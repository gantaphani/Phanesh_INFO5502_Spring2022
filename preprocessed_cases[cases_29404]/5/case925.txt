this appeal arises from a jury verdict that defendants the city of santa maria city and louis tanore,larry ralston,and danny macagni of the santa maria police department smpd violated the constitutional rights of plaintiffs javier bravo,his wife hope,and their granddaughter collectively,the bravos.specifically,the jury found that smpd officers failed to disclose in seeking a warrant to search the bravos home that javier bravo,suspected of hiding weapons that may have been used in a shooting incident was not living and had not been living in the home for some seven months prior to the shooting because he was incarcerated in state prison on unrelated charges.the resulting,search of the bravos residence did not yield any weapons,but succeeded in rousing the bravos from their beds and frightening them.prior to trial,the bravos settled with the city of santa barbara,whose officers actually carried out the entry of the bravo home,for.the case went to trial against the remaining defendants and resulted in a jury award of in compensatory damages to javier and nominal damages to hope and.in this opinion we address an issue of first impression whether in considering an award of attorney fees under,it is appropriate to take into consideration a plaintiff success in obtaining a settlement against another party arising out of the same facts.for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that,under the facts and circumstances of this case,it was appropriate to take the santa barbara settlement into consideration and,accordingly,we affirm the district court fee award.on the same theory,we vacate the cost award against the santa maria defendants and remand for the district court to take into account the costs recovered in the santa barbara settlement and offset those costs against the costs to be awarded against the santa maria defendants.
background 
factsa.shooting incident and investigation 
while investigating an april shooting,smpd detectives louis tanore and eligio lara learned that javier bravo,and about a dozen others might have been involved in the shooting or might possess evidence of the crime in particular,the weapons used.
tanore directed lara to gather information on eight of these individuals,including checking into their criminal histories and custody status.according to lara testimony,he called the santa barbara county jail to determine the custody status of the eight targets.lara learned from these calls that one of the eight james franklin had been transferred from county custody to state prison.he disclosed this finding to tanore,and franklin was removed from the list of targets.according to a county jail official trial testimony,lara asked whether javier was in county custody he was not,but he did not ask questions about whether,like franklin,javier had been transferred from county to state custody.lara never learned this.
custody check procedure 
to determine a target custody status,smpd officers practice was to call the santa barbara county jail.county jail officials can determine whether a target is in county custody,as well as whether he has been released or transferred to state custody.determining whether a target is in county custody and determining whether he has been transferred to state custody requires two different computer searches.
lara and larry ralston,the lead supervisor of the investigation,testified that if an smpd officer learned that a target had been transferred to state custody,he or she would then follow up with state authorities.tanore testified that smpd practice was to call the santa barbara county substation regardless of whether a person was potentially in county or state custody he did not mention any procedure.
warrant affidavit 
based in part on information gathered by lara,tanore prepared an affidavit in support of nighttime warrants to search the homes of javier and six other suspected gang members.the affidavit included criminal history information on each target,including javier,which tanore obtained by reviewing rap sheets provided by lara.the affidavit stated that javier had been arrested or charged numerous times in the past and included possession of known stolen property as one of the crimes for which he had been arrested or charged.however,the affidavit did not include the dates of the offenses.nor did it disclose that javier had been sentenced to two years in state prison in september about seven months prior to the shooting incident for the stolen property offense,or that he might still be incarcerated.
the magistrate judge approved a warrant for a nighttime search.because smpd lacked the resources to conduct seven simultaneous home searches,its officers invited the santa barbara sheriff office a county agency and santa barbara police department a city agency to conduct some of the searches.tanore informed the partner agencies of the risks and dangers of the search.though neither tanore nor anyone else from smpd prescribed the partner agencies tactics,tanore stated that he was not surprised that they elected to use a swat team.
at on april,a santa barbara police department swat team knocked on the front door of the bravos residence,announced their presence,and three seconds later shot off the locks and broke down the door.simultaneously,the team deployed two flashbang grenades outside of the back door.
javier,hope,and eight years old at the time were awakened by these loud noises and frightened to see armed individuals in their home.javier initially believed that robbers were invading the house or that his son had escaped from jail and been shot at his doorstep,causing him to experience symptoms.all three plaintiffs testified that they were not touched during the search.hope and were told to lie on the floor in the bathroom,where they had gone to hide upon hearing the loud noises.after securing the residence,the city of santa barbara officers turned the scene over to smpd to search the house.
at some point during the search,hope informed the officers that javier was in prison and showed them a letter she had recently received from him.as tanore was,an officer at the scene called to inform him that javier was in custody,at which time tanore instructed the officer to continue with a cursory search of the residence.smpd seized a number of items from the home,but found no weapons.
ii.procedural history 
complaint,pretrial motions,and prior appeal 
in october,the bravos brought suit against tanore,his supervisor ralston,smpd chief of police danny macagni,and the city of santa maria,as well as the counties of san luis obispo and santa barbara,their sheriff offices and county sheriffs,and the cities of san luis obispo and santa barbara and their police chiefs.the bravos alleged violations of the fourth and fourteenth amendments due process and equal protection and various state laws,and requested unspecified amounts of general,special,and punitive damages,a civil penalty,and recovery of related costs.
plaintiffs stipulated to dismiss their claims against the county of san luis obispo and city of san luis obispo defendants early in the case.they settled with the city of santa barbara defendants for after the city of santa barbara defendants appealed the district court denial of qualified immunity.the settlement amount consisted of in damages for each plaintiff,in attorney fees,and in costs.
the district court then granted summary judgment for the county of santa barbara and the santa maria defendants.the bravos appealed.in that appeal,we affirmed the grant of summary judgment for the county of santa barbara defendants,but reversed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the santa maria defendants.bravo city of santa maria,cir.we rejected the district court finding that the omission of javier jr.custody status was immaterial,concluding that if javier sentence imposed over six months prior to the incident occasioning the search warrant and his incarceration at the time of the shooting were included,the affidavit could not establish probable cause for the search and especially does not meet the heightened standard of justification required for nighttime swat service.id.at.javier custody status meant not only that he would not be present in the bravo residence at the time of the search,but that he could not have been involved in the shooting or in concealing the evidence.id.
we also rejected the conclusion that tanore was negligent at most in omitting javier custody status,concluding that the bravos presented sufficient evidence establishing a genuine issue as to whether tanore omission of javier sentence and custody information from the affidavit was intentional or reckless,as opposed to merely negligent id.at.
jury verdict and post trial judgment 
on remand,after five days of hearing evidence and four days of deliberation,the jury returned a special verdict finding all santa maria defendants liable.the jury awarded in compensatory damages to javier and to hope and.it did not award punitive damages.the district court entered judgment,awarding to javier and each to hope and 
after judgment was entered,defendants renewed their motion for judgment as a matter of law,attacking the findings of liability against tanore,ralston,macagni,and the city.defendants also moved to amend the judgment,contending that damages,attorney fees,and costs should be offset by the bravos settlement with the city of santa barbara.the bravos moved for a new trial on damages,and requested an award of attorney fees and costs.
the district court granted the defendants motion for judgment as a matter of law as to police chief macagni individual liability,but denied the motion as to tanore,ralston,and the city.regarding defendants motion to amend the judgment,the court concluded that any award of attorney fees should be offset by the attorney fees portion of the city of santa barbara settlement but that any award of costs should not be offset by the costs already paid in the city of santa barbara settlement.finally,the court denied the bravos motion for a new trial on damages,but named the bravos the prevailing parties and awarded in attorney fees and in costs.the court then entered an amended judgment,which the parties timely.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction under.attorney fee and costs awards are reviewed for abuse of discretion.disc golf ass n,champion discs,cir corder brown,cir.
in a contemporaneously filed memorandum,we affirm the district court decisions to grant judgment as a matter of law to defendant macagni,to deny judgment as a matter of law to defendants tanore,ralston,and the city,and to deny plaintiffs motion for a new trial on damages.we address in this opinion only the district court decisions as to attorney fees and costs.
attorney fees 
in a suit,the court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney fee as part of the costs.b.to determine the amount of a reasonable fee,district courts typically proceed in two steps first,courts generally apply the lodestar method to determine what constitutes a reasonable attorney fee and second,the district court may then adjust the lodestar upward or downward based on a variety of factors,including the degree of success obtained by the plaintiffs.gonzalez city of maywood,cir.the supreme court teaches that the degree of success obtained is the most critical factor in determining the reasonableness of a fee award.farrar hobby,d quoting hensley eckerhart,d.it is an abuse of discretion for the district court to award attorneys fees without considering the relationship between the extent of success and the amount of the fee award.mcginnis.fried chicken,cir quoting farrar,at.
here,it is undisputed that the bravos are prevailing parties and defendants do not contest the district court lodestar calculation.the sole issue before us is whether the district court erred in its analysis of the degree of plaintiffs success.defendants contend that the district court dramatically overvalued the degree of success.since the bravos won only at trial,the question is whether this litigation generated some other benefit that would justify the district court finding that the bravos achieved an excellent result and the consequent award of million in attorney fees.
we identify two such benefits in the record.first,the district court properly noted that this litigation benefitted the public by identifying a serious flaw in smpd method of checking individuals custody status before seeking warrants.in addition,this litigation led to our earlier bravo decision,in which we held that greater justification is needed for a nighttime forced entry by a swat unit than for an ordinary search.at.this provides guidance to law enforcement officers and to magistrate judges considering the issuance of such warrants.see gonzalez,at attorney fee award higher than the amount of damages won by plaintiff may be reasonable if the civil rights case also confer red benefits on others throughout society by,for example,ending institutional civil rights abuses or clarifying standards of constitutional conduct quoting mcginnis,at.
second,the district court properly considered the bravos settlement with the city of santa barbara defendants,with in damages for each plaintiff,as part of their success.although we have previously held that,in certain situations,a defendant may be entitled to an offset of attorney fees paid by a settling defendant,corder,at,we have yet to articulate a rule regarding whether a district court may consider a settlement payment in evaluating the reasonableness of an attorney fee award.we hold now that the district court may,within the exercise of its discretion,consider the damages portion of a settlement payment by other defendants in evaluating a plaintiff degree of success.however,it should do so only if and to the extent that plaintiff counsel time spent on settling defendants can not be fairly separated from the time spent on defendants.factors to consider include whether the plaintiff claims against both sets of defendants involve a common core of facts or are based on related legal theories,hensley,at if the claims are in fact divisible,whether that was apparent from the outset or whether the divisible nature became clear as the litigation developed and discovery progressed and whether the claims against the settling defendants were,in the district court considered judgment,meritorious,or whether they were settled for nuisance value 
turning to the facts of this case,the district court appropriately found that the bravos claims against the santa maria and the city of santa barbara defendants are factually and legally intertwined.plaintiffs theory of liability was that the santa maria defendants caused santa barbara to use a swat team to force entry into the bravos home.given that the district court decided as a matter of law that the entry violated the fourth amendment,it is clear that the claims against the city of santa barbara defendants were meritorious and not settled merely for nuisance value.
accordingly,we affirm the attorney fee award.
ii.offsets of costs 
defendants contend that the district court abused its discretion when it refused to offset its award of in costs,by the in costs paid by the city of santa barbara defendants.in refusing to offset costs,the district court held that costs are not akin to attorney fees,for which offsets are required,but rather are more analogous to damages,and therefore require defendants to pay at least their proportional share.
whether an award of costs must be offset by costs paid by a settling also appears to be an issue of first impression in this circuit.there is little case law directly on point therefore,we reason from principle and analogy and hold that the santa maria defendants are entitled to an offset of costs to the extent that the litigation expenses have already been reimbursed.
contrary to the district court holding,costs are not analogous to damages.they are not compensation for loss and,unlike the determination of damages,which is usually left for the jury,the calculation of costs is almost exclusively a function for a judge,see wright miller,federal practice and procedure ed.costs are more analogous to attorney fees.like attorney fees,costs are a reimbursement for expenses that a prevailing party is entitled to be awarded.taxation of costs,black law dictionary ed cf.d referring to costs other than attorney fees wright miller,federal practice and procedure ed treating attorney fees as component of costs.
we held in corder that a district court abuses its discretion when it refuses to offset an award of attorney fees by a settling defendant payment of those same fees.we reasoned that allows reasonable fees and that a second payment for the same billable time is an unreasonable double recovery.at.as defendants contend,attorney fees are a component of costs under.marek chesny,d fulps city of springfield,cir.thus,double recovery of costs other than attorney fees is just as impermissible as double recovery of attorney fees.
the district court reasoning that the deterrent principle at the heart of allows double recovery of costs is unpersuasive.while the statute is designed to deter civil rights violations and encourage access to the courts to redress often economically unviable injuries to fundamental rights,see generally city of riverside rivera,d,that basic principle does not require double reimbursement of identical litigation expenses.the statute does not specifically address this scenario,but it is difficult to imagine congress intended for litigation expenses to be paid multiple times.nor would eliminating duplicative payments for litigation expenses significantly influence counsel decision to prosecute civil rights suits.costs are nearly always a smaller prize than fees which also can not be,and almost always amount to less than the successful litigant total expenses in connection with a lawsuit.wright miller,federal practice and procedure.the decision to pursue a claim does not likely hinge on the prospect of recovering expenses multiple times for the same litigation activities.
the principle of not allowing double recovery of costs under is also supported by analogous california law.under california law,when a pretrial settlement with one defendant covers the very same costs a plaintiff is trying to recover from the defendant,the plaintiff can not recover the same costs twice.see regan roofing superior court,th,d.a california statute similarly provides that costs must be reasonable.c,see also witkin,california procedure at ed.
thus,whether this question is analyzed pursuant to federal common law or california law the district court erred by applying the incorrect legal standard.accordingly,we remand for the district court to determine what amount of costs should be offset.
conclusion 
we affirm the attorney fees award because the district court finding that the bravos achieved an excellent result is supported by the public benefit generated by the litigation as well as the in damages the bravos obtained in the santa barbara settlement.we reverse the district court refusal to offset costs and remand for consideration of what amount of the costs award,if any,should be offset by the costs already paid by the city of santa barbara defendants.
affirmed in part,reversed in part,and remanded for determination of costs.each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.
i fully concur in the majority opinion.i write separately,however,to explain why i would uphold the award in this case whether or not we considered the settlement with the santa barbara defendants.in short,i would uphold the fee award even if the only monetary benefit to plaintiffs was the verdict.i would do so for two reasons although the verdict was low in comparison to the fees sought by the attorneys,this litigation achieved significant benefits for society,and the entire context of the case,including the fact that plaintiffs had to overcome a robust defense,shows that the amount of time expended was necessary to vindicate the plaintiffs rights,even if the only benefit that had accrued had been the in damages awarded by the jury.plaintiffs counsel should be fully compensated for this effort.the defendants,relying in part on farrar hobby,suggest that we should ignore all other considerations,and that the fee award should be reduced solely based on a comparison between the verdict and the fee award.that position,however,is unsupported by farrar,our case law,and the motivating principles of.accordingly,i agree with the majority that the district court did not abuse its discretion by awarding million in attorney fees a reduction from the cost of the time and work counsel expended on this case.
as an initial matter,there is a strong presumption that the amount of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly a reasonable fee to be awarded under.perdue kenny ex rel.winn,d pennsylvania delaware valley citizens counsel for clean air,d blum stenson,d.this presumption is based on the premise that a fee under must be sufficient to induce a capable attorney to undertake the representation in order to advance the private enforcement of federal civil rights laws.perdue,at see also,at,as reprinted in.once the lodestar is calculated,the district court can look to other considerations to determine whether this presumptively reasonable fee should be adjusted either upward or downward.delaware valley,at.
in farrar hobby,a particularly unsympathetic case,the supreme court created a limited exception to the normal calculation of fees,d.in that case,the state of texas temporarily closed down a school for delinquent,disabled,and disturbed teens after a student of the center died.the owner of the center,joseph farrar,was indicted for murder because of his failure to administer proper medical treatment.id.at.farrar subsequently sued the lieutenant governor of texas,william hobby,as well as several other state employees who had participated in the events leading to the closing of the school.id.at.he sought million in damages,alleging that he had been deprived of liberty and property without due process by means of malicious prosecution.id.the jury determined that farrar had been deprived of a civil right,but it awarded zero damages.despite the wholly technical nature of farrar victory,and the fact that his law suit achieved no significant public purpose,his counsel sought in fees.the supreme court forcefully denied this fee award,and held that when a plaintiff,like farrar,achieves only technical or de minimis success,a district court may lawfully award low fees or no fees without calculating the lodestar or considering the other factors,id.at emphasis added,because the degree of the plaintiff overall success is the most critical factor in determining the reasonableness of a fee award.at.
in casting the critical fifth vote in farrar,justice explained in her separate opinion that not every nominal damage award is a purely technical or de minimis victory and that,when considering the degree of overall success,a court should consider more than the monetary amount awarded by a jury.see id.at.in particular,she wrote,courts should consider whether the plaintiff vindicated important rights or prevailed on significant legal issues even though no actual damages are proved.id.at.since farrar had done neither of these things,justice agreed that his victory was solely a technical one,and that in his case a denial of attorney fees was more than appropriate.it is important,however,that justice did not suggest that where actual damages are recovered that are not de minimis it is necessary for the plaintiff to establish in addition that he secured some overall societal benefit as well.
our court has interpreted farrar as having two central holdings.first,a district court may award little or no fees to a plaintiff who has achieved solely a de minimis victory,but that it should not do so if the plaintiff lawsuit achieved significant results for himself or other members of society.see mccown city of fontana,cir as amended,morales city of san rafael,cir.second,a district court abuses its discretion when it fails to consider the degree of success achieved by the plaintiff when determining a reasonable fee award.see morales,at.nothing in these cases suggests that the extent of victory is measured solely by the amount of the award.indeed,a small award may represent a complete victory 
i fully agree with the maj
