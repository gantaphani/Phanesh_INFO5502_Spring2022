this case returns to our calendar for the fourth time following its journey to the supreme court.plaintiffs,three insurance companies and one insurance trade association,originally brought this action against the california commissioner of insurance commissioner seeking to bar the enforcement of the holocaust victim insurance relief act of hvira,cal.that statute requires the disclosure of certain information pertaining to insurance policies written in europe.following the supreme court disposition of the case in their favor,plaintiffs sought attorney fees in this court.we remanded the fees question to the district court,which denied the request.the appealable order was appealed.
this appeal presents two principal questions.first,did the district court err when it held that plaintiffs were not prevailing parties within the meaning of second,do the foreign affairs power of the executive branch and the related executive agreements between the united states,germany,austria,and france create private rights within the meaning of 
we hold that plaintiffs are prevailing parties and are thus entitled to an award of a reasonable attorney fee.because we hold that plaintiffs are prevailing parties,we do not reach the question whether executive actions under the foreign affairs power create justiciable private rights.therefore,under the authority of maher gagne,d,we remand to the district court for a determination of the proper fee.
factual background and procedural history 
because the facts of this case have been set forth by this court and by the supreme court in detail,see gerling global reinsurance of am.gerling global low,cir gerling i gerling global low,cir gerling ii am.ins.ass garamendi,d,we recount only the basic procedural history here.
plaintiffs brought this action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief from the enforcement of hvira,claiming that the statute violated the commerce clause,due process clause,foreign affairs power,and other constitutional provisions.the district court concluded that plaintiffs demonstrated a probability of success on the merits that the hvira is unconstitutional in violation of the federal foreign affairs power and a violation of the commerce clause.gerling global quackenbush,wl.june.after finding that the balance of irreparable harm favored the plaintiffs,the district court granted a preliminary injunction and enjoined the enforcement of hvira and its implementing regulations.id.at.
the commissioner appealed and we reversed,leaving the preliminary injunction in place.we remanded the case to the district court to consider plaintiffs due process claims.gerling i,at.
on remand,the district court granted plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and permanently enjoined the commissioner from enforcing hvira,holding that b y mandating license suspension for of what may be impossible tasks without allowing for a meaningful hearing,hvira deprives plaintiffs of a protected property interest without affording them due process of law.gerling global low,d.
the commissioner again appealed the district court decision.during the pendency of that appeal,the plaintiffs filed a motion with the district court seeking attorney fees under.the district court denied the motion,and plaintiffs timely appealed.
in gerling ii,we reversed the district court and held that hvira did not violate plaintiffs due process rights,the commerce clause,the foreign affairs power,the bill of attainder clause,the contract clause,the equal protection clause,or the fourth amendment.we concluded that plaintiffs were not prevailing parties under and therefore were not entitled to attorney fees.id.at.
the supreme court granted certiorari.am.ins.ass low,d.the grant of certiorari encompassed three of the questions addressed in gerling i and gerling ii whether hvira intrudes on the federal foreign affairs power,violates the element of the foreign commerce clause,or exceeds the state legislative jurisdiction.am.ins.ass n,at.the court reversed this court judgment,holding that hvira was by executive branch authority over foreign policy.id.at.the court did not address the commerce clause and due process clause issues.id.at.because we hold that hvira is preempted under the foreign affairs doctrine,we have no reason to address the other questions.
following the court decision,plaintiffs sought attorney fees and moved this court for supplemental briefing and oral argument.we transferred the fee issue to the district court for consideration on a factual record.gerling global low,cir gerling iii.
the district court declined to award fees because it concluded that the foreign affairs power did not implicate a right,privilege,or immunity secured by the constitution or laws of the united states and therefore could not form the basis of a claim.
ii.the prevailing party determination 
the civil rights attorney fee award act of provides,in relevant part in any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of,the court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party,other than the united states,a reasonable attorney fee as part of the costs.b,in turn,protects against the deprivation of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws.the first issue is whether plaintiffs constitute prevailing parties.
the supreme court has summarized the prevailing party determination as follows 
t o qualify as a prevailing party,a civil rights plain tiff must obtain at least some relief on the merits of his claim.the plaintiff must obtain an enforceable judgment against the defendant from whom fees are sought,hewitt helms,d,or comparable relief through a consent decree or settlement,maher gagne,d.whatever relief the plaintiff secures must directly benefit him at the time of the judgment or settlement.see hewitt,at.in short,a plaintiff prevails when actual relief on the merits of his claim materially alters the legal relationship between the parties by modifying the defendant behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff.
farrar hobby,d.we hold that plaintiffs are prevailing parties in this litigation.plaintiffs not only obtained some relief on the merits of their claim,they received all of the relief they sought in their permanent injunction enjoined the enforcement of hvira.clearly,the ruling of the supreme court modified the commissioner behavior by materially alter ing the legal relationship between the parties.see id.
the second issue is whether the plaintiffs prevailed under a legal right.the supreme court decided for the plaintiffs relying on the implied preemption of hvira by the foreign affairs power of the executive branch.the commissioner argues that,because the supreme court ruled in favor of plaintiffs on a ground not covered by,the plaintiffs are not prevailing parties.we are thus faced with the question whether a court,in an action containing both claims and a claim which may not independently support a fee award,may deprive plaintiffs of attorney fees by grounding its ruling on the claim.answering this question in the affirmative would be inconsistent with both supreme court and ninth circuit precedent.
beginning with the assumption that the foreign affairs power does not confer rights within the meaning of,we must determine whether the claims left unaddressed by the supreme court,but included in its grant of commerce clause and due process clause support an award of attorney fees.due process clause and commerce clause claims are both properly cognizable,claims under.see,dennis higgins,d commerce clause paul davis,d due process clause.plaintiffs urge us to apply maher gagne,d,and its progeny to conclude that fees are appropriate here because the unaddressed claims were both substantial and arose from a common nucleus of operative fact with the foreign affairs power claim.
maher held that an award of fees is appropriate where a plaintiff prevails on a wholly statutory,claim pendent to a substantial constitutional claim or in one in which both a statutory and a substantial constitutional claim are settled favorably to the plaintiff without adjudication.id.at.the plaintiff in maher advanced claims under the social security act and the equal p
