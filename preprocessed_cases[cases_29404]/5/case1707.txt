introduction 
this case tests the limits of a trial court discretionary authority to determine that there is no prevailing party under civil code section.here,a landlord brought an unlawful detainer action and sought unpaid rent.the tenant asserted she owed the landlord nothing because there were leaks in the premises.the day before the trial the tenant vacated the premises,so the case went to trial only on the landlord money claims.the landlord recovered percent of what he claimed was owing.nevertheless,the trial court ruled that there was no prevailing party for purposes of the attorney fee clause in the lease agreement.
we reverse.the result was so lopsided that,even under an abuse of discretion standard,it was unreasonable to say the landlord was not the prevailing party.
reginald de la cuesta,the landlord,rented out a set of five suites in laguna hills to esther benham,the tenant,and her company,suits u,under a lease agreement requiring the tenant to pay a month later increased to about.by november the tenant had stopped making rent payments,and in the landlord had served a day notice to pay rent or quit.in a complaint for unlawful detainer filed in early january,the landlord claimed in unpaid rent through december.the landlord also claimed other damages of about 
the tenant quickly answered the unlawful detainer complaint,asserting that she owed nothing the landlord had breached the warranty of habitability,and refused to repair certain water and sewage leaks.thus the answer asserted without further specification that the rental value is currently zero due to the health issues,and went on to claim that the lease be ordered forfeit and the landlord declared unable to sue thereon because of fraud in the inducement.in a trial brief the tenant would assert that the premises leaked both rain and sewage water like a sieve.
the case was scheduled to go to trial on monday,february.however,since the tenant vacated the premises the previous weekend indeed,the day before the court converted the case to an ordinary civil action see,and,as such,the case did not come to trial until november.the trial court squarely rejected the tenants fraud allegations,finding that the tenant was both an attorney and a real estate broker and represented by a realtor in entering into the transaction,and in any event the property was in good condition when the lease was signed.
as to rent,the landlord had sought in total monetary damages in an amended trial brief.the trial court awarded.the calculations were as follows the rent due without any deductions was,but,because there were days when the tenancy was affected by water leaks,and the affected area was about percent of the premises,the court decided that a reduction of was in order.the trial court also found that the common area maintenance charges should be limited to what they were estimated to be in the lease a month,which meant that the total common area maintenance charges due were about.with late charges stipulated to be,the judgment came in at about.
costs were to be determined by posttrial motion,and,in february,the landlord made a motion for about in attorney fees.the motion was denied.we quote the entirety of the minute order denying the request motion by plaintiff for an award of attorney fees in the amount of against defendant esther benham is denied.the court finds that there is no prevailing party for purposes of awarding attorneys fees.while plaintiff did obtain possession that was due to defendant surrendering the property.the amended trial brief filed by plaintiff on requested total monetary damages of which was reduced significantly.the plaintiff statement of decision filed notes that the court reduced the common area maintenance charges requested and the award was reduced due to water damage.this appears to be a good news bad news situation and under nasser superior court d,the court has discretion not to award fees.
from that postjudgment order the landlord has filed this appeal.
iii.discussion 
entitlement and discretion 
under the rule of stare decisis,the governing case for prevailing party determinations under section of the civil code is hsu abbara cal th hsu,with some additional light thrown on the subject by scott blount,cal th,scott 
it is important to look at what hsu actually held there,after a flurry of offers and counteroffers that had not resulted in a deal to sell a house,the buyers sued the erstwhile sellers,claiming that the buyers had indeed accepted a particular counteroffer to buy the house for.the buyers lost when the trial court ruled that a new offer made by the prospective buyers after the purported acceptance extinguished the previous counteroffer for even so,the trial court denied the winning but now absolved of any obligation to perform sellers their attorney fees,albeit not giving any explanation.on appeal,the intermediate appellate court affirmed,reasoning that under an abuse of discretion standard the erstwhile sellers had failed to discuss all of the pertinent facts in the record which would bear on the issue of abuse of discretion.hsu,supra,cal th at.but the supreme court reversed,holding that the sellers were entitled to their fees because they had obtained a simple,unqualified win.id.at.
much of the hsu opinion represents the effort of the high court to reconcile what we might call the discretion clause of section with the entitlement clause of section.see hsu,supra,cal th at.both clauses are set forth in subdivision b of the statute.structurally,the entitlement clause comes first,with the statute first declaring that a the trial court must determine who is the prevailing party,and then b defining the prevailing party as the party who recovered a greater relief in the action on the contract.the court,upon notice and motion by a party,shall determine who is the party prevailing on the contract for purposes of this section,whether or not the suit proceeds to final judgment.except as provided in paragraph,the party prevailing on the contract shall be the party who recovered a greater relief in the action on the contract.italics added.but then comes the discretion clause,which gives a court permission to determine no party prevailed on the contract.the court may also determine that there is no party prevailing on the contract for purposes of this section.
as shown by the facts in the hsu case itself,the court reconciliation yielded this rule a simple unqualified win on the contract,of course takes a case out of the discretion clause and puts it into the entitlement clause.see hsu,supra,cal th at that was clearly the case in hsu,where the erstwhile sellers had obtained such a win.
the hsu court,however,left the distance between,on the one extreme,a simple unqualified win entitling the winner to fees and,on the other,a split decision,clearly leaving no party entitled to fees unexplored.the relevant language,however,is worth cataloging 
on the split decision no entitlement end,the court phrases were so equivocal hsu,supra,cal th at,mixed result id.at,opposing litigants could each legitimately claim some success in the litigation,ibid,and ostensibly prevailing party receives only a part of the relief sought ibid.
on the simple unqualified win entitlement end,the formulations were not mixed hsu,supra,cal th at,italics in original,purely good news for one party and bad news for the other id.at,obtaining all relief requested ibid.at,and litigation success is not fairly disputable ibid.
but the hsu court did provide a framework for exploring that distance essentially,the trial court is to attain an overview of the totality of the case,then compare the extent to which each party has won and lost accordingly,we hold that in deciding whether there is a party prevailing on the contract,the trial court is to compare the relief awarded on the contract claim or claims with the parties demands on those same claims and their litigation objectives as disclosed by the pleadings,trial briefs,opening statements,and similar sources.the prevailing party determination is to be made only upon final resolution of the contract claims and only by a comparison of the extent to which each party ha s succeeded and failed to succeed in its contentions.hsu,supra,cal th at,quotation from bank of idaho pine avenue associates d.
to the degree that hsu left any room to wonder whether anything short of total victory by one party might still entitle that party to fees clearly equivocal mixed and partial results would not so entitle,an answer was supplied four years later in scott no.in entitlement matters,said scott,there is no substitute for complete victory.commenting on hsu,the scott court said when a party obtains a simple,unqualified victory by completely prevailing on or defeating all contract claims in the action and the contract contains a provision for attorney fees,section entitles the successful party to recover reasonable attorney fees incurred in prosecution or defense of those claims.citation to hsu,supra,cal th at.if neither party achieves a complete victory on all the contract claims,it is within the discretion of the trial court to determine which party prevailed on the contract or whether,on balance,neither party prevailed sufficiently to justify an award of attorney fees.scott,supra,cal th at,italics added.
in the present case,we must agree with the trial court that landlord de la cuesta result falls short of a complete victory.a portion of the unpaid rent roughly a fifth was deducted from what the landlord was otherwise entitled to,plus claims for unpaid common area maintenance charges were reduced by capping them to the time of the lease.thus the landlord here can not claim legal error in the trial court decision.
abuse of discretion 
but just because a litigant is not entitled to its fees as a matter of the entitlement clause of section does not mean that discretion can not be abused.if the law were unless you win a complete victory,the trial court has unfettered discretion to declare you a,then hsu comparison to the extent language and the actual text of section could readily be thwarted.
first,why even bother comparing the extent of a party success or failure,or including a prevailing party attorney fee provision in a contract at all no matter how otherwise fair or bilateral if the trial court can simply then turn around and nullify that provision if there is anything less than percent success as measured against the most extreme claim for relief taken by a litigant at any point during the litigation 
on top of that,there is the actual language of section itself,which expressly contemplates some sort of comparison of respective results otherwise the legislature would not have defined prevailing party as the party obtaining a greater relief italics added a comparative term.as noted in sears baccaglio th,because the statute allows such discretion,it must be presumed the trial court has also been empowered to identify the party obtaining a greater relief by examining the results of the action in relative terms the general term greater includes l arger in size than others of the same kind as well as principal and s uperior in quality.italics both in the original and added.
and then there is the reality of litigation,almost universally recognized attorneys tend to err on the side of overstating the extent of the claims being presented on their client behalves.if anything short of complete victory allows the trial court unrestricted freedom to ignore the substance of a result,then trial courts have the freedom to nullify the normal expectations of parties who enter into contracts with prevailing party attorney fee clauses.as hsu said we agree that in determining litigation success,courts should respect substance rather than form,and to this extent should be guided by equitable considerations.for example,a party who is denied direct relief on a claim may nonetheless be found to be a prevailing party if it is clear that the party has otherwise achieved its main litigation objective.hsu,supra,cal th at italics in original removed and italics added.
our point is if the results in a case are lopsided in terms of one party obtaining greater relief than the other in comparative terms,it may be an abuse of discretion for the trial court not to recognize that the party obtaining the greater relief was indeed the prevailing party.silver creek,llc blackrock realty advisors,th,silver creek although a trial court has broad discretion to determine the prevailing party in a mixed result case,its discretion is not unlimited.hilltop investment associates leon th,hilltop appellant final argument is that the trial court discretion under civil code section is not unlimited,a proposition with which we agree.
the next question obviously is how lopsided must the results be before it is an abuse of discretion not to acknowledge that one party has clearly prevailed the reason the legislature included the discretion clause in section,of course,was obviously to allow trial courts to take into account the unique facts and circumstances of each case,as reflected in the totality and substance language from hsu.so we will not attempt to fashion a rule.that said,the line was crossed in the case before us.
of greatest significance here is the relative extent of the success of each party in comparison to its basic litigation position the tenant,benham,asserted the extreme position that she owed nothing by way of back rent because of the water and sewage leaks she ended up with a judgment of about against her.by contrast,at his most exuberant and that in an amended trial brief,the landlord,de la cuesta,asserted he was owed but that was cut back to.the landlord,in short,got percent of the most of what he sought going into trial the tenant got zero percent 
on top of those basic disparities,there are hsu equitable considerations to consider the tenant vacated the premises the day before trial was initially scheduled to begin,which,in equitable terms,was a clear victory for the landlord repossession of the premises was at least one of the landlord main litigation objectives,the litigation had clearly resulted in that repossession,and only the tenant unilateral capitulation deprived the landlord of being able to say that the trial itself resulted in the achievement of that objective.
plus,the trial court unequivocally rejected all of the tenant fraud claims,choosing instead simply to offset about percent of the back rent otherwise due to account for leaks that the landlord simply had not fixed and cap the common area maintenance arrearages to those contemplated by the contract 
tenant benham offers no case which comes anywhere close to this lopsidedness.she offers four cases.all are distinguishable.
nasser,supra,d really was a mixed result case there,a tenant wanted his market to stay in a certain location for another three years based on an option to renew his lease,and sued to establish a monthly rental the original lease provided for a standard.while the tenant got to stay in the premises and the lease was validated,the tenant also got hit with,as the court expressly noted,a more than percent increase on what his rent had previously been going from to id.at,and which was more than percent above the highest the tenant had offered in pretrial negotiations.ibid.previous offer was.the trial court determination of no prevailing party was thus reasonable.id.at.
kytasty godwin d kytasty,the genesis of the good news bad news trope that has become widely invoked in section prevailing party law was similar to nasser in that a given right was validated,but its scope was curtailed there,a claimed foot wide easement was reduced by percent to feet.using a good conscience test,the appellate court could not find that either side had prevailed.see kytasty,supra,d at the judgment as well as this opinion must be considered good news and bad news to each of the parties,and in good conscience we can not say attorneys fees should be awarded either for the trial or for this appeal.
hilltop,supra,th is notable for the chutzpah of the party seeking fees no wonder that party failed to show any abuse of discretion for not having been declared a prevailing party the case arose out of a squabble in the movie industry over an uncompleted film.a group of what appe
