the utility reform network turn petitions for review of an order of the public utilities commission puc awarding turn only part of the attorney fees it sought for participating in lawsuits about deregulation of the electrical power market in california.the puc declined to award turn compensation under the intervenor compensation provisions of the public utilities code for turn unsuccessful court challenge to the puc settlement of a lawsuit with a utility.the puc concluded that turn failed litigation did not make a substantial contribution to the puc proceedings.applying the required deference,we can not say that the puc decision bore no reasonable relation to the purpose and language of the governing provisions of the public utilities code.nor did the puc err in denying a multiplier.but the puc did err in awarding turn outside counsel hourly rates of up to instead of the they asked for.we therefore affirm in part and reverse in part.
facts and procedural background 
ab,the early puc proceedings,and our sce decision.
much of the history underlying turn petition for review is set forth in our earlier opinion,southern california edison public utilities commission et.th,d sce,as well as in southern california edison lynch lynch and southern california edison peevey cal th,d,peevey.to summarize in,the california legislature passed assembly bill ab.that legislation instituted generation competition as the basic structure of california electric utility industry.however,utilities could freeze regulated rates for generation temporarily,so they could make changes that would allow them to recover uneconomic costs.that is,the utilities could use a transition period to pay off their costs that might become uneconomic because of competition stranded or transition costs.ab provision for frozen rates recognized that the regulated price of electricity is higher than the competitive market price,and this price generally reflects the sunk costs of building generation facilities.ab permitted the utilities to recover their stranded costs until the end of the frozen rates were to remain in effect until march,or until the utility had fully recovered its costs for utility generation assets,whichever came first.
in,three utilities filed applications with the puc,proposing a methods for determining the end of the transition period,and b ratemaking mechanisms to be in place after the rate freeze ended.over the next couple of years,extensive proceedings took place before the puc in this posttransition ratemaking ptr docket.petitioner turn,a san francisco consumer advocacy organization,actively participated in the ptr proceedings.the puc issued various ptr decisions,including one that prohibited the utilities from carrying over and recovering after the period any uneconomic costs they had not recovered during the freeze.in the course of the ptr proceedings,the puc also adopted an accounting proposal that turn had submitted.
meanwhile,in november,two utility companies sued the puc commissioners in federal court,challenging the puc jurisdiction to issue its ptr decisions.see southern california edison lynch,case cal.pacific gas and electric company lynch,case cal.the cases were consolidated in the central district of california.turn eventually was permitted to intervene in both cases and it actively participated in the litigation on the puc side.
in july,turn submitted a request to the puc for in attorney fees and costs under the intervenor compensation provisions of the public utilities code,sections.all further statutory references are to this code.turn request covered its participation in the puc ptr proceedings as well as its six months of work defending the puc ptr decisions in the federal lawsuits brought by the utilities.in june,the puc awarded turn in attorney fees and costs.southern california edison petitioned for a writ of review,challenging that award to the extent it compensated turn for its federal court work.
in sce we affirmed the puc decision awarding turn compensation.we first noted that we are required to give considerable deference to the puc interpretation of the code that interpretation should not be disturbed unless it fails to bear a reasonable relation to statutory purposes and language.sce,supra,th at,d quoting peevey,supra,cal th at.applying that deference,we upheld the puc conclusion that turn was entitled to fees for its participation in defending the puc decision against a court challenge.we noted that,in the intervenor compensation provisions,the legislature authorized the puc to compensate customers,not only for their work before the puc,but also for the fees and costs of obtaining judicial review following a decision of the puc.sce,supra,th at,d quoting,subd.a.the administrative law judge who had considered the matter had concluded that turn had made a substantial contribution to puc proceedings by participating in the federal court proceedings.id.at,d.we quoted the puc observation that i f an intervenor can not gain compensation to defend a puc decision in which the intervenor prevailed,the intervenor effectiveness is severely limited.id.at,d.we concluded that we could not say that the puc construction of the intervenor compensation provisions bore no reasonable relation to statutory purposes and language.id.at,d quoting peevey,supra,cal th at.
the power crisis,the puc settlement with cal.edison,and turn unsuccessful court challenge to the settlement.
in the first few years of the transition period,the utilities recovered much of their stranded costs.but in the summer of,power procurement is,wholesale electricity sharply.the utilities incurred huge debts buying electricity.california governor declared a state of emergency.in january,the legislature called an extraordinary session to address the power crisis.in assembly bill ab,the legislature amended several provisions of ab,halting at least temporarily the transition to a competitive electricity market.although the january legislation did not reverse all aspects of electricity deregulation,it constituted a major retrenchment from the competitive approach of ab,reemphasizing instead puc duty and authority to guarantee that the electric utilities would have the capacity and financial viability to provide power to california consumers.peevey,supra,cal th at,d.
in the meantime,in october,two utilities petitioned the puc to modify its decisions in the ptr docket and to allow for recovery of certain costs they had not recovered during the period.in january,the puc granted the utilities emergency rate relief,authorizing a temporary surcharge of cent per.application of southern california edison cal.in march,still finding that the utilities continued financial viability and ability to serve their customers has been seriously compromised by the dramatic escalation in wholesale prices,the puc made the january increase permanent and authorized an additional cents per increase.application of southern california edison cal.
notwithstanding this rate relief,in april,pacific gas and electric company filed for bankruptcy.southern california edison claimed to be facing severe financial difficulties as well and was threatening to file for bankruptcy.cal.edison said it had accumulated liabilities and debts of somewhere between and billion,creating severe liquidity and credit problems for the company.peevey,supra,cal th at,d,lynch,supra,at.in october,the puc and cal.edison reached a settlement of cal.edison federal lawsuit.cal.edison agreed to dismiss the case and the puc agreed that cal.edison could recover its stranded costs over a longer period of time.under the settlement,cal.edison expected to recover about billion of its more than billion loss during the prior period.
turn objected to the.cal.edison settlement.however,the federal district court approved the settlement,finding it adequate and fair.peevey,supra,cal th at,d.turn then appealed to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit.turn raised a number of federal and state law challenges to the settlement.first,even though it had litigated in federal court earlier in the case in support of the puc,turn argued in the ninth circuit that the doctrine precluded the federal court from exercising jurisdiction in the case.lynch,supra,at citing rooker fidelity trust.and court of appeals feldman,d.the ninth circuit noted,however,that the doctrine has no application to judicial review of executive action,including determinations made by a state administrative agency.
second,turn argued the district court should have abstained under the burford doctrine.lynch,supra,at citing burford sun oil.the ninth circuit concluded that the district court did not err in declining to abstain in this case the threshold requirements for the exercise of burford abstention had not been satisfied for two reasons the state had not chosen to concentrate suits challenging the administrative action at issue in a particular court,and the state had expressly waived any abstention defense to cal.edison action and consented to the stipulated judgment.lynch,supra,at.
third,the ninth circuit held that the district court had not exceeded its authority by approving the stipulated settlement without turn consent,noting that a n intervenor does not have the right to prevent other parties from entering into a settlement agreement.lynch,supra,at citing firefighters cleveland,d.fourth and fifth,the ninth circuit concluded that the district court approval of the settlement did not deny turn due process or violate the tenth amendment.lynch,supra,at.in sum,the federal appellate court rejected all of turn arguments based on federal statutory and constitutional law.however,the court found a serious question existed of whether the agreement between the puc and cal.edison violated state law,both in substance and in the procedure by which the puc agreed to it.id.at.the ninth circuit therefore certified three questions of state law to the california supreme court.id.at.
the matter then was briefed and argued before the california supreme court.in a decision issued august,the high court ruled against turn on all issues.peevey,supra,cal th,d.the court first noted that the puc authority derives not only from statute but from the california constitution,which creates the agency and expressly gives it the power to fix rates for public utilities.id.at,d,citing cal,art.xii.adhering to these constitutional provisions,the court said,it has described the puc as a state agency of constitutional origin with duties,functions and powers whose power to fix rates and establish rules has been liberally construed.citations.peevey,supra,cal th at,d.so,the court observed,i f puc lacked substantive authority to propose and enter into the rate settlement agreement at issue here,it was not for lack of inherent authority,but because this rate agreement was barred by some specific statutory limit on puc power to set rates.ibid.
addressing each issue in turn,the supreme court first rejected turn contention that the settlement violated section,enacted as part of ab.section provided only that the freeze rates would remain in effect until the earlier of march,or the date on which a utility had fully recovered its costs for utility assets.section did not dictate that rates be reduced,or changed in any way,at the end of the freeze period.peevey,supra,cal th at,d.moreover,the court concluded,contrary to turn contentions,that after the enactment of assembly bill in,which required electrical utilities to retain their generating plants until at least and returned retained rates to regulation,puc was authorized to approve rates allowing cal.edison to recover the costs covered by the settlement agreement.id.at,d.the court further observed that the costs slated for recovery by the settlement agreement,on their face,were not stranded costs the settlement agreement provided for postfreeze recovery of energy procurement,rather than generation,costs.ibid.and,in any event,ab largely eliminated the category of uneconomic generating asset costs,the only costs whose recovery is limited under section.id.at,d.on the first issue,the supreme court concluded,whether we regard the costs to be recovered under the.cal.edison settlement as procurement costs or as costs,they were not uneconomic costs restricted in recovery by section.consequently,puc agreement to the settlement was not in violation of ab.id.at,d.
the second issue certified by the ninth circuit was whether the process by which the puc settled with cal.edison violated the open meeting act,subd.d.peevey,supra,cal th at,d.the supreme court concluded that it did not.the court noted that the puc strictly followed the procedure mandated in government code section,subdivision a.id.at,d.the court held that the government code authorized puc not only to discuss,but also to conclude the settlement in closed session.ibid.
the third question was whether the settlement violated section by altering utility rates without a public hearing and the issuance of findings.again,the supreme court said the answer was no.peevey,supra,cal th at,d.the court again noted that,under the settlement,the puc agreed to maintain cal.edison approved rates for a time,not to change them.id.at,d.nor did any other regulatory actions provided for in the agreement change rates.so,the court concluded,section did not apply.ibid.
in light of the california supreme court resolution of the state law questions,the ninth circuit then entered a final judgment affirming the district court.southern california edison lynch cir.
turn second request for compensation and the puc decision.
in june,turn submitted a request for compensation to the puc.turn sought more than million for part of the federal court litigation not included in its earlier request,for its work related to our decision in sce,and for its unsuccessful challenge to the cal.edison settlement in federal court and in the california supreme court.turn asked that its outside counsel be compensated at the same rates as those requested by pacific gas and electric company outside counsel in the bankruptcy litigation.turn also asked for a multiplier of and argued that a multiplier of would be justified because of the nature and quality of the work and the risk of nonrecovery.
in november,an administrative law judge issued a proposed decision that would have awarded turn a little over million.the administrative law judge recommended that the puc compensate turn for its challenges to the cal.edison settlement.however,he rejected turn request for a multiplier and for the requested hourly rates.in march,puc commissioner geoffrey brown issued an alternate proposed decision.he would have granted turn about.commissioner brown recommended against compensating turn for its challenges to the cal.edison settlement.
in april,the puc issued a decision awarding turn in addition to the it previously had received,bringing the total for turn participation in the ptr proceedings and related litigation to.the puc denied compensation for turn unsuccessful challenges to the cal.edison settlement.turn sought rehearing.in march,the puc denied rehearing but modified its decision in several respects.the puc concluded that turn was not entitled to compensation for its challenges in the federal courts and the california supreme court to the cal.edison settlement because those efforts did not make a substantial contribution to a puc decision.
the puc recognized that the intervenor compensation provisions authorize compensation for work associated with obtaining judicial review and this court explained in efforts almost always will occur after the substantial contribution to a puc decision has been made.but the puc concluded that a customer court efforts must somehow contribute to the preservation of that decision,or must result in a new example,where a customer successfully challenges a puc decision.here,although turn had made a substantial contribution to the initial rate stabilization decisions,the puc had changed its position on the issues to which turn had contributed earlier.therefore,in the judicial review of the settlement,turn was in a position where it no longer had a substantial contribution to the rate stabilization decisions that could be preserved.moreover,i f an intervenor does not succeed in its court challenge against the commission,there will be no substantial contribution to a commission action that is either created or preserved.the puc rejected turn suggestion that an intervenor is entitled to compensation in all cases where it participates in judicial review concerning a proceeding in which it contributed in short,turn no longer had a substantial contribution to the puc position to preserve,and it failed in its efforts in state and federal courts to challenge the puc.so,the puc concluded,neither the intervenor compensation provisions nor the sce decision provided for intervenor compensation eligibility on these facts.
the intervenor compensation provisions 
as did sce,turn current petition involves the interpretation of the intervenor compensation provisions of the code.those provisions authorize the puc to award compensation to consumers and groups who make substantial contributions to puc decisions.section provides,the purpose of this article is to provide compensation for reasonable advocate fees,reasonable expert witness fees,and other reasonable costs to public utility customers of participation or intervention in any proceeding of the commission.section provides,in part,
it is the intent of the legislature that 
a the provisions of this article shall apply to all formal proceedings of the commission involving electric utilities.
b the provisions of this article shall be administered in a manner that encourages the effective and efficient participation of all groups that have a stake in the public utility regulation process.
d intervenors be compensated for making a substantial contribution to proceedings of the commission,as determined by the commission in its orders and decisions.
so,to be eligible for compensation,the statute requires that the customer have made a substantial contribution to the puc proceedings,as the puc determines.substantial contribution means that,in the judgment of the commission,the customer presentation has substantially assisted the commission in the making of its order or decision because the order or decision has adopted in whole or in part one or more factual contentions,legal contentions,or specific policy or procedural recommendations presented by the customer.where the customer participation has resulted in a substantial contribution,even if the decision adopts that customer contention or recommendations only in part,the commission may award the customer compensation for all advocate fees,reasonable expert fees,and other reasonable costs incurred by the customer in preparing or presenting that contention or recommendation,subd.i.
the legislature authorized the puc to compensate customers not only for their work before the puc,but also for the fees and costs of obtaining judicial review following a puc decision.see,subd.a defining compensation as payment for all or part,as determined by the commission,of reasonable advocate fees and other reasonable costs of preparation for and participation in a proceeding,and includes the fees and costs of obtaining an award under this article and of obtaining judicial review,if any.
in sce,we considered whether the statutory provision authorizing the puc to award compensation for the costs of obtaining judicial review permitted the puc to give fees to a customer who intervenes in a judicial proceeding to assist the puc in defending a puc decision for example,in that utility challenges a puc decision.we concluded that the puc may compensate such a customer,whether the litigation took place in federal or state court.we discussed the relationship between an intervenor work in defending a puc decision and the substantial contribution requirement in section,subdivision d.we said,
cal.edison claims that turn federal court work could not have made a substantial contribution to the puc decisions because the federal court work was performed after the puc issued those decisions.it is true,as cal.edison notes,that the intervenor compensation provisions were designed to compensate customers who make a substantial contribution to puc proceedings,subd.d.indeed,making a substantial contribution is a prerequisite to an award of compensation.however,once a customer makes such a contribution to a puc proceeding,that customer may obtain compensation for the fees and costs of obtaining judicial review,regardless whether that judicial review work made a substantial contribution to the puc proceeding.any contrary construction would render the judicial review clause of section,subdivision a,meaningless in most cases because such review virtually always occurs after the puc has issued its decision.sce,supra,th at,d.
standard of review 
this court has jurisdiction to review the puc decisions under section,subdivision a it authorizes any aggrieved party to petition for review in the court of appeal.section provides that the court of appeal review shall not extend further than to determine,on the basis of the entire record whether any of the following occurred 
the commission acted without,or in excess of,its powers or jurisdiction.
the commission has not proceeded in the manner required by law.
the decision of the commission is not supported by the findings.
the findings in the decision of the commission are not supported by substantial evidence in light of the whole record.
the order or decision of the commission was procured by fraud or was an abuse of discretion.
the order or decision of the commission violates any right of the petitioner under the constitution of the united states or the california constitution,subds.a a.
as our supreme court has emphasized,and as we reiterated in sce,the puc interpretation of the public utility code should not be disturbed unless it fails to bear a reasonable relation to statutory purposes and language.sce,supra,th at,d quoting peevey,supra,cal th at.
discussion 
a.the puc decision denying turn compensation for its unsuccessful court challenges bears a reasonable relation to statutory purposes and language.
in its petition for review,turn first asserts that the puc erred in declining to give it compensation for its unsuccessful challenges in federal court and the california supreme court to the puc settlement with cal.edison.we find no error.
turn relies heavily on our statement in sce that,once a customer makes the required substantial contribution to a puc proceeding,that customer may obtain compensation for the fees and costs of obtaining judicial review,regardless whether that judicial review work made a substantial contribution to the puc proceeding.sce,supra,th at,d.but this language must be read in the context of our discussion on that point.neither the statutory language nor our interpretation of it gives entities like turn carte blanche to do whatever they wish once they have made some sort of contribution to a puc least not if they intend to seek to recover their fees.turn proposed construction of the statute and sce would require compensation for any and all later court work once an intervenor has made a contribution to any part of a proceeding,regardless of the value of the court work or whether intervening events have changed the original contribution.turn interpretation would mean that the commission finding of a substantial contribution then would entitle an intervenor to pursue endless court challenges with guaranteed compensation from ratepayers,regardless of the subject matter,value,merits,or outcome of the court challenge.indeed,if turn position were adopted,it could have the unintended consequence of making the puc reluctant to make substantial contribution determinations,especially where the puc adopts an intervenor position only to a limited extent.the puc then would have to award compensation if the intervenor chose to make a court challenge to the puc decision,even if that court challenge were unsuccessful.
here,turn substantially contributed to the early phases of the ptr proceedings in the puc and to the puc efforts to defend its decisions against cal.edison challenge in federal court.the puc awarded turn nearly for that work.four years after the legislature passed ab power prices unexpectedly skyrocketed.the governor,the legi
