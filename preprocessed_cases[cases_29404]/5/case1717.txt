in turner association of american medical colleges th turner i,this court held that,when taking a standardized test,individuals with learning disabilities and other conditions affecting their ability to read are not entitled to accommodations under california unruh civil rights act unruh act,and disabled persons act dpa et.we reversed the trial court decision in favor of plaintiffs and,on remand,defendant association of american medical colleges sought an award of attorney fees under section of the dpa.section provides that the prevailing party in an action for injunctive relief under the dpa shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees.on remand,the trial court declined to award attorney fees to defendant because,among other reasons,all of the hours spent by defendant on the claim for injunctive relief under section were inextricably intertwined with the defense on plaintiffs claims under the unruh act and section of the dpa,and only prevailing plaintiffs are entitled to attorney fees on those claims.that is,section authorizes fee awards only to prevailing plaintiffs on unruh act claims,and section authorizes fee awards only to prevailing plaintiffs on claims for violation of the dpa.the fee provisions were added to those two sections subsequent to the enactment of section.
this case presents an issue of first impression is a trial court required to award attorney fees to a prevailing defendant under the bilateral,prevailing party statutory provision in section for attorney hours that were inextricably intertwined with the hours incurred in defending claims under sections and we conclude that a prevailing defendant is not entitled to an attorney fee award for such hours.when the legislature enacted the unilateral,prevailing plaintiff provisions in sections and,it created an exception to section by implication,prohibiting a fee award to a prevailing defendant for the same hours devoted to defending claims under sections and.thus,the trial court did not err in rejecting defendant attorney fee request.
factual and procedural background 
defendant is a nonprofit organization whose members include medical schools and teaching hospitals throughout the country.its mission is to improve public health by enhancing the effectiveness of academic medicine.among other things,defendant develops and administers the medical college admission test mcat,a nationwide standardized test designed to assess a medical school applicant knowledge of basic science concepts,writing skills,and facility in problem solving and critical thinking.
plaintiffs turner,cashmore,pierce,and lebovitz are california residents with learning disabilities attention deficit hyperactivity disorder who applied to take the mcat in california in.defendant denied their requests for more time a private room in which to take the test.in july,these four individuals and two nonprofit organizations,the national disabled students union and the international dyslexia association,filed a class action complaint alleging that defendant failed to accommodate turner,cashmore,pierce,lebovitz,and other similarly situated students with learning disabilities who were seeking to take the mcat.the complaint alleged causes of action under the unruh act,the dpa,and the unfair competition law bus,et.the complaint alleged that the requests for accommodations should have been considered under these state statutes,which define disability more broadly than the americans with disabilities act of ada et.plaintiffs sought injunctive relief,declaratory relief,and attorney fees,but not damages.
the trial court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification for the limited purpose of determining whether defendant must apply california law to the members of the defined class.following a bench trial,the court ruled,among other things,that defendant is required to provide reasonable accommodations that do not otherwise fundamentally alter the mcat to persons with established disabilities as defined under the unruh act and the dpa.the court rejected the cause of action under business and professions code section.it awarded plaintiffs approximately in attorney fees and costs as the prevailing party under section.
in turner i,supra,th,this court reversed the trial court judgment in favor of plaintiffs,as well as the fees award.on remand,defendant sought an award of attorney fees and costs as the new prevailing party under section.defendant request included all attorney hours reasonably spent on the case,rather than just those hours dedicated exclusively to the section claim.defendant asserted,b ecause of the interrelated nature of plaintiffs claims under the dpa and the unruh act and the common factual basis for each claim,it would be virtually impossible to segregate the time spent by defendant in defending against plaintiffs claims under one statute but not the other.
the trial court denied defendant request for attorney fees.the court stated that the fee award sought by defendant would conflict with the statutory policy embodied in the unruh act and other sections of the dpa not to award fees to a prevailing defendant.the court harmonize d the statutory provisions by concluding that attorney fees should not be awarded to a prevailing defendant under section unless the plaintiff claims were frivolous,which the claims in this case plainly were not.the trial court also concluded that a reasonable fee under section would be an award of zero fees,particularly in light of the plaintiffs limited financial resources.the court awarded defendant in costs.this appeal followed 
discussion 
ordinarily,a party to litigation may recover its attorney fees only when fee shifting is provided for by statute or by agreement of the parties.code civ,trope katz cal th,california follows what is commonly referred to as the american rule,which provides that each party to a lawsuit must ordinarily pay his own attorney fees.citations.in the present case we are confronted with the question of whether a prevailing defendant may recover statutorily authorized fees where such an award would conflict with other subsequently enacted statutes that provide that only prevailing plaintiffs may recover fees.

the present case requires this court to apply three different,but related,statutory provisions sections,and.in doing so,u nder rules of statutory construction,we must ascertain the intent of the drafters so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citation.because the statutory language is generally the most reliable indicator of legislative intent,we first examine the words themselves,giving them their usual and ordinary meaning and construing them in context.citation.e very statute should be construed with reference to the whole system of law of which it is a part,so that all may be harmonized and have effect.citation.mejia reed cal th,mejia.where as here multiple codes are to be construed,they must be regarded as blending into each other and forming a single statute.citation.accordingly,they must be read together and so construed as to give effect,when possible,to all the provisions thereof.citation.citation.ibid.

the dpa et is a california statutory scheme guaranteeing access to people with disabilities sections and generally guarantee individuals with disabilities equal access to public places,buildings,facilities and services,as well as common carriers,housing and places of public accommodation,while section specifies remedies for violations of these guarantees,including a private action for damages.munson,supra,cal th at,fn.section,subdivision a provides in pertinent part that any person or persons,firm or corporation who denies or interferes with admittance to or enjoyment of the public facilities as specified in sections and or otherwise interferes with the rights of an individual with a disability under sections,and is liable for each offense for the actual damages and any amount as may be determined by a jury,or the court sitting without a jury,up to a maximum of three times the amount of actual damages but in no case less than one thousand dollars,and attorney fees as may be determined by the court in addition thereto,suffered by any person denied any of the rights provided in sections,and the legislature recognized the potential overlap between sections and,providing in section,subdivision c that a person may not be held liable for damages pursuant to both this section and section for the same act or failure to act.
section expressly authorizes private actions for injunctive relief to correct violations of dpa standards.section provides,any person who is aggrieved or potentially aggrieved by a violation of section or of this code may bring an action to enjoin the violation.the prevailing party in the action shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees.see molski,supra,th at the plain language of section allows bilateral fee recovery.one notable difference between sections and relates to the standing required to support actions under the respective provisions a n equitable action under section carries no standing requirement other than that the plaintiff be a person who is aggrieved or potentially aggrieved by the challenged violation,while section imposes the standing requirement that the plaintiff have suffered an actual denial of equal access before any suit for damages can be brought.citation.in other words,while virtually any disabled person can bring an action to compel compliance with the dpa under section,a plaintiff can not recover damages under section unless the violation actually denied him or her equal access to some public facility.urhausen longs drug stores california,th,urhausen.
iii.there is a conflict in the present case between sections,and 
where,as here,a prevailing defendant has incurred attorney fees defending claims arising under sections,and,and those fees are inextricably intertwined,a conflict arises between sections and,on the one hand,and section,on the other.section authorizes fee awards to prevailing defendants,but sections and authorize such awards only to prevailing plaintiffs.although sections and do not literally state that prevailing defendants may not receive fee awards,that,as we explain below,is a necessary corollary to the legislature decision to authorize such awards only to prevailing plaintiffs.and it reflects a conscious decision if prevailing defendants were able to obtain fees for attorney hours spent defending claims under the unruh act and section,it would undermine the purpose of the unilateral fee encourage enforcement of the statutes without fear of an adverse fee award in the event the enforcement action fails.
as the court explained in covenant mutual ins.young d,covenant,unilateral provisions are created by legislators as a deliberate stratagem for advancing some public purpose,usually by encouraging more effective enforcement of some important public policy.in particular,such provisions reflect the legislature intent to encourage injured parties to seek thus simultaneously enforce public situations where they otherwise would not find it economical to sue.id.at.in rejecting a defendant claim that the principle of reciprocity justified permitting a defendant to receive a fee award under a statute awarding fees to prevailing plaintiffs,the court explained that a fee award to a prevailing defendant in that context obviously would frustrate the legislative intent to allow more injured people to seek redress and to encourage improved enforcement of public policy.indeed it is entirely possible bilateral would lead to fewer lawsuits and less effective enforcement than is experienced in the absence of any at all.injured people contemplating a lawsuit would confront the prospect of having to pay the defendant legal fees as well as their own in the event they lost.this would make the bet even less appealing where the potential recovery was modest or where the chances of winning were good but uncertain.id.at see also id.at a fee award to a prevailing defendant on a claim with a unilateral provision would discourage the meritorious as well as the frivolous lawsuit and thereby defeat the legislative goal of encouraging the redress of grievances and enhancing the enforcement of public policy.
the same rationale underlies the unilateral provisions in sections and.the statutory language authorizing fee awards only to prevailing plaintiffs reflects a determination that prevailing defendants should not receive a fee award for hours spent defending such claims.this is reflected strongly in the legislative history to section,when,in,it was amended to include the unilateral provision by assembly bill reg.stats,ch.particularly notable is a september,letter from attorney matthew weinberg to speaker of the assembly leo mccarthy,which letter was requested by the assembly judiciary committee and attached to the january,bill analysis work sheet for assembly bill weinberg letter.the weinberg letter addressed a question raised by the legislative counsel of california as to whether the proposed statutory language providing fees to prevailing plaintiffs but not to prevailing defendants would violate state and federal constitutional guarantees of equal protection of the law.citing state and federal authorities,the letter opined,the legislature is not required by the equal protection provisions of the constitution to provide attorney fees to a successful defendant in instances where it provides attorney fees to successful plaintiffs.weinberg letter.a committee bill digest noted that under assembly bill violators of the unruh act are liable for the plaintiff attorney fees and t here is no c onstitutional impediment to prohibit the award of attorney fees to only one party.assem.com.on judiciary,bill,assem.bill reg.sess.as introduced.accordingly,the legislative history to the unilateral provision in section reflects the legislature considered judgment that prevailing defendants in unruh act actions should not receive a fee award.the legislative history to section is consistent,although less extensive an enrolled bill report states that the bill adding the provision to section would encourage the legal community to litigate the civil right claims of physically handicapped person s by imposing a statutory provision e nsuring them legal fees.governor,legal affairs,enrolled bill on bill reg.sess.

the decision in carver,supra,th,provides particularly clear support for concluding that a fee award to defendant under section would frustrate the purposes of the unilateral provisions in sections and.carver was confronted with a conflict between the unilateral provision applicable to antitrust violation claims under the cartwright act bus,et and a contractual provision,under which the prevailing defendant in the case sought a fee award.carver,at.carver held that the cartwright act fee provision prohibits an attorney fee award to a defendant for hours spent defending against a cartwright act claim,even if those hours also contributed to the defense of claims for which there is a contractual right to fees.carver,at.the court reasoned,to allow chevron to recover fees for work on cartwright act issues simply because the statutory claims have some arguable benefit to other aspects of the case would superimpose a judicially declared principle of reciprocity on the statute fee provision,a result unintended by the legislature,and would thereby frustrate the legislative intent to encourage improved enforcement of public policy.carver,at,citing covenant,supra,d at see also wood,supra,th at,following carver in denying contractual fees for hours inextricably intertwined with defense of a cause of action alleging financial abuse of an elder adult.
the decisions in molski,supra,th and murillo,supra,cal th do not undermine a conclusion that there is a conflict between statutes in this case.in molski,the plaintiff argued that a prevailing defendant should only be awarded attorney fees under section if the plaintiff action was frivolous.molski,at plaintiff argued for application of the standard under the ada,where an award of attorney fees to the prevailing party is discretionary hubbard,supra,at,but a prevailing defendant may only be awarded fees upon a finding that the plaintiff action was frivolous,unreasonable,or without foundation.summers teichert son,cir,quoting christiansburg garment eeoc,christiansburg.molski rejected application of the christiansburg standard to section attorney fee requests,concluding that a fee award to a prevailing defendant under section does not require a finding that the plaintiff claim was frivolous.molski,at hubbard,at see also jones wild oats markets,d,goodell ralphs grocery d.molski,however,did not address the conflict between section and sections and.see wood,supra,th at a case is not authority for propositions not considered therein.citation.
in murillo,supra,cal th,a defendant prevailed in a lawsuit brought under the consumer warranty act,et.the california supreme court held that an award of costs to the defendant under section,subdivision b of the code of civil procedure did not conflict with a provision of the consumer warranty act that provided costs and attorney fees to prevailing plaintiffs only.murillo,at.the decision is distinguishable because the court relied on language in section,subdivision b of the code of civil procedure requiring that any exception to the general rule awarding costs to prevailing parties be expressly provided.murillo,at.by that language,the legislature had clearly and explicitly informed the courts that the general rule should take precedence.ibid.section contains no comparable language.moreover,murillo expressly acknowledged that attorney fee awards present different considerations,and statutes providing for unilateral fee shifting are a deliberate stratagem to encourage statutory enforcement.thus,the court pointed out that its holding retains the primary financial benefit the consumer warranty act offers to consumers who sue thereunder to enforce their rights their ability,if successful,to recover their attorney fees based on actual time expended.such fees generally comprise the lion share of the litigation costs by permitting prevailing buyers to recover their attorney fees in addition to costs and expenses,our legislature has provided injured consumers strong encouragement to seek legal redress in a situation in which a lawsuit might not otherwise have been economically feasible.murillo,at see also id.at,carver chevron,th,distinguishing murillo on same basis.
in conclusion,the unilateral provisions in sections and reflect the legislature intent to encourage vigorous enforcement of the unruh act and section by removing the potent economic obstacles presented by the cost of obtaining representation and the risk of an adverse fee award.the trial court found,and defendant has conceded,that the hours spent defending the section claim are indistinguishable from those spent defending the other claims.the statutory conflict is clear section on its face would permit defendant to recover fees for attorney hours spent defending claims under the unruh act and section,but sections and reflect the legislature intent that prevailing defendants not receive a fee award for such attorney hours.indeed,defendant does not appear to dispute that there is a conflict between section,on the one hand,and sections and,on the other,in the present case instead,it argues plaintiffs created the conflict by choosing to seek injunctive relief under section.we address this contention later in this decision see below,at fn.
iv.sections and create an exception to section by implication 
as stated in mclaughlin,supra,th at page,since actual conflicts are inevitable given the breadth of california extensive statutory law,courts have developed several applicable interpretative paradigms by which a law in conflict with an existing statute may be given effect.
legislative history 
because the ultimate goal is to effectuate the legislature intent mejia,supra,cal th at,courts should consider whether any legislative history provides insight into the legislative intent as to which statute prevails lu hawaiian gardens casino,cal th,in re corrine cal th,tesco controls,monterey mechanical th.in this case,no legislative history provides insight into which statutory directive should prevail in the event of a conflict between sections and on the one hand,and section on the other.as noted previously,the legislative history to the unilateral provisions in sections and reflects the legislature considered determination to encourage enforcement by favoring plaintiffs on fees,but the legislative history does not address the potential for conflict with section.with regard to section,it is notable that the original version of the bill enacting the statute contained a unilateral provision the bill was amended to make numerous changes and the provision was made bilateral.compare assem.com.on judiciary,bill,assem.bill reg.sess.as introduced may,with bill,assem.bill reg.sess.as amended april.an enrolled bill report states regarding the provision,physically handicapped persons do not generally have income or resources necessary to pay for attorney fees when it is necessary to take flagrant violators to court.this bill will make it clear that the prevailing party will be entitled to attorney fees.cal.health and welf.agency,enrolled bill on assem.bill reg.sess.but the legislative history of section,like that of sections and,does not provide any specific guidance regarding whether bilateral or unilateral should prevail in the event of a conflict like that in this case.
specific versus general statutes 
turning to the principles of statutory interpretation that do not rely on an express indication of legislative intent,most straightforward is the principle that where there is a conflict between a general statute and a more specific one,the specific statute controls and will be treated as an exception to the general statute.mclaughlin,supra,th at.as courts have explained,unless repealed expressly or by necessary implication,a special statute dealing with a particular subject constitutes an exception so as to control and take precedence over a conflicting general statute on the same subject.citations.this is the case regardless of whether the special provision is enacted before or after the general one citation,and notwithstanding that the general provision,standing alone,would be broad enough to include the subject to which the more particular one relates.citation.tapia pohlmann th,fn.see mclaughlin,at same see also salazar eastin cal th,to the extent a specific statute is inconsistent with a general statute potentially covering the same subject matter,the specific statute must be read as an exception to the more general statute.citations.however,this principle does not apply where the court can not state that one statute is truly more specific in a relevant aspect.mejia,supra,cal th at neither statute appears to be significantly more specific than the other.the present case is not one in which it can be said that one of the applicable statutory provisions is more specific than the other.sections,and are all equally specific regarding the rules applicable to the respective claims.
presumptions of legislative acquiescence and awareness of existing statutes 
defendant asserts that section,enacted in stats,ch,should prevail because it was left undisturbed when the unilateral fee provision was added to section in stats,ch,when the unruh act and the dpa were amended in stats,ch,and when the dpa was amended in stats,ch.however,defendant fails to cite authority for the proposition that the legislature failure to amend a statute has any significance absent a relevant judicial construction to which the legislature can be said to have acquiesced.harris capital growth investors xiv cal d,w hen the legislature amends a statute without altering portions of the provision that have previously been judicially construed,the legislature is presumed to have been aware of and to have acquiesced in the previous judicial construction.accordingly,reenacted portions of the statute are given the same construction they received before the amendment.citation.section has not been reenacted since its adoption in,and no prior case has addressed the potential conflict between sections,and.in particular,the main cases on which defendant,supra,th,jones wild oats markets,supra,d,and goodell ralphs grocery,supra,d not address the conflict.accordingly,there is nothing that can be inferred from the legislature failure to amend section.
neither can we rely on the related presumption that legislators are deemed to be aware of laws in effect at the time they enact new laws and are conclusively presumed to have enacted the new laws in light of existing laws having direct bearing upon them.citations.mclaughlin,supra,th at.that presumption can be helpful where a provision present in an existing statute was not included in a statute.see,williams county of san joaquin d,court presumes the legislature did not intend to require notice to the prosecuting attorney of consideration of release of an arrestee on his own recognizance,because the legislature did not include a notice provision equivalent to one in a bail release statute.also,lawmakers can be presumed to borrow from existing law to supply omitted meaning to later enactments.mclaughlin,at see,people weidert cal d,reference to criminal proceeding in special circumstances enactment does not encompass a juvenile court proceeding in light of existing statute providing that juvenile court proceedings are not criminal proceedings.however,the presumption is unhelpful in a case like the present one,where sections and actually conflict with section in a lawsuit where a defendant prevails against claims under all three sections and the legal fees incurred can not be differentiated.see mclaughlin,at.we are aware of no authority that the presumption of legislative awareness of existing statutes can justify creating an exception by implication to the express language of a subsequent enactment.to the contrary,as explained below,the general rule is that the subsequent enactment is understood to amend the existing statute.
amendment or exception by implication 
in mclaughlin,the court was called upon to resolve a conflict between proposition,the english language in public schools initiative statute and education code section.mclaughlin,supra,th at.proposition enacted a new chapter in the education code requiring california public schools to teach children with limited english proficiency only in english,subject to the right of parents of affected children to seek waiver of the requirement.the issue before the court was whether the requirement was subject to a provision in education code section allowing schools to apply for waivers from program requirements not enumerated in the section.proposition was silent as to education code section.mclaughlin,at.
after reviewing the intent underlying both enactments and the history of proposition,the mclaughlin court concluded that there is simply no rational way to reconcile or harmonize the c hapter as an integrated whole with education code section.one can not uphold the clear and positive expression of intent in the c hapter,which mandates a strong system of education subject only to parental waiver,while supporting the right of school districts to avoid the c hapter decree through waivers.the statutes are in such irremediable conflict that to allow one would render the other nugatory.citation.mclaughlin,supra,th at.
turning to principles of statutory interpretation to resolve the conflict,mclaughlin observed california courts have long recognized that an act adding new provisions to and affecting the application of an existing statute in a sense amends that statute citation.an implied amendment is an act that creates an addition,omission,modification or substitution and changes the scope or effect of an existing statute.citations.like the related principles of r epeal by implication citation,and draft ers oversight citation,amendments by implication are disfavored but are allowed to preserve statutory harmony and effectuate the intent of the legislature citation.mclaughlin,supra,th at.the court pointed out that the california supreme court had employed the principle in two criminal cases in concluding that subsequently enacted sentencing enhancement provisions constituted implied exceptions to a section of the penal code that limited prison terms to double the base term.mclaughlin,at see people pieters cal d,the legislature impliedly created an exception to former penal code section,subdivision g when it enacted penal code section people jackson cal d,we read penal code section,subdivision g,as if it contained an exception for enhancements for serious felonies pursuant to former penal code section,disapproved on other grounds in people guerrero cal d.
the mclaughlin court recognized that the principle of amendment or exception by implication is to be employed frugally,and only where the statute creates such a conflict with existing law that there is no rational basis for harmonizing the two statutes,such as where they are irreconcilable,clearly repugnant,and so inconsistent that the two can not have concurrent operation citation.mclaughlin,supra,th at.the court stated that the chapter enacted by proposition and education code section were so irreconcilable,because w e see no way that the guarantee of instruction subject solely to parental waiver can be accomplished if school boards are allowed to avoid compliance with the entire c hapter by seeking waivers,no matter how well intentioned administrators may be in doing so.mclaughlin,at.the court concluded that the failure to expressly amend education code section was an oversight,and read into the section an implied exception from the waiver process.mclaughlin,at.
similarly,sections and are irreconcilable with section in a lawsuit such as this,where a defendant prevails on all claims and the attorney fees incurred in defense of a claim under section were inextricably intertwined with the fees incurred defending claims under sections and.there is no rational basis for harmonizing the three fee statutes.mclaughlin,supra,th at.they are irreconcilable,clearly repugnant,and so inconsistent that the three can not have concurrent operation in this circumstance.id.at.
an analysis of the public policy considerations supports finding an implied exception to a prevailing defendant right to recover fees under section in the circumstances of this case.see mejia,supra,cal th at people coronado,supra,cal th at.although the legislative history is not instructive,presumably the legislature included the bilateral provision in section to discourage at least the filing of frivolous litigation.see flannery prentice cal th,flannery reciprocal provision in the california fair employment and housing act feha,et furthers the important public policy of discouraging frivolous suits as well as the policy of encouraging meritorious ones.one important distinction between section and the feha provision considered in flannery is that fee awards under feha are discretionary and a prevailing defendant may only obtain an award where the plaintiff suit was frivolous.holman altana pharma us,th,it is now settled that the christiansburg standard must be satisfied before a defendant prevailing in a feha action may recover attorney fees.the court in molski,supra,th at pages,concluded that a defendant could obtain fees under section,even where the plaintiff claim was not frivolous.accordingly,the fee provision in section may have been intended to discourage not only frivolous lawsuits,but also other lawsuits that have possible but uncertain merit see covenant,supra,d at.
on the other hand,like the unilateral provisions in carver and other cases cited above in part,the fee provisions in sections and serve the well established public purpose of encouraging private enforcement of disability rights law.carver,supra,th at see also,earley,supra,th at.we have previously described this legislative purpose in detail,and explained that the purpose is broadly recognized in california case law and specifically acknowledged in the legislative history to section,section,and even section.it is also instructive to consider the observations in munson as to the legislature general intent regarding the enforcement of disability rights law.munson emphasized that the unruh act must be construed liberally in order to carry out its purpose to create and preserve a nondiscriminatory environment in california business establishments by banishing or eradicating arbitrary,invidious discrimination by such establishments.citation.the unruh act serves as a preventive measure,without which it is recognized that businesses might fall into discriminatory practices.citation.munson,supra,cal th at.to conclude that a substantial attorney fee award may be imposed on plaintiffs for the identical hours used in defending against plaintiffs unruh act claim would not be consistent with that legislative intent.moreover,when the legislature amended sections and in,it indicated that it sought to make california disability rights law at least as strong as federal law.the general intent of the legislation was expressed in an uncodified section it is the intent of the legislature in enacting this act to strengthen california law in areas where it is weaker than the ada and to retain california law when it provides more protection for individuals with disabilities than the ada.stats,ch.munson,at.to conclude that section should prevail would be contrary to that intent,because it would create a potential fee liability that does not exist under the federal scheme.see hubbard,supra,at.
the main thrust of defendant argument that section should prevail is that it is fair to impose attorney fees on plaintiffs because plaintiffs could have elected not to pursue an injunction under section.defendant relies on statements made by the court in molski,supra,th,in the course of rejecting application of the federal christiansburg standard to section.as noted previously,under christiansburg,supra,at page,a prevailing defendant in a civil rights action is entitled to attorney fees only where the action was frivolous.molski noted that christiansburg involved a suit under title vii of the civil rights act of et,not access litigation in california state court,where a plaintiff controls the relative risks,burdens and benefits by selecting from among several statutory options.molski,at.specifically,molski noted that a plaintiff prosecuting an access claim in california has several alternatives under california law and can seek relief under section,or.molski,at.a plaintiff seeking relief only under section would not be exposed to the risk of an adverse judgment for attorney fees by including a claim for injunctive relief under section,the plaintiff in molski knew that he could be exposed to an adverse fee award and therefore had something to lose if he did not carefully assess the merits of his claim.molski,at.the court concluded that awarding a prevailing defendant attorney fees under section without a finding that the plaintiff claims were frivolous did not offend the spirit of california statutory scheme.molski,at.a plaintiff should be held accountable for the consequences of a scorched earth strategy of electing to pursue every available statutory option,thereby maximiz ing the litigation expenses of his adversary.ibid.
although the plaintiff in molski sought relief under sections,and molski,supra,th at,the plaintiff apparently did not argue that sections and prevail over section and the court did not address the conflict between the various fee provisions.here,the fact that plaintiffs could have elected to forgo injunctive relief under section,and thus avoided the risk of any conflicting statutory directives on fee shifting,does not justify,as matter of public policy,a section fee award to a prevailing defendant that concedes it did not incur even one extra hour of attorney fees defending the section claim.to award fees under section would frustrate the purposes of the unilateral provisions in sections and,and in this case impose a crushing fee award on civil rights plaintiffs who did not even seek damages from defendant.moreover,such an award would also undermine enforcement of section,which benefits all disabled persons,by discouraging future plaintiffs from including claims for injunctive relief under section,even where inclusion of the claim would not increase the burden of the litigation.it is reasonable to conclude the legislature intended to discourage the filing of meritless lawsuits under section,but there is no reason to believe the legislature intended to discourage requests for injunctive relief under section that add nothing to the defendant litigation burden.see mclaughlin,supra,th at the basic principle of statutory interpretation is that provisions of statutes are to be interpreted to effectuate the purpose of the law.
on balance,the public policy analysis supports our conclusion that sections and should be read to create an exception to section by implication.the objectives underlying the unilateral provisions in sections and are well established in the legislative history and case law.to conclude that section mandates a fee award to a prevailing defendant for hours intertwined with the defense of claims under sections and would frustrate the purposes of the unilateral provisions in sections and and undermine enforcement of section,even where its inclusion would not add to the burden of the litigation 
defendant remaining contentions and conclusion 
in support of its claim to a fee award for all hours spent on the section claim,even if the hours overlapped with the defense on other claims,defendant cites the general proposition that a ttorney fees need not be apportioned when incurred for representation on an issue common to both a cause of action in which fees are proper and one in which they are not allowed.reynolds metals alperson cal d.although reynolds was decided in the context of a contractual right to attorney fees,the same nonapportionment principle applies where the fee entitlement is statutory.akins enterprise th,akins.however,none of defendant cases address a situation where,as here,an award of fees for all hours spent on the compensable claim would conflict with a statutory unilateral provision.see carver,supra,th at reynolds is distinguishable because it did not involve a conflict between a contractual right to attorney fees and a statutory prohibition against awarding such fees.wood,supra,th at same.
defendant also argues that,even if a fee award for all hours spent on the section claim would have been improper,the trial court abused its discretion in failing to apportion the hours between the claims and make some fee award under section.in carver,the trial court apportioned percent of the fees to defending the cartwright act claims,and reduced the fees awarded to chevron accordingly.the fees eliminated from the award were those reasonabl y and necessarily incurred in defending cartwright act claims,even if the work performed arguably provided some benefit to other aspects of the case carver,supra,th at.thus,the partial fee award was only for hours solely dedicated to act claims.carver,at.in the present case,the trial court found and defendant conceded below that all hours spent defending against the three claims were inextricably intertwined defendant has not challenged that finding on appeal.accordingly,there were no hours that could properly be apportioned to section.see wood,supra,th at no hours apportioned to tort claims where all causes of action arose out of same transaction.
in conclusion,we hold that where a defendant prevails against a plaintiff who sought relief under section as well as under section section,the defendant may not obtain an attorney fee award under section for attorney hours inextricably intertwined with hours spent defending claims under section section although defendant argues that denying it fees in this case would effectuate a repeal of section,our decision does not foreclose a defendant from seeking an award under section for hours that it can show were not intertwined with defense of a cause of action with a unilateral provision those are the only hours that represent additional litigation expenses due to inclusion of a request for relief under section defendant does not contend that any such hours exist in this case.
