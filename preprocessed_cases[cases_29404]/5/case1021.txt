and his parents collectively,plaintiffs appeal a summary judgment for monrovia unified school district and west san gabriel special education local planning area collectively,defendant on plaintiffs action for violation of the individuals with disabilities education act idea,and violation of section of the rehabilitation act.plaintiffs also appeal an award of attorneys fees to defendant under the idea.we have jurisdiction under.we affirm in part and reverse in part.
factual and procedural background 
was a young boy,approximately eleven years old at all relevant times,with cerebral palsy,seizure disorder,and global developmental delays.he was and required assistance changing body positions.he had cortical blindness,meaning his eyes could see but his brain did not acknowledge what his eyes saw.thus,did not always understand,retain,or make associations with what he saw.he could communicate only by responding to smile,a sound,or lifting his hand was a yes a flat affect was a no.however,was not consistent with these responses,so his service providers had difficulty determining whether a yes signal was actually an involuntary movement caused by the cerebral palsy.
in december,enrolled in the california virtual academy cava,a network of charter schools offering independent study at its students homes.although plaintiffs live in los angeles county,enrolled in cava kern county,which services students in any county that abuts kern county.cava provided materials to.father,who instructed and reported the results on cava website.a general education teacher visited plaintiffs home three days per week for one and hours per session.the teacher modified the curriculum by converting materials to questions and enlarging materials.
cava created a valid individualized educational program iep for in.cava and plaintiffs agreed on an independent schooling placement with support from a resource specialist five times a week for sessions,occupational therapy once a week for a session,adapted physical education once a week for a session,and speech and language once a week for a session.cava and plaintiffs held iep meetings again in and,but they were unable to agree on goals and objectives and parents refused to sign the iep documents.placement continued as independent study home schooling.
on december,cava and plaintiffs agreed on a new iep that changed placement to a classroom with appropriate supports.the iep team found that had marked improvement academically,socially,and physically,though his academic improvement was due to his service providers increased ability over time to gauge response.his social improvement was based on observations of his interactions and communication through his smiles with other people,which indicated awareness of his surroundings.his physical improvement was based on observations that he could sit in his chair and focus.the iep described language proficiency as age appropriate,which means that if a person spoke to like any other nine or,would have understood it completely,though he was nonverbal.the iep was not based on any formal assessment of.academic or cognitive abilities.
enrolled in defendant school district because cava has no classrooms and therefore could not implement the iep.plaintiffs submitted proof of residence and a copy of the iep to defendant on december.gail crotty reviewed iep to determine his interim placement.crotty has a master degree in educational administration,credentials in adaptive physical education and learning handicaps,and certificates in resource special programs and crosscultural language and academic development.she has held numerous positions and has worked with at least twenty students with disabilities comparable to.
crotty was concerned that defendant was being asked to implement an iep that was never previously implemented and required a change in placement.she also was concerned that the placement was determined at the beginning of the iep meeting,rather than after present levels of performance were discussed,and that the present levels of performance in the iep document were unclear and referred to reports that were not attached.some goals were not measurable,and other goals were on different levels.for example,one goal was to give a big smile when prompted by give a big smile now,while another goal was to write a three paragraph report using the third grade curriculum.crotty was concerned about whether could succeed if he went straight from home schooling to a general education classroom,since he was not used to being around other students.
crotty scheduled an intake meeting for december,which was two days before the winter vacation.plaintiffs and defendant disagreed about an appropriate wanted a classroom as provided in the iep,whereas defendant wanted to continue independent schooling for a period to assess though plaintiffs did not agree to defendant offer,continued in the independent schooling placement with services beginning on january,which was the first day of the new semester.
defendant scheduled an iep meeting on february.plaintiffs agreed to the february,meeting date,but cancelled three days before the meeting because father could not arrange child care for plaintiffs requested an iep meeting date in or april,but defendant could not agree because of the requirement.defendant offered to allow mother or father to participate by telephone,or to allow plaintiff father to bring to the meeting as he had done in the past,but plaintiffs refused these suggestions.defendant held the meeting without plaintiffs.
defendant iep team determined that should be classified as a and placed in a special day class on a campus.because defendant does not have an appropriate special day class,the iep team recommended a referral to the los angeles county office of education for placement.defendant offered an iep consisting of a comprehensive assessment of,physical therapy for two hours per week,occupational therapy for hour per week,speech and language for one and hours per week,adaptive physical education twice a week in sessions,placement in a special day class with a teacher credentialed in special education,a referral to california children services,a referral to los angeles county office of education for placement in a special day class,and a aide at the school site.this offer was sent to plaintiffs,but they did not consent to it.
defendant held a second iep meeting on may.plaintiffs lawyer attended,though plaintiffs did not attend.a los angeles county office of education representative attended,and the iep team agreed to offer plaintiffs a placement in a special day class at encinitas school.
plaintiffs and defendant each requested a hearing with the office of administrative hearings oah.oah consolidated the requests and ruled for defendant.plaintiffs filed a complaint in district court alleging a violation of the idea and a violation of section.died while the action was pending.defendants moved for summary judgment on both claims,and the district court granted the motion.the district court also awarded attorneys fees to defendant on the ground that death mooted the case and plaintiffs should not have continued it after it became moot.
ii.discussion 
plaintiffs argue that the district court erred by a failing to reverse the oah ruling for defendant on plaintiffs idea claim,b granting summary judgment to defendant on plaintiffs section claim,and c awarding attorneys fees to defendant.
whether the district court erred by failing to reverse the oah ruling for defendant on plaintiff idea claim 
we give due weight to oah decisions.bd.of educ.rowley.we give more deference to oah decisions if the findings are thorough and careful.see capistrano unified sch.dist.wartenberg by through wartenberg,cir.however,the ultimate determination of whether an iep was appropriate is reviewed de novo.id.
plaintiffs argue that defendant denied a free appropriate public education fape by not developing a procedurally and substantively valid iep.see a rowley,at stating that a fape includes an iep.
plaintiffs argue that defendant denied a procedurally valid iep by a failing to implement the iep or develop and implement a new valid iep within thirty days of transferring into the district b failing to develop an adequate iep and c not allowing plaintiffs to meaningfully participate in the iep process.
whether defendant failed to implement the iep or develop and implement a new valid iep within thirty days of transferring into the district 
when an student transfers from one california school district to another during the school year,the local school district shall provide services comparable to those described in the previously approved iep for a period not to exceed days,by which time the local educational agency shall adopt the previously approved iep or shall develop,adopt,and implement a new iep.cal.a.
plaintiffs argue that section a required defendant to provide services comparable to the iep during the initial thirty days because the iep was the previously approved iep since plaintiffs and cava agreed to it,though it was never implemented defendant argues that it was required only to provide services in accordance with the last implemented iep because california section a is modeled after the idea,which states that when an exceptional needs student who had an iep that was in effect in the same state transfers to a new school,the school shall provide services comparable to the previously held iep.d c i i.defendant argues that only the independent schooling iep was ever in effect.
oah concluded that section a refers to the last iep that was actually implemented.oah reasoning is persuasive providing services in accordance with the previously implemented iep effectuates the statute purpose of minimizing disruption to the student while the parents and the receiving school resolve disagreements about proper placement.we agree with oah.
plaintiffs also argue that defendant violated section a by not developing a new valid iep within thirty days.father filled out the paperwork to enroll in defendant district on december,defendant held an intake meeting with plaintiffs on december,school closed for the winter break from december,to january,defendant began providing services to on january,and defendant held an iep meeting on february.thus,defendant did not hold an iep within thirty days of enrollment.
oah concluded,and the district court affirmed,that defendant actions were appropriate because defendant would have had insufficient time to evaluate if defendant were required to hold an iep meeting within thirty days of enrollment on december,however,neither oah nor the district court cited authority for the proposition that school holidays toll section a requirement.
whether or not defendant exceeded the limit,suffered no deprivation of educational benefit and therefore has no claim.see amanda clark county sch,cir.oah is correct that service providers could not have adequately assessed needs within thirty days of december or.indeed,even though defendant had thirty days to evaluate,plaintiffs and defendant were unable to agree upon an appropriate iep and had to schedule a further meeting in may.that the brief delay during winter vacation caused no educational deprivation to is further evidenced by the fact that placement continued as independent schooling in may.
therefore,defendant did not commit a procedural violation by failing to implement the iep or by failing to develop and implement a new valid iep within thirty days of transferring into the district.
whether defendant failed to hold an adequate iep meeting on december,
plaintiffs argue that the december,intake meeting should be construed as an iep meeting because the resulting intake document substantially differed from the iep,essentially changing it.on this basis,plaintiffs contend that the meeting was procedurally deficient since all personnel necessary for an iep evaluation were not present.as oah correctly noted,however,defendant did not commit procedural violations when it did not have a full iep team at the december,intake meeting.the december,meeting was not an iep meeting.
whether defendant allowed plaintiffs to meaningfully participate in the iep process 
a receiving school must take steps to ensure that one or both parents of a disabled child are present at the iep meeting by notifying parents of the meeting early enough to ensure that they will have an opportunity to attend and scheduling the meeting at a mutually agreed on time and place.a.if neither parent can attend an iep team meeting,the public agency must use other methods to ensure parent participation,including individual or conference telephone calls id.at c.a meeting may be conducted without a parent in attendance if the public agency is unable to convince the parents that they should attend.in this case,the public agency must keep a record of its attempts to arrange a mutually agreed on time and place id.at d.
plaintiffs argue that the district court erred by not making findings on whether defendant allowed them to participate in iep meetings.the district court indicated,through its finding that defendant did not commit a procedural violation,that defendant took steps to obtain plaintiffs presence at the iep meetings.moreover,oah carefully considered the issue and concluded that defendant took steps to ensure plaintiffs participation,and there is no reason to overturn that reasoned decision.defendant scheduled an iep meeting for a date agreeable to plaintiffs,and plaintiffs cancelled three days before the meeting.defendant offered to reschedule,but plaintiffs would only agree to a meeting in or april,which was too far beyond the limit.defendant offered to allow plaintiffs to participate by telephone,but plaintiffs refused.thus,defendant took steps to obtain plaintiffs presence at the iep meeting.
plaintiffs also argue that parents could not meaningfully participate in the iep process because the iep documents failed to include pertinent information.oah rejected these arguments after careful consideration.oah found that the iep documents did not specify a method for measuring progress in physical therapy,but this did not affect plaintiffs ability to assess the iep offer because the physical therapy goals were similar to those in the cava iep that plaintiffs accepted.oah rejected plaintiffs argument that the iep documents failed to specify the supports and modifications necessary for to participate in the setting because the iep specified that would have the support of a aide during school hours.oah also found that the iep sufficiently documented the rationale for placing in a classroom and identified the duration and location of the special day classes and speech and language services.
therefore,the district court properly affirmed oah carefully considered decision that defendant did not commit a procedural violation.
plaintiffs argue that iep was substantively deficient because it was not based on unique needs and was not reasonably calculated to provide an educational benefit.see rowley,at.plaintiffs also argue that defendant did not offer an educational program that comported with his iep,and did not offer a program in the least restrictive environment.see id.at poolaw bishop,cir.
the iep team considered unique needs and developed an iep calculated to provide him an educational benefit.the iep team considered levels of performance and his needs based on the observations of service providers during the period.they concluded a placement was appropriate.defendant created an iep that included individual services and placement in a special day class.thus,the iep was based on needs and was calculated to provide him a benefit.
plaintiffs argue that defendant did not offer an educational program that comported with his iep.however,plaintiffs claim only that the educational program did not comport with the cava iep plaintiffs do not claim that defendant did not offer a program that comported with the iep created by defendant in.thus,this argument fails.
defendant offered an education in the least restrictive environment appropriate.as oah correctly noted,defendant argument that could not have received a meaningful education in a setting is persuasive.was and could respond only to questions.the general education teacher assigned to through
