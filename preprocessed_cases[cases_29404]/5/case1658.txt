this writ petition presents the following question may a surrogate for a party to a pending lawsuit against a public entity obtain documents under the california public records act cpra relating to the attorney fees charged by litigation counsel for the public entity in this case,we answer the question in the affirmative.
under the cpra,et every person has a right to inspect any public record,subd.a,for any purpose,subject to certain exemptions county of los angeles superior court axelrad th,axelrad.the cpra contains a number of exemptions,including one which excepts from disclosure records pertaining to pending litigation to which the public agency is a party until the pending litigation has been finally adjudicated or otherwise settled,subd.b.
by case law,the cpra is broadly construed.exemptions,however,are narrowly construed.consistent with this construction,the trial court here ruled the pending litigation exemption did not apply to billing and payment records reflecting the amount of money the county of los angeles county had paid in attorney fees to defend itself against a pending civil rights action.
the county claims the trial court erred in construing the statutory exemption and ordering disclosure of the records in question.we reject the contention and deny the county petition for a writ of mandate.
factual and procedural history 
real party in interest cynthia anderson barker is an attorney.she works in the same office as attorneys david mann and donald cook,who are her attorneys of record in this cpra action both in the trial court and in this court.attorneys mann and cook also represent the plaintiffs in a civil rights action that has been pending in the los angeles county superior court since venegas county of los angeles the venegas action the venegas action has been the subject of numerous appellate proceedings.see venegas county of los angeles,nonpub.opn.venegas county of los angeles th venegas county of los angeles cal th.in october,after the most recent appellate decision,the case was returned to the trial court for trial.
one month later,in november,anderson barker filed a petition for writ of mandate in the superior court,seeking disclosure under the cpra of certain records relating to the venegasaction,records that the county had refused to disclose in response to a formal cpra request see,subd.a member of public may challenge denial of cpra request by filing writ petition in the superior court.specifically,she sought all invoices or other requests for payment submitted to the county by any law firm representing it in the venegas action,each such law firm time records for the venegas action,and canceled checks and other writings reflecting payment by the county to such law firms.
in its answer to the mandate petition,the county maintained that the documents in question were not subject disclosure because,among other things,they were communications,they were attorney work product,and they were exempt from disclosure under the cpra pending litigation exemption in section,subdivision b.
before the hearing on the matter,the trial court issued a tentative decision which became the ruling of the court after the parties submitted on the tentative without substantive argument.the trial court ruled the documents in question were not privileged communications,but they did contain some attorney work product.thus,attorney time records reflect legal research performed,as well as the thought processes and impressions of counsel.the court ruled that the information should be redacted to show only the information that is not work product the hours worked,the identity of the person performing the work,and the amount charged.
with respect to the pending litigation exemption,and citing fairley superior court th fairley,the trial court ruled the exemption applied only to records specifically prepared for use in litigation.because the documents in question were prepared in connection with the venegas case,but not specifically for use in that case,the exemption did not apply.
the county filed a writ petition with this court challenging the trial court ruling.see,subd.c trial court order directing disclosure or upholding refusal to disclose under the cpra is not appealable,but shall be immediately reviewable by petition to the appellate court powers city of richmond cal th,a petition for extraordinary writ is the exclusive mode of appellate review in cpra actions.the county does not challenge the trial court ruling with respect to the and work product privileges.it argues here only that the redacted documents it was ordered to disclose are exempt from disclosure under the cpra pending litigation exemption.
we initially denied the petition summarily.however,the supreme court granted the county petition for review and transferred the matter to us with directions to issue an order to show cause.we issued such an order,received additional briefing from the parties,and heard oral argument 
discussion 
the standard of review 
as with any statute,the construction and interpretation of the cpra is a question of law which we review de novo.brv,superior court th,fairley,supra,th at.where,as here,the relevant facts are undisputed,application of the cpra to those facts presents an issue of law.brv,at.however,the substantial evidence test applies with respect to any factual determinations the trial court made as part of its cpra ruling.axelrad,supra,th at.
the cpra was enacted in and is modeled after the federal freedom of information act foia et.axelrad,supra,th at.it was enacted for the purpose of increasing freedom of information by giving members of the public access to information in the possession of public agencies.filarsky superior court cal th.in enacting the cpra,the legislature declared that access to information concerning the conduct of the people business is a fundamental and necessary right of every person in this state.
under the cpra,subject to certain express exemptions,every person has a right to inspect any public record maintained by a state or local agency,subd.a.the county is a local agency under the cpra,subd.a,and there is no dispute that the records at issue in this writ proceeding qualify as public records,subd.e public records includes any writing containing information relating to the conduct of the public business prepared,owned,used,or retained by any state or local agency regardless of physical form or characteristics.because the statute furthers the people right of access,it must be construed broadly.marken santa monica malibu school district th,see also cal,art.i,subd.b a statute,court rule,or other authority,including those in effect on the effective date of this subdivision,shall be broadly construed if it furthers the people right of access,and narrowly construed if it limits the right of access.
the cpra does not allow limitations on access to a public record based upon the purpose for which the record is being requested,if th
