appellant capitol hill group chg filed suit in the superior court of the district of columbia against its former counsel,shaw pittman now pillsbury winthrop shaw pittman llp and various associated attorneys,for claims stemming from alleged legal malpractice.appellees removed the case to federal court,asserting federal jurisdiction under b,arising in bankruptcy jurisdiction.the district court denied appellant motion to remand for lack of jurisdiction,and later granted summary judgment for appellees because chg claims are barred by res judicata.finding no error,we affirm.
to make a long and already story,somewhat summarize the relevant facts.chg filed for bankruptcy in february.chg primary asset,commercial property in the district of columbia,was embroiled in a zoning dispute with the district department of consumer and regulatory affairs regarding the amount of parking required.the controversy continued during the bankruptcy proceedings and shaw pittman,chg bankruptcy counsel,represented chg in the zoning process.
initially chg was told it would have to provide parking spaces,but in march the zoning administrator decided spaces would suffice.in january,after a neighborhood association appealed,the board of zoning adjustment bza affirmed,but then decided to reconsider its ruling.on february,the bza finally settled on a total of spaces,an announcement it made orally.the ruling was not issued in written form until september,at which time it was transmitted by the bza to shaw pittman,but not to chg itself.according to chg,such an expansive parking requirement effectively precludes chg from either utilizing a substantial portion of the property itself,or leasing it to others.
in the interim the bankruptcy court granted shaw pittman request to terminate its representation of chg.shaw pittman returned its files to chg but did not tell the bza it had stopped representing chg.as a courtesy,shaw pittman informed chg of the bza decision to reconsider its favorable january ruling at a hearing to take place on february a shaw pittman attorney gleaned while present at the bza on other business.
chg and shaw pittman relations were rocky.chg first complained that shaw pittman fees were unreasonable.after contested hearings,the bankruptcy judge granted summary judgment to shaw pittman and awarded the firm fees based primarily on its conclusion that chg had agreed not to contest the amount of the fees.the bankruptcy judge also made oral findings that shaw pittman services were professional and that shaw pittman deserved to be compensated for those services.capitol hill group pillsbury winthrop shaw pittman,llp,d.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court decision.in re capitol hill group.
shaw pittman then filed an application for fees and costs incurred during the first fee dispute.after a trial on october and,the bankruptcy judge orally ruled that chg was responsible for paying all fees and expenses that were reasonably foreseeable as a result of engaging in the fee litigation with shaw pittman.nevertheless,the cycle of acrimony continued.after a trial on a third fee application on august,the bankruptcy court approved the application.the court later entered a fourth and a fifth fee judgment with the consent of chg.on april,the parties made one final appearance before the bankruptcy court,after shaw pittman filed a motion to compel because it feared chg was withholding further claims.the bankruptcy court specifically asked chg whether it had any other claims against the firm.chg counsel stated t here are concerns that chg has about the representation that shaw pittman provided during its representation of capitol hill group that began in or whatever.but nothing been filed.chg also represented it had no outstanding claims against shaw pittman arising out of the bankruptcy proceedings.capitol hill group,d at.in addition,t he bankruptcy court noted that chg could have pursued malpractice claims against shaw pittman regarding the adequacy of its representation,in addition to claims chg had made about excessive fees and related professional misconduct,but that it had failed to do so and would therefore be barred from later asserting such claims by the doctrine of res judicata.id.
in this suit,chg alleges shaw pittman committed malpractice in two respects by failing to notify chg when bza issued the september order,and by failing to make a particular legal argument to the bza.shaw pittman removed the case to federal court.the district court concluded it had jurisdiction,and granted summary judgment for appellees because chg claims are barred by res judicata.
we have jurisdiction under from the final order of the district court granting summary judgment for defendants.after such a final order,the district court earlier denial of the motion to remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction also is reviewable.see geruschat ernst young llp in re seven fields dev,cir see also charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure ed.we review the district court legal conclusions regarding subject matter jurisdiction,including a denial of a motion to remand,de novo,vill.of depue exxon mobil,cir.and,of course,we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo as well,woodruff peters.
chg insists the district court erred in exercising jurisdiction over this case under b,which provides the district courts shall have original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all civil proceedings arising under title,or arising in or related to cases under title.p roceedings or claims arising in title are those that are not based on any right expressly created by title,but nevertheless,would have no existence outside of the bankruptcy.grausz englander,cir internal quotations omitted.
in concluding it had arising in jurisdiction,the district court principally relied on two cases southmark coopers lybrand in re southmark,cir and geruschat.each holds there is federal bankruptcy jurisdiction over malpractice claims brought by debtors against professionals arising while the professionals assisted the debtor and the court during the bankruptcy process.southmark,at geruschat,at.as the fifth circuit observed,a sine qua non in restructuring the relationship is the court ability to police the fiduciaries,including professionals,who are responsible for managing the debtor estate in the best interest of creditors.southmark,at.after all,t he bankruptcy court must be able to assure itself and the creditors who rely on the process that managers of the debtor estate are performing their work,conscientiously and.id.moreover,e xcessive professional fees or fees charged for mediocre or,worse,phantom work also cause the estate and the creditors to suffer.id.
appellant argues that claims arising and are outside the arising in jurisdiction of the court,citing valley historic limited partnership bank of new york,cir,and community bank of homestead boone in re boone,cir.rejecting a similar argument,the fifth circuit in southmark corporation specifically distinguished cases not implicating a malpractice claim involving professionals but rather involving claims that could stand alone from the bankruptcy case.at.the two cases appellant cites are distinguishable for the same reason.the claim at issue in community bank of homestead was not a malpractice claim against professionals involved in the bankruptcy proceeding but rather was against a bank that allegedly had tortiously interfered with the sale of the debtors house.at.in valley historic limited partnership,similarly,the claims at issue were not against bankruptcy professionals,but rather were tort claims against the bank that held the mortgage on the corporate debtor real estate assets.at.
in sum,we agree with our sister circuits that malpractice claims against professionals stemming from services provided in the bankruptcy proceeding are inseparable from the bankruptcy context,southmark,at,and constitute a proceeding arising in the bankruptcy,geruschat,at.such claims therefore fall within the bankruptcy jurisdiction of the federal courts.
chg argues res judicata should not bar it from pressing its malpractice claims
