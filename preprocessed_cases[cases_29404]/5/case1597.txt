in march,willard filed a verified petition for a peremptory writ of mandate to challenge,as contrary to law,the ballot designation proposed by candidate and real party in interest,eric woolery,that has been approved,accepted and will be printed on official sample ballots by respondent neal kelley in his official capacity as the registrar of voters for the county of orange in connection with the june,primary election,unless the requested relief is granted.some capitalization omitted.the petition asserted woolery ballot designation inaccurately stated that his occupation was orange.
the petition alleged orange is most definitely not woolery principal occupation as the designation requires and that his true principal occupation is deputy director of administration for the riverside county district attorney office as plainly listed on his resume and application for the position of orange county auditor controller.the petition further alleged,b ecause orange is not woolery true principal occupation,kelley is prohibited from accepting woolery candidate statement and is required to reject the ballot designation as unacceptable pursuant to california election code b,california code of regulations and california code of regulations.underscoring omitted.
the trial court denied the petition.the minute order explained the court ruling as follows the evidence is undisputed that woolery was appointed to the position of treasurer of the city of orange in and that he is still serving in that position.citation.it also is undisputed that woolery spends approximately hours per week fulfilling the duties of that office.citation.because this amount of weekly work is more than nominal as that term is used in ccr b,it is an activity which is one of the primary,main or leading professional,vocational or occupational endeavors of the candidate.citation.thus,woolery position of orange treasurer qualifies as a principal occupation under election code a.the fact that woolery may have another job that also is a primary occupation and requires him to work longer hours per week is his main source of income does not preclude the orange treasurer designation under the applicable statute and regulations.citations.accordingly,because petitioner has not established by clear and convincing proof that the designation of orange is misleading,the request for a writ is denied.judgment was entered in woolery favor.our record does not show willard appealed from the judgment.
