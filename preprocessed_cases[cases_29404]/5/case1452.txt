background 
old reliable is the assignee of patent the patent,which is directed toward insulated roof board.independent claim of the patent provides 
a composite insulated roof board structure comprising 
a an insulated roof board member comprising a main portion of rigid coherent solid insulating material,and a top portion comprising a plurality of spaced blocks above said main portion and integral therewith,said blocks defining therebetween a network of interconnected channels at the same level for horizontal venting of water vapor and 
b a relatively hard,dense protective top layer which is adhered to the tops of the blocks of said insulated roof board member.
cornell,a wisconsin roof manufacturer,produces several different insulated roofing products.its thermacal consists of a bottom layer of polyisocyanurate insulation,a layer of paper felt facing bonded to the insulation,spaced blocks on top of the felt facing,and a top layer of oriented strand board osb.its thermacal consists of a bottom layer of polyisocyanurate insulation,a layer of osb,spaced blocks on top of the layer of osb,and an additional layer of osb on top of the blocks.
in,old reliable filed an infringement action against cornell,asserting that the product infringed claims,and of the patent.in response,cornell argued that the patent was invalid because it was anticipated by its product,which was sold before the critical date for the patent.cornell further asserted that the patent was anticipated,or rendered obvious,by several other prior art references,including the insulated roofing panel manufactured by branch river foam plastics,branch river.
old reliable,however,argued that the did not anticipate the patent because it did not teach all of the structural elements required by the asserted claims.specifically,old reliable asserted that because the contained a layer of osb between the insulation and the spaced blocks,the blocks were not integral with the main portion of insulating material.see patent,requiring a top portion comprising a plurality of spaced blocks above said main portion and integral therewith emphasis added.old reliable further contended that the product was not anticipatory prior art because it did not disclose blocks that define interconnected channels as required by the asserted claims and did not allow for.
in september,cornell deposed anthony crookston,old reliable founder and the named inventor on the patent.crookston stated that the inventsaboard the commercial embodiment of the patent,the the accused product and the the product alleged to anticipate did e xactly the same thing.cornell also produced literature indicating that the branch river airflo product had channels that could be provided in either direction to suit particular roofing requirements.
in a march,deposition,james rice,old reliable expert,acknowledged that if the product had been manufactured with it would have been identical to the invention claimed in the patent.furthermore,richard dauphinais,a branch river employee,testified that branch river filled an order in which it had cut into its product prior to the patent critical date.
in december,the district court issued a claim construction order,construing the term integral to mean formed with or joined to and the term adhered to mean attached.in march,the trial court granted cornell motion for summary judgment of patent invalidity,concluding that the product was anticipatory prior art.although the court acknowledged that the contained a layer of osb between the insulation and the spaced blocks,it determined that the spaced blocks were nonetheless integral with the main portion of insulating material as required by the asserted claims.old reliable wholesale,cornell,dist.lexis,at,invalidity decision.

discussion 
a district court is vested with authority to award attorney fees to a prevailing party in patent litigation if it determines that the case is exceptional.while the discretion granted to a trial court under section is broad,it is not unbridled.see wedgetail,huddleston deluxe,noting that only a limited universe of circumstances warrant a finding of exceptionality in a patent case forest,abbott,emphasizing that section is limited to cases where the award of fees is necessary to prevent a gross injustice citations and internal quotation marks omitted cambridge,penn nutrients,t he exceptional nature of the case must be established by clear and convincing evidence.in view of the substantial economic and reputational impact of an award of attorney fees,this court is required to examine the record with care to determine whether the trial court has committed clear error in holding the case exceptional or has abused its discretion with respect to the fee award.medtronic navigation,brainlab medizinische computersysteme gmbh.
absent misconduct in conduct of the litigation or in securing the patent,sanctions may be imposed against the patentee only if both the litigation is brought in subjective bad faith,and the litigation is objectively baseless.brooks furniture,dutailier int l.the standard for establishing that a claim is objectively baseless under section is identical to the objective recklessness standard for enhanced damages and attorneys fees against an accused infringer for willful infringement actions under in re seagate technology,llc,en banc.ilor,llc google.lexis,at.thus,objective baselessness depends not on the state of mind of the party against whom fees are sought,see seagate,at,but instead on an objective assessment of the merits of the challenged claims and defenses.ilor.lexis,at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.unless an argument or claim asserted in the course of litigation is so unreasonable that no reasonable litigant could believe it would succeed,it can not be deemed objectively baseless for purposes of awarding attorney fees under section.see also dominant semiconductors sdn.osram gmbh.
while old reliable arguments in support of the validity of the patent proved unsuccessful,we conclude that the exacting standard for establishing that a case is exceptional under section,ilor.lexis,at,has not been met.old reliable had reasonable grounds for its argument that the patent was valid over the prior art,even following inventor testimony that the prior art product and the commercial embodiment of the patent did e xactly the same thing.likewise,because there was a genuine dispute regarding whether the branch river product allowed for the disclosed in the patent,old reliable had a legitimate basis for its contention that the product was not anticipatory prior art.finally,given that the pto,after reviewing the relevant prior art,issued a notice of intent to issue an ex parte reexamination certificate confirming the patentability of all claims of the patent,we are unwilling to conclude that old reliable lacked a reasonable foundation for arguing that its patent was not anticipated.
i.the crookston deposition 
the linchpin for the district court award of attorney fees was its determination that old reliable had no reasonable basis for maintaining its infringement action following the september,crookston deposition.in the court view,old reliable may have had some basis for its contention that the product did not anticipate the patent prior to the deposition,but when crookston testified that cornell prior art product did e xactly the same thing as the commercial embodiment of the patent,it was apparent that the patent was anticipated and any further action against cornell for infringement was baseless.attorney fees decision,dist.lexis,at emphasis omitted footnote and internal quotation marks omitted.
we disagree.anticipation requires that all of the claim elements and their limitations are shown in a single prior art reference.in re skvorecz,see also advanced display,kent state,explaining that invalidity by anticipation requires that the four corners of a single,prior art document describe every element of the claimed invention,either expressly or inherently.regardless of whether the and the commercial embodiment of the patent did e xactly the same thing,there could be no anticipation unless the disclosed,either expressly or inherently,all the structural limitations contained in the asserted apparatus claims.see skvorecz,at explaining that a prior art device did not anticipate because it did not contain the offset structure disclosed in the asserted claims applied med.res.united states surgical,emphasizing that a prior art device does not anticipate simply by possessing identically named parts,unless these parts also have the same structure or otherwise satisfy the claim limitations in re ruskin,ccpa even where a prior art device is the functional equivalent of a patented product,it does not anticipate unless it discloses the structure required by the asserted claims.because old reliable pointed to alleged structural differences between the and the commercial embodiment of the patent,it was not required to concede that its patent was anticipated even following inventor testimony that the two products were functionally equivalent 
ii.distinguishing the and products 
where a patent is granted in a field of invention abundant with prior art,a patentee will sometimes find it difficult to establish that his patent is broad enough to cover an accused product,yet narrow enough to evade the strictures of a crowded art field.augustine,gaymar.as the district court correctly recognized,old reliable faced significant challenges in its effort to establish that the patent was not anticipated by the product,but was nonetheless infringed by the product.see invalidity decision,dist.lexis,at.
independent claim of the patent requires a main portion of solid insulating material and a top portion comprised of a plurality of spaced blocks that is above the insulation layer and integral therewith.patent.in the prior art product,the foam insulation layer is separated from the spaced blocks by a layer of osb.in the accused product,by contrast,the foam insulation layer is separated from the spaced blocks by a layer of felt facing.old reliable argued that the did not anticipate the patent because,due to the layer of osb between the insulation and the spaced blocks,the blocks were not integral with the main portion of insulating material as required by the asserted claims.in order to establish infringement,however,old reliable argued that in the product the spaced blocks were integral with the main portion of insulating material,notwithstanding the fact that the blocks were separated from the insulating material by a layer of felt facing.
the district court concluded that old reliable was trying to have it both ways in order to preserve its infringement claim against the product and avoid invalidating the patent based on the prior art of the product.invalidity decision,dist.lexis,at.rejecting what it perceived as the inconsistent positions taken by old reliable,the court determined that the spaced blocks were integral with the insulation layer in both the and the products.id.
we can not agree,however,that old reliable argument that the spaced blocks were integral with the main portion of insulating material in the,but not in the,was objectively meritless.see aspex eyewear clariti eyewear,explaining that d efeat of a litigation position,even on summary judgment,does not warrant an automatic finding that the suit was objectively baseless.there was nothing frivolous or inherently implausible about old reliable assertion that,from a physical standpoint,separating the insulation from the spaced blocks by a thin layer of felt facing is different than separating the insulation from the blocks with a bulky layer of osb.as old reliable explained,unlike felt facing,which is flexible,the osb is inflexible and a separate structural component that does not conform to and form part of the insulating material.invalidity decision,dist.lexis,at internal quotation marks omitted.indeed,cornell own material safety data sheet msds indicated that the felt facer was part of the polyisocyanurate foam insulation,but that the osb was a separate structural component from the insulation layer 
furthermore,although cornell had been selling its product for several years before it introduced the,the quickly surpassed the in terms of sales.the undisputed commercial success of the provided a legitimate basis for old reliable assertion that secondary considerations weighed against any finding that the patent was invalid over the prior art.see geo martin alliance mach.int l llc,secondary considerations of
