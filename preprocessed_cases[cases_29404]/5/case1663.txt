factual and procedural background 
mclean and huth lease agreement with zintel 
mclean and huth have lived in units g and h of an apartment building at north palm drive in beverly hills for more than years.there is a doorway through a closet that connects the two units.
mclean and huth have never paid more than a total of per month for both units under local rent control ordinances.robert jonker fisher,who lived in new york,became the sole owner of the property in.mclean served as building manager and signed leases on behalf of fisher,who never traveled to beverly hills to visit the property.
the lease at issue in the litigation provided for the rental of units g and h for per month from may to may.mclean maintained she told fisher about the lease and he responded,okay.mclean then signed as both landlord and tenant huth also signed as tenant.the lease agreement includes an attorney fee provision stating in part,in the event action is brought by any party to enforce any term of this agreement or to recover possession of the premises,the prevailing party shall recover from the other party reasonable attorney fees.fisher terminated mclean as building manager in july but she remained a tenant,and her rent was accepted without incident.
fisher died in august.in,following extended probate proceedings,fisher widow took ownership of the property as the sole member of zintel.before that occurred,however,zintel had instructed the new building manager to accept mclean monthly rental payments.mclean rent checks were consistently cashed through.
from january to july zintel served mclean with inspection notices for her apartment.additionally,the building manager and the property management company sent mclean letters requesting she switch parking spots.mclean retained her original parking spot,and the matter was not pursued.on july,zintel served mclean and huth with a day notice to quit and a day notice to cure covenants or quit demanding the door connecting the two units be removed.those notices were later withdrawn.
zintel complaint and mclean 
on july,zintel sued mclean and huth seeking declaratory relief and equitable reformation of the lease agreement.the complaint alleged the fair market monthly rental value of the units was approximately.as the basis for relief,zintel alleged the lease violated the statute of frauds,was executed without fisher authorization and had been fraudulently backdated so it would appear to have been signed while mclean was still managing the property.zintel also alleged mclean had no authority to combine units g and h.the complaint requested a declaration of the parties respective rights under the lease and reformation of the lease,if not found to be void,to reflect a fair and equitable rental rate.
mclean two months later,alleging causes of action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment,elder abuse and intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress.the alleged the inspections and day notices constituted harassment and represented zintel attempts to force mclean to move out.mclean sought monetary damages on all causes of action.
the trial court orders granting summary judgment in favor of mclean and huth on the complaint and zintel on the 
on february,mclean and huth moved for summary judgment on zintel complaint.citing zintel admission it had accepted per month for the two units pursuant to the lease agreement for three years,mclean and huth argued zintel was estopped from asserting the lease agreement was void.
the following week zintel moved for summary judgment on mclean.zintel argued the notices it had sent were either minor inconveniences or had been withdrawn before any action was necessary and,therefore,not a basis for liability under any of the theories alleged.zintel further contended any communications to mclean requesting she change parking spaces did not rise to a level of actionable harassment in addition,the matter was subsequently abandoned.
after the filing of opposition and reply memoranda,the parties stipulated to adopt the court tentative ruling in its entirety granting both mclean and huth motion for summary judgment on the complaint and zintel motion for summary judgment as to mclean.accordingly,no hearing was held on the motions.
with respect to mclean and huth motion,the court ruled,even if the lease violated the statute of frauds,the doctrines of equitable estoppel and part performance precluded a finding it was void because zintel had known of the lease and accepted rent for both units from to.the court also concluded invalidating the lease would lead to an unconscionable result for mclean and huth while only marginally benefitting zintel since there was only one year remaining on the lease term.
with respect to the,the court ruled there was no evidence of constructive or actual eviction to support a cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment.the court further concluded there was no evidence mclean had been denied a property right qualifying as elder abuse or subjected to outrageous behavior constituting intentional infliction of emotional distress because zintel actions were within its statutory and contractual rights as a landlord.the court also found no evidence of a breach of duty to support a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress.
the trial court orders and judgment awarding mclean and huth costs as prevailing parties but denying their motion for attorney fees 
after filing the stipulation to adopt the court tentative rulings on the summary judgment motions,counsel for mclean and huth submitted a proposed judgment that included provisions for an award to them of costs and recovery of their reasonable attorney fees.zintel objected to these two portions of the proposed judgment,noting it was the prevailing party on the.accordingly,zintel argued mclean and huth were entitled only to an award of costs under section with respect to the complaint zintel was entitled to costs relating to the.zintel provided authority for the court discretion to apportion costs between the parties.as to attorney fees,zintel argued mclean and huth were required to file a formal motion before any recovery of fees was permissible.
the court prepared and filed its own form of judgment in favor of mclean and huth and against zintel on the complaint and in favor of zintel and against mclean on the.in its judgment,filed may,the court provided mclean and huth were to recover costs in an amount to be determined following the filing of a memorandum of costs pursuant to california rules of court,rule.the court explained,when relief is denied on both plaintiff complaint and defendant,defendant is deemed the prevailing party pursuant to ccp section a.with respect to the request for attorney fees,the court found there was no prevailing party under civil code section because neither party obtained relief.citation.no party is to recover attorneys fees.
mclean and huth moved to vacate the may,judgment,contending it was entitled to have the issue of attorney fees under section resolved following a noticed motion and hearing.shortly thereafter mclean and huth moved for an award of attorney fees,arguing mclean was a prevailing party even though her had been unsuccessful because she achieved her main litigation objective remaining in the apartment pursuant to the challenged lease and huth,who was not a party to the,had been fully successful in the lawsuit as it related to him.they asserted a total of in fees had been incurred on behalf of both mclean and huth that is,in defending against the complaint and prosecuting the with either based on the proportion of fees or based on itemization of billing entries incurred in the defense against zintel complaint.
in its opposition to the attorney fee motion zintel argued the trial court had discretion to find mclean was not a prevailing party because she did not achieve a complete victory and the outcome was a draw.zintel also argued huth rights under the lease were derivative of his mother and,given their close relationship,the court properly found he was not a prevailing party.additionally,zintel contended if huth was a prevailing party,the amount of fees requested the full amount attributable to defending against the complaint was arbitrary and unreasonable.
the trial court granted the motion to vacate entry of judgment to the extent the judgment had determined the parties rights to attorney fees pursuant to section and denied the motion for attorney fees.as to mclean,the court found she was not a prevailing party because she did not attain her primary litigation objectives as no decision had been made regarding the substantive validity of her lease.in addition,her unsuccessful sought substantially more than vindication of her tenancy under the lease and,therefore,was not simply defensive.the court also decided,given the identical defenses asserted and identical counsel the unity of interest between huth and mclean prevented a finding that huth was a prevailing party.the court further stated,even if huth were determined to be the prevailing party,a ruling that he is entitled to recover all fees defending against the complaint would be to elevate form over substance defense counsel has failed to specifically apportion those fees spent solely defending huth against plaintiff claims,versus mclean.
the final form of judgment entered by the court on july,awarded mclean and huth costs pursuant to section,subdivision a,in the amount of and no attorney fees.mclean and huth filed a timely notice of appeal challenging the denial of attorney fees.
discussion 
the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining mclean was not a prevailing party 
section,subdivision a,expressly defines prevailing party for purposes of a statutory award of costs to include a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief.in building maintenance service ail systems.th,d,we held this definition of prevailing party includes a litigant in mclean situation a defendant who defeats the plaintiff claim on a complaint,but who recovers nothing on his or her against the plaintiff,is nevertheless a prevailing party entitled to costs.accord,mclarand,vasquez partners,downey savings loan d.when neither the plaintiff nor the defendant who has filed a prevails,the defendant is the prevailing party entitled to costs a defendant in this context does not include the plaintiff as a see schrader neville cal d.zintel has not challenged on appeal mclean entitlement to costs other than attorney fees under section,subdivision a.
although mclean was properly found to be the prevailing party under section,c ourts have consistently held the prevailing party for the award of costs under section is not necessarily the prevailing party for the award of attorney fees in contract actions under section.sears baccaglio th,d see goodman lozano cal th,fn,d,noting differences in definition of prevailing party in the two statutes pnec meyer th,fn,d prevailing party inquiries under and are distinct.thus,as the trial court recognized,its finding mclean was the prevailing party under section,although a necessary prerequisite for an award of attorney fees as costs see code civ,subd.a attorney fees allowable as costs when authorized by contract,statute or law,was not determinative of whether she was also the prevailing party entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees in addition to other costs under the lease agreement and section 
section,subdivision b,provides,t he party prevailing on the contract shall be the party who recovered a greater relief in the action on the contract.the court may also determine that there is no party prevailing on the contract.the trial court has broad discretion in making this determination.see ajaxo e trade group,th,d trial court has wide discretion in determining which party has prevailed on a contract w e will not disturb such a determination on appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion silver creek,llc blackrock realty advisors,th,d a lthough trial court has broad discretion to determine the prevailing party in mixed result case,its discretion is not unlimited.however,when the judgment is a simple,unqualified win for one party on the only contract claims presented,the trial court has no discretion to deny an attorney fee award to that party under section.hsu abbara cal th,d,hsu.
both zintel complaint and mclean for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment involved claims expressly based on the lease agreement.there was no absolute or complete winner between those two litigants.accordingly,the court was obligated to determine whether there was a prevailing party under section i n deciding whether there is a party prevailing on the contract,the trial court is to compare the relief awarded on the contract claim or claims with the parties demands on those same claims and their litigation objectives as disclosed by the pleadings,trial briefs,opening statements,and similar sources.the prevailing party determination is to be made only upon final resolution of the contract claims and only by a comparison of the extent to which each party ha s succeeded and failed to succeed in its contentions.hsu,supra,cal th at,d.where neither party achieves a complete victory,the trial court has discretion to determine which party prevailed on the contract or whether,on balance,neither party prevailed sufficiently to justify an award of attorney fees.scott blount,cal th,d.
mclean contends the trial court abused its discretion in finding no prevailing party because,while she may have recovered nothing on her,she successfully defeated the two contract claims in zintel complaint and therefore attained greater relief.she also insists her was essentially defensive,a tactical aspect of her response to zintel contract claims,which she defeated at summary judgment.see hsu,supra,cal th at,d,fn.when there are on a contract containing an attorney fees provision,and no relief is awarded in either action,a trial court is not obligated to find that there is no prevailing party on the contract for purposes of section.if the court concludes that the defendant against the plaintiff was essentially defensive in nature,it may properly find the defendant to be the party prevailing on the contract.mclean sought monetary damages unrelated to the complaint,expanded discovery and led to substantial briefing.given the nature of the and the affirmative relief it sought and the mixed results obtained by mclean in the litigation,the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining mclean was not a prevailing party.see mclarand,vasquez partners,downey savings loan,supra,d at.no abuse of discretion where trial court apparently concluded that fairness dictated each side should pay its own attorneys fees.
the trial court erred in determining huth was not a prevailing party entitled to an award of contractual attorney fees 
w hen a defendant defeats recovery by the plaintiff on the only contract claim in the action,the defendant is the party prevailing on the contract under section as a matter of law.hsu,supra,cal th at,d.huth contends his complete defeat of zintel complaint entitled him to a prevailing party designation and the trial court had no discretion to determine he was not the prevailing party and deny his request for attorney fees based on the unity of interest between him and his mother we agree.see goodman lozano,supra,cal th at,d,u nless otherwise provided by statute,a prevailing party is entitled to recover costs in any act
