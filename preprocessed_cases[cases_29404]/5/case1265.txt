in,the ftc filed a motion to show cause why the defendants should not be found in contempt of the permanent injunction and requested that the district court award million in contempt sanctions.all of the defendants moved to dismiss on due process grounds,and the senior kuykendalls separately filed a motion to dismiss claiming a lack of personal liability.the senior kuykendalls argued that they played no role in the management of the corporations during the period of the alleged contempt and therefore could not be held liable for violating the permanent injunction.after an evidentiary hearing,the district court denied the senior kuykendalls motion,ruled in the ftc favor as to liability,and held each of the defendants jointly and severally liable for million.en banc opinion,at.
the defendants appealed the district court ruling on a variety of grounds including an individual appeal by the senior kuykendalls arguing that the district court erred by denying their motion to be dismissed from the contempt proceedings.a panel of this court affirmed the district court findings that all of the defendants were liable,but remanded for further proceedings as to the amount of damages awarded.see panel opinion,at.this court granted rehearing en banc,vacated the panel opinion,and reversed the district court judgment as to the senior kuykendalls liability,but upheld the district court finding of liability as to kuykendall,and one of the corporate defendants.see en banc opinion,at.

ii.discussion 
a.the district court properly denied the motion for attorney fees 
under the american rule,the prevailing party in civil litigation may not collect attorney fees from the loser.united states mccall,cir.in certain rare circumstances,however,an exception to this rule is applied when a party opponent is found to have acted in bad faith,vexatiously,wantonly,or for oppressive reasons.id.quotation omitted.this bad faith exception to the american rule applies to the government pursuant to b,which states that the united states is liable for attorney fees to the same extent that any other party would be liable under the common law.b.in order to fall within the exceedingly narrow bad faith exception to the general rule,there must be clear evidence that the challenged claim is entirely without color and has been asserted wantonly,for purposes of harassment or delay,or for other improper reasons.freecom commc ns,cir.because a fee award under b is punitive,it requires more than a showing of a weak or legally inadequate case,and is only appropriate in exceptional cases and for dominating reasons of justice.united states boxes of boned beef,cir.
whether the bad faith exception applies turns on the party subjective bad faith.sterling energy friendly bank,cir.a district court determination as to whether a party has acted in bad faith is a finding of fact that we review for clear error.bergman united states,cir eng rs,united states,cir int l union of petroleum and indus.workers indus,cir.finally,we review a district court denial of attorney fees for an abuse of discretion.boxes of boned beef,at.
the district court did not make any findings as to the first prong of the bad faith the ftc claim was it concluded that the senior kuykendalls had failed to present any evidence that the ftc claims were brought for an improper purpose.the senior kuykendalls argument on appeal relies on statements made in our en banc opinion to support their claim of bad faith.specifically,they highlight that this court found that the ftc failed to introduce any evidence to support a finding that the senior kuykendalls could be held personally liable for the challenged conduct.see en banc opinion,at.
even if we were to accept the senior kuykendalls contention that the claim against them was colorless,that fact alone would not support taxation of fees on the ftc the test for bad faith is requires clear evidence of both a complete lack of color and an improper purpose on the part of the government.see freecom,at.our statements regarding the factual inadequacies in the ftc case do not shed light on whether the ftc subjectively acted with an improper purpose.in fact,there is no evidence to suggest as much.
the senior kuykendalls argue,however,that the case against them was so deficient as to give rise to an inference that the claim was motivated by an improper purpose.see sterling energy,at stating that a case can be so frivolous as to reflect impermissible conduct.the district court found that such a finding was not warranted in this case because there was a dearth of other evidence to suggest that the ftc brought the claims for any improper reason.indeed,bad faith requires more than a mere showing of a weak or legally inadequate case,and the exception is not invoked by findings of negligence,frivolity,or improvidence.schuchmann,cir.
finally,the senior kuykendalls point out that this court,in questioning why the ftc waited approximately five years before filing the contempt action,suggested that the ftc conduct raises questions about its bona fides.en banc opinion,at.as the district court noted,however,this observation was made with regard to the timing of the ftc actions against all the defendants some of whom were properly held liable and does not provide clear evidence,see freecom,at,that the action against the senior kuykendalls was motivated by an improper purpose.accordingly,the district court factual determination that the ftc did not pursue its action against the senior kuykendalls in bad faith is not clearly erroneous.clearly,then,the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the senior kuykendalls recovery of attorney fees.
