these appeals arise out of an incident on february,involving plaintiff phaly poy in an arrest,a scuffle with a lowell,massachusetts,police officer,defendant boutselis,a booking at the police station,and emergency hospital treatment for a laceration.plaintiff was charged with several offenses,including disturbing the peace and assault and battery.after being acquitted by a jury,he brought suit on february,against boutselis and another officer present at the scene,conroy,and the lowell chief of police,davis,as well as the city of lowell,citing,and a variety of state claims.also included as a defendant was one neov,owner of the premises where the incident occurred and the temporary employer of boutselis.
after denial of a motion to dismiss on statute of limitations grounds,a seven day jury trial in resulted in a verdict for plaintiff against defendant boutselis in his personal capacity,granting him to compensate for the use of excessive force,to compensate for severe emotional distress,and in punitive damages.in addition,the court allowed prejudgment interest in the amount of.all other claims against all parties were dismissed.post trial,the district court denied boutselis motion for new trial and declined to award any counsel fees to any party.
both plaintiff and boutselis have appealed.boutselis has challenged the rejection of his statute of limitations defense,the denial of his motion for a new trial,and denial of defendant conroy motion for attorney fees.poy appeals from the court refusal to award him attorney fees and costs.we affirm the court rulings as to boutselis and conroy we vacate the court orders denying poy motions for attorney fees and costs and remand for reconsideration in light of this opinion.
we first describe the incident giving rise to these cases,giving the version of facts and inferences favorable to poy.we then discuss boutselis appeal,following with our deliberations as to poy appeal.
i.the incident 
at about on february,poy,a man of cambodian origin,and three friends went to a club,the golden swan,and proceeded along a hallway to a dance or function room.barred from entering by a doorman,poy looked inside to see if he knew anyone there.soon officer boutselis,specially employed by the club owner neov,approached poy,telling him in abusive language to leave before i fucking pound your fucking head.as poy was peacefully leaving,boutselis pushed him from behind.poy fell on the floor.boutselis,six feet tall and weighing pounds,sat on him,struck him above his right eye,and handcuffed his hands behind him,the right hand being brought over his shoulder and the left hand being drawn across his back and up.two of poy friends testified that boutselis,using the handcuffs as brass knuckles,repeatedly hit poy on the head.
poy was dragged to a police van and taken to the police station,helped by a policewoman to sign his name,and was charged with four counts disorderly conduct assault and battery on a police officer assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and resisting arrest.he was then taken to a hospital where he received five stitches to close a laceration over his right eye,leaving a scar observed by the jury.he returned to the police station where he remained for a number of hours until he was bailed.poy testified that he felt pain lasting some two months in his shoulder,back,wrist,and head,and had difficulty sleeping and eating.
the above account is diametrically contradicted by the testimony of officer boutselis at every critical,resistance,efforts to subdue,and extent of injury.but the jury was not required to accept his version.
ii.appeal of boutselis 
statute of limitations 
boutselis argues that poy suit,filed on the third anniversary of the key events,was one day late.boutselis urges us to reject both.civ.a and.a by counting the limitations period of three years inclusive of the date of accrual so that the final day for bringing suit would fall one day before the third anniversary.it is an argument which upon analysis reveals less than meets the eye.
the argument begins with the recitation of propositions accepted by both parties a claim,according to,borrows the appropriate state law governing limitations unless contrary to federal law,wilson garcia,d since the claims against boutselis were for the use of excessive force,assault,battery,the limitations period for personal injury is the appropriate analogue,id.at the massachusetts statute governing personal injury claims is.laws ch,providing that actions shall be commenced within three years next after the cause of action accrues.federal law controls the determination of when the cause of action accrues,cir.both federal and massachusetts law agree that a claim accrues when a plaintiff knows or has reason to know of his injury.see nieves mcsweeney,cir riley presnell.massachusetts begins counting on the day following the day of the incident,with the last day for filing suit being the anniversary date of the event,in accordance with.civ.a.see ciampa january.div.we refer to rule a as the massachusetts application rule.
at this point,appellant advances two parallel support of his contention that the claim is time barred.
first,boutselis argues that while we may borrow the limitations period in.laws ch,we are prohibited from borrowing the application rule in.civ.a.under boutselis reading of precedent,borrowing the massachusetts application rule contradicts the supreme court directive in west conrail,d,which advised federal courts that if a state statute of limitations must be borrowed for a federal cause of action,the court is to borrow no more than necessary.second,even if we were permitted to borrow the state rule of application,boutselis maintains that massachusetts utilizes a different application rule for claims than for those arising under state law.
with respect to his first we may not borrow the massachusetts application attempts to derail as precedent our opinion in,cir,but in doing so contradicts the supreme court decision in wilson,at,which holds that the length of the limitations period,and closely related questions of tolling and application,are to be governed by state law.in carreras,we recognized wilson teaching and looked to a puerto rico statute and a ruling of the puerto rico supreme court to determine the timeliness of a action.see carreras,at.boutselis suggests,however,that this holding encompasses only those instances in which a state statute,rather than a rule of procedure,sets forth the application rule in advancing this pained distinction,he also ignores our disagreement in carreras with dicta equating the date of accrual with the first day of the limitations period,id.at.
boutselis second argument urges us to hold that massachusetts uses a different rule of application for claims than for claims arising under state law.boutselis concedes that massachusetts generally excludes the accrual date in calculating the limitations period of tort claims,see ciampa.div.at,but he maintains that under pagliuca city of boston,the statute of limitations for claims begins running on and therefore is inclusive of the date of the wrongful acts.in pagliuca,the court was dealing with the question of whether a action accrues on the date of the wrongful acts or a later date when the effects of the acts were felt.its decision about the beginning and ending dates of the limitations period cited no massachusetts authority and relied solely on our decision in altair pesquera de busquets,cir.we specifically abrogated altair in carreras,at,borrowing instead the puerto rico law which calculated the limitations period exclusive of the date of accrual.
most importantly,boutselis ignores the strong indication of a beginning date in the next after language of.laws ch.as well as longstanding massachusetts precedent excluding the date of accrual from the calculation of the limitations period.see pierce tiernan,interpreting prior.laws.ch,which contained the same next after language as the current.laws.ch,to mean that in computing the limit of time,the day upon which the cause of action accrued is to be excluded see also bemis leonard,in this commonwealth,the general rule,as applied in a variety of circumstances,and now well established,is,that in computing time from the date the day of the date is to be excluded.
we thus hold that in determining the accrual and limitations period of a claim,we borrow.laws ch,as well as.civ.a.we note also that there can not be any inconsistency with federal law since the rules of the two jurisdictions are identical.see wilson,at.carreras,at.the district court therefore did not err in finding that poy anniversary date filing was timely.
motion for new trial 
in his motion for a new trial,boutselis made one allegation,namely,that the amount of damages for the intentional or reckless infliction of emotional distress and for punitive damages was excessive and the result of prejudice or sympathy.in the memorandum submitted to the district court,the argument widened to an assertion of a complete absence of evidence supporting two jury findings.with reference to the state law claim involving emotional distress,appellant argued that there was no medical or psychiatric evidence,and no testimony from the plaintiff specifically mentioning emotional distress.with reference to the claim for punitive damages,appellant argued that the jury had made a special finding that he,boutselis,had not acted maliciously and sadistically for the purpose of causing harm,that there was no evidence of evil intent,and that the incident was an isolated one.the district court denied the motion,ruling that there was a genuine dispute of fact for decision by the jury.
appellant faces a formidable burden in trying to persuade us to reverse a district judge denial of a motion for new trial.our review of such an issue is extremely circumscribed.correa hospital san francisco,cir.in assessing whether or not there is a reasonable basis for the jury decision,we take both the facts and the reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most hospitable to the jury verdict.id.at.
first of all,both the claims for intentional or reckless infliction of emotional distress and for punitive damages require proof of similarly extreme conduct.the former requires evidence of conduct that is extreme and outrageous.nancy.the latter requires either evidence of evil intent or reckless or callous indifference to the federally protected rights of others.smith wade,d.in this case the jury answered a carefully constructed series of questions.after it had found that boutselis had used excessive physical force,despite an absence of resistance,threats,or attempt to flee on the part of poy,it went on to find that his conduct violated contemporary standards of decency and is repugnant to the conscience of the community,was unnecessarily wanton or excessive,extended beyond the scope of his capacity as a police officer,and took place with reckless disregard for the likelihood that it would cause poy to suffer severe emotional distress.we agree with the district court that at the very least the evidence presented factual questions as to boutselis conduct which could be and were resolved by the jury.
as for the evidence of resulting emotional distress,although there was no medical or psychiatric evidence,there was considerable testimony,not only from plaintiff but from two other witnesses,of the following facts poy was struck repeatedly on his face and back,being knocked to the floor and pinioned by boutselis his hands were locked behind him and handcuffs were used as brass knuckles,striking him repeatedly on the forehead a resulting wound required sutures at a hospital and left visible evidence of a scar which the jury observed the incident was followed by two months of pain in his shoulder,back,wrist,and head.a jury could reasonably infer from such humiliation,long continued pain,and facial disfigurement a condition of severe emotional distress.wagenmann adams,cir upholding compensatory damages of for a incident involving false arrest,bringing of charges,handcuffing,thrusting into police vehicle,arraignment,and a night in a mental hospital,but no physical injury.
on this record,the district court denial of the motion for new trial is far from an abuse of discretion,not to mention a manifest abuse of discretion.joia service,cir.
conroy motion for attorney fees 
in the district court,defendant conroy sought attorney fees on the ground that he was kept in the case long after the claims of plaintiff toeur em,whom he had arrested,had been dismissed.the district court denied the motion.whether or not this decision might have been we do not suggest that it is not before us.the notice of appeal filed by boutselis makes no mention of conroy.lacking any indication that conroy intended to appeal,we find that we have no jurisdiction.fed.app.failure to include this third issue in the notice is fatal to our jurisdiction.lehman revolution portfolio,cir.
iii.appeal of poy 
the question posed by this appeal is whether,on the facts of this case,the district court was within its discretion in denying any attorney fee award at all to poy,although he obtained a verdict and not insignificant money damages against a city police officer.
proceedings below 
the proceedings leading to this appeal involve several hearings.the first was held shortly after the conclusion of the jury trial,on october,to consider motions for attorney fees.poy two attorneys each submitted a motion containing statements totaling some and covering over four and a half years of representation by the senior counsel as well as work in preparation for the recent trial by the junior counsel.the court expressed its reactions that both motions were excessive,commented on what it thought wasteful duplication of lawyer presence and effort by poy team,questioned the apparent inappropriateness of including fees for the pursuit of claims on behalf of the disappearing em and against officer conroy,and heard an argument that poy lawyers records did not appear to be contemporaneous in two specific entries in which conversations with boutselis attorney freda were noted at a time prior to his association with his present firm.the court then set another date for further presentations,giving an opportunity for counsel to amend their affidavits.
poy counsel responded to the court invitation with several submissions.one was from junior counsel miller,affirming that all billing records had been reviewed and a good faith attempt made to locate errors and exclude excessive items.he rehearsed the work performed,principally in discovery,depositions,meeting with plaintiffs,and trial.he asserted that plaintiff em claims and claims against the city of lowell involved the common core of facts and related legal theories deemed legitimate in successful claims by plaintiffs in aubin fudala,cir.finally,he signified his willingness to take a ten percent cut,reducing his request from to.
poy senior attorney,wernick,explained the allocation of work between him,with years experience,and miller,with six,in which discovery matters were handled largely by miller,and depositions largely by wernick.both were in attendance at trial as were the two lawyer teams representing boutselis and the city.attorney wernick also voluntarily reduced his request from to,saying this was a ten percent cut.in reality this would be a cut in excess of percent and is clearly an error a third submission addressed the two entries recording a conversation with boutselis attorney freda at a time prior to his association with his firm.photocopies of the original time records were submitted purporting to show that conversations with an unnamed boutselis attorney had indeed been made on the cited dates.
a second hearing was soon held,on november.in replying to counsel query why the court was not inclined to award any attorney fees to either party,though plaintiff had prevailed against boutselis,the court said,b ecause you prevailed in part,but only in part,and very substantially did not prevail.each of you overclaimed very,very substantially.instead of spending a great deal of time with more submissions and repetitive arguments,the court concluded,i should simply say that since neither of you prevailed in the sense that justifies an award of attorney fees or costs,i w
