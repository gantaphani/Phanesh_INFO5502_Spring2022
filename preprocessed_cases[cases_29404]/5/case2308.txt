the plaintiff,who was injured while riding on an elevator,brought this action in the superior court against two companies that installed and serviced the elevator the millar defendants or millar,and against two companies that owned and managed the building where the elevator was located the delle donne defendants or delle donne.during the pendency of that case and before the trial began,all four defendant companies entered into joint tortfeasor settlements with the plaintiff.that left for resolution only the defendants cross claims against each other for indemnity and contribution.
at the trial on the defendants cross claims,the jury determined inter alia the defendants proportionate liability,finding that the delle donne defendants were liable,and that the millar defendants were liable,for the plaintiff injuries.based on those findings,the trial court determined that the millar defendants were entitled to contractual indemnity of,plus an attorneys fees award of,against delle donne the trial court entered judgment against delle donne in that amount.
delle donne has appealed from the trial court judgment,claiming that no indemnity and attorneys fees should have been awarded to millar.millar has from that portion of the judgment awarding attorneys fees,claiming that after millar settled with the plaintiff,it was contractually entitled to,rather than,of the fees it incurred to recover contractual indemnification from delle donne.
for the reasons set forth herein,we affirm the trial court final order awarding contractual indemnity and attorneys fees to millar.we reverse that portion of the order limiting millar to of the attorneys fees it incurred after may,to recover contractual indemnification from delle donne,however,because we conclude that millar was entitled to recover of those fees.
on july,the plaintiff,cheryl wickes,sustained injuries while riding on an elevator that suddenly dropped and came to an abrupt stop.the elevator on which this incident occurred was installed,serviced,and maintained by millar elevator service company millar,which was an unincorporated division of schindler elevator corporation schindler the building in which the elevator was located was owned by delmont partners,and was managed by delle donne associates collectively delle donne 
on june,plaintiff wickes filed her initial superior court complaint,naming as defendants millar,schindler,and delle donne.wickes later amended her complaint on july,and again on april,to add as additional defendants delmont,and later elevator equipment company,which manufactured a component part of the elevator.
in its answers to the three complaints,millar asserted a cross claim for indemnity,or alternatively for contribution,against delle donne.millar cross claim also sought reimbursement of its expenses,including the reasonable attorneys fees it incurred to defend the lawsuit.in its answers,delle donne asserted a cross claim against millar for contractual indemnity,common law indemnity and contribution.
between november,and may,the defendants entered into separate settlements with the plaintiff.on november,delle donne settled with the plaintiff for.as part of that settlement,the plaintiff granted to delle donne a joint tortfeasor release that contained language intended to protect delle donne from further contribution claims,as contemplated by the uniform contribution among tortfeasors law because it remained an interested party for purposes of resolving the mutual cross claims asserted by and against millar,delle donne was not dismissed from the case.
on february,elevator equipment company advised the trial court that it had entered into a settlement with the plaintiff in an undisclosed amount.elevator equipment company was dismissed as a party,because the other defendants decided not to pursue cross claims against it.that left millar as the only defendant still contesting the plaintiff negligence claims.on may,two days before the trial was scheduled to begin,millar settled with the plaintiff for.
thus,by the time of trial,plaintiff wickes claims against all the defendants had been settled for.the only claims that remained to be determined were the cross claims being asserted by the delle donne and the millar defendants against each other for indemnification contribution arising out of their individual settlements with wickes.
in their cross claim,delle donne claimed that the parties indemnification and contribution rights and obligations were governed by the elevator maintenance agreement into which delle donne and millar had entered on october.the elevator maintenance agreement obligated millar to indemnify delle donne for any liability caused by millar own negligence,but it did not impose a reciprocal indemnity obligation running from delle donne to millar.delle donne acknowledged that the stated term of the elevator maintenance agreement extended only to september two years before wickes suffered her injury.delle donne contended,nonetheless,that on the date of wickes injury the elevator maintenance agreement was still in effect,because there had been no attempt to terminate that agreement and both parties continued to operate under its terms.
the millar defendants disputed that contention,urging that by its terms the elevator maintenance agreement had expired.millar took the position that on the date that wickes was injured,the only operative contract was the custom engineered maintenance agreement among the parties,that became effective on september.that contract was terminable by either party at the end of a period,or any subsequent renewal period,on ninety days written notice importantly,the custom engineered maintenance agreement contained reciprocal indemnity covenants,wherein the delle donne defendants and the millar defendants each agreed to indemnify and hold harmless the other from and against all claims,damages,losses and expenses,including reasonable attorneys fees,resulting from bodily injury to any person to the extent caused by the negligent acts or omissions of the other the indemnifying party.that is,the custom engineered maintenance the elevator maintenance agreement upon which delle donne delle donne to indemnify millar for its losses to the extent they were caused by delle donne negligence.
thus,from an indemnity standpoint,the maintenance agreement manifestly favored delle donne,whereas the custom engineered maintenance agreement clearly favored millar.for that reason,the issue of which agreement was in effect on the date of wickes injury became critical during the trial court proceedings.
in an effort to resolve that issue,delle donne moved for summary judgment,arguing that as a matter of law the elevator maintenance agreement was operative on the date of wickes injury,and that that agreement required millar to defend and indemnify delle donne in wickes personal injury action.millar opposed the motion,arguing that the custom engineered maintenance agreement was the only contract in effect at the time of wickes injury.
the trial court denied delle donne summary judgment motion in a bench ruling,on the basis that there were material facts in dispute that required a trial.
the trial court disposition and the appeals therefrom 
the case was then tried before a jury.as reflected in the pretrial order,two primary issues of law remained to be litigated whether millar owed a duty to defend and indemnify delle donne for wickes personal injury claim,and whether the custom engineered maintenance agreement required millar to defend or indemnify one or both of the delle donne defendants the remaining factual issues were to be determined by the jury in answers to special interrogatories.the jury answered those interrogatories,finding that the delle donne defendants and the millar defendants were all negligent,and that their concurrent negligence was a proximate cause of wickes injury.the jury apportioned negligence among the parties as follows the delle donne defendants,and the millar defendants.the jury also found that i wickes had sustained in damages and that ii the october,elevator maintenance agreement whose term expired on september,was not in effect at the time wickes was injured on july.
based on that jury verdict,delle donne filed,and the parties briefed,a motion for the entry of an appropriate judgment that led ultimately to the entry of an order awarding judgment to millar.specifically,the trial court awarded millar partial indemnity under the custom engineered maintenance agreement in the amount of,representing the difference between what millar actually paid in the settlement and what it was legally obligated to contribute the court also awarded millar costs,including attorneys fees,in the amount of,calculated by reducing millar recoverable attorneys fees by the degree of negligence attributed to millar.
on appeal to this court from that judgment,delle donne claims that the trial court erred by awarding indemnity and attorneys fees to millar in any amount,because millar waived its claim for contractual indemnity the trial court improperly awarded proportional indemnity to millar in contravention of delaware common law,the uniform contribution among joint tortfeasors law and the release granted by wickes to delle donne and millar was not entitled to attorneys fees.
in response,millar contends that the trial court award of partial indemnity and of its attorneys fees incurred before may,day that millar reached its settlement with correct.millar contends on its,however,that the trial court erred by not awarding millar of its costs including attorneys fees from and after may,because millar was entitled to full reimbursement of all the costs it incurred after that date to recover the contractual indemnification that the court ultimately awarded.
we next address these claims.
the argument that millar waived whatever indemnity claim it had 
to put delle donne first claim of error in context,the jury found that at the time of wickes injury,the operative contract was the custom engineered maintenance agreement.in that contract,millar and delle donne reciprocally agreed to indemnify each other against losses,costs and expenses arising out of personal injuries to any person,to the extent the injury was caused by the other party negligence.based on the jury finding,the trial court determined,as a legal matter,that delle donne was obligated to indemnify millar on the basis of delle donne proportional negligence that is,delle donne was obligated to contribute of the that all defendants had paid to wickes to settle her claim.by so concluding,the trial court rejected delle donne contention that millar had waived its right to seek contractual indemnity.
delle donne does not contest any of the jury findings.it claims,however,that even if the custom engineered maintenance agreement was the operative contract,the trial court erred by not concluding that millar had waived its right to seek indemnity under that agreement.in this court,delle donne contends,as it did below,that millar waived any indemnity right because it failed to identify,or rely upon,the custom engineered maintenance agreement as the basis for its indemnity claim.
on an appeal from a decision of the superior court,we review conclusions of law de novo.the trial court factual findings will be accepted if they are sufficiently supported by the record and are the product of an orderly and logical deductive process.we conclude that delle donne waiver argument finds no support in the factual record or in applicable legal principles.on the other hand,the trial court determination that no waiver had occurred is adequately supported by the record and in law.
first,in its answer to the original and the amended complaints,millar consistently raised,as an affirmative defense,the following claim 
to the extent there exists any contract governing the allegations of negligent conduct against millar and to the extent the contract would inure to the benefit of millar,millar hereby pleads as an affirmative defense the contractual provisions and avers that it did not owe any duty to the plaintiff or that the contract relieves millar of any liability in this matter.
millar also asserted,in each of its answers to the various complaints,a cross claim for contribution or indemnity from delle donne,plus reimbursement of its expenses,including reasonable attorneys fees,in defending the lawsuit the only conceivable basis on which millar could assert a right to indemnity was by an express written agreement,because implied indemnity was legally unavailable to millar as a party to a written contract with delle donne although millar theory of recovery was inartfully expressed in that millar did not identify the source of its claimed indemnity,millar answer and cross claim were,nonetheless,sufficient to put delle donne on notice of the possibility that millar might seek indemnification on the basis of the custom engineered maintenance agreement 
second,during the discovery process millar gave notice that the contract upon which it was relying as the basis for its indemnity claim was the custom engineered maintenance agreement.that notice was relevant to the waiver issue,because as the trial court observed 
under the notice pleading requirements of superior court a,all that is required is a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,and a demand for judgment for the relief to which the party deems itself entitled.the pleading need not set out in detail the facts upon which it is based as long as it gives the other party fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.the details of the claim can be obtained through discovery 
in this case,delle donne employed discovery by interrogatories to identify which maintenance agreement millar contended was in force on the date of the accident.in its response to those interrogatories,millar identified its custom engineered maintenance agreement as the applicable contract.
third,millar also identified the custom engineered maintenance agreement as the applicable contract in its response to delle donne motion for summary judgment.that response referred to the terms and conditions limiting millar responsibility for loss and and conditions which contained the reciprocal indemnity clause upon which millar was relying.
finally,millar trial brief and its answer to delle donne trial brief,both of which were filed after millar had settled with the plaintiff,identified the reciprocal indemnity clause in the custom engineered maintenance agreement as the relevant provision that governed the parties respective indemnity obligations.
we conclude,for these reasons,that the trial court did not err in rejecting delle donne contention that millar had waived its right to recover contractual indemnity from delle donne 
the claim that millar was not entitled to any indemnity 
delle donne second claim consists of two alternative arguments,whose thrust is that in concluding that millar should be indemnified based on the jury liability allocation,the trial court erred as a matter of law.our review of that claim is for legal error and de novo 
delle donne first argues that the award to millar,although labeled as one for indemnity,was in substance an award of contribution that was barred by the uniform contribution among tortfeasors law and by the release provided by the plaintiff to delle donne.delle donne second argument is that even if millar was entitled to be indemnified in the abstract legal sense,it was not entitled to that relief in this concrete factual setting.
delle donne first argument must be rejected,because it rests on a false premise.the argument inner logic is not clearly articulated,but appears to run as follows in its opinion and order the trial court determined to award proportional indemnity to millar,measured by the percentages determined by the jury,for delle donne for millar.because proportional indemnity is not a recognized basis for relief under delaware law and has never been the basis for recovering indemnification,delle donne argues,the only conceivable ground for a recovery was common law contribution.but,common law contribution to millar was legally foreclosed by the plaintiff joint tortfeasor release to delle donne and by the uniform contribution among tortfeaso
