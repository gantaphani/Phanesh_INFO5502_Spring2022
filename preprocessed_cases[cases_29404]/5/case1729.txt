the trial court heard testimony from three other tenants about additional,uncharged acts that occurred in,and.melina boudov testified gabriel took a piece of wood tabletop from her without permission,assaulted her when she tried to retrieve it,and was nearby when there was a suspicious oil leak under her car.mitchel resnick testified that in gabriel changed the lock on his garage in an attempt to force him to move and in smirked at him when he noticed someone had scratched the paint of his car with a key.he further testified that during the criminal trial someone slashed gabriel victim tires in the courthouse parking lot.the implication was that gabriel keyed the car and slashed the tires.faith foss testified that in gabriel gave her an unwanted hug,grabbed or touched her breast,tried to kiss her,asked if she was a virgin,entered her apartment five to ten times without permission,and without permission removed an end table to have it appraised.
gabriel repeatedly objected to these latter lines of testimony,arguing they were irrelevant and unduly prejudicial.the people argued gabriel remote acts were probative of the need for injunctive relief.the trial court overruled gabriel objections.

the court found gabriel rented uninhabitable space as living quarters,entered tenants units unlawfully,and sexually harassed a tenant.it imposed a civil penalty for each unfair practice and enjoined gabriel from interacting with tenants,setting forth its reasoning in a statement of decision filed on january,considering the nature and seriousness of the above described conduct,the persistence of the conduct,the defendant past history of both civil and criminal violations and his complete lack of understanding of the nature and consequences of his conduct,the court enjoins the defendant from having any management role at any of his rental properties for a period of five years.the defendant is required to retain a management company approved by the city of santa monica,and the court,to perform all management duties ordinarily associated with rental property.the defendant is to have no contact with any past,present or future tenants.he is not to initiate or pursue any litigation,as a plaintiff,against any past,present or future tenant without the express authorization and supervision of a legal representative of the management company.he is not to enter any rental unit,either occupied or vacant,unless accompanied by a member of the management company and with good cause.such good cause is within the sole discretion of the management representative.the court is cognizant of the draconian nature of this injunction.however,the defendant has evidenced a long history of willful disobedience to previous warnings and orders.he does not appreciate the offensive and criminal nature of his conduct toward his tenants and others.
discussion 
admission of evidence of prior acts 
gabriel argues admission of evidence regarding acts committed in,and was improper under evidence code section,violated the four year limitations period set forth in business and professions code section,was barred by the doctrine of res judicata,and violated his constitutional right to due process.business and professions code section and the doctrine of res judicata are inapposite,as neither bars admission of evidence of remote acts.
a judgment may be set aside on the ground of improper admission of evidence only if the error complained of was prejudicial.see cal,art.vi,code civ,soule general motors cal th,d.prejudice is not presumed,and the burden is on the appealing party to demonstrate that a miscarriage of justice has occurred.waller tjd,th,d.to establish prejudice,an appellant must show a reasonable probability exists that,in the absence of the error,he or she would have obtained a more favorable result.see soule general motors,supra,at,d.
here,except for occasionally asserting in conclusory fashion that he was prejudiced,gabriel ignores the prejudice issue.the court found that in and he sexually harassed a tenant,made unlawful entries into tenants units,and rented an uninhabitable space as living quarters.he does not challenge these findings.the court assessed a civil penalty of and enjoined him from dealing with tenants for five years.though he calls the remedies draconian,he does not argue they are improper.nor does he explain how he would have obtained a more favorable result had testimony regarding remote acts not been admitted.absent a more thorough explanation of this issue and its purported effect,we deem the argument waived.kurinij hanna morton th,d an appellant must present argument and authorities on each point to which error is asserted,or else the issue is waived.see schoendorf registry,th,d belli curtis pub.d,fn.there is no duty on this court to search the record for evidence which will serve to overturn the judgment.
sexual harassment can be a business practice 
gabriel contends his sexual harassment of a tenant was not a business practice subject to suit under the ucl it was,at most,personal misconduct geared toward personal gratification,with only an incidental connection to commercial activity.we disagree.
by its terms the ucl prohibits as unfair competition any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice.bus.the statute has been found to prohibit wrongful business conduct in whatever context such activity might occur.citation.massachusetts mutual life ins.superior court th,d.whether a particular act is is a question of fact dependent on the circumsta
