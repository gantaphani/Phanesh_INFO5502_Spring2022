darby lumber and bob russell construction,appeal the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of sharon childress and other former employees in their action alleging violations of the worker adjustment and retraining notification warn act.at issue is whether the district court erred in concluding that darby lumber and bob russell construction constituted a single employer for purposes of the warn act concluding that the companies were not exempt from the warn act notice requirement for mass layoffs deciding various discovery disputes and awarding attorney fees.we conclude that the district court was not in error,and therefore affirm its ruling in full.
background 
this case arises under the worker adjustment and retraining notification act.id.bob russell construction brc was incorporated in the state of idaho by robert russell russell in.in,darby lumber,dli was incorporated in the state of montana.in january of,dli acquired of the shares of brc.at all times relevant to these proceedings,the stock of dli was owned by russell approximately and the dli employees stock ownership trust approximately.
dli operated as a lumber mill and manufactured,marketed,and sold finished lumber.brc operated as a construction company,building log roads,hauling timber,and managing the log yard for dli.during the period from september,to september,dli employed employees each with more than hours of employment with the company.during the period from september,to september,brc employed employees each with more than hours of employment with the company.
on september,larry guerrero,the general manager of the dli mill,placed a written statement in the paychecks of all dli employees,advising them of the financial difficulties of the company,and informing them that there would be a major layoff.on september,dli shut down the mill,and all mill employees were laid off.the planer operation at the mill continued to operate for several weeks thereafter,but was then shut down,and all of those employees were laid off.all of the employees of brc were laid off over the next several months.
on february,this suit was filed by former dli employees,alleging violations of the warn act,which requires a notice of layoffs in certain situations.the warn act requires employers of or more employees to give at least sixty days advance notice of a plant closing if the shutdown results in an employment loss at a single employment site during any period for fifty or more employees excluding any employees.id.appellants dli and brc asserted that the act did not apply to them because each company had fewer than employees.appellants further claimed that even if the warn act did apply,the affirmative defenses of faltering company,unforeseeable business circumstances,good faith applied and would preclude application of the warn act.appellees maintained that the two companies qualified as a single employer under the warn act,that the exceptions did not apply here,and that even if they did apply,warn sanctions were warranted because the notice of termination was insufficient.
on for summary judgment,the district court found,based on an analysis of the labor management relations act and warn act factors for determining single employer status,that brc and darby lumber are a single employer for the purposes of the warn act.childress darby lumber,d,order granting summary judgment.the district court went on to find that neither the good faith,business circumstances,nor faltering company exceptions applied.the district court then found that darby lumber would still be liable even if some of the exceptions applied,because its notice was inadequate.in subsequent orders,the court granted plaintiffs motion for attorney fees in the amount of and ordered defendants to pay damages to plaintiffs in the amount of,which was sixty work days of lost to the individual plaintiffs from the layoff date of september,minus any days worked.

warn act overview 
the purpose of the warn act is to provide 
protection to workers,their families and communities by requiring employers to provide notification calendar days in advance of plant closings and mass layoffs.advance notice provides workers and their families some transition time to adjust to the prospective loss of employment,to seek and obtain alternative jobs and,if necessary,to enter skill training or retraining that will allow these workers to successfully compete in the job market.
employers with or more employees are barred from ordering a plant closing or mass layoff until the end of a period after the employer serves written notice of such an order to each representative of the affected employees as of the time of the notice or,if there is no such representative at that time,to each affected employee.a,a.
under the warn act,the term mass layoff means a reduction in force which 
a is not the result of a plant closing and 
b results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any day period for 
i i at least percent of the employees excluding any employees and ii at least employees excluding any employees or 
ii at least employees excluding any employees 
id.a.these figures are calculated from the date of the last date upon which the notice would be required to be given,in this case,july,sixty days before september,the date of the layoff.see a.on july,dli and brc had more than employees combined,while alone,each company had fewer than employees.
single employer analysis of dli and brc 
appellants contend that there was significant evidence to establish that dli and brc were separate companies,neither of which independently employed employees.int l of teamsters american delivery serv,cir analyzed the single employer test for the warn act and the labor management relations act together 
to determine single employer status under the lmra,we consider these four factors common ownership common management centralized control of labor relations and interrelation of operations.
common ownership is the least important factor,and the remaining three factors are guideposts only.single employer status ultimately depends on all the circumstances of the case and is characterized as an absence of an arms length relationship found among unintegrated companies.
the relevant regulations under warn provide that under existing legal rules,independent contractors and subsidiaries which are wholly or partially owned by a parent company are treated as separate employers or as a part of the parent or contracting company depending on the degree of their independence from the parent.some of the factors to be considered in making this determination are i common ownership,ii common directors officers,iii de facto exercise of control,iv unity of personnel policies emanating from a common source,and v the dependency of operations.
id.at quoting a,internal citations omitted.the five warn factors are analyzed as follows.
common ownership 
brc is the wholly owned subsidiary of dli.while appellants deny common ownership,they admit that dli owns of the shares of brc,and that russell owns of the shares of dli and is the trustee for the other of the shares.while technical common ownership is avoided by corporate formalities,this actual commonality of ownership satisfies this least important factor.id.
it is undisputed that brc and dli share common directors and officers,as appellants admitted in their responses to plaintiffs discovery requests.
ii.common directors officers 
iii.de facto exercise of control 
the parties contest the extent of dli de facto control over brc.appellants assert that the companies maintained separate employment policies,had separate managers,and had separate workforces with separate pay scales,payrolls,workers compensation,employee health benefits,and separate middle management.appellees rejoin that dli manager was given daily reports on the activities of both dli and brc,and at times directed the activities of brc.dli manager made the decision to move employees from the payroll of dli to that of brc,and to have employees on the brc payroll work in the dli log yard.russell admitted in his deposition that he directed both the dli manager and the brc manager to shut down the respective companies when the time came.finally,appellants admitted in discovery responses that management of brc would ultimately answer to higher management at darby lumber.
this court agrees with the district court that these factors,on balance,demonstrate de facto exercise of control by dli over brc.
iv.unity of personnel policies emanating from a common source 
appellees do not seriously dispute appellants showing of significant differences in personnel policies between dli and brc,including differences in overtime,breaks,methods of pay,and health insurance premiums.
dependency of operations 
appellees maintain that brc operation was overwhelmingly dependent on dli.citing deposition testimony that over ninety percent of brc activities and revenues were derived from dli in,appellees argue that brc main purpose was to provide support services for the dli mill.in addition,brc maintained its financial records at dli facilities,and,as previously noted,some brc employees worked in the dli log yard.
appellants counter that russell,in his affidavit,declared that brc was not dependent 
brc was not dependent upon dli for its operational existence.brc existed as a viable operating company for many years before dli even came in to being.the services brc provided such as road building,hauling,trucking and delivery could easily have been provided to entities other than dli.in fact,they were provided to others for many years before dli existed and continued after dli closed.
however,although russell states that brc could easily have provided these services to others,the facts demonstrate that while dli and brc were both in existence,brc regularly provided these services almost exclusively to dli.further,brc shut down operations just months after the dli mill closed,suggesting that brc was dependent upon dli for business.
accordingly,the evidence demonstrates dependency of operations between dli and brc.
the relevant factors,taken as a whole,support the district court finding that brc and dli operated as a single employer for the purposes of the warn act,and that the warn act applies to their conduct.
ii.exceptions to the warn act notice requirement 
appellants contend that they were exempt from the warn act notice requirement for layoffs under either the good faith exception,the business circumstances exception or the faltering company exception,and that the district court erred in not allowing these defenses to go to a jury.
good faith exception 
the warn act provides 
if an employer which has violated this act proves to the satisfaction of the court that the act or omission that violated this chapter was in good faith and that the employer had reasonable grounds for believing that the act or omission was not a violation of this chapter the court may,in its discretion,reduce the amount of the liability or penalty provided for in this section.
a.appellants claim that this defense should have gone to a jury,and that the district court decision to dismiss it at the summary judgment stage was reversible error.
however,as the district court recognized,good faith is an affirmative defense as to which defendants have the burden of proof,and in this case they failed to raise triable issues as to several elements of the defense.as the district court stated 
the good faith defense requires a showing by the employer of a subjective intent to comply with the act as well as evidence of objective reasonableness by the employer in applying the act.in re jamesway.if there is not a material fact issue concerning one or both of these factors,good faith can be a matter appropriate for summary judgment.id.under the good faith exception,the employer must establish that it had an honest intention to ascertain and follow the dictates of the statute and that it had reasonable grounds for believing that its conduct complie d with the statute.local utility workers union of america southern california edison company,cir.
childress,d at order granting summary judgment alterations in original.
appellants failed to provide facts to establish that they had an honest intention to ascertain and follow the dictates of the warn act or that they had reasonable grounds for believing that their conduct complied with it.appellants did provide evidence that they had little or no knowledge of the act and that russell did not want to close the dli mill.that information tends to show that defendants were ignorant of the warn act it does not,however,show that they had an honest intention to follow it,or that they had grounds for believing that they were in compliance with it.mere ignorance of the warn act is not enough to establish the good faith exception.the district court was correct in finding that the good faith exception to the warn act did not apply.
business circumstances exception 
the warn act notice requirements do not apply if the closing or mass layoff is caused by business circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable as of the time that notice would have been required.b a.the code of federal regulations gives guidance on what types of business circumstances will be considered not reasonably foreseeable 
an important indicator of a business circumstance that is not reasonably foreseeable is that the circumstance is caused by some sudden,dramatic,and unexpected action or condition outside the employer control.a principal client sudden and unexpected termination of a major contract with the employer,a strike at a major supplier of the employer,and an unanticipated and dramatic major economic downturn might each be considered a business circumstance that is not reasonably foreseeable.a government ordered closing of an employment site that occurs without prior notice also may be an unforeseeable business circumstance.
the test for determining when business circumstances are not reasonably foreseeable focuses on an employer business judgment.the employer must exercise such commercially reasonable business judgment as would a similarly situated employer in predicting the demands of its particular market.the employer is not required,however,to accurately predict general economic conditions that also may affect demand for its products or services.
appellants point to the decision by bank on september,refusing to rewrite dli credit,as the sudden and unforeseeable event that caused the shutdown of the mill.however,appellants own response to a discovery request stated 
the closure of the plant and layoffs in september was occasioned by losses to the company which could not be sustained any longer.these losses were a function of the depressed lumber market,increased cost of raw materials,operational difficulty in the startup of a new planer,and factors effected by the price of raw materials and finished goods beyond the control of darby lumber.in turn,raw materials and finished goods markets and prices were effected by the general economic downturn in pacific rim countries,influences by nafta,and significantly influenced by environmental pressure to halt sales of forest service timber.
this statement makes it evident that the plant closure was not caused solely by the decision of bank,but was caused by a variety of factors which accumulated over time,making the closure foreseeable.indeed,as the district court noted,while bank decided not to rewrite dli loans on september,the company did not actually lose its credit with the bank until november,a month following the mass layoff.
appellants failed to meet their burden of showing that the business circumstances exception applies in this case.accordingly,we affirm the district court finding that the business circumstances exception did not apply.
