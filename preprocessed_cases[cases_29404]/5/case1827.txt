discussion 
on november,appellant filed in this court a civil case information statement,which attached the trial court june,order granting attorney fees,the court may,order granting defendants motion for a protective order,and the august,judgment.believing that the civil case information statement raised serious timeliness issues,this court on november,directed the parties to address the timeliness of the appeal in their appellate briefing citing maughan google technology,supra,th,d,the order noted that the trial court september,order granting respondents motion and its subsequent june,attorney fees order may have been independently appealable,and that the time for appealing therefrom may have expired before appellant filing of the notice of appeal on september.the order also noted that nothing precluded respondent from serving and filing a motion to dismiss in advance of the parties briefing.respondent filed no such motion.instead,he argued in his brief that although appellant appeal was untimely to the extent he challenged the original order granting defendants motion,appellant appeal from the subsequent judgment was timely insofar as he challenged the award of attorney fees.
appellant concedes that his failure to appeal the september,order granting defendants motion precludes this court from considering the correctness of that ruling.maughan google technology,supra,th at,d because plaintiff did not timely appeal from order granting a special motion to strike,court could not reach merits of order.the question remains,however,whether he was required to appeal from the order granting attorney fees and denying discovery,and whether his subsequent appeal from the judgment was therefore untimely.
untimely appeal of attorney fees award.
in general,the party prevailing on a special motion to strike may seek an attorney fees award through three different avenues simultaneously with litigating the special motion to strike,by a subsequent noticed motion,or as part of a cost memorandum at the conclusion of the litigation.american humane los angeles times communications th,d doe luster th,fn,d.in maughan google technology,supra,th,d,the trial court granted a motion for attorney fees submitted after the granting of an motion.maughan,supra,at,d.judgment was entered the same day the judgment summarized the trial court previous order and attorney fees order.id.at,d.plaintiff appealed from the judgment but not the order granting fees and costs,and defendant filed a from the judgment insofar as it establishes attorneys fees and costs.id.at,d.the appellate court held that defendant from the judgment was timely,and that it therefore was inconsequential whether it was to review the order granting attorney fees and costs as an interim order under the judgment or to construe the to have been taken from the order itself.maughan,supra,at,d.the court therefore found it was unnecessary to determine whether an order granting attorney fees to a prevailing defendant under the statute is directly appealable,or whether it is reviewable only on appeal from the judgment.ibid.as the parties here acknowledge,this is an unsettled question.
relying on doe luster,supra,th,d,which held that interlocutory orders awarding or denying attorney fees under section,subdivision c are not immediately appealable,respondent argues in his appellate brief that appellant appeal of the attorney fees award is timely as an appeal from a final judgment.as his attorney acknowledged during oral argument however,doe is inapposite.there,it was a plaintiff who prevailed on motions when the trial court denied the motions.doe,supra,at,d.doe appealed the denial of her motion for attorney fees,but the appellate court dismissed the appeal,holding that nothing authorized an appeal from an interlocutory attorney fees order.id.at,d.in doe,the denial of attorney fees to plaintiff was necessarily an interlocutory order,because plaintiff had prevailed on defendants special motions to strike,thereby avoiding dismissal of her lawsuit.doe noted that no statutory authority authorizes an immediate appeal from the award of attorney fees to the prevailing moving party,the situation here.id.at,d.however,it also acknowledged that an attorney fees award in an case may be appealed as an order made after a judgment,subd.a where it is preceded by a judgment or dismissal order disposing of a plaintiff action doe,supra,at fn,d,citing all dismissals ordered by the court shall be in the form of a written order signed by the court and filed in the action and those orders when so filed shall constitute judgments and be effective for all purposes johnston corrigan th,d by filing amended that did not name after they filed special motion to strike,effectively dismissed against them subsequent order granting attorney fees was appealable order fire protection dist.weir th,d order denying attorney fees under section,subd.c was order after judgment,according to doe,because it was made after trial court disposed of entire case on the merits
