the individuals with disabilities education act idea,obligates school districts to furnish a free appropriate public education fape to children with disabilities.see id,b c,a,i,b.that is the good news.the bad news is that the idea is not,and parents,school officials,bureaucrats,and judges alike have struggled to master its intricacies.
these consolidated appeals illustrate the point.taken together,they present two loosely related questions.the first concerns whether parents who successfully resist a school district effort,in an independent legal action,to overturn a placement on the ground of the alleged dangerousness of a child with disabilities are considered prevailing parties within the purview of the idea provision.the second concerns the circumstances under which a child who,by reason of his age,is no longer covered by the idea may nonetheless be entitled to some relief to compensate him for the deprivation of a fape during an earlier period.the district court answered these questions in ways that pretermitted the appellants claims for attorneys fees and compensatory education.concluding,as we do,that the court erred,we reverse the judgments below and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
we sketch the relevant facts.the appellants,and,are the parents of,who was born in december of,suffers from down syndrome.he has had special educational needs throughout his formative years.during the times material hereto,maine school administrative district the school district has had the responsibility of ministering to these needs.
generally speaking,the idea obliged the school district to furnish with a fape sufficient to confer some educational benefit.see bd.of educ.rowley,d roland concord sch,cir.federal law directs school districts to carry out such a duty through the development and implementation of an annual individualized education program iep.see,a,d see also.was eligible for such special education services through the school year when he turned twenty years of age.see a b i ii linking eligibility for special education services to state law.tit,granting every student the right to public education through the school year encompassing his or her twentieth birthday.
it would serve no useful purpose to discuss early scholastic experiences.rather,we begin with the school year which encompassed nineteenth birthday.in furtherance of its responsibilities under the idea,the school district prepared an iep for that year.under it,spent mornings at marshwood high school and afternoons at a training program where he also received some special education services.
during the school year,displayed a variety of behavioral problems,including verbal outbursts and assaultive conduct.believing that these problems stemmed from ineffective and frustrating iep,and repeatedly requested modifications.officials of the school district met with the family many times to address these remonstrances,discuss current iep,and ponder his future curriculum.
in june of,the school district proffered a new iep for the school year.under this proposal,was to be relegated to a training program for the entire school day.his vocational training would be augmented with monthly speech therapy,sign language lessons,behavioral consultations,and social skills instruction.
parents rejected this proposal.they took especial umbrage at the fact that the draft iep completely removed from a mainstream academic setting.concluding that this circumstance violated their son right to receive educational services in the least restrictive environment possible,see a,the parents sought a hearing before the maine department of education,see id.f.the parents simultaneously invoked the idea provision,id.j,so that would remain in his educational placement pending a resolution of his iep the school district defended the draft iep,and,accordingly,resisted the parents administrative petition.
the school district then took a more unusual step it initiated a civil action in the united states district court for the district of maine the first suit seeking to bar from returning to marshwood high because his presence there would pose or so the school district alleged a substantial risk of danger to himself or others.coincident with the filing of its complaint,the school district moved for temporary and preliminary injunctive relief.after reviewing the motion papers and the family objection,the district court refused to issue a temporary restraining order tro.the effect of that ruling was to leave the order and,thus,placement at marshwood high intact.the school district chose not to pursue the matter further,but,rather,moved to dismiss its complaint.see.a.the parents did not object but asserted an entitlement to attorneys fees and costs.see i b.the district court granted the school district motion for voluntary dismissal but denied the parents request for remuneration on the ground that they were not a prevailing party.me.sch.admin.dist.v,civ.the parents filed a timely appeal.
meanwhile,the administrative hearing anent the adequacy of the proposed iep went forward on a parallel track.in a decision dated october,the hearing officer approved the concept of a totally placement but determined that the iep was inadequate in other respects.consequently,he ordered the school district to prepare an amended iep.the parents exercised their right to judicial review of this decision,see i a they commenced an action in the federal district court the second suit in which they sought to overturn the hearing officer approval of placement.the school district filed a challenging other parts of the administrative decision.
in december of,reached his twentieth birthday.the following june,he graduated from marshwood high.upon the occurrence of that event,the school district took the position that the parents appeal from the administrative decision had become moot.in their reply,the parents gainsaid this contention.they pointed out that had dropped out of his special education program at marshwood high during the school year and asserted that he was entitled to compensatory education to offset the inadequate iep that the school district had proposed after some skirmishing the details of which need not concern us,the district court ruled that the suit was not procedural ly moot because the parents had raised the claim for compensatory education in a timely fashion me.sch.admin.dist.v,d.the court nevertheless dismissed the case for what it termed substantive mootness,declaring that had received,for all that appears in the record,the very relief he and his parents initially sought in this action,by virtue of the ruling.id.at.the second appeal followed.we consolidated it with the earlier appeal which had been stayed for briefing and argument.we now resolve both appeals.
ii.analysis 
the henceforth shall refer to them as the ahead on two fronts.they assign error to the lower court determination that they were not prevailing parties in the first suit.they also protest the district court dismissal of the second suit as moot,pointing to the pendency of their compensatory education claim.we address these points sequentially.
a.the attorneys fee claim.
in most civil litigation,the parties are responsible for paying their own attorneys fees.see buckhannon bd.care home.dep t of health human,d gay officers action league puerto rico,cir.despite this general rule,congress sometimes chooses to allow for in particular situations,and it chose to do so in connection with the idea.the statute provides in relevant part 
in any action or proceeding brought under section of the idea,the court,in its discretion,may award reasonable attorneys fees as part of the costs to the parents of a child with a disability who is the prevailing party.
i b.because this provision employs the phrase prevailing party a term of must be interpreted and applied in the same manner as other federal statutes that use the same phraseology.see new hampshire adams,cir explaining that,in construing the idea provision,cases decided under kindred federal statutes,such as the fees act,furnish persuasive authority,at,reprinted in,stating that section i b should be construed in keeping with hensley eckerhart,d,a fees act case see also buckhannon,at.classifying prevailing party as a term of art.
for purposes of a federal statute,a prevailing party is any party who succeed s on any significant issue which achieves some of the benefits plaintiffs sought in bringing suit.hensley,at.the party success can not be a hollow victory it must materially alter the litigants legal relationship by modifying one party behavior in a way that directly benefits the other see farrar hobby,d gay officers,at.thus,the change effected must be material a purely technical or de minimis victory can not confer prevailing party status.state teachers ass garland indep.sch,d stanton berkshire reg l sch,cir.
it follows from the foregoing that a court faced with the need to decide whether a litigant is or is not a prevailing party must make a qualitative inquiry into the import of the result obtained.gay officers,at,see also christopher marcus,cir i t is helpful to identify the relief sought by the plaintiff and compare it with the relief obtained as a result of the suit.where,as here,prevailing party status turns on a question of law,we afford plenary review.gay officers,at domegan ponte,cir.with this paradigm in mind,we turn to the assignment of error.
the appellants ask for attorneys fees referable only to the first suit.their position is straightforward the school district commenced a civil action and the appellants successfully defended against it,the school district did not receive any of the relief that it sought and,eventually,threw in the towel.the school district rejoins that this victory was merely single battle in the war over the therefore is insufficient to support prevailing party status.we test these hypotheses.
in general,the materiality requirement demands that a party succeed on the merits of a claim or defense.adams,at.but a party may be considered prevailing even without obtaining a favorable final judgment on all or even the most crucial of her claims.buckhannon,at.rome sch.comm,cir see generally william danne,annotation,who is prevailing party for purposes of obtaining attorney fees under i b of individuals with disabilities education act,fed,wl collecting cases.thus,interlocutory orders that confer substantive injunctive relief often have been viewed as sufficient to carry the weight of a fee award,haley pataki,cir pearson fair,cir collecting cases.
on the other hand,interlocutory orders that serve merely to maintain the status quo usually are deemed insufficient to buoy a fee award.see lso,stroh,cir.consequently,a successful invocation of the idea provision,on an interlocutory basis,ordinarily will not confer prevailing party status.see,orange township bd.of,cir bd.of educ.steven,cir.
this case,however,is not cut from the usual cloth.we are dealing here not with a order issued,on an interlocutory basis,in the course of ongoing judicial review.rather,the first suit was an independent,civil action,instituted by the school district,in which it sought to enjoin the operation of the provision.that quest for injunctive relief was the sole raison the first suit.
to be sure,the school district probably saw the first suit as a piece of a larger dispute between it and the appellants over the iep.but a party subjective view of a cause of action counts for very little in determining prevailing party status.see.state teachers ass n,at.nadeau helgemoe,cir.by the same token,it is immaterial whether the school district ultimately withdrew its complaint because it thought that the administrative decision had rendered the request moot.see watson county of riverside,cir bisciglia kenosha unified sch.dist,cir.we search,therefore,for more objective indicia.
we deem it important to emphasize that the school district,not the appellants,brought the first suit.the appellants were haled into court as defendants and won a victory on the sole issue in the case an issue that had been framed by the school district.a triumphant defendant may qualify as a prevailing party for the purpose of obtaining a fee award.see,weyant okst,cir collecting cases see also burke guiney,cir.it follows inexorably that a defendant who prevails on the only claim that justifies the presence of the case in a federal court has a legitimate basis for asserting that she is the prevailing party.see perlman zell,cir.
this conclusion is reinforced by our awareness that the school district could have appealed the order as part and parcel of judicial review of the iep,see i a,but eschewed that course.it elected instead to pursue an independent cause of action by invoking a statute that permits temporary changes in a child placement if a school district can demonstrate by substantial evidence that maintaining the current placement of such child is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or to others.id.k a.this statute does not carve out an exception to section j provision.see honig doe,d timothy rochester,sch,cir orange township,at implying that sections j and k are independent in terms of prevailing party determinations.indeed,a restraining order under section k requires the proponent to proffer substantial evidence that the affected child current placement poses a significant and unreasonable likelihood of injury either to himself or to others.k a,c.the merits of the iep dispute are almost wholly irrelevant.honig,at.emphasizing the dichotomy between injunctions for safety and placements.
in fine,the school district chose to make alleged dangerousness a contested issue in and of itself and to try to change his placement accordingly.that is to say,the injunctive action that it brought under section k the first suit attempted to work an autarkic material alteration in the legal relations between the parties.defeating that attempt,once and for all,gave the appellants solid ground on which to base prevailing party status 
this result squares with commonly accepted notions of materiality in the context.the materiality of a judicial outcome depends in part on whether the result is purely procedural or whether it actually accomplishes something substantive for the winning party.see adams,at krichinsky knox county,cir see also hanrahan hampton,d.because the district court denied injunctive relief on the basis that the school district had not adduced sufficient proof to satisfy the section k standard,it is readily evident that the appellants successfully defended the first suit on the merits.
this thesis is confirmed by considering what would have happened had the appellants not appeared in court to oppose the school district action.in that event,the court most likely would have entered a default judgment and changed placement.by defending,the appellants not only deprived the school district of the benefit that it sought in bringing suit but also blocked it from implementing a course of action inimical to interests.the appellants victory was,therefore,material.see farrar,at.stanton,at.
for these reasons,we conclude that the appellants were the prevailing parties in the first suit,and that the district court erred as a matter of law in holding to the contrary.accordingly,we reverse the district court order and remand the first suit so that the court may determine whether special circumstances exist that might bar an award,and,if not,the amount of attorneys fees and costs to which the appellants are entitled.
b.the compensatory education claim.
we turn now to the justiciability of the appellants compensatory education claim.it is law that,in a federal court,justiciability requires the existence of an actual case or controversy.const.art.iii,cl.even if an actual case or controversy exists at the inception of litigation,a case may be rendered moot and,therefore,subject to dismissal if changed circumstances eliminate any possibility of effectual relief.cmm cable,ocean coast,cir.
in a suit seeking only injunctive relief,this ordinarily means that once the act sought to be enjoined occurs,the suit must be dismissed as moot,oakville dev.fdic,cir.if,however,a plaintiff seeks alternative redress such as money damages in addition to injunctive relief,the o
