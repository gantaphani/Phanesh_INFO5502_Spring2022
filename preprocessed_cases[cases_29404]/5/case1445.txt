this is a patent infringement case involving radial arm saw or radial saw guard safety technology.michael powell brought suit against home depot,alleging that it infringed his patent,patent patent,covering radial arm saw guards that are installed in every home depot store location throughout the united states.following a trial,the jury determined that home depot literally and willfully infringed powell patent.after the jury trial,the district court held a bench trial on the issue of unenforceability.it concluded that powell had not committed inequitable conduct and declined to hold the patent unenforceable.based on home depot willful infringement,the district court awarded enhanced damages.based on the district court finding of litigation misconduct and vexatious and bad faith litigation,it also awarded attorney fees.
on appeal,home depot challenges the district court denial of its renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law jmol on the issues of infringement,willfulness,and damages.it also challenges the district court claim construction,inequitable conduct,and attorney fees determinations.
powell conditionally cross appeals on the issue of enhanced damages seeking additional enhanced damages if,for example,the compensatory damage award were reduced.
the jury verdict of willful infringement and damages determination are supported by substantial evidence.we affirm the district court,having detected no reversible error in its denial of judgment as a matter of law in favor of home depot on the issues of infringement,willfulness,and damages.further,we affirm the district court conclusions as to claim construction,inequitable conduct,and attorney fees.
background 
home depot is one of the largest,most profitable home improvement retailers in the united states.for many years,powell had a business relationship with home depot as its for the installation and repair of radial arm saws.home depot uses radial arm saws in its stores to cut the raw lumber it sells down to a smaller size,based on a customer preference.
in and,home depot took note of an alarming trend.its employees were suffering injuries including lacerations and finger amputations caused while operating radial arm saws to cut lumber for customers.top corporate officers,including the ceo,learned of the employee injuries and directed home depot safety personnel to either fix the radial saws to prevent injuries or remove them from all stores.
home depot studied the repercussions of removing the radial saws from its stores and ceasing to offer its customers the option to have lumber cut into smaller pieces.it concluded that the benefits of keeping the radial saws outweighed the risks and chose to find a solution to employee injuries,rather than remove them from its stores.employee injury claims had already cost the company nearly,but its competitors still offered lumber cutting services and it feared the loss of its customers that utilized the service at home depot.further,it risked losing the considerable sales in lumber and other departments that sell goods related to lumber purchases.seeking a solution to the problem,it turned to powell.
powell recognizing that removal of radial arm saws in home depot stores would hurt his business set out to develop a solution to employee injuries.in july,he presented a saw guard prototype to home depot,which then ordered eight production units for use and testing in stores.by august,those production saw guard units were installed in home depot stores and powell filed an application for a patent on his saw guard invention.
unbeknownst to powell at the time he installed his invention for testing,home depot contacted another company,industriaplex,to build and install saw guards for its radial arm saws.home depot invited industriaplex to view powell invention and asked it to build nearly identical copies at a price less than the per saw guard it paid powell for the testing units.industriaplex agreed.home depot eventually ordered nearly saw guards built by industriaplex for approximately per unit.
powell continued to confer with home depot through the end of,but could not reach an agreement to supply it with the saw guards at the price it offered to pay per unit,including installation.powell patent issued on may,and he sued home depot for infringement in may.
after a jury trial,the jury reached a unanimous verdict that home depot willfully and literally infringed the patent.it awarded million in damages.the district court enhanced damages by an additional million and also awarded attorney fees totaling million.when all the dust had settled,the final judgment against home depot totaled,including interest.

discussion 
this appeal raises several issues claim construction,infringement,willfulness,inequitable conduct,damages,enhanced damages,and attorney fees.we address each issue in turn.
claim construction 
as part of its challenge of the district court denial of jmol of noninfringement,home depot disagrees with that court claim construction of two terms,dust collection structure and table top.these terms appear in independent claims and.claim is reproduced below.
in combination with a radial arm saw assembly comprising a table having a top and a rip fence projecting upward therefrom,a vertical column extending upwardly near the rear of the top,a radial arm extending horizontally from the top of the column,a rotary power saw suspended below the radial arm by a carriage adapted for travel along the length of radial arm,the saw including a rotating blade,a protective blade shroud,and a handle,the improvement comprising a work surface mounted to the table top at least one push handle in slidable engagement with said work surface for movement toward and away from said rip fence a cutting box disposed on top of the work surface,said cutting box defining an interior bounded by a top in spaced relation with said work surface,opposing side walls,and front and rear walls at least one of said side walls defining an opening therein with brush bristles disposed in said opening to allow a work piece to be at least partially inserted within said cutting box through said opening said cutting box top defining an elongate slotted aperture for receiving the lower portion of the saw blade as the blade travels during the sawing process and said cutting box interior in fluid communication with dust collection structure for collecting sawdust.
patent ll emphases added.each of these claim construction and infringement issues are discussed below.
dust collection structure 
claim construction 
while the district court initially construed dust collection structure as a element under,it thereafter changed its view and issued a new construction replacing the earlier construction from its admittedly erroneous claim construction order.on appeal,home depot challenges the new claim construction,arguing that the district court initial construction was correct because it had overcome the presumption that applies against treatment when the claim does not use the term means.according to home depot,that presumption was overcome because the claim term fails to recite sufficiently definite structure.thus,it argues that the district court improperly changed the construction of dust collection structure when it redefined the term as being comprised of two components a repository that temporarily collects and contains sawdust and wood chips generated during the cutting process,and at least one opening or port to allow the extraction of sawdust and wood chips by the vacuum system.home depot challenges the adopted claim construction only to the extent that it alleges that the original claim construction was proper.
powell responds,asserting that the district court was correct to change its initial claim construction.he argues that in the absence of the word means,there is a strong presumption against construing dust collection structure as a element.further,he asserts that the full limitation,in context,recites a structural requirement that the dust collection structure be in fluid communication with the cutting box interior.see patent ll,ll said cutting box interior in fluid communication with dust collection structure for collecting sawdust.this,he contends,recites sufficiently definite structure because the claim requires that the dust collection structure and the cutting box be coupled together to allow air and sawdust to flow to the dust collection structure when the saw blade is in motion.
we agree with powell and conclude that the claim term dust collection structure is not subject to construction as a element under.here,the claim language at issue recites sufficiently definite structure.the claim term requires,in the context of the entire limitation,that the cutting box interior and the dust collection structure be in fluid communication with each other.see patent ll,ll.this requirement indicates interconnectedness between the cutting box interior and the dust collection structure,wherein the physical characteristics of the dust collection structure allow dust to pass from the cutting box and be collected by the dust collection structure.
the patent written description further confirms that the presumption against treatment is not rebutted.the written description depicts component parts of the dust collection structure,including a cutting box,dust collection outlet ports,and a dust collection tray.patent.the details of how this structure functions to collect dust are also disclosed,including that the c utting box functions to contain the sawdust and wood chips generated as the blade cuts through the wood and is adapted for connection to an external dust collection system.patent ll.
additionally,the written description identifies several prior art patents that disclose various types of dust collection structures.patent ll.pat.discloses a dust collector including a rectangular shroud having an inlet and a tapered tube extending rearwardly therefrom pat.discloses a dust collector comprising generally hood positioned at the rear of the work table pat.discloses a dust collector including a generally shroud.this disclosure indicates that the term dust collection structure is used by persons of skill in the pertinent art to designate structure and has a reasonably well understood meaning in the art.greenburg ethicon endo surgery.though home depot argues that we can not consider these patents because they were never before the district court on this issue,the patents are not only cited,but also discussed in detail in the background of the invention section of the written description.our cases establish that prior art cited in a patent or cited in the prosecution history of the patent constitutes intrinsic evidence.kumar ovonic battery,citing tate access floors,interface architectural,vitronics conceptronic.
in sum,the claim language,the disclosure in the written description,and the meaning to persons of ordinary skill indicate that home depot has failed to rebut the presumption that the claimed dust collection structure is not a limitation.
infringement 
the jury found that home depot saw guard literally infringes claims and of the patent,which require a cutting box interior in fluid communication with dust collection structure for collecting sawdust.patent ll.the district court denied home depot motion for jmol of noninfringement.home depot challenges the jury infringement verdict and district court denial of jmol in its favor,asserting that even under the court claim construction for dust collection structure,it does not infringe.it argues that the terms cutting box and dust collection structure are distinct terms and can only be infringed by a device that has separate structures corresponding to the distinct claim elements.citing becton,dickinson tyco healthcare group,home depot contends that when a claim lists elements separately,the accused device can not infringe if it does not also contain separate elements corresponding to the claimed elements.it asserts that powell infringement theory improperly divided the cutting box of the accused device to have a front half that allegedly meets the cutting box limitation and a rear half that allegedly meets the dust collection structure.this division of the accused device cutting box can not meet the claim requirement of having a separate cutting box and dust collection structure,home depot contends.
powell responds,arguing that the jury infringement verdict is supported by substantial evidence because even home depot expert agreed that the rear portion of the cutting box on the accused product serves to collect sawdust and woodchips and has at least one port to allow for extraction of the sawdust and wood chips.
we agree.becton is not to the contrary.there,the claim language did not suggest that the hinged arm and the spring means could be the same structure.becton,at.further,t he specification confirm ed that the spring means was a separate element from the hinged arm.id.thus,based on the intrinsic record,the terms hinged arm and spring means were construed to require separate structures a requirement which carried through to the infringement analysis.id.
here,the disclosure in the specification cuts against home depot argument that the cutting box and dust collection structure must be separate components for purposes of the infringement analysis.the specification discloses that the c utting box defines an internal chamber wherein the rotating saw blade meets the work piece during the cutting process and functions to contain the sawdust and wood chips generated as the blade cuts through the wood.patent ll.thus,the specification teaches that the cutting box may also function as a dust collection structure to collect sawdust and wood chips generated during the wood cutting process.it does not suggest that the claim terms require separate structures.see retractable,becton,dickinson,the claims and the specifications indicate that the needle holder and retainer member need not be separately molded pieces.see also ntp,research in motion,noting that the asserted claim language did not support a limitation requiring that the claimed rf receiver and destination processor be separate and distinct.nor are we convinced that the claim language in fluid communication requires that cutting box and dust collection structure be wholly separate structures.
turning back to the true infringement issue,under the district court claim construction for dust collection structure,the jury verdict is supported by substantial evidence.the experts agreed that the rear of the cutting box of the accused device was a place where sawdust and wood chips generated by the cutting process could collect.further,they agreed that the rear portion of the cutting box contained a port allowing for the extraction of sawdust and woodchips.thus,according to the experts,the two requirements of the district court claim construction for dust collecting structure were embodied within the accused product.the jury was entitled to rely on this testimony in finding that home depot infringed the patent.
claim construction 
like the term dust collection structure,the district court changed its initial construction of the term table top.from the bench,the court gave an oral charge,construing the term table top to mean 
the word table is a well understood concept in everyday parlance,in everyday language.the patent uses it in this sense.
it refers to a structure often used as a piece of furniture in a home or in a work setting.it is used to carry out a function at some height above the floor.now,the height of the table will depend on the function for which it is intended,and i used these examples,for example,under today custom,a coffee table is often lower than a dining table,while an altar table might be higher than a dining table.so the height of the table really depends on what it is going to be used for.
the top surface of the table is raised above the floor by one or more legs or a base or other supporting structure.normally,the top of the table is a horizontal surface on which an intended function can be performed,for example,eating,writing or working or displaying objects.
a table top is usually solid,but it may contain openings of various shapes and sizes to permit different functions.as one example,you will note the tables in the courtroom that are being used by the lawyers have a hole that has been cut in the top to accommodate electrical cables.now,the presence of these holes does not diminish the fact that the tables have tops,that is,there are horizontal surfaces on which functions are performed.
home depot challenges the district court construction,arguing that it is erroneous because it fails to impose an additional requirement that the table top function as a horizontal work surface to support lumber while being cut.specifically,it submits that the correct construction of table top is the structural component of a radial arm saw that has a flat top surface and is constructed to provide continuous support for the workpiece during the cutting operation.appellant br.at.powell responds,asserting that a functional requirement is unnecessary because the surrounding claim language indicates that a work surface is mounted to the table top.patent.he contends that this claim language already imposes a functional limitation requiring that the table top support a work surface.thus,he argues that it is not the table top that supports the lumber it is the work surface that supports the lumber while being cut.
we agree with the district court construction of table top,which does not impose an additional functional limitation.independent claims and require a work surface mounted to the table top and a planar top work surface mounted on the table top,respectively.patent.because this claim language already indicates that the table top functions to support the work surface,imposing the functional limitation that home depot seeks was not required.indeed,home depot argument conflates the role of the claimed table top and work surface.the work surface is mounted to the table top and it is the work surface that supports the workpiece,not the table top,as home depot argues.
the specification confirms the construed meaning of the claim language.in describing the related art,the specification indicates that a typical radial arm saw includes a work table having a horizontal flat top work surface the material to be cut,such as a piece of wood,is supported on the work surface.patent ll.in describing the actual invention,the patent discloses that s afety top includes a generally planar work surface.id.at ll.further,shows that work surface supports the workpiece during the cutting process.in view of the consistent disclosure in the claims and specification,the district court construction of table top is correct.
infringement 
the jury found that the table top limitation of claims and was literally infringed and the district court denied home depot motion for jmol in its favor.its noninfringement argument regarding table top is dependent on its claim construction argument for the same term,which we have rejected.it does not alternatively argue that the jury verdict is not supported by substantial evidence under the claim construction adopted by the district court.
it is undisputed that the assembly instructions for the accused device require removal of the original work surface and use of boards to create a structure used to support a new work surface,including the complete safety device assembly.indeed,powell expert testified that the accused product is modified to create a table top through the use of mounting boards affixed to the structure of the radial saw after the work surface is removed.home depot expert agreed that the mounting boards support the work surface that is later mounted to the existing radial saw assembly.thus,the jury was entitled to rely on this testimony in concluding that home depot infringes the patent table top element under the district court claim construction.
inequitable conduct 
we next turn to home depot argument that during a bench trial following the jury verdict the district court erroneously determined that powell did not commit inequitable conduct.in contrast to most inequitable conduct allegations,which involve the failure to disclose prior art,this case involves the patentee failure to update a petition to make special.
while prosecuting the patent application,powell filed a petition to make special,seeking expedited review on grounds that he was obligated to manufacture and supply devices embodying the claims sought.see mpep ed,july.powell believed that based on his ongoing negotiations and business relationship with home depot he was obligated to supply it with saw guards for radial arm saws located in each home depot store.before the petition was granted,however,it became clear that home depot would use industriaplex to supply saw guards in each of its stores.nevertheless,powell failed to update his petition to make special to indicate that he was not obligated to build and supply devices embodying the claims sought.eventually,the patent and trademark office pto granted the petition and powell patent application received expedited review.
based on the evidence,the district court determined that powell with intent to deceive failed to inform the pto that he was no longer under an obligation to manufacture.further,his intentional omission was deemed material.ultimately,however,the district court concluded that home depot failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that the patent was unenforceable based,in part,on the balance of equities.
during the pendency of this appeal,this court,sitting en banc,tackled issues surrounding inequitable conduct and raised the level of materiality required before a court may render a patent unenforceable.therasense,becton,dickinson,en banc.though the parties briefs focus on issues that are no longer relevant under current law,home depot maintained at oral argument that powell conduct,in failing to correct the petition,constitutes inequitable conduct under therasense.they knew that the statement in the petition to make special was not accurate he let it stand.oral argument at,available at.powell contends that his conduct can not constitute inequitable conduct under the materiality and affirmative egregious misconduct standards outlined by therasense.id.at.
where,as here,the patent applicant fails to update the record to inform the pto that the circumstances which support a petition to make special no longer exist that conduct does not constitute inequitable conduct.therasense,at.that is so because powell conduct obviously fails the materiality standard and is not the type of unequivocal act,such as the filing of an unmistakably false affidavit,that would rise to the level of affirmative egregious misconduct.id.at.thus,based on the intervening change in law,we affirm the district court conclusion that home depot did not establish by clear and convincing evidence that the patent is unenforceable due to inequitable conduct.
willful infringement 
the jury determined that powell had proven by clear and convincing evidence that home depot willfully infringed the asserted claims of the patent.the district court denied home depot motion for jmol in its favor.on appeal,it argues that it did not willfully infringe because its actions did not satisfy the objective prong of the willful infringement inquiry.for instance,it argues that the district court denial of powell request for a preliminary injunction and the closeness of the inequitable conduct case indicate that it did not act despite an objectively high likelihood of infringement.
powell responds with two points.first,he contends that home depot only argument regarding the objective reasonableness of its positions concerns issues that were not presented to the jury.thus,he asserts that the jury verdict is supported by substantial evidence based on the evidence that was before it.second,he contends that the question of willful infringement,under the objective prong,is a question of fact reserved only for the jury.appellee br.he faults home depot for never contending that it should have been allowed to present evidence to the jury regarding the district court initial claim construction and the bench trial on inequitable conduct.thus,the parties disagree as to whether the jury is the sole decider of the objective prong of the willful infringement inquiry and the type of evidence that may be presented to the jury regarding willful infringement.we address these disputes in turn.
under in re seagate technology,llc,a willful infringement determination requires a analysis entailing separate objective and subjective inquiries.as to the former,a patentee must show by clear and convincing evidence that the infringer acted despite an objectively high likelihood that its actions constituted infringement of a valid patent the state of mind of the accused infringer is not relevant to this objective inquiry.seagate,at.as to the latter,if the former is satisfied,the patentee must also demonstrate that this risk determined by the record developed in the infringement proceeding was either known or so obvious that it should have been known to the accused infringer.id.
since seagate,this court has required patentees to prove the objective prong of the willful infringement inquiry by clear and convincing evidence as a predicate to the jury consideration of the subjective prong.see depuy spine medtronic sofamor danek,declining to address the subjective prong when the objective prong had not been established see also uniloc usa,microsoft.w here an accused infringer relies on a reasonable defense to a charge of infringement,the objective prong tends not to be met.spine solutions,medtronic sofamor danek usa.
under the objective prong,the answer to whether an accused infringer reliance on a particular issue or defense is reasonable is a question for the court when the resolution of that particular issue or defense is a matter of law.see cohesive,waters,applying the clearly erroneous standard of review to the district court willful infringement determination under the objective prong based on the closeness of the claim construction inquiry.should the court determine that the infringer reliance on a defense was not objectively reckless,it can not send the question of willfulness to the jury,since proving the objective prong is a predicate to consideration of the subjective prong.see depuy,at.when the resolution of a particular issue or defense is a factual matter,however,whether reliance on that issue or defense was reasonable under the objective prong is properly considered by the jury uniloc,at given this court conclusion that uniloc failed to show that a reasonable jury could find microsoft conduct objectively reckless on the infringement evidence presented,this court need not address the subjective prong of seagate.in circumstances,then,where separate issues of fact and law are presented by an alleged infringer as defenses to willful infringement,the objective recklessness inquiry may require analysis by both the court and the jury.for instance,in this case,certain components of the case were before the jury,while others were not.the court decided issues of claim construction and inequitable conduct,neither of which was before the jury.thus,while the jury was in a position to consider how the infringement case weighed in the objective prong analysis,on other components such as claim construction the objective prong question was properly considered by the court 
turning to the facts of this case,the denial of a preliminary injunction and the question of unenforceability are both issues of law.thus,the district court properly considered both issues in analyzing whether the patentee proved the objective prong of the willful infringement inquiry.we detect no error in the district court determination that the objective prong of the willful infringement inquiry was met despite the denial of the preliminary injunction requested by powell.the court preliminary injunction denial was premised on a claim construction determination that the court ultimately abandoned or modified after the trial commenced.thus,we are not persuaded by the strength of home depot positions based on the preliminary injunction denial.likewise,we reach the same conclusion regarding the effect of home depot inequitable conduct argument on the objective prong of the willful infringement determination.after therasense,powell conduct,in failing to update his petition to make special,is not material or affirmative egregious misconduct.thus,we determine that the jury verdict is supported by substantial evidence and affirm the district court determination to deny judgment as a matter of law in favor of home depot on the issue of willful infringement.
this case presents an issue regarding a reasonable royalty.as sent to the jury,the question it was required to answer was what amount would powell have received from home depot for the right to use his patented invention in the united states.the jury awarded million,or approximately per unit,in damages as a reasonable royalty that powell would have received from home depot for the right to use his invention in the united states for the duration of the patent.a party challenging a jury verdict on damages must show that the award is,in view of all the evidence,either so outrageously high or so outrageously low as to be unsupportable as an estimation of a reasonable royalty.rite hite kelley,en banc quoting lindemann maschinenfabrik gmbh am.hoist derrick,f d.
first,we address home depot argument that a reasonable royalty can not exceed lost profits.on this point,we note that powell citation to golight,wal mart stores,for the proposition that t here is no rule that a royalty be no higher than the infringer net profit margin is not controlling.here,the point made by home depot is not that its net profit margin should set the upper bound of the reasonable royalty calculation.that argument is foreclosed by golight.rather,its argument is that powell can not recover more than his expected profits from selling saw guard units to home depot as a reasonable royalty.we disagree with home depot for two reasons.
the evidence presented to the jury indicates that had powell successfully negotiated a deal with home depot in prior to receiving his patent a conservative estimate of his expected profits from building and installing saw guards in each of home depot stores was per unit.here,however,the reasonable royalty must be based on the terms of a hypothetical licensing agreement reach
