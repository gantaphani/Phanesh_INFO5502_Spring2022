upon review of the defendants timely petition for rehearing,requesting that we reconsider that portion of our opinion granting the plaintiffs attorneys fees incident to this appeal,we agree that dadeland is not yet entitled to attorneys fees under the applicable florida statute.accordingly,we vacate that portion of our opinion,see cir,and substitute the following revised opinion in its place.
this case returns to us for disposition from the supreme court of florida,to which we certified five questions of florida state law.see dadeland depot,paul fire and marine ins,cir.based on the florida supreme court responses to those questions,see dadeland depot,paul fire and marine ins,so d,we now conclude that the district court erred in its disposition of the defendants summary judgment motion and of the plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment.accordingly,we reverse the grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants,grant the plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment,and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.we also grant the plaintiffs motion for attorneys fees on appeal,conditioned,however,on appellant ultimate recovery in the trial court.see mcdonald southeastern fid.ins,so d.
background 
the procedural history,facts,and issues of this case are summarized in our previous opinion,published at cir.for purposes of background,this appeal arises out of a lengthy and complicated dispute between dadeland station associates,and dadeland,collectively,dadeland,a lessor and manager of commercial properties,and paul fire and marine insurance and american home assurance collectively,paul,who acted as the sureties on a performance bond issued in connection with a shopping center that dadeland was developing.
a number of structural and design defects were subsequently discovered with the development,and the,paul,and the general contractor,walbridge contracting,walbridge entered into an arbitration proceeding to resolve the disputes over the construction.at the conclusion of the proceeding,dadeland obtained an award in the amount of for the contractor defective workmanship.paul,as surety,was bound to that award to the extent that the principal,walbridge,was bound.walbridge timely paid the award.
dadeland then brought this action in the fifteenth judicial circuit of florida,alleging that paul,as sureties,had acted with bad faith and had failed to perform its duties under the performance bond.specifically,dadeland alleged that paul had intentionally attempted to avoid and delay the arbitration as it had been unfolding that paul had effectively ignored its obligations under the bond by repeatedly failing to address dadeland complaints concerning the defects with the development and that paul had done so without ever conducting any independent investigation into dadeland complaints.dadeland asserted claims against paul for.stat.b,and unfair insurance practices.stat.a 
after removing this case to federal court,paul filed a motion for summary judgment or for judgment on the pleadings.dadeland filed a separate motion for partial summary judgment on the narrow question of whether paul was collaterally estopped from raising defenses that had been raised and disposed of in the earlier arbitration proceeding.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of paul on all counts of dadeland complaint,and denied dadeland motion for partial summary judgment.the district court then entered final judgment in favor of paul.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
dadeland argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of paul and in denying its motion for partial summary judgment.we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standard used by the district court.johnson bd.of regents,cir.under that standard,summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.citing.c.in reviewing the motion,we view the evidence and all factual inferences in a light most favorable to the party,and all reasonable doubts about the facts are resolved in favor of the.id.at citation and internal quotations omitted.
the plain language of rule c mandates the entry of summary judgment against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party case,and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.johnson,at quoting celotex catrett,d.that is,i f the party fails to make a sufficient showing on an essential element of his case with respect to which he has the burden of proof,then the court must enter summary judgment for the moving party.gonzalez lee county hous,cir quoting celotex,at.at.
in this case,the district court granted summary judgment for paul as a matter of law.more specifically,the district court decision hinged on three points of florida law first,the district court concluded that dadeland was not entitled to bring an action for a an insurance claim under.stat.b because it had not established the validity of the underlying claim,which is a condition precedent to bringing such an action under florida law.second,the district court concluded that the earlier arbitration proceeding would have a res judicata effect on dadeland current claim for damages against paul,and that,consequently,dadeland was now barred from com ing to this court to assert the same claim against paul.at.finally,the district court concluded that dadeland had failed to allege a general business practice on the part of paul,which the district court believed was a to bringing a claim under.stat.a.id.at.based on those determinations,it granted summary judgment in favor of paul.
as to dadeland separate motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of whether the earlier arbitration proceeding would collaterally estop paul from raising the same affirmative defenses in the current case,the district court concluded that the issue was moot in light of its prior finding that dadeland claims were barred by res judicata.accordingly,the district court denied dadeland motion for partial summary judgment on that issue.
on appeal,dadeland contends that the district court conclusions were legally erroneous,and that therefore summary judgment was improperly granted to paul.in addition,dadeland argues that the disposition of the arbitration proceeding collaterally estops paul from raising the same defenses in the current proceeding,and that therefore it was entitled to partial summary judgment on that issue.we address each of these contentions in turn,guided by the unambiguous responses of the florida supreme court to the questions that we certified.
district court grant of summary judgment in favor of paul 
as a preliminary issue,we address the question of dadeland standing to bring an action for an insurance claim under.stat.b.under the language of florida insurance code,any person may bring a civil action against an insurer when the insurer does not attempt in good faith to settle claims when,under all the circumstances,it could and should have done so,had it acted fairly and honestly toward its insured and with due regard for her or his interests.stat.b.the district court began its summary judgment order by querying whether an of a surety bond constituted an insured for purposes of the statute.the court also questioned whether the contractual obligations imposed in a surety relationship could properly be construed as insurance claims so as to give rise to a cause of action under.stat.b.noting the differences between a traditional insurance relationship and a suretyship,the district court expressed doubt as to whether an obligee may sue a surety under the bad faith insurer provision for its alleged refusal to perform its contractual duties.at.the district court assumed,for purposes of its disposition,that an was an insured who could bring an action against a surety under b.
although the district court did not rule on the issue,we found that,as a threshold matter,the question of dadeland standing to bring a b was important enough that it warranted clarification by the florida supreme court.therefore,we certified the following question to the florida supreme court 
is the obligee of a surety contract considered an insured such that the obligee has the right to sue the surety for refusal to settle claims under b 
dadeland,at.
the florida supreme court answered that question in the affirmative.in its response,the court considered a number of factors,including its prior case law the fact that a surety is defined elsewhere in the florida insurance code as an insurer,see.stat.the plain language of b other jurisdictions treatment of the question and the legislative history of b.after a detailed analysis,the court unambiguously held that an obligee in a surety relationship does indeed constitute an insured for purposes of b.in light of that response,it is clear,as a preliminary matter,that dadeland,as obligee,has standing to pursue this action against paul,its surety,for its alleged.we now turn to the district court disposition of dadeland claim.
whether dadeland satisfied the condition precedent under b 
in its summary judgment order,the district court observed that,in order to bring a claim under b,a plaintiff had to establish that he was entitled to a payment of the claim,either via a judicial adjudication of damages in the plaintiff favor or via a settlement agreement in dadeland case,the arbitration panel imposed liability on dadeland contractor,walbridge,in the amount of,and then stated in its decision that t he surety is bound to this award to the extent that its principal is obligated under the award and its defenses are denied,exh.at.the district court concluded,however,that the arbitration panel decision was not sufficient to establish that dadeland was entitled to payment of its claim under the performance bond with paul.in the absence of some judicial determination that paul had breached an obligation under the performance bond and was liable for a sum certain,the court concluded that dadeland had failed to satisfy the condition precedent necessary for an action for the a claim,and that,therefore,its action failed as a matter of law.at.accordingly,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of paul.
dadeland appeals that decision,arguing that the arbitration panel award,and its finding that paul was bound by it to the extent that walbridge was unable to pay it,was sufficient to establish the condition precedent necessary to bringing a b claim under florida law.because we were unclear as to the effect of the arbitration panel earlier decision on dadeland action,we certified the following question to the florida supreme court 
is the arbitrator finding that a surety principal has breached its duty to the obligee,and that the surety is bound to the arbitration award to the extent that its principal is bound,sufficient to satisfy the condition precedent to a later claim that there be a prior adjudication that the plaintiffs were entitled to a payment of a claim from the sureties 
dadeland,at.
the florida supreme court answered this question in the affirmative.the court observed that a plaintiff bringing a b action for an insurer a claim only needs to establish the validity of the underlying claim.the court held that this threshold would be satisfied by alleging that a determination has been made with regard to the existence of liability on the part of an uninsured principal and the extent of the plaintiff damages.dadeland,so d at citation omitted.
in the context of dadeland case,the court concluded that an arbitration panel award of damages against an uninsured principal was a sufficient determination of liability so as to show the validity of the insured underlying claim against the insurer.the court observed that the arbitration panel had made clear that the principal walbridge had breached a duty to the obligee,dadeland,and that paul,as the surety on the bond,was bound to the extent of walbridge liability.it found that this evidence was sufficient to establish the validity of dadeland underlying claim against paul,and that therefore dadeland had satisfied the condition precedent necessary to bringing a b action.thus,under florida law,dadeland was entitled to proceed with its claim against paul.
in light of the florida supreme court response to this question,we conclude that the district court erred in concluding that dadeland had failed to satisfy the condition precedent necessary to bringing a b action and in granting summary judgment for paul on that basis.
applicability of res judicata on dadeland action 
the district court further concluded that dadeland claim against paul was barred by the doctrine of res judicata.the court suggested that dadeland claim against paul was more properly construed as a breach of contract claim for its refusal to perform under the terms of the bond.finding that dadeland could have and should have brought that claim in its earlier arbitration proceeding,the court stated that res judicata would bar dadeland from bringing its current action against paul 
dadeland appeals that decision,arguing that its present action is a separate count against paul for its a standard breach of contract that dadeland could not have possibly asserted that count against paul in the arbitration proceeding,because at the time of the arbitration it had not yet established the validity of its underlying claim.because we were unclear as to the effect of the earlier arbitration on dadeland action,we certified the following question to the florida supreme court 
is the arbitrator decision res judicata,thus barring dadeland later claim against the sureties for refusal to settle 
dadeland,at.
the florida supreme court answered that question in the negative.it agreed with dadeland that its current claim was separate and independent from any breach of contract claim that dadeland might have asserted in the arbitration proceeding.in addition,the court agreed that dadeland b action had not yet accrued at the time of the arbitration proceeding,as dadeland had not yet established a breach on the part of walbridge or an entitlement to payment under the performance bond.because dadeland b action had not yet accrued at the time of the arbitration,the court concluded that res judicata would not bar dadeland from bringing its b claim in the present action.
in light of the florida supreme court response,it is clear that res judicata does not bar dadeland from pursuing the current b action against paul.the district court erred in concluding otherwise,and in granting summary judgment to paul on that basis.
requirement of a general business practice to pursue an unfair trade claim in connection with a action 
the district court also concluded that dadeland did not present evidence to establish that paul alleged conduct constituted a general business practice.the court stated that in order for a plaintiff to bring a i action against an the conduit of plaintiff was required to provide evidence that the unfair settlement practice complained of was a general business practice.at.because dadeland had failed to allege a general business practice on the part of paul,the court construed dadeland i claim as being waived 
because the florida supreme court had not addressed whether eliminated the need for proof of a general business practice,we certified the following question to the florida supreme court 
does the language in b eliminate requirement of proof of a general business practice when the plaintiff is pursuing an unfair trade claim through the right of action provided in 
dadeland,at emphasis omitted.the florida supreme court answered that question in the affirmative,holding that the plain language of b made clear that a plaintiff suing under does not need to allege a general business practice.the court construed the exceptional language of b as applying to in its entirety,and,accordingly,concluded that the need for a general business practice was eliminated when an unfair trade count was sought pursuant to.
in light of the answer of the florida supreme court,is clear that dadeland was not obligated to allege a general business practice in order to assert a claim through the cause of action provided in.the district court erred in concluding otherwise,and in treating dadeland claim as being waived.the response of the florida supreme court makes clear that it was improper to grant summary judgment for paul on that basis.
genuine issues of fact 
despite the fact that the district court committed the foregoing errors of florida law in granting summary judgment for paul,we might nevertheless affirm the district court grant of summary judgment for paul if we found there were no genuine issues of material fact remaining in the dispute between paul and dadeland.rule makes clear that w hen a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided in this rule,an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the adverse party pleading,but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.e.a dispute about a material fact is genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the party.jeffery sarasota white sox,cir per curiam quoting anderson liberty lobby,d.the inquiry is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.id.quoting anderson,at.at.
the million performance bond that was issued in connection with dadeland construction project set forth paul obligations as surety on the bond.its relevant provisions state that paul obligations shall arise after dadeland has declared a contractor default and has formally terminated the contractor right to complete the contract,exh.a at.when that condition is met,the bond states that paul shall promptly and at paul expense take one of the following actions 
arrange for the contractor,with the consent of dadeland,to perform and complete the construction contract or 
undertake to perform and complete the construction contract itself or 
obtain bids and negotiated proposals from qualified contractors acceptable to dadeland for a contract performance and completion of the construction contract or 
waive its right to take those steps and with reasonable promptness under the circumstances 
after investigation,determine the amount for which it may be liable to dadeland,and,as soon as practicable after the amount is determined,tender payment therefor to dadeland or 
deny liability in whole or in part and notify dadeland citing reasons therefor.
exh.a at emphasis added.thus,under the terms of the bond,once dadeland had declared a contractor default on the part of walbridge,paul was legally obligated either to arrange for the contractor to complete the project,to obtain a satisfactory substitute contractor to complete the project,or,with reasonable promptness,to investigate the matter and determine the extent of its liability to dadeland,or to d eny liability in whole or in part and notify dadeland,citing reasons therefor.id.the outstanding issue of fact pertains to whether,and to what extent,paul acted reasonably and in good faith in light of these obligations.
the evidence in the record suggests that dadeland discovered structural and design defects in connection with the project as early as dadeland also discovered that the project,as completed,was in violation of a number of provisions of the south florida building code.although the facts show that paul was made aware of these the dispute between dadeland and the contractor as far as who bore responsibility for early as,the district court found,properly,we believe,that dadeland did not formally declare a contractor default until december.thus it was not until december that paul obligations to act under the bond were officially triggered.
in its letter,dated december,dadeland wrote to paul,declaring that walbridge had failed to perform the construction contract satisfactorily,and stating that dadeland was hereby declar ing a contractor default and was formally terminat ing the contractor right to complete the contract perform corrective work on the project,exh.in that letter dadeland demanded that paul immediately take action in accordance with paragraph of the bond.id.the letter also stated if the sureties did not take action within five business days of this letter,the sureties failure to take action shall be considered a failure to perform with reasonable promptness id.quotations added.
paul responded to dadeland on december,and indicated that it was in the process of conducting an investigation into dadeland allegations,exh.the letter assured dadeland that paul would follow up with dadeland on december,but there is no evidence that it did so.thus,the following day,december,dadeland again wrote to paul,indicating that paul had not taken action nor advised of the action they intend ed to take with respect to walbridge default on the project,exh.in addition to demanding that paul take action in accordance with paragraph of the bond,the letter stated that if paul failed to take steps to honor its obligations under the bond within fifteen days of its letter,paul would be deemed in default on the bond,pursuant to paragraph it is clear from the facts that paul did not respond within fifteen days in fact,its next correspondence with dadeland did not arrive until january.
in that january letter,paul took the position that walbridge had performed as required by the contract documents,exh.in addition,paul stated a s to any defective work for which walbridge and the subcontractors may have responsibility,walbridge has either had the appropriate subcontractors correct the work,or remains willing to have them do so.id.the letter also stated that walbridge bore no responsibility for the design defects at the development.id.finally,paul stated that it was not in a position to take over for walbridge,and thus recommended that dadeland cooperate with walbridge to bring this matter to a final resolution.id.
a month later,in february,dadeland filed notice of an insurer violation with the florida department of insurance,alleging that its general contractor had failed to perform the construction contract,that dadeland had repeatedly notified paul of the problems and declared a contractor default,but that paul,without any investigation,refused to perform any of its obligations under the bond,exh.subsequent correspondence ensued between dadeland and paul.in july,dadeland advised that walbridge had made only a token effort at completing the work under the permit that was issued to them,exh.b at.dadeland letter again stated that paul had failed to honor its obligations under the bond,and that as a result it was in danger of losing the construction project.the letter listed a panoply of defects contained at the development,and it emphatically demanded paul take steps to address these problems.in response to this letter,paul indicated that the issue of liability for the defects remained an open question,that walbridge continued to deny responsibility for the defects,and that these issues were being adequately and thorough addressed via the arbitration proceeding between the parties.
dadeland wrote to paul again in september,stating that its position that it was both irresponsible and inappropriate for paul to rely solely on information obtained from the contractor,walbridge,thereby intimating that paul was to undertake an independent investigation into the defects contained in the development.the letter also made clear that,in light of the fact that walbridge had allegedly violated both state and county regulations in building the development,at a minimum it was entitled to at least a portion of its claims directly from paul at this time,exh.f.in paul response,the surety indicated that it strongly disagreed with dadeland continued assertions regarding lack of investigation in this matter by paul,exh.paul stated that had conduct ed a good and proper investigation of dadeland allegations,which paul believed were subject to the arbitration.
in a final missive,sent february,dadeland observed that the contractor had been conclusively found by the county board of rules and appeals to be in violation of applicable building codes,and that,meanwhile,paul had not provided cents as reimbursement toward the millions of dollars that have been spent correcting clearly deficient work performed by walbridge,exh.j.the letter accused paul of sit ting idly by and ignor ing its obligations under the performance bond,for which dadeland paid an approximately premium.id.over a year after this correspondence,dadeland,having in the interim obtained a favorable judgment from the arbitration panel for walbridge defective construction,brought the present action against paul,alleging that it acted in bad faith both in delaying the arbitration proceeding and in totally ignor ing their duties under the terms of the performance bond,exh at.
in its motion for summary judgment,paul contended that there was no evidence that it breached its obligations under the performance bond,and that therefore it was entitled to summary judgment on dadeland claim.specifically,paul argued that paragraph of the performance bond did not obligate paul to correct the construction deficiencies,if,in lieu of doing so,it denied liability in whole or in part and,with reasonable promptness under the circumstances,notified dadeland,citing reasons therefor,exh.a at.paul contended that it had done so,with its response of january it stated that walbridge had performed as required by the construction contract documents,exh.that therefore there was no outstanding factual issue as to whether it had acted with bad faith.the district court apparently agreed with this characterization,although it did not make an express finding on the point.in its summary judgment order,the court stated its view that the sureties performed all that they were required to do under the bond,at,thereby implying that there were no remaining issues of fact as to whether paul acted with bad faith.
we disagree.florida statute obligates an insurer to act in good faith and with due regard for the interests of the insured.farinas.farm bureau ins,so d,pet.for review denied,so d citation and internal quotations omitted.see also.stat.b requiring an insurer to act fairly and honestly toward its insured,and with due regard for her or his interests.the statutory provision is grounded in the common law obligation of good faith that was traditionally imposed on insurers,which obligated insurers to refrain from acting solely on the basis of their own interests rather than those of the insured party.farinas,so d at citation and internal quotations omitted.the florida supreme court has held that,at its essence,the duty of good faith requires an insurer to use the same degree of care and diligence as a person of ordinary care and prudence should exercise in the management of his own business.boston old colony ins.gutierrez,so d.although the typical insurance case hinges on an allegation that the insurer breached its contractual duties,the florida supreme court has also stated that b ecause the duty of good faith involves diligence and care in the investigation and evaluation of the claim negligence is relevant to the question of good faith.id.at citation omitted.
in dadeland case,we find that there remain questions of material fact as to whether paul acted in good faith and with due regard for the interests of its insured,dadeland,including whether paul adequately investigated dadeland complaints of a default on the part of the contractor and whether paul adhered to its obligations under the terms of the performance bond.these outstanding fact questions are sufficient for dadeland to withstand a motion for summary judgment.
as to the first issue,in construing the insurer duty of good faith in other contexts,the florida supreme court has stated that an insurer has a duty to use diligence and care in the investigation and evaluation of an insured case.boston old colony,so d at.see also farinas,so d at stating that the insurer must investigate the facts underlying a claim in the interests of reaching a final settlement.here,this duty to investigate the insured case arises not necessarily by virtue of a contractual provision,but rather by virtue of the insurer duty of good faith and fair dealing.
we find that there remain issues of material fact as to whether paul conducted a sufficient investigation in response to dadeland formal declaration of a default on the part of walbridge.dadeland has proffered evidence that paul neither had any direct conversations with dadeland in response to its default letter,nor did it hire any consultants,engineers,or experts to determine the responsibilities of the parties with respect to the deficiencies.see at.although dadeland repeatedly protested that paul denials of liability were based on the reliances of the than any independent investigation on the part of response paul stated only that it strongly disagreed with dadeland continued assertions regarding lack of investigation in this matter by paul,exh.paul never elaborated in the parties correspondence as to what investigation if any it was conducting in connection with the dispute.
in light of this evidence,we agree that factual issues remain as to whether paul acted with good or bad faith,or whether its conduct was reasonable under all of the circumstances.although the terms of the performance bond may not,by its express terms,have necessarily required paul to conduct an investigation into the defects at the construction site,dadeland proffered suggests a failure on the part of paul to conduct a thorough investigation into the contractor sufficient to give rise to fact questions as to whether paul acted reasonably,with due care,and with regard to the interests of its insured,dadeland.
second,the evidence raises questions of fact as to whether paul did in fact adhere to its obligations under the bond.specifically,the evidence suggests that paul failed to act in a timely manner with respect to dadeland allegation of a contractor default,as it was required to do.under the terms of the bond,after being initially advised of walbridge default,paul was obligated either to commence rectifying the matter,or,with reasonable promptness,to determine the amount for which it was liable or d eny liability in whole or in part and notify dadeland of same,exh.a at.after being advised of walbridge default on december being asked to honor its obligations under the bond within five.paul failed to take any of these steps.rather,on december it responded and stated only that it was in the process of conducting an investigation into the dispute,exh.its formal denial of liability pursuant to paragraph did not come until a month later,on january raising a jury question as to whether paul acted with reasonable promptness,as it was required to do.
additionally,the evidence suggests that paul did not adhere to paragraph of the bond,which obligated paul to act within fifteen days of receiving an additional written demand from dadeland,or to be deemed in default of its commitments.the record established that paul failed to do so dadeland served its additional written letter on paul on december,demanding that paul honor its obligations under the bond,but paul response in which it finally invoked its right to deny liability under paragraph did not arrive until january beyond the period required by the bond terms not only does this evidence suggest that paul belated response arguably placed it in default of its commitments under the bond,but,viewed in context with all of the factual circumstances,it creates triable issues of material fact as to whether paul acted in a timely manner and with reasonable care towards its insured,dadeland,or whether it engaged in a concerted attempt to avoid its commitments under the bond by engaging in dilatory tactics.
viewed in a light most favorable to dadeland,the nonmoving party,and resolving all reasonable doubts in its favor,see johnson,at,we find there are outstanding fact issues as to whether paul acted in good faith and in accordance the terms of bond,or whether its conduct constituted an effort to engage in a pattern of delay and denial.accordingly,the district court summary judgment in favor of paul was improper.see,berges infinity ins,so d,w here material issues of fact which would support a jury finding of bad faith
