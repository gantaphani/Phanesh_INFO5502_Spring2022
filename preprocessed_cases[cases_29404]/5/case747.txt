this case raises a question about an award of attorney fees to a prevailing party under the civil rights attorney fees awards act of.after the underlying claims,which challenged the constitutionality of both state and local zoning regulations,were disposed of through dismissals,partial summary judgments,a repeal of the relevant portion of the local statute,and a final dismissal for mootness,the district court granted the plaintiffs motion for attorney fees.for the following reasons,we affirm.
background 
the issue on appeal can be succinctly stated did the district court correctly award attorney fees to palmetto as a prevailing party under however,prevailing party is a legal term of art,generally meaning a party in whose favor a judgment is rendered buckhannon bd.care home,vir.of health and human,d quotation omitted.in buckhannon,the supreme court demonstrated that,although the issue and definition can be pithily put,in order to determine whether an award of attorney fees would be appropriate,a meticulous analysis of the particular judgments and orders entered in a case is necessary.mcgrath toys r us,cir.we have done so in the past,see,fed of adver.indus.representatives,city of chicago,cir federation,and to do so here,we now review the underlying facts and procedural posture of this case.
palmetto properties,and george schirmer collectively,palmetto sought to open an adult entertainment nightclub or cabaret in dupage county,illinois.according to county ordinance section,palmetto strip club is classified as an adult business use because the expose specified anatomical areas engage in specified sexual activities.dupage county ordinance likewise,the club is an adult entertainment facility under state law.comp.stat.
while both the state and county regulate the location of these adult businesses,after the state adopted its first such zoning law in,the two regulations differed in material respects.first,under the law as adopted in,dupage county required all adult businesses to locate in a zoning district designated industrial and banned such establishments from locating within feet of other adult businesses,or within feet of certain residentially zoned districts or any church,school,library,park or other publicly operated recreational facility.dupage county zoning ord.but the law adopted by the state in banned all adult businesses from locating within feet of the property boundaries of any school,day care center,cemetery,public park,forest preserve,public housing,and place of religious worship.comp.stat.emphasis added.consequently,in december of,after the state adopted its regulation,the county amended its ordinance to add various categories of land use from which adult business must be separated and increase the required separation distance from to feet.dupage county zoning ord.the county zoning restriction thereby mirrored the state.
second,the county ordinance stated that its purpose was to eliminate the adverse effects of adult businesses,such as the blighting or downgrading of surrounding neighborhoods.dupage county zoning ord.in adopting that law,the county relied upon a study conducted by the city of indianapolis,which had adopted a similar separation requirement,and upon a survey done by dupage and cook counties.the state statute,however,contained no such statement of policy,nor did its legislative history reveal any studies or reports relied upon by the illinois general assembly.and when the county amended its ordinance in solely to incorporate the state law,no new studies were conducted,nor earlier studies reevaluated,and the statement of policy went unchanged.
the land palmetto obtained and partially developed for the proposed adult business complied with all of the locational limits set out in the county and state regulations,save one.the parcel was feet,more than,but less than feet from the boundary of pratt wayne woods forest preserve,much of which is not accessible to the public as a result,palmetto feared that the county state would prevent the nightclub opening based upon the forest preservation separation requirement.palmetto sued dupage county,the forest preserve district of dupage county,joseph birkett in his official capacity as dupage county state attorney,and jim ryan in his official capacity as illinois attorney general,arguing that the state and local laws were violations of the first and fourteenth amendments.specifically,in its third amended complaint,palmetto alleged that the forest preserve separation requirement,under either law,was facially unconstitutional because it was unsupported by a substantial governmental interest the forest preserve separation requirement,under either law,was unconstitutional as applied to palmetto and both laws were facially unconstitutional in toto because they effected a complete ban of protected speech in dupage county 
between february of and march of,the district court was inundated with a flurry of motions to dismiss,motions,responsive pleadings,and competing fact statements,resulting in a total of at least filings.early in the course of the proceedings,however,illinois attorney general ryan was dismissed from the suit because palmetto failed to overcome the presumption of ryan eleventh amendment immunity.this determination was not appealed.
finally,on march,the district court issued its order,which sorted through myriad issues.first,the forest preserve district motion for summary judgment was granted because the district has no connection to the enforcement of the dupage ordinance or the illinois statute and there is no district ordinance or policy at issue here.second,the court found that because palmetto claims were rooted in the first amendment,palmetto was entitled to rely on the impact of the ordinance s on the expressive activities of others as well as its own,and hence,the case was ripe for adjudication.third,state attorney birkett eleventh amendment immunity barred palmetto suit with respect to the state law,but not with respect to the county ordinance therefore,only the county of dupage and birkett only with respect to the county ordinance remained as defendants hereinafter collectively defendants or county.
reaching the merits,the district court held that the state and local zoning forest preserve separation requirements were neither supported by a significant government interest nor narrowly tailored because neither entity presented any evidence or prior case law to demonstrate that strip clubs negatively impact areas of forest preserves not open to the public and both restrictions failed to leave open reasonable alternative means of communication.uncertain as to whether the district court struck down the entirety of the county ordinance or simply the forest preserve segment,defendants asked the district court to clarify its judgment.the court did so on april,and specifically declared only the portion of ordinance section referring to forest preserves unconstitutional 
presumably wanting to avoid further litigation,the defendants informed the district court and palmetto that,instead of appealing,the offending provision of the ordinance would be amended or repealed.hence,while the county pursued such action,the district court continued the case in lieu of entering a final order to officially close the action.as promised,the forest preserve separation requirement was repealed palmetto was therefore free to operate its proposed nightclub.following its opening,the district court dismissed the lawsuit as moot on january.
palmetto then petitioned for an award of attorney fees from the defendants as a prevailing party under.while there was no dispute as to the amount claimed,the defendants adamantly argued that palmetto was not a prevailing party.the district court disagreed.after carefully analyzing buckhannon and noting that palmetto did not request fees related to claims never addressed on the merits,see supra notes and,the district court awarded to palmetto.this appeal resulted and,for the following reasons,we affirm the district court award.

standard of review 
under a prevailing party is entitled to a reasonable attorney fee.when analyzing a district court grant or denial of such fees,we review de novo the lower court purely legal conclusions.federation,at.but factual matters underlying the fee award,such as the fee amount and a party ultimate litigation goals,are reviewed for clear error.cady city of chicago,cir.because the county challenges only whether the district court inappropriately extended the definition of a prevailing party,our review here is de novo.
buckhannon and its progeny 
in buckhannon,the supreme court interpreted prevailing party under the provision of the fair housing amendments act of fhaa,c.because nearly all federal provisions use this term of art,see,the buckhannon court encouraged consistent interpretation,when possible,across the federal statutes.see at.although we have not gone so far as to hold that buckhannon applies to all statutes,we have held that it is conclusively presumed to so apply absent a clearly contrary indication in the text,structure,or legislative history of a particular statute lagrange school dist,cir internal quotations omitted.therefore,we followed the strictures of buckhannon in the two cases recently brought before this court which required interpretation of prevailing party,supra federation,supra.in federation,we expressly held that it is abundantly clear that buckhannon applies to the term as used in.federation,at.in short,whether palmetto is entitled to attorney fees under depends upon the application of buckhannon,and federation.
the supreme court in buckhannon upheld a denial of attorney fees where a defendant voluntarily mooted the action.buckhannon,at.a corporation operating residences sued the state of west virginia and other individual and agency state actors,claiming that a particular provision of a state statute violated the fhaa.id.at.the state legislature repealed the contested provision,thereby mooting the suit,while discovery was still pending and prior to any substantive judicial determinations.id.at.specifically rejecting the catalyst theory,the court emphasized that a defendant voluntary change in conduct,although perhaps accomplishing what the plaintiff sought to achieve by the lawsuit,lacks the necessary judicial imprimatur on the change.id.at.emphasis in original.the court also discounted arguments about defendants incentives to avoid fees,noting that such considerations were too speculative and thus unhelpful because,depending on the case,a defendant fear of fees may or may not be as significant as its fear of monetary damages,if liable.id.at.finally,the court stated that if the catalyst theory applied,major,yet wholly tangential,litigation would likely result because a district court would need to delve into a highly factbound analysis of a defendant subjective motivations in changing its conduct.id.at.thus,the court held that in order to be a prevailing party,a litigant must have obtained a judgment on the merits,a consent decree,or some other judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties.at.citing hanrahan hampton,d per curiam maher gagne,d texas state teachers ass garland independent sch,d.
in,the parents of a student suffering from attention deficit disorder claimed that the defendant school district deprived the student of a free appropriate public education under the individuals with disabilities education act idea,d a,and appealed to the district court an administrative adjudication which proposed to place the student in a regular classroom,instead of authorizing placement at a private day school.at.specifically,we considered whether the plaintiff was entitled to attorney fees where for summary judgment had been filed,but when the parties negotiated a settlement agreement before any rulings by the district court.in the agreement,the defendant acquiesced to nearly all the plaintiff of the student in a special program in a public school,and reimbursement to the parents for tuition and all costs relating to the student prior attendance at the day school.at.importantly,the settlement agreement contained no provision regarding attorney fees.id.at.after concluding that buckhannon applies to idea,id.at,we found that while most private settlement agreements do not entail the judicial approval and oversight involved in consent decrees,some do,in which case a settlement agreement can be the basis for an award of attorney fees.id.at internal quotation omitted.but in,despite the fact that the district court was actively involved in the settlement negotiations,the agreement was not embodied in a court order or judgment did not bear the judge signature and did not give the district court continuing jurisdiction to enforce the agreement.id.at.see also toms taft,cir holding that a settlement conference was insufficient to make the plaintiff a prevailing party.hence,we concluded that it was merely a private settlement agreement between the parties,lacking the judicial imprimatur necessary to convey prevailing party status.id.
in federation,an advertising trade association sued the city of chicago,alleging that an ordinance prohibiting the placement of alcohol and cigarette advertisements on billboards,sides of buildings,and freestanding signboards violated the first amendment and was preempted by federal and state statutes.at.in,the trade association moved for summary judgment on both the first amendment and preemption claims.although no ruling was made on the first amendment claims,the district court held that all portions of the ordinance relating to cigarette advertising were preempted by federal law and that the portions relating to alcohol were not severable.id.the city appealed the preemption determination,and we reversed in large part,finding that only a tiny provision of the ordinance was preempted by federal law and the ordinance was severable.fed of adver.indus.representatives,city of chicago,cir.
subsequently,the city amended the ordinance to remove the preempted portion and other provisions,the constitutionality of which had been seriously called into question by greater new orleans broadcasting ass united states,d.at.
the trade association then amended its complaint to drop the preemption claim and to entirely eliminate its challenge to the portions of the ordinance.id.in,the association again moved for summary judgment on its remaining first amendment claims.but before the city filed its response,the supreme court decided lorillard tobacco reilly,d,which held that a statute similar to the challenged ordinance was preempted by federal law.id.the city then filed a to dismiss based upon mootness,indicating that although the city believed its statute was materially different from the lorillard ordinance,the risks of going forward in light of lorillard had persuaded it to repeal the ordinance.id.the city did indeed repeal the ordinance,and the district court then dismissed the case and denied the trade association request for attorney fees under.id.
upon appeal of the district court denial of fees,we analyzed exactly what,if any,judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties the trade association had achieved.first,we pointed out that while the district court originally granted its motion for summary judgment on preemption grounds,we reversed the core holding of that decision.simply because we affirmed a tiny portion of the original district court decision certainly does not make the trade association a prevailing party,particularly when our holding provided the association no relief at all.at.
second,we assumed,arguendo,that the city repeal of the statute was not voluntary,instead compelled by the combination of the supreme court decision in lorillard and the association motion for summary judgment.however,because neither the city nor the trade association were parties to that case,we concluded that there was no judgment that changed the legal relationship between the parties in this case,id.emphasis in original,and we affirmed the district court denial of attorney fees.
