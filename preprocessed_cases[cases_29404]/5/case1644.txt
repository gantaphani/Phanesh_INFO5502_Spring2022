to determine the applicability of section,the statute,we look to the gravamen of the instant action.rather than focusing on the gravamen of this action,which was that the pebble defendants allegedly purchased the coalition confidential documents,the trial court focused on the injury to the coalition,which was forced to defend itself in the apoc proceeding.however,the gravamen of an action is the allegedly wrongful and conduct,not the damage which flows from said conduct.here,the gravamen of the coalition action is the allegation that the pebble defendants wrongfully purchased its confidential documents.said purchase was not an act by defendants in furtherance of their right of petition or free speech.therefore,the trial court erred in granting the special motion to strike.

factual and procedural background 
the coalition commenced this action on march,and filed the operative first amended complaint on march,naming the three pebble defendants as well as robert kaplan kaplan not a party to this appeal.
the complaint pled in pertinent part 
pebble mine is a proposed mine for copper,gold and other metals in southwest alaska,in the headwaters of bristol bay.pebble lp is an alaska limited partnership undertaking the mine development.pebble is an alaska corporation operating as the general partner of the limited partnership.the jermain law firm,located in anchorage,represented clients pebble and pebble lp.
the coalition is an alaska nonprofit corporation which opposed the mine project and seeks to preserve alaska fishing and hunting resources,including the land and waters that the fishing and hunting stock need to survive.
in,opposition to pebble mine coalesced in the alaska clean water ballot initiative,ballot measure,which would have impeded or blocked the mine development.
in april,the coalition contracted with fund raising,fri,a california corporation,which is in the business of raising money for political campaigns.kaplan is the principal and sole shareholder of.as a professional fundraiser,kaplan knew his clients considered their communications confidential,and that his clients relied on him not to disclose their internal,confidential communications related to the political campaign.
in september,after the defeat of ballot measure,the coalition terminated its contract with.a dispute then arose concerning what amounts,if any were still due to fri under the contract.
although the contract called for the fee dispute to be resolved by arbitration in california,kaplan contacted the alaska attorneys who had represented the pebble mine interests in the recently concluded election campaign.kaplan intent in doing so was twofold he did so as part of a plan to threaten the coalition with disclosure of its confidential campaign correspondence to the coalition opponents in the event the coalition failed to pay fri all amounts that kaplan considered due under the contract and he did so with the intent of selling his client confidential campaign communications to the coalition opponents,in order to raise funds with which to sue his clients for amounts kaplan considered due under the contract.
in early,attorney matthew singer of the jermain firm met with kaplan in los angeles under the guise of considering whether to have jermain represent fri in its fee dispute with the coalition.jermain declined to represent fri in the matter.however,kaplan gave jermain copies of confidential communications between kaplan and the coalition,and jermain gave kaplan a check for,drawn on the law firm bank account.
a few weeks after obtaining the confidential documents,jermain used those documents to prepare and file a formal complaint with the apoc.jermain brought the complaint on behalf of its clients,pebble and pebble lp.the apoc complaint alleged the coalition and other nonprofits had violated alaskan election law,primarily,that the nonprofits were used to shield from public view the fact that substantial contributions in support of the ballot initiative were being made by one individual,robert gillam gillam.
the actions of jermain and its clients in bringing the apoc complaint achieved their aim of undermining the coalition.for example,the moore foundation advised the coalition that due to bad publicity surrounding the apoc proceeding,it would not renew an intended annual grant of million.
in the apoc proceeding,the coalition admitted it had failed to report as campaign expenditures the cost of sending emails to members urging them to vote yes on the ballot measure,and the cost of making space available for campaign materials on the coalition folding table at the alaska state fair.the coalition disputed all other charges.
the apoc complaint was ultimately settled in early with no finding of liability against gillam,the coalition or the other nonprofits.apoc staff explicitly acknowledged the respondents to its complaint had asserted their positions in good faith,and that substantial evidence showed the respondents took substantial efforts to obtain and rely on proper advice in order to comply with the requirements of alaska law.the apoc complaint was settled for a payment of,which was about half of what apoc spent to prosecute the matter and much less than the expense of having to defend the matter at trial.
based on the above,the coalition superior court complaint pled causes of action against kaplan for breach of fiduciary duty,breach of professional duty,negligence,interference with prospective economic advantage,and unjust enrichment.
as against the pebble defendants,the complaint asserted two causes of action interference with contract fourth cause of action,and interference with prospective economic advantage sixth cause of action.the coalition pled 
jermain was aware of the coalition contract with fri,and jermain was given a copy of the contract,which restricted fri ability to disclose confidential communications.notwithstanding its knowledge of the agreement,jermain induced fri to breach the contract by offering to pay,and paying,in exchange for fri delivery of confidential communications between kaplan and the coalition.in doing so,jermain acted as counsel and agent for its clients,pebble and pebble lp.as a result of the sale of the coalition confidential documents to its opponents,the coalition was damaged by having,at substantial expense,to defend the apoc proceeding to a finding of no liability.the coalition also suffered a dramatic drop in contributions and grant money resulting from adverse publicity triggered by the pebble defendants use of the confidential documents to wage a smear campaign in the press to the effect that the coalition and the entire opposition to pebble mine were pawns of one wealthy supporter and the coalition was violating alaska law by shielding the identity of supporters,which was not the case.
special motion to strike.
on april,a mere days after the commencement of the action the pebble defendants filed a special motion to strike the only two causes of action in which they were named,the fourth cause of action for interference with contract and the sixth cause of action for interference with prospective economic advantage.
the moving papers asserted the coalition claims against the pebble defendants arose from protected conduct,that is to say,activities in furtherance of their right of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue.the pebble defendants contended b ecause the coalition causes of action against them arise from the apoc complaint,they fall squarely under the statute.
the pebble defendants further argued that because they had made a threshold showing the coalition lawsuit against them arose from their exercise of their right of petition to the apoc,the burden shifted to the coalition to establish a probability it would prevail on its claims,and that the coalition was incapable of meeting its burden.
the moving papers were supported by extensive declarations and exhibits,including the declaration of attorney matthew singer of the jermain firm.singer stated he met with kaplan in santa monica on march,at which time he gave kaplan a check payable from my law firm client trust account in the amount of.according to singer,the check was for a consulting arrangement with kaplan,who would be available to assist in the preparation of an apoc complaint.singer admitted receiving a stack of documents from kaplan,but asserted he only obtained documents that had not been specifically designated as confidential.
opposition.
in opposition,the coalition argued that bribing a professional consultant to turn over confidential documents is not protected activity,and therefore the coalition claims against the pebble defendants were not subject to the procedure.although the moving parties relied on their bringing the apoc complaint as protected activity for slapp purposes,the coalition was not suing the pebble defendants for bringing the apoc complaint.rather,the coalition was suing the pebble defendants for inducing kaplan to sell them the coalition confidential documents for.
further,although the moving parties argue d that anything done to gather evidence in preparation for their bringing their apoc complaint should likewise qualify as protected activity the slapp statute does not protect illegal activity in preparing for a lawsuit.here,ample evidence shows that the moving parties conduct in bribing kaplan was a violation of california uniform trade secrets act,an inducement of breach of contract,and conversion.
as for the merits,the coalition contended there was sufficient evidence to support a judgment in its favor.specifically,the litigation privilege did not protect kaplan sale of the coalition documents to the pebble defendants.further,the fact the coalition had not yet pleaded the legal theories of misappropriation of trade secrets and conversion in addition to what it has pleaded should be of no consequence at this initial stage of the litigation a motion for leave to amend will promptly be brought.the coalition specifically invoked civil code section,subdivision b,defining misappropriation as a cquisition of a trade secret of another by a person who knows or has reason to know that the trade secret was acquired by improper means,which covers the pebble defendants.
trial court ruling granting special motion to strike.
on may,the matter came on for hearing.the trial court granted the special motion to strike and subsequently issued an extensive written ruling setting forth the basis of its decision.
relying on the allegations of the fourth and sixth causes of action against the pebble defendants,the trial court found both causes of action,then,arise out of defendants filing of the apoc complaint.the constitutional right to petition includes the basic act of filing litigation or otherwise seeking administrative action.citations.the acts which form the basis for both of these causes of action,jermain retention of kaplan as a consultant and possession of allegedly confidential documents were acts in furtherance of defendants right of petition or free speech.the coalition contention is that it is not suing defendants for bringing the apoc action.rather,the coalition is suing the pebble defendants for inducing kaplan to sell them the coalition confidential documents for is belied by its damages allegations,set forth above.
after finding the pebble defendants had met their threshold burden to show the coalition complaint arose from their constitutionally protected activity,the trial court ruled the coalition had failed to meet its burden of showing a probability of prevailing on any its claims against the pebble defendants.
the trial court found the fourth cause of action,interference with contract,was barred by the litigation privilege.
as for the sixth cause of action,interference with prospective economic advantage,the trial court stated plaintiff concedes that its cause of action against defendants should be stricken defendants reliance on the litigation privilege has merit,insofar as to date,the evidence of damage resulting from the disruption of prospective economic relationships consists of losses in grants and donations that track back to the apoc proceeding,and the litigation privilege could bar reliance on damages that resulted solely from that proceeding.opposition.
the trial court also rejected the coalition request for leave to amend to add new causes of action for misappropriation of trade secrets and conversion,stating allowing a slapp plaintiff leave to amend the complaint once the court finds the prima facie showing has been met would completely undermine the statute by providing the pleader a ready escape from section quick dismissal remedy.instead of having to show a probability of success on the merits,the slapp plaintiff would be able to go back to the drawing board with a second opportunity to disguise the vexatious nature of the suit through more artful pleading.this would trigger a second round of pleadings,a fresh motion to strike,and inevitably another request for leave to amend.simmons allstate ins.th.
subsequent proceedings.
on august,the pebble defendants filed a motion seeking in attorney fees,having successfully moved to strike both causes of action against them pursuant to section.after hearing the matter,the trial court denied the pebble defendants request for fees in the amount of,and instead granted fees in the amount of.
on september,the trial court entered a judgment of dismissal in favor of the pebble defendants.the judgment of dismissal includes the award of attorney fees to the pebble defendants.
the coalition appealed the order granting the pebble defendants special motion to strike the pebble defendants appealed the september,judgment,insofar as the judgment awarded them only in attorney fees.
contentions 
the coalition contend the trial court erred in granting the special motion to strike because the pebble defendants alleged liability arose from their conduct in bribing kaplan to turn over confidential documents,not from protected speech,making the statute inapplicable and the trial court further erred in ruling the coalition action lacked minimal merit.
on,the pebble defendants contend the trial court abused its discretion by making an inadequate award of attorney fees after they prevailed on their special motion to strike.
