as rwanda bloody civil war drew to a close,with rebel forces controlling rwanda capital and the retreating government accused of genocide,the embattled regime retained appellant,a washington lawyer,to help improve its image and cast the rebels as terrorists.roughly a week later,after the united states ordered rwanda embassy closed,appellant entered a second agreement,this time to provide among other things immigration help to rwanda ambassador and other embassy diplomats,who feared reprisals if they returned home.pursuant to these agreements,rwanda paid some into appellant client trust account,and after the war a new government formed by the victorious rebels sued to get the money back.following a bench trial,the district court found appellant liable for conversion and breach of fiduciary duty,explaining that appellant had performed virtually no work under the first contract and treated the second as a personal account with rwanda former ambassador rather than an agreement with rwanda itself.the court also awarded in punitive damages.for the most part,we affirm.
some of the late twentieth century most horrific events form the background of this litigation.on april,a missile from an unidentified source shot down an aircraft carrying rwanda president,juvenal habyarimana.stepping into the power vacuum,extremists from rwanda majority hutu ethnic group formed an interim government and unleashed genocidal violence that over the next days claimed the lives of some rwandans,most of them ethnic tutsis,a minority group historically dominant in rwandan politics.as united nations peacekeepers stood by,powerless to contain the bloodshed,a tutsi rebel force called the rwandan patriotic front rpf canceled a ceasefire and resumed its offensive against the government.
while civil war and genocide raged,rwanda embassy in washington entered into the two agreements at issue in this case.first,on july,four days after rpf forces captured rwanda capital kigali,rwanda united states ambassador aloys uwimana,a representative of the hutu government,signed a memorandum of understanding with three robert johnson ii timothy towell,a retired diplomat and edward van kloberg iii,a washington lobbyist.under this agreement,the three americans,termed the rwanda working group or rwg,were to assist the government of rwanda,through ambassador aloys uwimana in washington,to get its views clearly and dramatically presented to the international community.in particular,the rwg would e ncourage the comprehension and support of american authorities of rwanda cause,aiming to isolat e the rpf and foster the perception that it constituted a marginal group,perhaps even a minority,terrorist group.the mou,which called for payments totaling,required an initial deposit of.on july,rwanda embassy cut a check for that amount to the robert johnson ii trust fund.
but it was soon too late for lobbying.on july one week after rwanda signed the mou and two days after rwanda united states issued a note verbale requiring,given the uncertain and untenable situation which has existed in rwanda since april,that the embassy terminate all operations of the diplomatic mission,other than activities relating to the closure of the mission,effective july.though one embassy official,boniface karani,was permitted to remain in the united states for the present to oversee the closing of the embassy,the note ordered ambassador uwimana to leave the country no later than july.all remaining members of the mission and their family members other than any who may be citizens or legal permanent residents of the united states,including uwimana and children,were to depart the united states no later than august.
the note verbale precipitated johnson second agreement with rwanda.in a letter to ambassador uwimana,johnson offered to help with the embassy closure,providing in particular continued oversight and assistance regarding immigration requests by embassy employees hoping to remain in the united states instead of returning to the chaos in rwanda.johnson proposed 
w e will work with the state department to ensure that their recommendations to the immigration and naturalization service are favorable,and we will obtain testimony from experts that conditions in rwanda are presently.also,we shall supervise and coordinate the activities of two immigration attorneys in the preparation of the asylum requests and the handling of the cases to ensure that the work is thorough and.
claiming that a ll the paid under the mou has been disbursed or obligated,johnson letter requested for the new work for the immigration attorneys and for the rwg.on july,the day the embassy closed,ambassador uwimana signed johnson proposal and authorized a check for,again payable to johnson client trust fund.
the following month,johnson learned that the united states had recognized the rpf as rwanda legitimate government.soon afterwards,karani,by then newly reappointed to the embassy,wrote to confirm the termination of the july agreement and demand return of,the amount karani calculated to be left in the account.apparently referring to immigration work performed on uwimana behalf,karani observed that necessary steps have been taken for only one diplomat family,making johnson retention of the full unnecessary.nonetheless,johnson refused to make any refund,insisting in two response letters that only uwimana could direct his expenditures.two months later,another embassy official demanded return of the entire.again,johnson refused.
having thus failed to obtain a voluntary refund,rwanda sued in the district court for the district of columbia,asserting law claims of conversion and breach of fiduciary duty against johnson,uwimana,and johnson two rwg colleagues.uwimana declared bankruptcy,obtaining an automatic stay under,and johnson two partners settled,paying rwanda out of the paid under the mou.after denying johnson motion to dismiss and rwanda motion for summary judgment,see gov t of rwanda rwanda working group,d,the district court held a bench trial.based on extensive factual findings,the district court concluded that none of the lobbying or other work for rwanda ever took place under the july mou and that johnson used from the july letter agreement almost exclusively for uwimana asylum request and for other immigration services,undertakings the district judge believed were against the interest of johnson client,the government of rwanda.see gov t of rwanda rwanda working group,d,rwg.
the district court held johnson liable for conversion and fiduciary breach as to both the mou and the july agreement,imposing liability in the amount of as the balance from the mou payment following the two rwg members settlement,plus based on the july agreement.id.at.in addition,finding that johnson actions in this case were accompanied by gross recklessness and a willful disregard of the rights of his rightful government of rwanda,the district court imposed in punitive damages.id.at.finally,the court referred claims for prejudgment interest and attorney fees to a magistrate judge,id.at,who awarded interest but not fees.
johnson now appeals the district court judgment in rwanda favor on the conversion and fiduciary breach counts as well as its award of punitive damages.rwanda the denial of fees and calculation of prejudgment interest.
we begin with johnson challenges to the conversion and fiduciary breach claims,reviewing the district court factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo,see,singletary district of columbia,see also.a indicating that following trial without a jury,f indings of fact,whether based on oral or documentary evidence,shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous,and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses.in addition to disputing the legal sufficiency of the district court findings,johnson argues that notwithstanding rwanda later demand for the full,karani earlier letter ratified all but of his expenditures pursuant to the july proposition johnson says is conclusively established by in re uwimana,cir,a fourth circuit case involving former ambassador uwimana person
