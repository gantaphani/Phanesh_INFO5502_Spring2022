introduction 
plaintiff daniel lyons lyons appeals from a postjudgment order of the san francisco superior court denying his motion for attorney fees pursuant to code of civil procedure section following entry of a stipulated judgment and permanent injunction in lyons lawsuit against defendant chinese hospital association cha.by this judgment,cha was permanently enjoined from violating specific asbestos laws concerning notification,training and surveying at buildings,including the chinese hospital,a medical office building and six other specified buildings.the injunction also required cha to retain and pay north tower environmental,a certified asbestos consulting firm,to monitor cha compliance with the asbestos laws,reporting annually to the court regarding cha compliance for a period of three years.
the trial court denied the fee request on the grounds that lyons was not a successful party under the statute that lyons failed to demonstrate that a fee award was appropriate because of the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement that the district attorney instituted a parallel prosecution of defendant,also obtaining a stipulated injunction and that lyons failed to establish that the interests of justice required defendant to pay his fees.
lyons contends that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to award him fees and costs.we shall conclude the trial court abused its discretion in denying attorney fees to lyons 
and procedural background 
underlying action 
in late,cha and daniel lyons doing business as daniel lyons builders entered a contract under which the latter agreed to remodel certain portions of the first floor of the chinese hospital building.the remodeling required some demolition work,including removal of floor tile.at a prebid meeting on december,and again at a meeting on february,a question was asked about the presence of material in the construction area.cha chief engineer sam english and a representative of the project architect,gordon chong and partners,informed lyons that an asbestos survey of the hospital had been performed and that the construction area was free of material.after seven months of demolition and construction,lyons saw material that he suspected contained asbestos and asked english to show him the asbestos survey.when english did not produce the survey,lyons took samples of the materials and had them tested himself.the results showed that asbestos was present throughout the construction site,in the vinyl floor tile,floor mastic,insulation wrap on heating,ventilation,and air conditioning boxes,and the core of doors.appellant daniel lyons and his brother morgan plaintiffs had personally removed floor tile manually by chipping and prying it with large demolition bars and scraper blades.the arbitrator found that demolition of the floor tile exposed the pair to airborne asbestos.lyons produced evidence that the release of asbestos occurred directly adjacent to the hospital lobby,in which cha employees worked and members of the general public congregated,and through which patients,employees and members of the public walked on a daily basis.however there was no finding that employees,patients or the public were actually exposed to asbestos.upon receiving the test results,lyons immediately shut down the construction,refusing to return until cha conducted a thorough and complete asbestos survey of the construction area.lyons also demanded that cha notify state authorities about the disturbance of asbestos in the hospital,citing to various regulations cha had violated in misleading him about having a survey.
it is undisputed that lyons spoke with two or three asbestos lawyers to try to find a lawyer to pursue the hospital.they each refused to take the case because plaintiffs would not know for at least years whether they would become sick as a result of the asbestos exposure.the lawyers told lyons the case was just too complex to bring,particularly with uncertain damages.in late spring of,attorney richard nelson,who had recently left the attorney office,agreed to represent lyons.nelson knew that the costs of litigation would be high,and that there was only a slight chance of a significant monetary recovery by lyons.nelson convinced his law firm to take the case on a contingency fee,with the main focus of the representation being an effort to encourage the government to prosecute cha.nelson enlisted jeff hallam as cocounsel.
during the spring and summer of,counsel and lyons contacted federal and state authorities.the case was initially presented to federal prosecutors and the environmental protection agency epa.the epa ultimately referred lyons to the san francisco district attorney office.in august,counsel and lyons met with assistant district attorney ross mirkarimi.however,when mirkarimi did not respond to followup messages and in light of the statute of limitations on some of the personal injury causes of action,plaintiffs filed the civil action herein against cha,english and others collectively defendants on november,
the complaint contained five causes of action seeking tort damages for exposure to asbestos one cause of action seeking declaratory relief for indemnity against future liability the plaintiffs might incur related to demolition and removal of material from the hospital,and one cause of action for unfair business practices bus,seeking injunctive relief to require cha to comply with specified asbestos laws and regulations and for attorney fees pursuant to section.
during discovery,it was disclosed that cha was not in compliance with many asbestos regulations,including requirements regarding notice to employees and employee asbestos awareness training.on march,the hospital director of human resources provided a declaration that no asbestos notice had ever been given to its employees,despite the october receipt by hospital department heads of an from english concerning the presence of materials in the hospital.nor had the hospital provided any asbestos awareness training materials to its employees.
on april,lyons filed a motion for a preliminary injunction before the honorable james robertson ii,to require cha to provide the required notice and training.on april,cha filed opposition,arguing lyons lacked standing,that he had unclean hands and that the motion was moot because cha was scheduling asbestos awareness training for hospital engineers and housekeepers to be completed within days and because it planned to send within the week a written notice to each employee informing the employee of the presence of materials in the hospital and medical office building 
on april,the day before the hearing on the preliminary injunction,judge robertson issued a tentative ruling,continuing the hearing to may,to permit cha to comply with its asbestos notification and training obligations and stating that the court would issue an order granting the motion if cha did not provide the required notification and training by may.thereafter,cha filed declarations stating that employees and tenants of the hospital and medical office building were notified about the presence of asbestos in those buildings on april and,and that asbestos awareness training had been provided to custodial and engineering staff on may.based upon these declarations,the court denied the preliminary injunction motion as moot.
however,cha had distributed the written notices to its employees only in english.depositions of chow ming cheung and kwok sun wong,two cha housekeepers who cleaned materials such as floor tiles as part of their duties,disclosed that neither read english.both required a cantonese interpreter for their depositions.cheung testified that he did not recognize the notice and wong testified that he received only an english version that required translation by his son.on august,lyons again moved for a temporary restraining order and an order to show cause as to why a preliminary injunction should not issue requiring cha to provide the asbestos notice in a language readily understandable to all cha employees,as required by law.cha opposed the motion,arguing that the law did not require notice to employees in their native languages and that it had provided its hospital supervisors with cantonese translations of the notice to distribute to those employees they believed did not speak english well enough to understand.after judge robertson issued an order to show cause and set the preliminary injunction for hearing on september,cha delivered a copy of the asbestos notice translated into cantonese to all of its employees.judge robertson denied the motion for preliminary injunction without prejudice to bring it again should plaintiffs find other employees requiring foreign language notice in a language other than english or cantonese.
district attorney becomes involved 
in september,after cha served a subpoena on the district attorney in connection with plaintiffs action,lyons counsel contacted june cravett,the head of the environmental crime section of the district attorney office.cravett informed him that mirkarimi had taken a leave of absence in the summer of,and that she knew nothing about the case.however,when she expressed interest in learning more,counsel sent her copies of depositions and some of the critical documents produced in discovery.assistant district attorney james thompson was then assigned to gather more information to determine whether prosecution was warranted.nelson met with thompson more than a dozen times and supplied copies of depositions and videotapes of depositions.thompson spent days at nelson office reviewing boxes of documents that had been produced during discovery and making copies of documents that he wanted.in,the district attorney office notified cha and sam english that it would be pursuing charges against them.ultimately,cha and thompson agreed to a stipulated judgment and permanent injunction.the judgment and injunction was entered in may.people chinese hospital association,sam english super.city and county.the injunction involved two main issues notification to contractors about asbestos in the hospital and disposal of asbestos in approved hazardous waste facilities.defendants did not admit liability,and the stipulated injunction provided it was not to be used as evidence or admission of liability.the main provisions of that injunction permanently enjoined cha,english and their representatives and successors from violating any provision of california code of regulations,title,section,and imposed a civil penalty health,upon english for violations involving false statements and illegal disposal of hazardous waste.
arbitration of tort claims 
on september,the superior court granted cha renewed petition to compel arbitration in the case filed by daniel and morgan lyons,submitting all causes of action except for the alleged violation of business and professions code section to arbitration.the arbitration was conducted in may and june.
on july,in a written final arbitration award,the arbitrator found that defendants cha and english had negligently misrepresented that material was not present at the hospital and that an asbestos survey had been performed.the arbitrator also found that the statements had been made with intent to induce reliance and that plaintiffs had justifiably relied upon them.however,the arbitrator also found the misrepresentations had been negligent only and not intentional.the evidence did not prove that cha or english had actual knowledge that the hospital building contained asbestos materials and consequently,that the representations about the absence of asbestos in the construction area did not constitute fraud or any type of intentional tort,including the intentional infliction of emotional distress.although the arbitrator had found negligent misrepresentation and reliance,he also found that plaintiffs had failed to prove they suffered damage as a result of the misrepresentation.plaintiffs were unable to present evidence quantifying their increased risk of contracting mesothelioma and so had failed to establish that they faced a significant risk or any quantifiable risk at all of contracting an asbestos related disease as a result of their exposure to asbestos at the hospital building.
the arbitrator therefore determined that plaintiffs should recover nothing from defendants and awarded neither plaintiffs nor defendants indemnity against either of the others.the arbitration award provided that both plaintiffs and defendants bear their own costs and attorney fees and that both should bear equally the cost of the arbitrator fees.
stipulated judgment and injunctive relief 
upon conclusion of the arbitration,plaintiff morgan lyons dismissed his remaining unfair competition cause of action against defendants.plaintiff and appellant daniel lyons moved to set his remaining claim for unfair competition and injunctive relief for trial.over defendants opposition,the superior court donna hitchens set lyons injunctive relief claim for trial on february.
on january,lyons deposed karen chow,an officer of cha.chow admitted that cha had surveys of asbestos in other buildings and had reviewed the report in january cha had not provided the required written asbestos notice to custodians,tenants and residents of any of those other buildings that had been found to contain asbestos and no training had been provided to persons performing housekeeping services at those other buildings.
shortly thereafter,the parties agreed to entry of a stipulated judgment and permanent injunction that was approved by judge hitchens on january,and entered on february.neither party was named the prevailing party therein and defendants did not admit fault.the permanent injunction provided in relevant part 
cha shall be permanently enjoined from violating california health safety code et ccr,bay area air quality management district regulation,and et,at buildings,including the chinese hospital,located at jackson street,a medical office building,located at jackson street,and buildings located at bush street,jackson street,wentworth street,grant street,washington street,and jackson street in san francisco,california.
cha shall retain and pay north tower environmental to monitor cha compliance with the asbestos laws and report to the court regarding cha compliance.the first such report shall be made within two months of the entry of this stipulated judgment by the court,and then annually for three years thereafter,with the court retaining jurisdiction for the purpose of ensuring compliance with this stipulated judgment.
the stipulated judgment also provided that plaintiff attorney fee request was to be resolved by the superior court law and motion department.
pursuant to the terms of the permanent injunction,north tower environmental filed its first compliance report with the court on april.it detailed the actions taken by cha to comply with asbestos laws,including notification of employees,tenants and contractors bidding on and performing work at the buildings,training of custodial,housekeeping,and engineering staff performing work at buildings identification of asbestos through asbestos inspections reviewing,monitoring,updating and streamlining cha asbestos program and records related thereto.
attorney fee proceedings 
on may,lyons moved for an award of attorney fees of approximately million under section.following a hearing,the trial court issued a minute order denying the motion on june,but failing to state reasons for doing so.lyons sought clarification of the order and,on august,the court filed its order clarifying its denial of lyons motion.in its entirety,the order states 
plaintiff motion for an award of attorney fees is denied for the following reasons 
plaintiff is not a successful party within the meaning of code of civil procedure.contrary to plaintiff assertions,this case was not primarily directed at achieving a public benefit by forcing defendant chinese hospital association to comply with laws regulating asbestos.the lawsuit was primarily about recovering damages,and in that regard it was unsuccessful.plaintiff filed his lawsuit because he wanted damages for exposure to asbestos during work performed on defendant property.he failed in the six causes of action directed at that goal.
on his claim for violation of business and professions code,plaintiff was successful to the extent that defendant chinese hospital association stipulated to an injunction requiring it to refrain from certain activities and comply with the law.this limited success,is outweighed by the lack of success on other scores.
plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that a fee award is appropriate because of the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement.the test is whether the achievement of the public benefit outweighs plaintiff personal stake in the outcome.here it does not.the fees and costs incurred in this case were primarily directed at the recovery of damages on the claims that were arbitrated.plaintiff personal stake in the outcome of that aspect of the case was quite substantial and included a demand for punitive damages.in addition,the necessity of private enforcement is questionable because the record shows that the district attorney of san francisco instituted a parallel prosecution of the defendant for violation of asbestos laws and achieved the same result,a stipulated injunction.
finally,plaintiff has not established that the interests of justice require that defendant pay his fees.
this timely appeal followed.
discussion 
issues and scope of review 
attorney fees are recoverable under section by a successful party,in an action that has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest,if a significant benefit has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons,and the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement are such as to make the award appropriate.the statute purpose is to encourage public interest litigation that might otherwise be too costly to pursue.families unafraid to uphold rural el dorado county board of supervisors th,d.bowman city of berkeley th,d bowman.
the trial court is to assess the litigation realistically and determine from a practical perspective whether the statutory criteria have been met.families unafraid to uphold rural el dorado county board of supervisors,supra,th at,d.rulings under section are reviewed for abuse of discretion.graham daimlerchrysler cal th,d.the questions are whether the court applied the proper legal standards under section and,if so,whether the result was within the range of the court discretion city of sacramento drew d,whether there was a reasonable basis for the decision westside community for independent living,obledo cal d.bowman,supra,th at,d.
although section is phrased in permissive terms the court may award,the discretion to deny fees to a party that meets its terms is quite limited.the s upreme c ourt in serrano unruh serrano iv cal d,noted that the private attorney general theory,from which section derives,requires a full fee award unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.pearl,cal.attorney fee awards ed,accord,hammond agran th,d.
in lealao beneficial california,th,d lealao,we agreed with city of sacramento drew,supra,d,that the scope of discretion always resides in the particular law being applied,in the legal principles governing the subject of the action action that transgresses the confines of the applicable principles of law is outside the scope of discretion and we call such action an abuse of discretion.city of sacramento drew,supra,d at.lealao,at,d.
accordingly,the question before us is whether the trial court refusal to award fees was consistent with the applicable law.
cha does not dispute that this case involved enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest.nor does cha contend that a significant benefit was not conferred on the general public or on a large class of persons.indeed,at the fee hearing,judge mcbride stated that he was not too worried about those two factors.nevertheless,the trial court found that the other prerequisites for the successful party and private burden not satisfied.
it is undisputed that relief obtained through a settlement may qualify a plaintiff as the prevailing party,even in the presence of a stipulation disclaiming liability on the merits.see,santisas goodin cal th,d,folsom butte county.of governments cal d,planned parenthood aakhus th,d pearl,cal.attorney fee awards,supra.
prevailing party 
lyons contends that the court abused its discretion in determining that he was not a successful party because he succeeded in obtaining only injunctive relief and because he did not achieve the damage award that the court found to be his primary litigation objective.there is no question that lyons was unsuccessful in obtaining damages for his asbestos exposure.he prevailed on only one of the six causes of action in his mandate petition.lyons points out that the court could award attorney fees for that partial success.it is well settled that partially successful plaintiffs may recover attorney fees under section.see manaster selmi,cal.environmental law land use practice b,and cases cited pearl,cal.attorney fee awards ed,and cases cited.a party need not prevail on every claim presented in an action in order to be considered a successful party within the meaning of the section.citations.wallace consumers cooperative of berkeley,d.rather,when a plaintiff is successful within the meaning of the section,the fact that he or she has prevailed on some claims but not on others is a factor to be considered in determining the amount of the fee awarded.computerxpress,jackson th,d.bowman,supra,th at,d,italics added.
the successful party concept is not so narrow as the court clarification suggests.see bowman,supra,th at,d.in order to effectuate the purpose of section,courts have taken a broad,pragmatic view of what constitutes a successful party.graham daimlerchrysler,supra,cal th at,d.a successful party means a prevailing party id.at,d,and plaintiffs may be considered prevailing parties for attorney fees purposes if they succeed on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing suit.maria riles cal d,italics added.bowman,at,d.
although the significance of the issue resolved by the of cha compliance with asbestos laws and regulations relating to testing,notice and a matter for the trial court judgment,the trial court apparently agreed that such relief resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest and conferred a a significant benefit on the general public or a large class of persons.bowman,supra,th at,d families unafraid to uphold rural el dorado county board of supervisors,supra,th at,d.
the trial court conclusion that lyons could not be considered a successful party because he did not accomplish his primary litigation aim is based on language in catalyst cases,where the issue is whether a party who has not obtained any judicial relief is nevertheless entitled to fees.see generally graham daimlerchrysler,supra,cal th at,d,fees can be awarded in that situation if the defendant has changed its behavior as sought in the litigation.in such cases,an award of attorney fees may be appropriate where plaintiffs lawsuit was a catalyst motivating defendants to provide the primary relief sought westside community for independent living,obledo,supra,cal d at,italics added and deleted.bowman,supra,th at,d,italics added.this,however,is not a catalyst case.lyons obtained,through a final judgment entered by the court in this action,injunctive relief consisting of employee,tenant and contractor notification employee training and asbestos testing and monitoring for three years for not only the hospital and medical building,but also for other buildings owned by cha.moreover,the trial court focus on the primary relief sought was misplaced for other reasons as well.
in sokolow county of san mateo d.sokolow,the court of appeal reversed an order denying attorney fees under section to the plaintiffs,who had sued the mounted patrol of san mateo county,the county,and others for sex discrimination.the trial court had denied fees on the ground that the plaintiffs were not the prevailing party as they had not succeeded in obtaining either the primary relief they injunction compelling the mounted patrol of san mateo county to admit sokolow and other qualified women to membership,or the secondary relief they injunction prohibiting the county from maintaining any affiliation,formal or informal,with the mounted patrol.id.at.rather,they had obtained a ruling granting a permanent injunction requiring the mounted patrol and the county to sever their unconstitutional relationship and obtained a concession from the county ending the patrol informal monopoly on equestrian search and rescue in the county and opening the opportunity to engage in such rescue activities to any qualified person.id.at.
in sokolow,supra,d at page,footnote,the appellate court rejected the trial court focus on the primary relief or central issue test and instead recognized that the united states supreme court in texas teachers garland school dist,d,had definitively adopted the significant issue test under federal statutes as restated in hensley eckerhart,d plaintiffs may be considered prevailing parties for attorney fees purposes if they succeed on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing the suit.citations.sokolow,at,fn.the court of appeal found that the plaintiffs were independently entitled to attorney fees under section,and that the trial court rationale that plaintiffs were not the prevailing party was entirely unconvincing,particularly when viewed in the light of the court decision on the merits id.at,as plaintiffs had succeeded in obtaining a decision that the county was significantly involved with the mounted patrol that so long as the relationship existed,bylaws limiting membership to males only violated appellants constitutional and federal statutory rights and that the county must sever all significant involvement with mounted patrol activities.id.at.
here,too,lyons succeeded in obtaining relief on a significant issue in the action.the trial court abused its discretion in determining that lyons was not a prevailing party where he succeeded on a significant issue in the litigation.
necessity and financial burden of private enforcement 
the trial court also denied attorney fees on the ground that lyons failed to demonstrate that a fee award is appropriate because of the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement.
under the private burden prong of section,fees are recoverable when the cost of the claimant legal victory transcends his personal interest,that is,when the necessity for pursuing the lawsuit placed a burden on the plaintiff out of proportion to his individual stake in the matter.woodland hills residents,city council cal d.if the enforcement of the public interest is merely coincidental to the attainment of personal goals citation or is self serving,citation,then this requirement is not met.california common cause duffy d.bowman,supra,th at,d.stated otherwise,the private attorney general doctrine was not intended to reward litigants motivated by their own pecuniary interests who only coincidentally protect the public interest.citations.pearl,cal.attorney fee awards,supra.
according to a leading california treatise on the subject,t his requirement really examines two issues whether private enforcement was necessary and whether the financial burden of private enforcement warrants subsidizing the successful party attorneys.pearl,cal.attorney fee awards,supra.
the necessity of the private enforcement factor looks to the adequacy of public enforcement and seeks economic equalization of representation in cases where private enforcement is necessary.citations.committee to defend reproductive rights v.a free pregnancy center d.committee to defend reproductive rights.
here,the trial court concluded that the need for private enforcement was questionable because a parallel prosecution of defendant achieved the same stipulated injunction.we are convinced that on this record,the trial court abused its discretion in so finding.
in committee to defend reproductive rights,supra,d,the plaintiffs,without first contacting the district attorney,filed an action alleging false advertising and unfair business practices bus,against the defendant clinic for fraudulently advertising its services as a medical center providing abortion counseling and referral when it was not a medical facility and did no counseling other than advocating against abortion.id.at.four months later the san francisco district attorney filed a similar,but not identical,action.the cases were consolidated.after a judgment against the defendant,the plaintiffs requested attorney fees pursuant to section.the trial court denied the plaintiffs fees on the ground that the plaintiffs action was not necessary because the district attorney had filed a parallel action.id.at.we reversed,concluding that the plaintiffs were not barred from recovery of attorney fees by reason of the government participation in the litigation.we remanded the issue to the trial court,instructing the court to consider the following in determining whether the services of the plaintiffs were necessary did the private party advance significant factual or legal theories adopted by the court,thereby providing a material non de minimis contribution to its judgment,which were nonduplicative of those advanced by the governmental entity did the private party produce substantial evidence significantly contributing to the court judgment which was not produced by the governmental entity,and which was neither duplicative of nor merely cumulative to the evidence produced by the governmental entity id.at.
on the record before us in this case,we believe these questions could only have been answered in the affirmative.it is undisputed that lyons and counsel repeatedly sought to involve public authorities in prosecution of defendants.the record provides no reason to believe that there would have been any prosecution without plaintiffs efforts.not only did plaintiffs initiate the action that resulted in the district attorney becoming involved nearly a year after plaintiffs had first sought the district attorney assistance,but they also shared with the district attorney the voluminous information they had obtained during a lengthy discovery process in plaintiffs civil action.in addition,lyons counsel met with the prosecutor assigned to the case more than a dozen times to discuss the case and highlight the evidence and case law supporting the elements in the case the district attorney could bring against defendants.there is no indication in the record that the district attorney office conducted any independent investigation or discovery in its action,and lyons counsel avers that he is aware of none.lyons contribution to the district attorney action was more than merely helpful or even substantial it was necessary to the ultimate success of the public prosecution 
moreover,the injunction obtained by the district attorney in its action against defendants in many important respects was not duplicative of that subsequently obtained by lyons.the district attorney injunction enjoined defendants from violating ccr section.section is focused on a building owner responsibility to disclose and remove materials before and during construction activities in a building and with the safety of workers,employees and others during construction.by contrast,the injunction obtained by lyons addressed broader requirements under health and safety code section et asbestos and hazardous substance removal contracts ccr sections injury and illness prevention program,same,reporting use of regulated carcinogens occupational exposures to asbestos bay area air quality management district regulation setting emission performance standards for hazardous pollutants,including asbestos and air quality and emissions limitations.indeed,ccr section specifically provides that it does not apply to most construction work,as e xposure to asbestos in construction work other than spraying is covered by california code of regulations,title section the provision referenced in the district attorney injunction the only other remedy provided in the district attorney injunction was the fine against english for false statements and illegal disposal of hazardous waste.
remedies obtained through lyons injunction required cha to provide asbestos notice to current and new employees and tenants,whether or not construction was occurring provide asbestos awareness training to its custodians and engineers post notices during construction about the dangers of exposure to asbestos fibers and report to the division of occupational safety and health standards of the department of industrial relations if asbestos is disturbed.in addition,the permanent injunction required cha to retain and pay for a certified asbestos consultant to monitor cha compliance and to report annually to the court for the next three years.there is no provision for supervision in the district attorney injunction.although there may be areas of overlap between the two injunctions,they are fundamentally in the circumstances they cover and the relief they provide.
we believe,in the circumstances presented and on the record before us,that the trial court abused its discretion in denying fees on the ground that the need for private enforcement of the asbestos laws was questionable.
the trial court also determined that lyons had failed to demonstrate that a fee award was appropriate because of the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement.in so finding,the court articulated and applied an erroneous test,stating the test is whether the achievement of the public benefit outweighs plaintiff personal stake in the outcome.here it does not.the court then proceeded to find that the fees and costs incurred were primarily directed toward recovery of money damages on the arbitrated claims,and that lyon personal stake in the outcome of the damage claims was quite substantial and included a demand for punitive damages.
as stated above,u nder the private burden prong of section,fees are recoverable when the cost of the claimant legal victory transcends his personal interest,that is,when the necessity for pursuing the lawsuit placed a burden on the plaintiff out of proportion to his individual stake in the matter.woodland hills residents,city council,supra,cal d at.if the enforcement of the public interest is merely coincidental to the attainment of personal goals citation or is self serving,citation,then this requirement is not met.california common cause duffy,supra,d at pp.the personal interests involved may include specific,concrete,nonfinancial interests however,a party can be expected to have some concrete personal interest in the issue being litigated press lucky stores,cal d,fn.bowman,supra,th at,d see also pearl,cal.attorney fee awards,supra.nor does the fact that the case was pursued on a contingency fee basis undercut a plaintiff attorney fees claim,particularly where the plaintiff is responsible for substantial costs.families unafraid to uphold rural el dorado county board of supervisors,supra,th at,d see also lolley campbell cal th,d,fee recovery even where no obligation to pay fees incurred.
a pecuniary interest in the outcome of the litigation is not disqualifying.if the party claiming fees has a pecuniary interest in the outcome of the lawsuit,the issue is whether the financial burden placed on the party is out of proportion to its personal stake in the lawsuit.pearl,cal.attorney fee awards,supra,accord,baggett gates,supra,cal d at,police officers challenging reassignment to a position without proper hearing enforced basic procedural rights,although it might not have resulted in any pecuniary benefit to the plaintiffs otto los angeles unified school dist.th,d financial burden of establishing right to administrative appeal from district procedure resulting in adverse material in personnel file exceeded the plaintiff personal stake as there was no guarantee the plaintiff would ever recover any financial benefit henneberque city of culver city d.financial burden of prosecuting case out of proportion to the economic benefit.
on the other hand,t he private attorney general doctrine was not intended to reward litigants motivated by their own pecuniary interests who only coincidentally protect the public interest.citations.pearl,cal.attorney fee awards,supra,and cases there cited.
i n comparing the cost of litigation to the plaintiffs stake in the matter,we do not look at the plaintiffs actual recovery after trial,but instead we consider the estimated value of the case at the time the vital litigation decisions were being made los angeles police protective league city of los angeles d,italics added los angeles police protective league.in other words,the inquiry looks forward from the outset of counsel vital litigation decisions,rather than backward after judgment.this is because the purpose of section is to encourage public interest litigation by offering the bounty of a fee.d at,and the focus of that incentive is on the point in time when vital litigation decisions are being considered.beasley wells fargo bank d,d beasley.
los angeles police protective league,supra,d,and beasley,supra,d,d,each adopted a process for determining the estimated value of the case.beasley,described that process as follows first,the court must determine the monetary value of the gains actually attained by the successful litigants.second,the court must discount these total benefits by some estimate of the probability of success at the time the vital litigation decisions were made d at.this discount is essential because of the purpose of encouraging public interest litigation as of the time vital litigation decisions are being considered.thus,for example,if the plaintiffs had only a probability of ultimate victory,the estimated value of the case was only the actual recovery.ibid.
once estimated value is determined,it is compared to actual litigation costs.in general,a fee award will be appropriate unless estimated value exceeds by a substantial margin the actual litigation costs.d at.in other words,unless the estimated value of the case was sufficient to absorb actual litigation costs and still provide an incentive to litigate,fees may be awarded under section.
also,the financial burden criterion is interrelated with the other pertinent criteria under section.if public benefits are very significant,it is more important to encourage litigation,and thus it may be appropriate to award fees under section even in situations where the litigant own expected benefits exceed its actual costs by a substantial margin.d at.in contrast,if public benefits are modest,the courts should award fees only where the litigant own expected benefits do not exceed its costs by very much or possibly are even less than the costs of the litigation.ibid.
thus,the following rule may be extrapolated from the los angeles police protective league opinion if the estimated value of a class action common fund recovery,determined as of the time the vital litigation decisions were being made,does not exceed actual litigation costs by a substantial margin,the financial burden of private enforcement is such as to make it appropriate to award attorney fees under section.in contrast,if estimated value is substantially more than actual litigation costs,there should be no award under section unless public benefits are very significant.beasley,supra,d at,d.
following beasley,the appellate court in notrica state comp.ins.fund th,d,discussed the method for assessing whether the attorney fees incurred by the party seeking fees were in proportion to that party individual stake in the litigation.the jury had awarded compensatory damages in the net amount of and punitive damages of million.the trial court awarded attorney fees of.id.at fn,d.on appeal,the judgment was affirmed,except that the million award was reversed and remanded subject to the plaintiff acceptance of a reduction in the punitive damages to million.id.at,d.in rejecting a financial burden proportionality challenge to the fee award,the appellate court stated in assessing this ratio,the court must look at the estimated value of the case when the critical litigation decisions were being made,not the actual recovery after trial.beasley,supra,d at,d.nortica alleged in its complaint that it had suffered proximate damages of or more,asking leave to allow amendm
