in,webb brought a class action pursuant to alleging unconstitutional conditions for prisoners in the ada county jail.the district court granted webb partial summary judgment,finding that the jail overcrowding was unconstitutional and was a major cause of webb other complaints.through court orders and a partial consent decree,webb prevailed on many of his claims.pursuant to,the court awarded webb in attorney fees for his attorneys work on the merits of the action.in an unpublished order,we affirmed the district court disposition of the merits of webb claims.webb ada county,idaho,wl cir webb i.
after the district court judgment on the merits,webb attorneys performed legal services to enforce the court orders and the terms of the consent decree.webb requested an award of attorney fees for this service.the district court found that webb was partially successful in his postjudgment efforts and awarded him in attorney fees.webb filed an appeal in which he challenged the amount of the award.webb ada county,idaho,cir webb ii.in webb ii,we affirmed in part the district court award of attorney fees but remanded so that the district court could apply the rate cap provisions of the plra to the portion of postjudgment attorney fees earned after the effective date of the statute.id.at.
on remand,ada county objected to the award of any attorney fees,arguing that they were not compensable under the plra because they were not reasonably and directly incurred in proving an actual violation of webb constitutional rights.in rejecting ada county argument,the district court concluded that the postjudgment fees were related to the enforcement of relief for violations of webb constitutional rights.after applying the plra,the district court reduced the amount of attorney fees to.the district court also awarded webb an additional for the services performed by webb attorneys since the first award of attorney fees for enforcing and monitoring compliance with the judgment on the merits and the entry of the consent decree.

ada county appeal 
ada county argues that the district court erred in awarding attorney fees for the services rendered by webb attorneys subsequent to the plra effective date of april,we review the district court award of attorney fees for abuse of discretion.native vill.of venetie ira council alaska,cir.we review a district court interpretation of the law de novo.id.at.
the plra limits the amount of attorney fees that can be awarded for services performed in actions brought on behalf of prisoners.the portion of the plra relevant to this appeal provides 
in any action brought by a prisoner who is con fined to any jail,prison,or other correctional facility,in which attorney fees are authorized under section of this title,such fees shall not be awarded,except to the extent that 
a the fee was directly and reasonably incurred in proving an actual violation of the plaintiff rights protected by a statute pursuant to which a fee may be awarded under section of this title and 
b i the amount of the fee is proportionately related to the court ordered relief for the violation or 
ii the fee was directly and reasonably incurred in enforcing the relief ordered for the violation.
ada county argues that a fee request must satisfy a and b i or b ii.ada county contends that webb did not demonstrate that any constitutional violations occurred after the judgment and consent decree were entered.ada county maintains that webb is not entitled to attorney fees incurred in monitoring and enforcing the judgment and consent decree pursuant to the plra because webb failed to demonstrate that the postjudgment fees were incurred in proving an actual violation of the constitution.we disagree.ada county interpretation of the plra would render the language of subsection b ii superfluous.subsection b ii requires that the fees be directly and reasonably incurred in enforcing the relief ordered for the violation.d b ii emphasis added.if a postjudgment fee request could only be granted if the attorney services were directly linked to a discrete constitutional violation,fees incurred in enforcing the relief that the court had ordered because of demonstrated previous constitutional violations,could not be awarded.to the contrary,when subsections a and b are read together,it is apparent that congress intended that a plaintiff is entitled to fees incurred in enforcing a judgment entered upon proof that the plaintiff constitutional rights had been violated.the plra defines relief as all relief in any form that may be granted or approved by the court,and includes consent decrees.g.therefore,webb attorney fees incurred for postjudgment enforcement of the district court orders and the consent decree were compensable under the plra.
ada county argument that webb is not entitled to attorney fees incurred in enforcing the consent decree ignores findings by the district court that it corrected violations of webb rights.after the enactment of the plra,ada county brought a motion to terminate the consent decree.it asserted that the consent decree did not comply with the requirements of the plra.the plra provides for the immediate termination of any consent decree unless 
the court makes written findings based on the record that prospective relief remains necessary to correct a current or ongoing violation of the federal right,extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the federal right,and that the prospective relief is narrowly drawn and the least intrusive means to correct the violation.
b.the district court denied ada county motion to terminate the consent decree.it reasoned as follows 
based upon the rulings by this court and the magistrate judge prior to the approval of the partial con sent decree,violations of federal rights were found.additionally,the relief set forth in the partial con sent decree was narrowly drawn and extended no further than necessary to correct the violation of the federal rights.
thus,in holding that the consent decree met the requirements of the plra,the district court found that the consent decree corrected violations of webb constitutional rights.
the district court judgment and the consent decree were instituted to correct federal constitutional violations of webb rights.the attorney fees webb requested for work were incurred in enforcing and monitoring the court judgment and the consent decree,or were directly related to the services performed in webb litigating requests for attorney fees under the plra.the district court did not err in ruling that webb attorney fees were compensable under the plra.
webb appeala.
webb contends that the district court erred in calculating the award of attorney fees.ada county asserts that we have no jurisdiction to consider the merits of webb appeal because it was filed beyond the deadline prescribed by fed.a therefore,as a threshold matter,we must determine whether we have jurisdiction over webb appeal.see browder,of,d stating time limit is mandatory and jurisdictional.
after our remand in webb ii,the district court filed its judgment regarding webb request for postjudgment attorney fees on april.webb timely filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment under.e the district court granted in part and denied in part webb rule e motion in an order filed june.the district court entered a final judgment regarding the rule e motion on august.webb filed his notice of appeal on august.
the period for webb appeal began to run from the entry of the order disposing of his rule e motion.fed.a a iv.an order is entered for the purposes of rule a a iv when it is entered in compliance with.rule requires that e very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document.ada county contends that the period began to run from the district court june,order granting in part and denying in part webb rule e motion rather than the judgment entered on the rule e motion on august.in support of this contention,ada county relies upon hollywood city of santa maria,cir.in hollywood,we held that when a district court properly enters an order on the docket denying a party rule motion for a new trial,it is not required to enter a separate document labeled judgment to start the period for the filing of a notice of appeal.at.we reasoned in hollywood that the rule requirement that a separate document be filed 
serves to eliminate confusion as to which order ends the litigation no comparable risk of confusion exists with respect to an order denying a motion for new trial where the order is properly entered on the docket sheet.in this case,as is generally the case in the rule context,the order denying the motion for new trial definitively signaled the end of the litigation.
id.at.we held in hollywood that the period begins to run when the district court enters a final order denying a rule motion.id.
in hollywood,however,we distinguished a second circuit case that held where a district court grants a rule e motion and subsequently enters a new judgment,the period begins to run from the entry of the new judgment,not from the order granting the rule e motion.id.at.in the instant matter,in its june,order,the district court granted in part and denied in part webb rule e motion to alter or amend the judgment.the court ordered the parties to submit a proposed amended judgment within days.thus,this case is distinguishable from the factual scenario in hollywood.here,the district court did not simply deny webb motion to alter or amend the judgment.instead,the district court ordered the parties to submit a final judgment for the court approval within days.webb timely filed his appeal because the period began to run when the court filed its amended judgment on august.
turning to the merits of webb appeal,webb argues that the district court made several errors in calculating the final award of attorney fees.a district court award of attorney fees is reviewed for abuse of discretion.schwarz sec y of health human,cir.a ny elements of legal analysis and statutory interpretation which figure in the district court decision are reviewable de novo.a district court fee award does not constitute an abuse of discretion unless it is based on an inaccurate view of the law or a clearly erroneous finding of fact.id.quotations and citations omitted.
webb first contends that the district court erred in applying the plra rate cap to attorney fees relating to motions for contempt and discovery sanctions.he argues that since the contempt and discovery sanctions fees were awarded under and,these fees should not be limited by the plra rate cap because the plra applies only to fees awarded pursuant to the record shows,however,that webb contempt and discovery motions were directly related to his underlying cause of action.the discovery sanctions were ordered against ada county for refusing to turn over documents related to the jail staffing levels.the purpose of the plra was apparently to curtail frivolous prisoners suits and to minimize the are borne by with those suits.madrid gomez,cir.given this purpose,it is unlikely that congress intended that only part of the attorney fees awarded in a prisoner lawsuit be subject to the plra rate cap.congress desire to reduce the costs of these lawsuits would not be furthered by awarding attorney fees piecemeal webb interpretation of the plra scope would increase litigation over which fees should be paid at which rate.the district court did not abuse its discretion by applying the plra rates to fees related to motions for contempt and discovery sanctions.
the district court applied the plra rate cap to all fees relating to work that webb attorneys performed after the plra effective date of april.webb contends that a portion of these attorney fees were not incurred in postjudgment monitoring services,but rather related to the merits of the case.webb asserts that the plra rate cap should not apply to the portion of fees related to the merits of the case because this would create an impermissible effect on counsels expectation as to their compensation when they undertook the representation.in martin hadix,d,the supreme court held that the plra rate cap does not apply to postjudgment monitoring work performed before the plra effective date,but that w ith respect to postjudgment monitoring performed after the effective date there is no retroactive effect,and the plra fees cap applies to such work.at.webb argues that martin did not foreclose his argument because martin only discussed fees earned for postjudgment monitoring,as opposed to fees earned relating to the merits of a case.webb reading of martin,however,is too narrow.in reaching its holding,the martin court reasoned that the plra put attorneys 
on notice that their hourly rate had been adjusted after april,any expectation of compensation at the rates was unreasonable.there is no manifest injustice in telling an attorney performing postjudgment monitoring services that,going forward,she will earn a lower hourly rate than she had earned in the past.if the attorney does not wish to perform services at this new,lower pay rate,she can choose not to work.in other words,as applied to work performed after the effective date of the plra,the plra has future effect on future work this does not raise retroactivity concerns.
in holding that the plra has no retroactive effect on work performed after the effective date,the martin court rejected the assumption that the attorney initial decision to file a case on behalf of a client is an irrevocable one or that once an attorney files suit,she must continue working on that case until the decree is terminated.id.at.webb maintains that this case is distinguishable from the situation presented in martin because his counsel was practically and ethically prevented from withdrawing prior to the final determination on the merits of the case.the idaho rules of professional conduct,however,allow an attorney to withdraw from a case if the representation will result in an unreason able financial burden on the lawyer.idaho prof l conduct b.the attorneys here neither requested withdrawal nor evidenced any desire to withdraw from the case.see martin,at.respondents do not seriously contend that the attorneys were prohibited from withdrawing from the case.
the court reasoning in martin regarding the retroactive effect of the plra was not limited to fees relating to postjudgment monitoring.it can not be said that the plra changes the legal consequences of the attorneys decision to file the case.id.therefore,all fees incurred for attorney services performed after the plra effective date of april,are subject to the plra rate cap.the district court did not err in applying the plra rate cap to all fees,whether related to the merits or postjudgment monitoring,earned after the plra effective date.
webb also contends that the district court erred by applying an incorrect hourly rate in calculating attorney fees under the plra.we agree.webb asked the district court to apply a baseline hourly rate of,as authorized by the judicial conference pursuant to the civil justice reform act.the district court rejected webb argument and determined that the ba
