this case addresses the california wildlife conservation board wcb approval of a project involving the conversion of agricultural land into wildlife habitat as categorically exempt from the california environmental quality act ceqa.the california department of fish and game dfg and the wcb appeal the grant of a peremptory writ of mandate directing them,inter alia,to set aside the decision finding the traynham ranch project project to be exempt from ceqa the dfg and wcb also appeal the award of attorney fees to the county of colusa county and to petitioners california farm bureau federation,colusa county farm bureau together the farm bureau and intervenor richard mora.we shall affirm the trial court grant of a peremptory writ of mandate and the orders granting attorney fees.
factual and procedural background 
in,the dfg through the wcb together the state agencies negotiated the purchase of a conservation easement on acres of farmland the property owned by leroy traynham iii traynham in the county as the first acquisition restoration project under the north central valley,conservation reserve enhancement program.wcb as the lead agency approved as part of the conservation easement a site specific waterfowl habitat management plan management plan which identified measures needed to convert the property from agriculture to habitat.the project consisted of both the conservation easement and the management plan.
the property is adjacent to an existing project in the lower colusa trough and would expand a nearly contiguous corridor of wetlands and riparian habitat along the ridge cut slough that has been restored in recent years.
the property is located in the general agriculture land use designation of the county general plan and is zoned exclusive agriculture.the property is located within the boundaries of an agricultural preserve and is designated on the important farmland series maps,pursuant to government code section,as one or more of the following prime farmland,farmland of statewide significance,unique farmland,farmland of local importance.the property had been part of a williamson act contract with the county,et and at the time of the easement purchase by the state agencies it was covered by a farmland security zone contract super williamson act contract with the county,et under this super williamson act contract,traynham had,agreed to restrict the use of the property to production of food and fiber for commercial purposes and compatible uses.the property had been planted with row crops and rice and was planted with sudan grass at the time of the appraisal for the easement purchase by the state agencies 
the state agencies provided a project description of the acquisition of the conservation easement as requiring approximately acres of leveled agricultural fields to be restored to a mixture of seasonal and wetlands,grasslands,and forested wetlands.the conservation easement specifically precluded the cultivation of agricultural crops for commercial gain on the easement lands as a use inconsistent with the easement.
the conservation easement incorporated the management plan designed for the property and made part of the easement covenants.such management plan required the conversion of the property from agricultural fields to wetlands.according to the management plan this would require existing permanent levees in a meandering fashion such that all interior and exterior levees are feet high and contain at least side slopes except where a levee borders a ditch,in which case the slope on the ditch side shall be,constructing permanent interior levees maximum feet high,minimum side slopes to replace small rice dikes such that permanent interior levees are present at maximum intervals of every of elevational drop within each field,developing or improving ditches as necessary to facilitate independent flooding and drainage of wetland units,installing flashboard riser water control structures diameter pipe,spill width to allow the timely of wetland units and precise control of wetland water depths,constructing channels or swales feet wide,of excavation that meander from the inlet to outlet structures,utilizing the resultant spoil to restore variable pond bottom topography by constructing underwater berms and hummocks,developing small linear loafing bars feet long,feet wide,minimum side slopes,above the water level and possibly some higher mounds for duck blinds,planting isolated clumps of hardstem bulrush tules throughout the wetland area,and planting native willows and cottonwoods in areas that can be irrigated for the first two years.the cost for the project,not including the cost of the conservation easement itself,was estimated at.
the project would result in approximately acres of wetlands and acres of uplands.some of the wetlands would be seasonal wetlands,but at least acres would be wetlands brood ponds,which would be flooded continuously during the spring and summer from at least march through july.
the california waterfowl association cwa received a grant to fund the construction work.cwa submitted a work plan for the project which listed the following specific work to be done an existing hp pump will be refurbished.a ft pipeline will be installed to irrigate the southern upland field.levees will be refurbished or constructed and flashboard risers will be installed to control the application and management of water.a catch basin will be constructed to take advantage of free water from the agricultural drainage ditch.approximately acres of brood ponds will be constructed an irrigation swale will be cut from the pump,around the interior upland field and into the catch basin swales will be cut throughout the wetland units from inlet to outlet to facilitate water delivery and drainage.excavated soil from the swales will be used to construct levees and diversify pond bottom topography.in addition to swales,ponds will be cut into the fields,varying in depth from feet to inches with an average of inches in depth.tules,cottonwood trees and willow trees will be planted to restore native vegetation.small berms will be constructed in the southern upland field to facilitate irrigation.all uplands will be planted with a mix to establish dense nesting cover for locally nesting waterfowl,songbirds,and pheasants.
the dfg recommended the wcb approve the project.the dfg took the position the acquisition of the conservation easement was exempt from ceqa under class of the guidelines categorical exemptions for acquisitions for wildlife conservation purposes and the restoration efforts were exempt from ceqa under class of the guidelines categorical exemptions for minor alterations of land to benefit fish and wildlife.the wcb approved the project on february,and on march,filed a notice of exemption asserting the project was exempt from ceqa under class.
the farm bureau filed a petition in the trial court against the state agencies seeking a writ of mandate and injunctive relief alleging violations of ceqa and the williamson act.the county,traynham,and the cwa were named as real parties in interest.richard mora,an individual agricultural landowner in the county,was allowed to file a complaint in intervention similarly alleging violations of the williamson act and joining in the farm bureau demand for relief under ceqa the county filed a and against the state agencies and traynham alleging violations of the williamson act and failure to comply with county codes and ordinances.the trial court granted a preliminary injunction and stay against the state agencies,traynham,and the cwa.the trial court ordered the county action bifurcated and stayed pending resolution of the farm bureau petition.
after the state agencies and traynham amended the conservation easement to allow some commercial grazing of livestock on the property,the county dismissed its causes of action for violations of the williamson act,but filed a new writ petition alleging violations of ceqa by the state agencies in approving the amendment to the easement.all parties stipulated to allow the farm bureau to intervene in the county new petition alleging ceqa violations and to consolidate the two lawsuits.
the trial court ultimately ruled the project was not exempt from ceqa and issued a peremptory writ directing the state agencies to set aside the decision finding the project to be exempt,to refrain from any future approvals of the project unless made in compliance with ceqa,to use the condition of the property as it existed prior to the wcb approval of the project on february,as the baseline for the environmental review,and in the interim to cease all activity relating to the project.the trial court granted the motions of the farm bureau,mora,and the county for attorney fees on the ceqa issue.
the remaining claims of the petition,and complaint in intervention were settled and dismissed.final judgment on the consolidated matters was entered and the state agencies have appealed.
discussion 
compliance with ceqaa.ceqa overview and standards of review 
ceqa is a comprehensive scheme designed to provide protection to the environment.mountain lion foundation fish game com.cal th,d,mountain lion foundation.it is to be interpreted to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language.citation.ibid.and the legislature has directed the secretary of the resource agency to promulgate a list of classes of projects that have no significant effect on the environment.a project falling within such a categorical exemption is not subject to ceqa.id.at,d.
to achieve this objective,the guidelines establish a process to assist a public agency in determining which document to prepare for a project subject to ceqa.guidelines,subd.k.in the first step,the lead public agency preliminarily examines the project to determine whether the project is statutorily exempt from ceqa,falls within a guidelines categorical exemption or if it can be seen with certainty that the project will not have a significant effect on the environment.citations.mountain lion foundation,supra,cal th at,d.if so,no further agency evaluation under ceqa is required.the agency may prepare a notice of exemption.guidelines,subd.k,see apartment of greater los angeles city of los angeles th,d,fn.omitted notice of exemption has no significance other than to trigger the running of the limitations period remy et,guide to the california environmental quality act ed hereafter remy,ceqa guide agency may,but need not,file notice of exemption.if,however,the project does not fall within an exemption and it can not be seen with certainty that the project will not have a significant effect on the environment,the agency takes the second step and conducts an initial study to determine whether the project may have a significant effect on the environment.guidelines,subd.k,no oil,city of los angeles cal d,no oil.if the initial study shows there is no substantial evidence the project may have a significant effect on the environment or revisions to the project would avoid such an effect,the lead agency prepares a negative declaration,subd.c guidelines,subd.k,subd.b,et if the initial study shows there is substantial evidence,in light of the whole record that the project may have a significant effect on the environment,the lead agency must take the third step and prepare an environmental impact report eir,subd.d,guidelines,subd.k,et no oil,supra,at,salmon protection watershed network county of marin th,d.
a s ignificant effect on the environment is statutorily defined as a substantial,or potentially substantial,adverse change in the environment.environment means the physical conditions which exist within the area which will be affected by a proposed project,including land,air,water,minerals,flora,fauna,noise,objects of historic or aesthetic significance.combining these statutory definitions,a significant effect on the environment under ceqa is a substantial or potentially substantial adverse change in the physical conditions existing within the area affected by the project.
at issue here is the first step in the ceqa process,the determination of whether the project as defined by the state agencies is subject to ceqa so that an initial study must be undertaken.
judicial review of an agency compliance with ceqa where no administrative hearing at the agency level was required is governed by section,which limits judicial inquiry to whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion.no oil,supra,cal d at,fn.abuse of discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law or if the determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence.we apply this same standard on appeal,reviewing the agency action,not the trial court decision.lighthouse field beach rescue city of santa cruz th,d.
where the specific issue is whether the lead agency correctly determined a project fell within a categorical exemption,we must first determine as a matter of law the scope of the exemption and then determine if substantial evidence supports the agency factual finding that the project fell within the exemption.fairbank city of mill valley th,d fairbank see also azusa land reclamation main san gabriel basin watermaster th,d.the lead agency has the burden to demonstrate such substantial evidence.magan county of kings th,d davidon homes city of san jose th,d davidon homes.
once the agency meets this burden to establish the project is within a categorically exempt class,the burden shifts to the party challenging the exemption to show that the project is not exempt because it falls within one of the exceptions listed in guidelines section.davidon homes,supra,th at,d.
where the agency fails to demonstrate the project is within a categorically exempt class,the project may nevertheless be exempt from ceqa if it can be seen with certainty that the project will not have a significant effect on the environment.citations.mountain lion foundation,supra,cal th at,d.the guidelines cover this concept in section,subdivision b,called the exemption,which provides in part ceqa applies only to projects which have the potential for causing a significant effect on the environment.where it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant effect on the environment,the activity is not subject to ceqa.the discussion accompanying this guideline explains subsection b provides a short way for agencies to deal with discretionary activities which could arguably be subject to the ceqa process but which common sense provides should not be subject to the act.this section is based on the idea that ceqa applies jurisdictionally to activities which have the potential for causing environmental effects.where an activity has no possibility of causing a significant effect,the activity will not be subject to ceqa.remy,ceqa guide,supra,appendix v,davidon homes,supra,th at,d.
in the case of the common sense exemption,the agency has the burden to provide the support for its decision before the burden shifts to the challenger.imposing the burden on members of the public in the first instance to prove a possibility for substantial adverse environmental impact would frustrate ceqa fundamental purpose of ensuring that government officials make decisions with environmental consequences in mind.davidon homes,supra,th at,d,quoting bozung local agency formation com.cal d.t he agency exemption determination must be supported by evidence in the record demonstrating that the agency considered possible environmental impacts in reaching its decision.davidon homes,supra,at,d see east peninsula ed.council,palos verdes peninsula unified school dist.d.
keeping these principles in mind,we turn to the issues in this case.
class categorical exemption 
section,subdivision a,mandates that the guidelines include a list of classes of projects which have been determined not to have a significant effect on the environment and which shall be exempt from this division.these categorical exemptions are found in article et of the guidelines.where a project is categorically exempt,it is not subject to ceqa requirements and may be implemented without any ceqa compliance whatsoever.citation.in keeping with general principles of statutory construction,exemptions are construed narrowly and will not be unreasonably expanded beyond their terms.citations.strict construction allows ceqa to be interpreted in a manner affording the fullest possible environmental protections within the reasonable scope of statutory language.citations.it also comports with the statutory directive that exemptions may be provided only for projects which have been determined not to have a significant environmental effect.citations.county of amador,supra,th at,d.
in this case,the dfg took the position the acquisition of the conservation easement was exempt from ceqa under class of the guidelines categorical exemptions for acquisitions for wildlife conservation purposes.guidelines.the wcb approved the project and filed a notice of exemption asserting the project was exempt from ceqa under class.
at the time of the filing of the notice of exemption,section of the guidelines provided class consists of the acquisition of lands for fish and wildlife conservation purposes including preservation of fish and wildlife habitat,establishing ecological reserves under fish and game code section,and preserving access to public lands and waters where the purpose of the acquisition is to preserve the land in its natural condition.section was amended in to read class consists of the acquisition of lands for fish and wildlife conservation purposes including a preservation of fish and wildlife habitat,b establishing ecological reserves under fish and game code section,and c preserving access to public lands and waters where the purpose of the acquisition is to preserve the land in its natural condition.changes in italics.the initial statement of reasons for regulatory action issued by the california resources agency resources agency noted the necessity for the revisions was to avoid the misperception that the qualifying language at the end of example c regarding the purpose of the acquisition applies to all three examples of acquisitions for fish and wildlife conservation purposes.the final statement of reasons issued by the resources agency for the amendments to this section indicate this revision was intended to provide structure and clarity to this section by labeling each of the three examples without changing any existing language or punctuation.
based on the amendment of section and these statements indicating the revisions did not change,but clarified,the existing language,the state agencies argue the acquisition of the conservation easement falls within the class exemption even if the property is in other than a natural condition,it is farmland we agree the clarifying revisions and the normal last antecedent rule of construction make clear that,even before the amendment when wcb filed the notice of exemption,land did not necessarily have to be in its natural condition to qualify for a class exemption.we disagree,however,with the state agencies argument that section applies to the acquisition of land for conversion to wetlands,which conversion requires active construction and ongoing maintenance,such as the project defined by the state agencies here.
section provides three examples of acquisitions for conservation purposes that will qualify for categorical exemption under class.the first example is an acquisition for the preservation of fish and wildlife habitat.webster third new international dictionary defines the verb to preserve variously as to keep safe from injury,harm,or destruction,to protect,save or to keep alive,intact,in existence,or from decay.these definitions connote,as the county suggests,the safe keeping of an existing condition.for this first example in section,that existing condition need not be land in its original natural condition,but it must be existing habitat.the language simply does not stretch to cover acquisitions for the purpose of physically constructing or creating and actively managing new wildlife habitat.
the state agencies do not suggest this project falls within either of the other two listed examples of acquisitions covered by class.the state agencies do argue the term including indicates that there may be other circumstances,not specifically spelled out,when acquisition of land for fish and wildlife conservation purposes is exempt.both the initial and final statement of reasons for the amendments to section by the resources agency describe the three acquisitions listed in section as examples,suggesting the section is not intended to be limited to the three described acquisitions.however,even assuming other acquisitions for wildlife conservation purposes could be covered by the class categorical exemption,such acquisitions would still have to be similar in kind to the listed examples.
we turn to the related maxims noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis to divine the regulatory intent behind section.noscitur a sociis literally,it is known from its associates means that a word may be defined by its accompanying words and phrases,since ordinarily the coupling of words denotes an intention that they should be understood in the same general sense.sutherland,statutory construction ed,fn.omitted.ejusdem generis literally,of the same kind harris capital growth investors xiv cal d,fn,engelmann state bd.of education th,fn,d,means that where general words follow specific words,or specific words follow general words in a statutory enumeration,the general words are construed to embrace only things similar in nature to those enumerated by the specific words.sutherland,statutory construction,supra,fns.omitted.
here we have already discussed the first example given in section,which covers preservation of fish and wildlife habitat.even though the state agencies do not claim the project falls within the purview of the two other examples,these examples are helpful to understand the scope of the section exemption.the second example is the acquisition of lands for the purpose of establishing ecological reserves under fish and game code section.fish and game code section provides for the protection of threatened or endangered native plants,wildlife,or aquatic organisms or specialized habitat types,both terrestrial and nonmarine aquatic,or large heterogeneous nature gene pools for the future use of mankind through the establishment of ecological reserves.to establish such reserves,the statute authorizes the dfg to acquire land and nonmarine water,by a variety of methods,suitable for that purpose.this statute too appears to contemplate the acquisition of existing habitat or land already in a condition to provide habitat.nothing in the language of the statute suggests land may be acquired for the purpose of making it suitable for an ecological reserve.the third example given in section is even more restrictive acquisition is limited to preserving access to public lands and waters where the purpose of the acquisition is to preserve the land in its natural condition.italics added.these examples narrow the construction that should be given the language for fish and wildlife conservation purposes in section to the acquisition of land already in a natural condition or providing existing habitat or ready to provide habitat.
the evidence in the record regarding the traynham ranch shows the property has been actively farmed,growing row crops,rice and most recently sudan grass.it is not existing wetland habitat.the purpose of the acquisition is to convert the property into a habitat,not to preserve a natural condition or existing habitat.there is no evidence in the record that the property will provide wildlife habitat without the construction and active management contemplated by the management plan we do not view the evidence that waterfowl and shorebirds already occasionally feed in the winter on the thousands of acres of rice fields in the area as substantial evidence the property itself is existing habitat so as to come within the class exemption.
the state agencies have not met their burden to show by substantial evidence the project comes within the class categorical exemption.the wcb abused its discretion in finding this project exempt under the class categorical exemption.
class categorical exemption 
in briefing the merits of the ceqa issues before the trial court,and now again on appeal,the state agencies assert that the improvements required by the management plan for the conservation easement on the property were exempt under the guidelines class categorical exemption.guidelines.farm bureau complains this exemption was not identified in the notice of exemption filed by the wcb after approval of the project.however,it is clear a notice of exemption is not mandatory and its only effect when filed is to start the statute of limitations running.guidelines,subd.k,see apartment of greater los angeles city of los angeles,supra,th at,d remy,ceqa guide.therefore,the fact the wcb listed the project as exempt only under class and not class would not necessarily preclude the wcb from defending its exemption determination by asserting other categorical exemptions,at least where there is no claim or showing of prejudice.compare mcqueen bd.of directors of the regional open space district d,notice of exemption improperly used,incomplete and misleading mcqueen,disapproved on other grounds in western states petroleum superior court cal th,d,with centinela hosp.city of inglewood d.notice of exemption with inaccurate project description upheld.
the county complains the state agencies combination of two separate categorical exemptions to cover the project is an improper segmentation of the project.the ceqa guidelines define a project to mean the whole of an action.guidelines,subd.a.it would be improper for an agency to divide a project into separate parts to avoid ceqa review.mcqueen,supra,d at.however,where the agency considers the project as a whole and determines the combined effect of two exemptions places the entire project outside the scope of ceqa,no improper segmentation has occurred.see surfrider foundation cal.coastal comm th,d combination of statutory and categorical exemption placed project outside purview of ceqa.
the problem here is the acquisition of the land does not fall within the class categorical exemption identified by the state agencies and the construction work identified in the management plan for this project,further identified by the work plan submitted by cwa,does not fit within the class categorical exemption for minor alternations to land.
class consists of minor public or private alterations in the condition of land,water,vegetation which do not involve removal of healthy,mature,scenic trees except for forestry and agricultural purposes.guidelines.examples given by section include,but are not limited to,a grading on land with a slope of less than percent,b new gardening or landscaping,including the replacement of existing conventional landscaping with water efficient or fire resistant landscaping,c filling of earth into previously excavated land with material compatible with the natural features of the site,d minor alternations in land,water,and vegetation on existing officially designated wildlife management areas or fish production facilities,which result in improvement of habitat or greater fish production,e minor temporary use of land having negligible or no permanent effect on the environment,such as carnivals or christmas tree sales,f minor trenching and backfilling where the surface is restored,g maintenance dredging where the spoil is deposited in an authorized spoil area,h the creation of bicycle lanes on existing,and i fuel management activities within a certain distance of structures to reduce the volume of flammable vegetation meeting with some limitations.
the state agencies claim the proposed improvements to the property here easily fall within the definition of minor alterations to land.the state agencies suggest the alterations are consistent with the type of minor alterations to improve habitat described in subdivision d of section.we disagree.first,subdivision d of section covers minor alterations to improve habitat on existing designated wildlife management areas or fish production facilities.the property here is not an existing wildlife management area or fish production facility.second,the language of subdivision d reasonably suggests the kinds of activities exempted are those minor alterations which improve existing wildlife habitat,not the creation of habitat.finally,and most fundamentally,the class exemption applies to only minor alterations,which this project is not.the management plan calls for,among other things,a change in both the height and slope of existing levees,the construction of new permanent interior levees to replace small rice dikes,the construction of to wide and to deep swales or channels meandering throughout the property,the digging of ponds of up to feet in depth in addition to the swales,the construction of to long and to wide loafing bars,plus some higher mounds for duck blinds,the construction of a catch basin,using the excavation spoil to construct what will become underwater berms and hummocks,the installation of feet of pipeline plus a number of flashboard risers,and the planting of new riparian vegetation including trees.the work will result in acres of new ponds,which will require regular management and maintenance.the work will clearly alter existing drainage patterns and elevations of the land.it will change the nature of the land from level fields to wetlands.this is not a minor physical alteration to the land as exemplified by the kinds of examples listed in section.exemption categories are not to be expanded beyond the reasonable scope of their statutory language.lion foundation,supra,cal th at,d,see dehne county of santa clara d.see myers bd.of supervisors d.
the state agencies have not met their burden to show this project falls within the class categorical exemption.
class categorical exemption 
in a footnote in their opening brief in the section discussing the class categorical exemption,the state agencies assert,without substantive analysis or supporting citations to the record and authorities,the project is also exempt under the class categorical exemption guidelines.we may disregard arguments not properly presented under appropriate headings as required under rule a of the california rules of court heavenly valley el dorado county bd.of equalization th,fn,d and may treat as forfeited arguments merely asserted without support.kim sumitomo bank th,d.however,even if we were to reach this issue,we would conclude this project is not categorically exempt under class.
guidelines,section provides a categorical exemption for transfers of ownership in land to preserve existing natural conditions and historical resources.section states class consists of the transfers of ownership interests in land in order to preserve open space,habitat,or historical resources.examples include but are not limited to 
a acquisition,sale or other transfer of areas to preserve the existing natural conditions,including plant or animal habitats.
b acquisition,sale or other transfer of areas to allow continued agricultural use of the areas.
c acquisition,sale,or other transfer to allow restoration of natural conditions,including plant or animal habitats.
d acquisition,sale,or other transfer to prevent encroachment of development into flood plains.
e acquisition,sale,or other transfer to preserve historical resources.
f acquisition,sale,or other transfer to preserve open space or lands for park purposes.italics added.
section by its terms covers only acquisitions,sales or other transfers of ownership interests for particular purposes.it does not cover anything else.therefore,even if we were to decide that the acquisition of the property in this case could be covered by section,which we do not,the exemption would not cover the project as defined by the state agencies with its management plan component requiring significant construction.
the state agencies have not met their burden to show the project in this case was categorically exempt under guidelines section.
e.the common sense exemption 
even though the state agencies have failed to bring the project within the scope of any statutory or specific categorical exemption,the project may nevertheless be exempt from ceqa if it can be seen with certainty that the
