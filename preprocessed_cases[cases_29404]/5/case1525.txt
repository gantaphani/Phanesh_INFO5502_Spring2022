background 
tokyo tanabe company,owns patents and,which are directed to a lung surfactant composition for treating respiratory distress syndrome in premature babies.pursuant to an exclusive license of the and patents,abbott developed a commercial product known as survanta in the.at about the same time,ony developed its own product for treating neonatal respiratory distress syndrome called calf lung surfactant extract clse.in june,ony entered into an agreement with forest for forest to further develop and market clse under the trade name infasurf.
from until,abbott and ony maintained contact regarding the development of clse.abbott met with ony in november to discuss the development,composition,and testing of clse,and later informed ony that it had opted to develop the tanabe product instead of clse because the tanabe product had patent protection.in april,at abbott request,ony submitted a memorandum of invention to abbott disclosing everything known about clse for abbott to conduct a patentability search.upon completion of the search,abbott informed ony that clse was likely not patentable in light of two pertinent references,but did not mention the and patents nonetheless,abbott encouraged ony that it look ed forward to working with ony in the future.in april,abbott again met with ony to discuss the possibility of joint development of clse and suggested that some future collaboration might still be possible.abbott continued to monitor the development of clse until,while internally expressing concern that ony might receive fda approval for clse before abbott could do so for survanta.
in july,abbott received both fda approval and orphan drug status providing seven years market exclusivity for survanta,which it then proceeded to market.several years later,abbott informed ony and forest that it had reason to believe that infasurf would infringe the and patents if it were to be marketed.nonetheless,in march,ony filed a new drug application for approval to market infasurf.the fda then notified ony that infasurf was the same drug as survanta under the orphan drug act,and that it therefore could not be approved for sale until abbott period of exclusivity expired in july.
in light of abbott june letter claiming infringement and the fda notification that infasurf and survanta were the same drug,ony and forest sued abbott and tanabe in the district court for the western district of new york,seeking a declaratory judgment of noninfringement and invalidity of the and patents.abbott and tanabe counterclaimed for infringement.a jury found both patents infringed and not invalid and,in an advisory verdict,rejected ony and forest defense of equitable estoppel.the district court,however,granted ony and forest a judgment of noninfringement as a matter of law jmol on the ground that abbott and tanabe had failed to present any evidence at trial to show that clse met the water content limitations of the patents in suit either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents.forest,abbott,dist.lexis,at,wl june,forest i.in a separate opinion,the court also ruled that abbott,and tanabe by imputation,was equitably estopped from asserting infringement of the and patents against ony and forest because abbott,in bad faith,misled ony and forest to believe that it would not assert infringement by encouraging their development of infasurf and by neglecting its duty to inform them of any possible infringement ony and forest reasonably relied on abbott misleading conduct and ony and forest would suffer economic and evidentiary prejudice if abbott were permitted to proceed with its infringement counterclaim.forest,abbott,dist.lexis,at june,forest ii.on appeal,we affirmed the jmol of noninfringement and,having done so,declined to consider the equitable estoppel issue.forest,abbott,forest iii.
the district court subsequently granted ony and forest motion for attorney fees and expenses against abbott,but not tanabe.the court found the case to be exceptional under because abbott,in bad faith,encouraged ony to develop clse,disregarded its duty to advise ony and forest of possible infringement,and pursued its infringement counterclaim with a reckless disregard for the facts in an attempt to prevent infasurf from reaching the market.forest iv,slip op.at.in so finding,the court rejected abbott argument that fees could not be awarded for conduct that occurred prior to litigation and held that,in any event,abbott had acted in bad faith during litigation by bringing suit with knowledge of its prior conduct toward ony and forest.id.at.having found the case to be exceptional,the court then chose to exercise its discretion and award attorney fees in order to avoid a gross injustice and to deter patentees from similar conduct in the future.id.at.upon the parties stipulation as to the amount of any fee award,the court entered an award against abbott of million in attorney fees and expenses.forest,abbott.

ony and forest respond that the district court properly found that abbott conduct,its failure to raise the issue of infringement with ony and forest between and,while encouraging the development of infasurf as an alternative until it received fda approval for survanta,makes this case exceptional.they point out that the court did not need to find by clear and convincing evidence that the elements of an equitable estoppel defense were proved,but only that this case was exceptional.ony and forest also maintain that a finding of exceptionality was appropriate because abbott s
