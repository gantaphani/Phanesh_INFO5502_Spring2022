wagner wagner,llp,and daniel baurkot,appeal from judge gleeson adoption of magistrate judge mann report and recommendation.
after an infant compromise hearing,judge mann awarded in attorneys fees and in expenses to atkinson,haskins,nellis,brittingham,gladd,carwile,the atkinson firm or appellees,and in attorneys fees and in expenses to wagner wagner,llp.she denied an award of fees to baurkot because wagner wagner sharing of the fees with baurkot was not properly disclosed to plaintiffs and baurkot had performed no services of value in the litigation.therefore,she concluded,the fee sharing agreement was in violation of new york disciplinary rule dr the magistrate judge awarded baurkot portion of the fee to the plaintiffs.appellants then took this appeal.the atkinson firm has filed a brief responding to wagner wagner argument that if we affirm the award to the plaintiffs,the fee splitting agreement between wagner wagner and the atkinson firm requires a redistribution of fees between the two firms.
on september,we issued an order affirming the district court order.given the nature of this appeal taken by attorneys who continue to represent the plaintiffs from a judgment in plaintiffs favor and evidence that the annuity called for in the settlement had not been established we appointed pro bono counsel to represent the plaintiffs and forbade appellants from contacting plaintiffs except through pro bono counsel.our order stated that an opinion would follow.this is that opinion.
background 
a the underlying action 
after his daughter was injured by a paper shredder,lee rodriguez contacted baurkot to discuss legal assistance.on april,baurkot contacted wagner wagner,after which representatives of wagner wagner met with rodriguez and his wife,evelyn custodio,the mother of the injured girl.during that meeting,plaintiffs retained wagner wagner on a basis to reach a settlement or bring an action on behalf of their daughter and themselves as plaintiffs.appellants then executed a fee agreement between themselves,providing that wagner wagner would receive of any recovered fee and baurkot would receive the remaining.
in,the atkinson firm,which had experience with similar cases,contacted wagner wagner.after consultation with baurkot and the plaintiffs,wagner wagner retained the atkinson firm.the retention agreement provided that the atkinson firm would receive of any contingency fee received,while wagner wagner would receive of the fee,to be shared with baurkot pursuant to the existing agreement.
ultimately,the action was brought in the eastern district,with wagner wagner as the attorneys of record and the atkinson firm as lead counsel.this led to an agreement to settle the matter for,that,after the payment of fees,was to fund an annuity in the infant plaintiff name.
b attorneys fee proceedings 
pursuant to local civil rule a the magistrate judge held an infant compromise hearing to review the proposed settlement and award of fees.although the attorneys were in agreement regarding the sharing of the fee award and the plaintiffs consented to the fee,the judge sua sponte questioned whether dr permitted wagner wagner to share its fee with baurkot.she expressed concern that baurkot had not performed any work in the matter and that his fee was simply a referral fee this concern arose at least in part,because i wagner wagner failed to initially disclose baurkot share of the fee to the court and ii prior to the disclosure of baurkot share in a supplemental petition filed the day before the infant compromise hearing,the magistrate judge had never heard of baurkot.
when the plaintiffs were questioned about their contact with baurkot,custodio stated that she could not recall his name.rodriguez testified that he had spoken to baurkot once over the phone and had a sense that baurkot would receive a portion of the fee because he was the first attorney contacted,but that he was not sure whether he was going to be working on the case or not.the attorneys from wagner wagner stated only that baurkot has been involved and been in constant contact with wagner wagner throughout the litigation.they also added conclusory statements relating to baurkot routine involvement in other cases that he had referred to wagner wagner.dissatisfied with this record,the magistrate judge requested submissions from baurkot and wagner wagner regarding the specific services baurkot provided in the present litigation.
both wagner wagner and baurkot submitted supplemental affidavits and memoranda of law.wagner wagner also submitted its entire file in the case.baurkot claimed that after he was first contacted by rodriguez,they had several other telephone conversations that enabled baurkot to conduct a preliminary investigation.baurkot also claimed that once he concluded that wagner wagner should become involved in the matter,he introduced rodriguez to members of wagner wagner over the telephone on august.according to baurkot,he advised plaintiffs of the arrangement between himself and wagner wagner during that phone call,and they agreed to it.baurkot also asserted that he was involved in strategic decisions about the case,including the decision to file the claim in federal court instead of state court and the decision to bring in the atkinson firm.
edward wagner,a member of wagner wagner,submitted an affidavit stating that wagner wagner informed plaintiffs of the arrangement between wagner wagner and baurkot during a meeting with the plaintiffs on august,and that the parents agreed to the arrangement.he also asserted that baurkot was involved in the decision to file suit in federal court and that baurkot was involved throughout the case,even reminding him of specific facts on one occasion.however,wagner acknowledged that he could not describe with greater particularity the amount or type of work performed by baurkot.
wagner wagner file contained several hundred pages of documents,but only four that referred to baurkot.these four dealt exclusively with the retaining of wagner wagner and the atkinson firm and with resultant fee agreements.none of the documents involved constituted legal services on behalf of the plaintiffs.nor did any of the documents submitted show the parents consented to the arrangement.
on august,the magistrate judge issued her report and recommendation.after acknowledging that both wagner wagner and plaintiffs agreed that their retainer agreement provided for a contingency fee,she examined each individual fee request and determined that both wagner wagner request for fees of,representing of of the total contingency fee,and the atkinson firm request for in fees,representing of the total contingency fee,were reasonable.
the magistrate judge then denied any portion of the attorneys fees to baurkot because dr prohibited it.first,she found that dr was violated because plaintiffs never received the required disclosure of the agreement.the judge rejected wagner wagner and baurkot contentions that they had orally sought and received the required consent.instead,the magistrate judge relied on the plaintiffs testimony indicating they were unaware that baurkot would be working on the case.
second,the magistrate judge concluded that dr was violated because the requirement that either the work done be in proportion to the fee received or that the attorneys agree in a writing to undertake joint responsibility was not met.in so finding,she relied on several pieces of evidence,including i wagner wagner initial failure to disclose baurkot share of the fee to plaintiffs ii wagner wagner and baurkot failure to show specific work he performed on the case and iii the lack of any documents in wagner wagner file to corroborate the claim that baurkot performed services on the case.
the magistrate judge determined that the portion of the fee claimed by baurkot should be awarded to the plaintiffs,rather than going to wagner wagner.she expressed a concern that the fee would still find its way to baurkot if wagner wagner received it,and,moreover,noted that wagner wagner had acknowledged that it considered fair and adequate compensation for its efforts.
wagner wagner and baurkot filed timely objections to
