international computer negotiations,icn appeals from a district court order denying sanctions under title,against attorney basyle tchividjian,his law firm landis graham french,attorney craig berman,and his law firm berman law firm,for their conduct in representing a plaintiff in a wrongful discharge suit against icn.after thorough review,we affirm.
the essential facts and procedural history are these.this appeal regarding attorneys fees sought under arises out of the underlying wrongful discharge suit brought by kevin hudson hudson pursuant to the florida civil rights act of.stat,et fcra,and of the employee retirement income security act,erisa,against his former employer,appellant icn.
from may through november,hudson worked for icn,a consulting and educational organization that advises and trains technology procurement professionals and others involved in negotiating large business transactions.hudson served as the director of caucus,an operating division of icn that serves as an association of technology procurement professionals with chapters throughout the country.caucus membership provides access to quarterly educational meetings,online fora,conferences and seminars,and a certification program,and hudson responsibilities included organizing these meetings and increasing membership.hudson employment agreement contained a clause as well as a clause.by the time of his termination,hudson benefits included disability,whose premiums icn paid for,as well as optional disability,whose premiums hudson would be responsible for if he elected that coverage.
icn founder and president,joseph auer iii auer,testified in deposition that he was generally aware of hudson business activities and performance early in hudson tenure at icn,and that a lthough there were some aspects of his performance that i thought were not particularly strong and should have been done differently or better,hudson had usually done acceptable work.in the fall of,however,hudson came under auer direct supervision.auer testified that by late or early he realized that hudson performance fell far below what i expected and required.auer began to object to several aspects of hudson performance.hudson acknowledges that auer repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction over these issues,although he defended his performance against auer critiques and argued that auer method of voicing criticism was abusive.
all parties agree that auer and hudson relationship began to deteriorate at this point.however,although auer would often object to hudson performance,sometimes in front of other employees,auer indicated on more than one occasion,when asked by hudson,that he did not want hudson resignation.instead,auer assured hudson that he was a valuable member of the team.moreover,in august,in anticipation of taking a sabbatical from icn,auer created an executive committee to run the company in his absence.auer included hudson on the committee,and gave each member of the committee a raise.hudson also generally received annual raises during his time at icn.nevertheless,a few months before his termination in november,hudson began seeking alternative employment because he was not happy at icn under auer supervision.
on or about september,auer was entering icn offices while hudson was leaving.auer asked hudson where he was going,and noted that hudson had been leaving the office often.at hudson request,they proceeded to auer office,where hudson explained that he was seeing a psychologist and a psychiatrist for depression,and that he had chosen providers close to icn offices so that he would not have to take much time off.according to hudson,auer said that he understood and that he was supportive.both agree that the brief conversation ended there.
in early october,auer asked hudson how he ensured that new caucus members were made aware of the list serve icn provides,which allows members to communicate with each other and share ideas.according to auer,hudson said that it had been his longstanding practice to have his assistant,bonnie whitaker whitaker,contact each new member and explain the list serve to him or her.when auer later questioned hudson assistant about this practice,she was at first evasive,but eventually confessed that hudson had only recently told her to begin contacting new members to tell them about the list serve,that no one had previously been doing so,and that hudson had further instructed her that if auer asked,to tell him that she had been engaged in the practice for a long time.auer testified that i nstructing an employee to lie to me was the last straw,and he decided to fire hudson.however,auer says that he decided to wait to fire hudson until after the conclusion of what was at that time the biggest event icn had annual caucus conference scheduled in new orleans for the third week of october,all aspects of which hudson was responsible for organizing and producing.
although auer concedes that the conference went well overall,and that certainly hudson put lots of work into it,auer observed additional issues with hudson performance that confirmed his decision to terminate hudson for poor performance.however,hudson and auer did not see each other after the conference until auer fired hudson on november.
prior to that,in the weeks leading up to his termination,hudson approached icn chief financial officer daniel wallace wallace,who was responsible for certain human resources tasks,about insurance questions he had concerning some of the employees working under hudson.wallace apparently did not have ready answers to each of hudson questions at that time.
icn office manager,deborah rosenblum rosenblum,testified that during the latter part of hudson time at icn,he confided to her that he was in counseling for pressures,including the way he believed he was being treated by auer,and that he was being treated for depression.hudson says he confided in rosenblum because she had confided in him about a similar situation affecting someone close to her,because she kept track of where everyone was so i needed to tell her that i would be going out,because he needed someone in the office to know what was going on,just because of the nature of the situation,and because she was the benefits coordinator,so it was kind of hard to hide anything from that person.
on october and again on november,hudson asked rosenblum for a copy of his disability policy or for detailed information about what disability benefits he had.on both occasions she said that she did not have that information,and that hudson would have to obtain it from the insurance carrier itself.on november,the insurance company faxed to hudson home one page from his disability policy concerning a mental health provision.there is no indication from the fax itself that it was copied to anyone else,and hudson did not share it with anyone at icn.
on november or,wallace passed hudson in the icn offices and indicated that he would get back to him about an insurance question,which he did not more specifically describe.
on november,the first time auer saw hudson after the october conference,auer personally terminated hudson.auer testified that he was the sole.auer explained that he discussed with hudson that things were just not working out,and auer listed some of the performance issues that had been troubling him since late or early.auer said that the conversation was actually pretty amicable and,and that hudson broached the subject of his buying caucus from icn.hudson agrees that he may have broached the idea.
on november,hudson met with his attorney,tchividjian,for the first time to seek legal advice concerning his ability to procure unemployment compensation,although he also mentioned that he was suffering from depression and had been terminated just several days after asking rosenblum about his disability insurance policy.shortly thereafter,about one month after his termination,hudson filed for and received unemployment benefits.
between late november and,hudson and icn engaged in protracted severance negotiations that grew contentious.on december,wallace sent hudson a letter reminding him of his obligation to adhere to the and provisions of his employment agreement,and warned that icn would take any action necessary in response to a violation of this agreement.on january,hudson responded that he was not subject to any such agreement,that in fact he may be engaging in employment or ownership in the technology arena,and likewise warned that he would take all action necessary to prevent icn from inhibiting him.on january,hudson and attorney tchividjian met again,this time to discuss hudson severance negotiations with icn.although they discussed the legal claims hudson might have against icn,tchividjian advised that corroborating evidence was needed.
in march,after turning down multiple job offers,hudson started his own business,technology procurement education network,tpen.in,icn learned about tpen,and on july,icn sued hudson in the circuit court for the ninth judicial circuit,in orange county,florida,to enforce the,and confidentiality clauses of his employment agreement.
on august,tchividjian,who had not met with hudson since january,filed an answer on hudson behalf.in his affirmative defenses,hudson alleged for the first ten months after his he had been unlawfully terminated because of a disability.sometime between august and november,hudson called tchividjian to inform him that he had located the fax sent directly from the insurer to hudson home containing the portion of his insurance plan pertaining to his disability benefits.in november,about a year after hudson termination,tchividjian filed a complaint on hudson behalf with the florida commission on human rights,alleging that icn termination of hudson constituted discrimination on the basis of disability.
nineteen months after his june,filed this suit against icn on hudson behalf in the united states district court for the middle district of florida,alleging that auer terminated him because of his depression,which he said constituted a disability,in violation of the florida civil rights act of.stat,et fcra,and in order to deprive him of disability benefits,in violation of of the employee retirement income security act,erisa hudson also brought a claim under florida common law,alleging that icn negligently misrepresented that he would not be fired in the months leading up to his termination.the complaint also claimed that auer abuse in the workplace was the cause of hudson depression.
as the district court would later find in its first sanctions order,icn was forced to file three separate motions to compel the production of documents,complete answers to interrogatories,and rule disclosures.despite the fact that the district court granted each of these motions,hudson failed to comply with at least one of them,forcing icn to file yet another motion to compel compliance with the court order,which the court granted and pursuant to which it awarded attorneys fees to icn.
icn subpoenaed hudson mental health records,which hudson did not have and which tchividjian had not reviewed prior to filing the lawsuit.they revealed that hudson had been seeing a mental health professional well before he began working for icn,that during all times of treatment hudson had been able to work,and that his psychiatrist believed hudson to be a capable person.as the district court would later find,the conflicting evidence on this issue showed that hudson had suffered major depression prior to his termination,but had not been clinically depressed at the time of his termination.in any case,the court determined,there was no evidence that hudson depression substantially limited his ability to work,and the evidence showed that hudson was,at the time of this suit,able to fully function in life.
tchividjian took several depositions,most of which failed to support hudson claims.rosenblum testified that she had not mentioned hudson inquiry to anyone,including auer and wallace.wallace testified that in his november or comment to hudson indicating that he would get back to him about an insurance question,he was referring to one of the questions hudson had asked him about an employee under hudson supervision,and that he had no knowledge that hudson had made any inquiries about himself or that hudson was receiving any sort of counseling or treatment for depression.auer testified that he had no knowledge that hudson had inquired about his disability benefits,and that he did not view hudson as being disabled based on the single comment hudson made to him indicating that he was seeing a professional for depression.auer observed that he alone made the decision to fire hudson when,after what he considered to be a year of substandard performance,he learned that hudson had asked whitaker to lie to him.finally,although by the time of her deposition she herself had been terminated by icn,whitaker confirmed that auer had repeatedly raised issues with hudson about his performance,that hudson had instructed her to lie to auer,and that when auer learned of the fabrication he became very upset.
the only testimony to support hudson case came in the form of an affidavit submitted by former icn employee lara proctor,hudson executive assistant beginning in may.proctor swore that e veryone in the office knew that rosenblum primary role at icn was to keep auer informed about what was going on in the office based upon prior experiences,we were all aware that whatever was shared with rosenblum would be subsequently communicated to auer.there is no doubt that rosenblum would have told auer that hudson was seeking information on both short and long term disability.
icn moved for summary judgment on all three counts,arguing that,as for the erisa claim,the evidence showed that auer alone made the decision to terminate hudson,that he was not aware of hudson inquiry regarding disability,and that as for the fcra claim,the evidence showed that hudson alleged depression had not come close to substantially impairing a major life activity.in sum,icn argued that hudson could not make out a prima facie case under either statute,and that even if he could,icn had shown legitimate reasons for his termination.icn also argued,with respect to the negligent misrepresentation claim,that hudson could not have relied to his detriment on anything auer told him because the evidence showed that hudson had been actively seeking alternative employment months before his termination.
hudson and tchividjian arranged for berman to prepare hudson response to icn motion for summary judgment.that response abandoned the negligent misrepresentation claim.it did,however,oppose summary judgment as to his claims under erisa and the fcra,arguing that a genuine issue of material fact existed concerning auer knowledge of hudson inquiry to rosenblum that his depression had substantially limited his ability to interact with others and concentrate,his emotional stability,his sexual drive,and his ability to sleep and that even if hudson was not disabled,auer had terminated hudson based on his perception that hudson was disabled.berman also argued generally that the undisputed facts harmful to hudson claims must be disregarded because they came from the testimony of interested parties.
the district court granted summary judgment to icn on all counts.as for the erisa claim,the court found that hudson could not show that auer,the sole,had the specific intent to interfere with hudson erisa rights,which is the ultimate inquiry in a case.order at quoting clark coats clark,cir.the district court concluded that the best hudson could do was offer his unsupported assumption that rosenblum told auer of hudson request concerning assumption the court said was further weakened by evidence showing that rosenblum did not inform anyone,and that auer was not aware of that request prior to hudson termination.
as for the fcra claim,the court found that hudson could not show that his depression substantially limits a major life activity,in particular,his ability to work,nor had hudson established that he was regarded as being impaired.instead,the court found that both before and after his termination,hudson engaged in a successful job search and started his own company.the court concluded 
hudson has utterly failed to support his claims under both erisa and fcra.particularly given the circumstances of this case and the timing of this suit,it appears that this suit is little more than a retaliatory action by hudson in response to icn suit regarding the agreement.indeed,these circumstances,combined with hudson utter inability to support his claims,make his claims appear little more than frivolous.
counsel tchividjian timely filed a notice of appeal and berman prepared and filed hudson appellate brief in which he made essentially the same arguments he presented in his opposition to summary judgment.in a brief,unpublished per curiam opinion,a panel of this court affirmed without oral argument,agreeing with the district court that hudson utter inability to support his claims made them little more than frivolous.cir.icn then moved for attorneys fees against hudson and his attorneys under g of erisa,of the fcra,and.by separate order,we granted icn unopposed motion to transfer consideration of appellate attorneys fees to the district court.see cir.july,
on remand,the district court considered icn motion as to both district court and appellate attorneys fees under erisa,the fcra,and against hudson,tchividjian,and berman.berman filed one opposition on his own behalf and a second one on hudson behalf,both of which relied on this court decision in cordoba dillard,cir.tchividjian filed an opposition on his own behalf.
on july,the district court entered its first order on this issue which,among others,assessed attorneys fees against lawyers tchividjian and berman personally under.the court concluded 
while no one consideration,standing alone,would be sufficient for the court to impose sanctions under section,the court finds that in combination,the frivolous nature of the claim,hudson retaliatory motive,counsel handling of the case particularly as it relates to discovery,and the continued efforts to support the claims in the face of both a lack of supporting evidence and clear evidence to the contrary,warrant the imposition of sanctions.
as for the frivolous nature of hudson claim,the district court said that it was able to make clear findings of fact from the evidence produced through discovery,and that several of the arguments hudson made in response to icn motion for summary judgment def ied any semblance of logic.specifically,the district court found,with respect to hudson erisa claim,that the evidence did not support the claim that auer knew of hudson request for disability benefits information.the evidence distinctly demonstrate d that rosenblum,the only person with whom hudson spoke about his benefits,did not advise auer of hudson request.nor was hudson warranted in his attempts to infer from wallace purported knowledge of hudson request for benefits information that auer also was aware of hudson request.
as for hudson fcra claim,the district court found that hudson had produced no evidence that his depression substantially limited his life activities,which was necessary to support his claim that he is disabled within the meaning of the fcra.nor,the court found,could hudson save his fcra claim by arguing that auer discharged him because of a perceived disability the clear evidence showed that auer terminated hudson because of dissatisfaction with various aspects of hudson performance,rather than because of hudson admission to auer that he suffered from depression.the district court concluded that although hudson claims were questionable at best when they were made,and then discovery revealed or should have revealed an almost complete lack of factual support for his claims,hudson and his counsel nevertheless pressed on,attempting to create argument to support their untenable position.the district court also imposed sanctions for hudson appeal to this court,noting that he raised virtually the same argument before us as those presented to the district court.
tchividjian moved for reconsideration because the court appeared to have overlooked his brief and considered only berman briefs.the district court granted the motion.on july,this court issued its opinion in amlong amlong,denny,cir,as amended,in which we noted that an attorney under the threat of sanctions is entitled to an evidentiary hearing.see id.at.shortly thereafter,both berman and tchividjian asked for such a hearing.the district court granted the application.
at the october,hearing,the district court noted that the hearing was being held,and the motion for reconsideration had been granted,in part in order to consider whether its original order granting sanctions was incorrect under circuit precedent found in cordoba dillard,cir.after the hearing,the court concluded that it had no option but to vacate its prior order,and refused to award fees.the district court said that although it continued to believe that hudson case had been frivolous,it read cordoba,which involved a similar fact pattern,as precluding fees in this case.
the district court stated that other than a typographical error in its prior order,he had no reason to change my findings,per se.i still think this case was frivolous.i do think that there was ever any connection between the request for disability information and the termination by the decision maker.tr.in addition,the court noted,circumstantial evidence suggested there is reason to believe that the federal case was brought in retaliation for icn suing hudson in state court,giving at least the appearance that federal process was being used as leverage as opposed to being used on the merits.in particular,the temporal proximity of the filing of the two cases and hudson offer to settle the federal case in exchange for icn dropping the state case were cause for concern.however,the court expressly found that it had no basis to get into the minds of the parties involved,and therefore ca make a finding that it so.id.moreover,the district court said that it had only recently learned that tchividjian firm had taken the federal case on a contingency fee basis,which it found tends to weigh against a finding that the lawyers brought the case knowing that it was frivolous and unlikely to succeed.accordingly,the district court rejected an award of sanctions under.
as for the fees incurred pursuant to hudson appeal of the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of icn,the district court concluded that it was not in a position to either legally or factually determine sanctions from appeal.id.the district court stated that determining whether sanctions are justified for bringing a frivolous appeal is the job of the appellate court,not of the district court.the district court entered an order to that effect,citing the reasons stated in open court during the hearing,and noting that its decision came particularly in light of the decision in cordoba.
icn appeals from the district court final order.its appeal is limited to the district court refusal to assess attorneys fees against hudson attorneys under.
we review a district court order under for abuse of discretion.cordoba,at.an abuse of discretion occurs if the judge fails to apply the proper legal standard or to follow proper procedures in making the determination,or bases an award upon findings of fact that are clearly erroneous.id.at internal quotations omitted.icn does not dispute the district court findings of fact.instead,it argues that the district court made a legal error,constituting abuse of discretion,in interpreting cordoba as having created a per se bar to sanctions in certain categories of cases.see app.br.at.
sanctions for conduct related to the district court proceedings 
section provides,in pertinent part,that a ny attorney who so multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously may be required by the court to satisfy personally the excess costs,expenses,and attorneys fees reasonably incurred because of such conduct.under the plain language of the statute,then,in order for a court to justify sanctions,it must find that three conditions apply 
first,the attorney must engage in unreasonable and vexatious conduct.second,that unreasonable and vexatious conduct must be conduct that multiplies the proceedings.finally,the dollar amount of the sanction must bear a financial nexus to the excess proceedings,the sanction may not exceed the costs,expenses,and attorneys fees reasonably incurred because of such conduct.
peterson bmi refractories,cir.an attorney conduct meets the first of these conditions only when the attorney conduct is so egregious that it is tantamount to bad faith.amlong amlong,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.a n attorney conduct must be particularly egregious to warrant the imposition of attorney must knowingly or recklessly pursue a frivolous claim id.at.n egligent conduct,standing alone,will not support a finding of bad faith under for sanctions under section to be appropriate,something more than a lack of merit is required.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
while an attorney conduct must be tantamount to bad faith,for purposes of,bad faith turns not on the attorney subjective intent,but on the attorney objective conduct.id.at.what is crucial is whether,regardless of the attorney subjective intentions,the conduct was unreasonable and vexatious when measured against an objective standard.id.that is not to say the attorney purpose or intent is irrelevant.although the attorney objective conduct is the focus of the analysis,the attorney subjective state of mind is frequently an important piece of the calculus,because a given act is more likely to fall outside the bounds of acceptable conduct and therefore be unreasonabl e and vexatious if it is done with a malicious purpose or intent.id.at.
icn argues that the district court committed legal error constituting an abuse of discretion by reading cordoba as setting a per se bar against sanctions in a wrongful discharge case whenever an employer actual knowledge is disputed.we do not read the district court statements on the record at the conclusion of the evidentiary hearing as interpreting cordoba in this way,although we agree with icn that such an interpretation of cordoba or any of our cases would be erroneous.as we reiterated in cordoba itself and have had occasion to stress before,d eterminations regarding frivolity are to be made on a basis.cordoba,at quoting sullivan sch.bd.of pinellas county,cir emphasis added.but,even if the district court had read cordoba as imposing a per se rule,we would still affirm because under the strikingly similar facts of cordoba,the attorney conduct here was not so egregious that it is tantamount to bad faith.amlong amlong,at.
in that case,cordoba sued her former employer,the department store dillard,for wrongful termination on the basis of disability,in violation of the ada and the fcra.at.after the district court granted summary judgment in favor of dillard on all counts and before we affirmed in an unpublished opinion,dillard sought attorneys fees against both cordoba and her attorney,dempsey,under,inter alia.id.the district court granted the motion.however,cordoba and dempsey appealed,and we reversed.id.
cordoba was a sales associate at dillard,where she was one of about employees.id.cordoba direct supervisor was stossel,the area sales manager asm in the area of the store where she worked.id.stossel supervisor,in turn,was groo.id.one day in august,cordoba came to work wearing a plainly visible heart monitor to aid her doctor in diagnosing some heart issues she had been experiencing.at least one noticed it and discussed it with cordoba.id.at.in may,cordoba had to leave work to go to the hospital because she had a heart episode.id.in january,she again had to leave work for the hospital because she had another episode.id.at this time cordoba was finally diagnosed as suffering from a congenital heart disorder which caused her to have sporadic episodes of an erratic heartbeat,and for which she took medication that caused additional side effects.id.cordoba discussed her condition with several of her colleagues on a number of occasions.id.in march,her doctor recommended surgery,which cordoba scheduled for that summer.id.at.
cordoba and stossel discussed cordoba condition on at least a few occasions.id.at.stossel knew of cordoba diagnosis,that she had scheduled surgery,and that she would need a couple of weeks off to recuperate.id.at least once,stossel noticed cordoba sitting down on the job and cordoba explained that she was having heart palpitations cordoba also reported to stossel any time she needed to leave work because of an episode.id.in march or april,cordoba asked stossel for a reduction in hours and requested that she not have to work nights because her medication caused her fatigue.stossel said it would take a while to fulfill those requests because doing so would require hiring another employee.dillard complied in about one month.id.
groo,on the other hand,had very little contact with cordoba and would later testify that she had no inkling that cordoba had any health problems.id.in october,groo and cordoba met about some unexcused absences and tardiness.cordoba explained to groo that she had been sick and was going to a lot of doctors appointments and getting a lot of testing done,and that the doctors had not yet determined what was wrong with her.id.
on june,a customer asked cordoba to return a garment.id.at.cordoba determined that she needed the approval of an asm before accepting the return,and because stossel was unavailable,she contacted sebben,the asm of another store area.sebben and cordoba apparently had a heated exchange after which sebben asked cordoba whether she liked working at dillard.cordoba said that she hated dillard but continued working there for the insurance benefits,which she depended on.id.at.sebben related the incident to stossel two days later,and stossel,in turn,related the story to groo.id.at.groo then asked stossel and cordoba to her office to discuss the matter.cordoba did not apologize for the remark,but did explain that she was being sarcastic in the face of what she perceived to be sebben verbal attack on her.groo told cordoba that if she did not like her job,she could no longer work at dillard.cordoba says she tried to persuade groo to reconsider,but groo handed her her termination papers.id.
in september,cordoba sued dillard,alleging that she had been terminated because of her heart condition.id.at.the evidence showed that cordoba condition was not recorded anywhere in her personnel files groo and stossel testified that they had never discussed her condition and groo was the sole.id.the district court granted summary judgment to dillard.it found that there was a question of fact as to whether cordoba was disabled,but granted summary judgment because it found that cordoba could not show that the sole,groo,was aware of her alleged disability.id.the district court also note d with concern that,quite apart from the question of what defendant knew,there is serious reason to doubt even that plaintiff considered herself to be disabled at any time during her tenure at dillard.id.at.in fact,in her application for unemployment benefits,she stated that she was not disabled.id.cordoba had made an alternative argument that dillard had constructive knowledge of her disability,which the district court rejected as making no sense without groo first having actual knowledge.id.finally,cordoba argued that stossel actual knowledge created institutional liability for dillard.id.on appeal,we affirmed,rejecting each of cordoba theories of liability.id.
the district court assessed fees,inter alia,against cordoba counsel under,finding that dempsey conduct was tantamount to bad faith,as required by our case law construing the statute.id.at.specifically,the trial court found that attorney dempsey had acted in reckless disregard of a serious defect in cordoba case groo lack of knowledge of her alleged disability.id.at.the court determined that cordoba actual knowledge theory had no basis in fact,while her constructive knowledge theory had no basis in law,and that at some point,counsel obviously grasped these defects,yet instead of retreating from a frivolous suit through voluntary dismissal or settlement,he pushed on through summary judgment.id.
reviewing for an abuse of discretion,we reversed the sanctions order.id.at.we found that cordoba h
