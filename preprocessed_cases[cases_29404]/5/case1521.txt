a.the merits issues 
on september,the plaintiffs moved for summary judgment of infringement on the patent count.on september,porta systems for summary judgment of on the patent count.on november,porta systems moved for dismissal and summary judgment on the ground that the plaintiffs lacked standing with respect to both the patent and trademark counts.
on february,the district court granted summary judgment for porta systems on the patent count for lack of infringement and on the trademark and trade dress count for lack of standing in an omnibus order.waymark porta,slip op.at,omnibus order.it considered patent infringement only under a.that section provided that whoever without authority makes,uses,offers to sell,or sells any patented invention,within the united states or imports into the united states any patented invention during the term of the patent therefor,infringes the patent.a.the district court found a inapplicable because there was no evidence that porta systems ever produced an infringing device after the assignment to the partnership was made.the court noted that the plaintiffs had produced exhibits that indicated that porta systems had produced and shipped some components that,if assembled,would infringe claim of the patent,but that these exhibits did not indicate that an assembled battscan device was ever made by porta systems.id.at.the court dismissed the trademark count for lack of standing because the trademark for the name battscan was registered with the patent and trademark office by plaintiff waymark on september,more than one year after plaintiffs filed their complaint alleging trademark infringement.id.at.
the plaintiffs timely moved for reconsideration,apparently for the first time specifically asserting that porta systems had infringed under f by shipping to mexico components that,if assembled,would infringe the patent on april,the district court denied the plaintiffs motion,holding that t here can be no contributory infringement under f without the fact or intention of direct infringement.waymark porta,slip op.at.the plaintiffs timely appealed to this court solely on the issue of patent infringement under a and f.on appeal the plaintiffs did not challenge the grant of summary judgment as to the trademark and trade dress count.
on april,we held that the district court had properly granted summary judgment on infringement under a because that section requires assembly,or a nearly complete testing assembly,within the united states,which had not occurred.waymark porta systems,at,at.on infringement under f,however,we held that summary judgment was improperly granted because,contrary to the district court interpretation of that section,actual combination or assembly of the components by the alleged infringer was not required.id.at,at.t he statutory language in this section does not require an actual combination of the components,but only a showing that the infringer shipped them with the intent that they be combined.id.because the district court had granted summary judgment on the lack of combination alone,we vacated and remanded with respect to the claims under f,while affirming summary judgment of the claims under a.id.at,at.we denied porta systems request for sanctions against the plaintiffs for bringing the appeal.
on october,the district court held a hearing on the remanded infringement claim and gave the appellants an additional ninety days of discovery on the issue of infringement under f.the district court cautioned during the hearing that it ha d a serious question about this infringement under f,i think you are running the risk of taking one sanction position and making it worse,but that up to you.on january,the appellants filed a stipulation of voluntary dismissal,which the district court entered on january.
b.the sanctions issues 
on march,while the appeal to this court was still pending,the district court granted porta systems motion for sanctions in the form of attorneys fees but did not set the amount.waymark porta,slip op.at.the court explained that it was granting the motion for three reasons the trademark for the name battscan not having been registered until more than a year after suit was filed,there was no basis for the claim of trademark infringement there was no written exclusive patent license agreement from the partnership to waymark as required under,and thus waymark did not have standing to file suit for infringement of the patent and the appellants provided a misleading response to defendant document request and the court order to show cause portion of the omnibus order with regard to the legally insufficient oral agreement to license the patent.id.at apparently based on the first two findings,the court concluded that had plaintiffs conducted a proper investigation,defendant would not have incurred the substantial attorney s fees and costs it now claims.id.the court held that the case was exceptional under a and,and that plaintiffs attorneys have unreasonably and vexatiously multiplied the proceedings in this case in violation of.id.at.
on january,after our disposition of the patent appeal,the district court entered a second sanctions order.waymark porta,slip op.at sanctions order.in the order,the district court reaffirmed its earlier sanctions order,recapitulating the bases for sanctions under a,and.id.the district court made no mention of our decision on appeal with respect to the patent claims.
the court later awarded a sanction of,which represented the court determination of the reasonable attorneys fees and costs due to plaintiffs continued pursuit of its claims for which no basis for recovery existed.waymark porta,slip op.at.this amount was assessed against the caravello family lp,waymark,and their lawyers,and was not apportioned.the caravello family lp,waymark,and the sanctioned counsel timely appealed to this court.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
