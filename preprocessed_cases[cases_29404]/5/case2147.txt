in may of,track attorney requested a meeting with platten.platten refused to meet.instead,platten sent track a letter stating in part,until we receive the list of tenants from november through october,with their addresses and terms of tenancy,together with a itemized list of what damages occurred on what dates,we can do nothing on this claim and a meeting would be useless.
track,kolchier,testified he had no way of gathering the information nor did kolchier believe the information was available to anyone else.track never submitted the information demanded by platten.
in order to perform repairs,track borrowed money secured by trust deeds on the building.it spent in repairs.of that amount was expended for damages covered under the policy.
track brought its action against crusader for breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.shortly prior to trial,crusader paid track on the claim.crusader did not require a release.
boyd veenstra testified as track expert.veenstra opined that crusader handling of the property damage claim fell well below the standard for handling claims.he said crusader failed in its duty to investigate.it did not determine the scope of loss,that is,a list of what needs to be done to put the building back together.crusader also failed to evaluate the claim objectively.it refused even to meet with track to discuss the loss.veenstra said an undisputed portion of the claim should have been paid long ago.
veenstra also testified that the documentation crusader requested of track was unreasonable.it demanded a list of tenants and the specific dates on which the damages occurred.veenstra said it was unreasonable to expect a mortgagee to have or get such information.the custom and practice in the insurance industry when there is a disputed claim or the amount of loss is unknown is to furnish the insured with a form for the insured to make a sworn statement of loss.crusader never did that.
the trial court found that crusader breached its contract and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.the court found that track substantially performed its duties under the contract or was excused from performance by the unavailability of the information requested by crusader.
the trial court found that track expended to repair damage covered under the policy.the court ruled,however,that the amount track can recover under the policy is limited to the difference between the obligation secured by the trust deed at the time of foreclosure and track credit bid.the court calculated that amount to be,less the paid by crusader prior to trial,for a total of due track under the insurance policy.the trial court also awarded prejudgment interest.
as compensatory damages for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,the trial court awarded track attorneys fees and for interest paid on the money it borrowed to fund the repairs.the trial court denied track request for punitive damages.

track appeali 
track contends the trial court should have awarded the cost of repair notwithstanding the partial credit bid.
it is well settled that when a lender makes a full credit bid at the foreclosure of its mortgage,it is precluded for purposes of collecting its debt from later claiming that the property was actually worth less.alliance mortgage rothwell cal th,d.under such circumstances,the lender is not entitled to insurance proceeds payable for prepurchase damage to the property.ibid.this is because the lender only interest in the property is the repayment of the debt.id.at,d.the lender interest having been satisfied,any other payment would result in a double recovery.ibid.
track concedes that in the absence of tortious conduct,these principles apply to limit the lender recovery even when its credit bid is only for part of the total obligation.but track distinguishes this case on the ground that here crusader is liable in tort for breaching its covenant of good faith and fair dealing
