the issues now before us arise from a dispute between two attorneys over fees generated from the successful prosecution of a case previously before us.see weeks baker mckenzie th,d.the trial court entered judgment against appellant in his action for breach of an agreement with respondent for division of attorney fees.the trial court found that the agreement violated rule of the rules of professional conduct,and appellant action for quantum meruit barred by the lapse of the statute of limitations.we conclude that appellant can not recover a portion of the contingent fee under the agreement,but is entitled to proceed with his claim for quantum meruit.
statement of facts and procedural history 
appellant and respondent were attorneys with separate law practices in san francisco.they had individual office letterheads,and respondent listed his professional address as his home law office on avenue.respondent also maintained a separate professional liability insurance policy for his practice.appellant and respondent did not list each other as employees or partners in any official documents they filed.
however,in accordance with an arrangement between appellant and respondent,they shared office space in and.respondent rented a conference room in appellant office building on sutter street for per month,to meet with clients and conduct depositions.although apparently not part of the formal arrangement,respondent also customarily used appellant office telephone service,law library,postage,fax and copy machines,maintained files and a computer in the office,rented a monthly parking space in the building parking lot,and was listed as a on the building directory.appellant assisted respondent with his work on a few cases.in addition,appellant staff regularly provided assistance to respondent with documents.
during,at respondent request appellant became in a sexual harassment action previously filed by respondent on behalf of his clients,rena weeks and mary rossman,against the law firm of baker mckenzie and attorney martin greenstein hereafter the weeks case.the oral contractual arrangement between appellant and respondent provided for appellant to receive of the attorney fee received in the weeks case.appellant role in the litigation was to maintain the files,conduct discovery assigned to him by respondent,confer with weeks in the office,and appear as on her behalf at pretrial hearings.appellant continued to work on other cases he had at the time.in pleadings filed in the weeks case,appellant and respondent were both listed as counsel for plaintiffs,at the sutter street office address.appellant also advanced costs and expenses in the case in the amount of.
during discovery in the weeks case,a dispute arose between appellant and respondent over disclosure to the defendants of confidential records of psychiatric evaluations and treatment of weeks at the devereux foundation following severe injuries she suffered in an automobile accident as a child,and appellant perceived efforts to persuade weeks to settle the case.on september,respondent sent notification by letter to appellant that he had been removed effective immediately from the weeks and rossman cases,with the approval of the clients.in the letter,respondent complained of appellant differing approach to these cases and failure to consult me on a variety of matters.the letter also confirmed that appellant would receive the compensation agreed upon between them earlier in the event of settlement of the case before depositions,of the attorney fees called for under my agreement with my clients,which is of the monies recovered thereafter,an increase to of the fees specified under the agreement with the clients and,reimbursement of the costs advanced by appellant to date respondent sent a copy of the letter to weeks,but did not obtain the client written consent to appellant removal from the case or the proposed compensation to be paid to him.
by return letter appellant accepted the compensation in the weeks case offered by respondent.on september,respondent filed a notice of association and disassociation of counsel in the weeks case,which stated that alan exelrod had been associated as counsel of record in place of appellant.
by letter dated november,respondent further complained of appellant malfeasance and violation of fiduciary duties to the clients in the weeks case.respondent reiterated that appellant would receive the payment as originally agreed upon of of the attorney fees of recovered in the weeks case upon submission of his time records,but would not receive payment in the rossman case.this letter,unlike the letter of september,did not show a copy to the clients.
the weeks case proceeded to jury trial in july of,and resulted in a large award of compensatory and punitive damages for plaintiff weeks,along with a significant award of attorney fees under government code section,subdivision b.counsel for respondent and exelrod informed appellant in a letter sent to him on october,that his failure to perform legal services in the weeks case,the wholly improper accounting he provided in his attorney fees billing statement,and unforeseen changed circumstances,all served as a basis for abrogation of any agreement between them as to a division of fees.this letter contained an offer to compensate appellant for his services in the weeks case in the amount of per hour for the total number of hours specified in his prior billing statement.appellant declined respondent offer,and suggested mediation of the fee dispute between them.
the judgment in favor of weeks,including the attorney fee award,was ultimately affirmed on appeal by this court in weeks baker mckenzie,supra,th,d.after the judgment in the weeks case was satisfied and respondent obtained his attorney fees in september of,the present action for breach of contract and common counts was filed by appellant on may.this appeal is from summary judgment granted in favor of respondent on grounds that the alleged agreement between the parties for division of fees is unenforceable as violative of rule of the rules of professional conduct,and the common count action for quantum meruit is barred by the governing statutes of limitations code civ,
discussion 
i.the validity of the agreement for division of attorney fees.
appellant argues that the trial court erred by finding the agreement between the parties for the division of attorney fees in the weeks case unenforceable as against public policy for lack of compliance with rule,which prohibits any division of a fee for legal services with a lawyer who is not a partner of,associate of,or shareholder with the attorney unless the client has consented in writing thereto after a full disclosure has been made in writing that a division of fees will be made and the terms of such division.appellant claims that his agreement with respondent does not fall within the scope of rule,and even if it does the violation or illegality does not render the contract invalid.
our task in reviewing the entry of summary judgment in respondent favor is to determine whether a triable issue of material fact remains to be adjudicated and not to decide the merits of the issues raised.flowmaster,superior court th,d.a motion for summary judgment is properly granted if the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.jackson ryder truck rental,th,d.a defendant is entitled to summary judgment if the record establishes as a matter of law that none of the plaintiff asserted causes of action can prevail.citation.citation.to succeed,a defendant moving for summary judgment must conclusively negate a necessary element of the plaintiff case or establish a complete defense and thereby demonstrate that under no hypothesis is there a material factual issue which requires the process of a trial.citations.flowmaster,superior court,supra,at,d.we conduct a de novo examination of the evidence and independently review the trial court determination of questions of law.campanano california medical center th,d romero american president lines,th,d.
a.the application of rule to the agreement.
in our review of the trial court finding that the agreement was illegal and unenforceable,we first confront appellant contention that rule is inapplicable to an agreement between attorneys for division of fees.appellant argues that rule exists for the benefit of the client only,and does not enable an attorney to confiscate fees legitimately earned by another attorney or confiscate costs advanced by that attorney.he adds that rule was designed only to impact referral fees and was never considered to apply to a situation where attorneys act as and share responsibilities,expenses and liabilities.
by its terms,rule is not strictly limited to pure referral agreements as appellant suggests the language of the prohibition is much more encompassing it specifies that an attorney shall not divide a fee for legal services with a lawyer who is not a partner of,associate of,or shareholder.italics added.nothing in rule indicates that division of fees for a pure referral agreement is proscribed unless it complies with the specified conditions,while a division without consent of the client is permitted if all of the attorneys perform at least some duties or legal services.the proscription is a blunt and broad one that extends to any division of fees for legal services.the clear and unambiguous language of rule imposes a categorical restriction on a division of fees without the client written consent,so we must follow it and decline to read a limitation into the statute.see chevron,workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d,perko enterprises,rrns enterprises th,d.
appellant argument that rule only applies to referral fees is also inconsistent with the opinion issued by the state bar,committee on professional responsibility,formal opinion.it describes the following criteria used to determine if a division of fees falls within the restrictions of rule whether the amount paid to the outside lawyer is compensation for the work performed and is paid whether or not the law office is paid by the client the amount paid by the attorney to the outside lawyer is neither negotiated nor based on fees which have been paid to the attorney by the client and the outside lawyer has no expectation of receiving a percentage fee.if all three criteria are met,there is no division of fees.cal.compendium on responsibility,state bar com.on responsibility,formal opn.here,the fee agreement did not meet all three of these criteria,since appellant had an expectation of receiving a percentage of the contingency fee.
moreover,we are convinced that the objectives of the rules of professional conduct to protect the public and promote respect and confidence in the legal profession are furthered by including in the purview of rule all agreements to divide fees,not just referrals.scolinos kolts th,d.attorney fee agreements are strictly construed against the attorney.bennett potter cal,lane wilkins d.in order to protect clients and to assure fee agreements are fair and understood by clients,the legislature enacted numerous statutes specifically delineating the required contents of most attorney fee agreements.bus.alderman hamilton d.the consumer protection rationale of rule is particularly vital where,as here,a contingent fee is split by agreement of attorneys,with the outside attorney paid a percentage of the fee,rather than compensation based upon an hourly rate or other set salary disclosure to the client of the allocation of fees and the outside attorney interest in the case is imperative to facilitate informed consent.even if all participating attorneys perform legal services and share responsibilities in a case,the client must still be protected by compliance with the disclosure and consent requirements of rule.any other interpretation of the rule would be essentially unworkable.if we were to determine that only pure referrals are covered by rule,attorneys would be easily able to circumvent the intended protections of the rule merely by structuring the agreement to provide that everyone performs some service,even if only of meaningless or trivial value to the case.we accordingly conclude that the agreement between appellant and respondent for division of fees falls within the scope of rule,despite the shared responsibilities and costs by the two attorneys.
b.the exception for partners and associates.
next,we confront appellant contention that his agreement with respondent is exempted from rule under the stated exception for partners and associates.appellant maintains that his relationship with respondent constituted a law firm as defined by the rules of professional conduct.he further argues,where actually share the work and costs of suit in one joint effort from the client perspective,a partnership or association exists for purposes of the rule exception,even if the attorneys do not practice with each other in the same law firm at all times.appellant highlights the parties common use of his law office,their agreement to share the profits in the weeks case,his contribution of substantial costs and performance of legal services in the case,and the listing of their names together on pleadings as counsel for the plaintiffs,to claim that they were partners or associates within the meaning of rule.he submits that at the very minimum a triable issue of fact has been raised by the evidence presented.
the evidence establishes that appellant and respondent did not operate a single law firm together.rule b a provides that a law firm means,two or more lawyers whose activities constitute the practice of law,and who share its profits,expenses,and liabilities.according to the undisputed evidence,appellant and respondent maintained separate law offices with separate identities,addresses,cases,expenses and liabilities.they may have collaborated on the weeks case and a few others,but they were not members of the same law firm as defined by the rules of professional conduct.
respondent was also not an associate of appellant,which is defined in rule b as an employee or fellow employee who is employed as a lawyer.respondent shared space in appellant independent law office neither attorney was directly employed by the other.appellant admitted that he neither had associates who worked for his law firm nor was an associate with another firm,and was never a salaried employee of respondent.in accordance with the agreement,appellant did not receive a salary or other payment of wages directly from respondent,as would an employee.instead,his compensation was based upon a percentage of the contingent fee paid to respondent by the client,which constitutes a division of fees under rule rather than employment of an associate.cal.compendium on responsibility,state bar com.on responsibility,formal opn.
in the very recent case of sims charness th,d,hereafter sims,the court reached a contrary conclusion in a dispute between two lawyers over the division of a contingent fee.charness,who had the original retainer agreement with the various clients,brought in sims with his trial expertise to try the cases,pursuant to an oral agreement between them for sims to receive percent of the attorney fees due under the client retainer agreement in the event a favorable verdict were obtained,at,d.our colleagues in the second district concluded that if a agreement and relationship between attorneys is not a pure referral,and the outside attorney functions essentially on the same basis as an employee of the law office,rule does not govern their agreement.sims,supra,at,d,italics omitted.
although we question the reasoning in sims,which seems to us to conflict with the very state bar committee on professional responsibility opinion upon which it purports to rely,the record before us does not support an argument that appellant was an associate within the meaning of rule the term associate in the framework of the practice of law can have diverse meanings in a myriad of contexts.see vapnek et,cal.practice guide professional responsibility the rutter group.while there appears to be a dearth of authority defining the term associate within the context of rule b,the term is usually employed to describe a salaried employee of the firm or other lawyer.vapnek et,cal.practice guide professional responsibility,supra.appellant was not a salaried employee.his compensation was exclusively a product of an percentage of the contingent fee which may be recovered in the weeks case.in contrast to the relationship of the attorneys in sims,respondent did not enlist appellant trial services to take advantage of his greater expertise,but rather essentially joined him in the weeks case for the use of his office and staff.appellant did not work exclusively for respondent,as sims did for charness.sims,supra,th at,d.further,it appears that appellant performed only minor,basically ministerial pretrial services,and did not continue to participate in the case through its successful conclusion as did the outside attorney in sims.while respondent fundamentally controlled appellant involvement in the case,we do not consider this factor dispositive where the compensation arrangement failed to treat appellant as an employee,and instead linked his compensation to the ultimate payment of the contingent fee by the client.we therefore conclude that appellant was not an associate of respondent for purposes of rule.
nor were appellant and respondent partners.a partnership is an association of two or more persons to carry on as a business for profit.ordinarily the existence of a partnership is evidenced by the right of the respective parties to participate in profits and losses and in the management and control of the business.black brundige.smith grove,d martin sharp fellows cont.kersch taber d.the parties did not engage in a common enterprise in which they shared profits and control as of a business.they agreed to split fees in a particular litigation venture,the weeks case,but otherwise operated entirely separate law firms.respondent used the facilities and equipment in appellant office,but paid appellant rent to do so,hardly an indication of a partnership relationship.we conclude that the agreement between appellant and respondent is not saved from the obligations of rule by the exception for partners and associates.
c.the effect of lack of compliance with rule.
since the record fails to prove full disclosure to the client in writing that a division of fees would be made and the terms of such division,or the client written consent for the division of fees,we turn to an examination of the effect of noncompliance with rule upon appellant right to recover from respondent for breach of the agreement.
appellant claims that a violation of rule does not render the contract unenforceable under the facts presented here.his argument is that rule is intended to protect the client,not to enable an attorney to confiscate fees legitimately earned by another attorney or confiscate costs advanced by that attorney.he submits that the violation of a disciplinary rule may not be interposed as a shield to avoid a contractual duty by respondent,particularly where the client apparently concurred with the arrangement.see potter peirce.hence,his argument concludes,no public policy purpose exists to prevent enforcement of the agreement for division of fees in the present case between two attorneys,despite the illegality.
courts are reluctant to enforce agreements that are offensive to public policy.pacific gas electric superior court th,d.as explained by our supreme court t he courts generally will not enforce an illegal bargain or lend their assistance to a party who seeks compensation for an illegal act.the reason for this refusal is not that the courts are unaware of possible injustice between the parties,and that the defendant may be left in possession of some benefit he should in good conscience turn over to the plaintiff,but that this consideration is outweighed by the importance of deterring illegal conduct.knowing that they will receive no help from the courts and must trust completely to each other good faith,the parties are less likely to enter an illegal arrangement in the first place.lewis queen ball sons cal d.waisbren peppercorn productions,th,d.this rule is applied not to secure justice between the parties but to promote a societal recognition that certain types of transactions should be discouraged.dunkin boskey th,d.public policy,in the context of a court refusal to enforce a contract term,may be based on the policy expressed in a statute or the rules of a voluntary regulatory entity,or may be implied from the language of such statute or rule.citation.when the policy of the statute or rule outweighs the interest in enforcement of the contract term,a court will not assist in giving effect to the offending term.cariveau halferty th,d.
we have observed that w hether a contract is illegal or contrary to public policy is a question of law to be determined from the circumstances of each particular case.jackson rogers wells d.before labeling a contract as being contrary to public policy,courts must carefully inquire into the nature of the conduct,the extent of public harm which may be involved,and the moral quality of the conduct of the parties in light of the prevailing standards of the community.moran harris,supra,d at.the question whether a contract violates public policy necessarily involves a degree of subjectivity.therefore,courts have been cautious in blithely applying public policy reasons to nullify otherwise enforceable contracts while contracts opposed to morality or law should not be allowed to show themselves in courts of justice,yet public policy requires and encourages the making of contracts by competent parties upon all valid and lawful considerations,and courts so recognizing have allowed parties the widest latitude in this regard and,unless it is entirely plain that a contract is violative of sound public policy,a court will never so declare.the power of the courts to declare a contract void for being in contravention of sound public policy is a very delicate and undefined power,and,like the power to declare a statute unconstitutional,should be exercised only in cases free from doubt.citation.no court ought to refuse its aid to enforce a contract on doubtful and uncertain grounds.the burden is on the defendant to show that its enforcement would be in violation of the settled public policy of this state,or injurious to the morals of its people.citation.citations.citation.dunkin boskey,supra,th at,d.
an attorney violation of one of the specified ethical duties to the client is harshly treated as a breach of vital public policy considerations.it is clearly contrary to the public policy of this state to condone a violation of the ethical duties which an attorney owes to his client.academy of california optometrists,superior court d.in recognition of this premise,c ontracts which violate the canons of professional ethics of an attorney may for that reason be void.ibid.kallen delug d.the general rule holds that where an attorney violates his or her ethical duties to the client,the attorney is not entitled to a fee for his or her services.cal pak delivery,united parcel service,th,d.
we disagree with appellant attempts to characterize the agreement as merely one between the two attorneys which did no harm to the client.the rules of professional conduct are not only ethical standards to guide the conduct of members of the bar but they also serve as an expression of public policy to protect the public.altschul sayble d.we do not have before us an innocent party,unencumbered by the ethical rules that govern attorneys,who seeks to enforce the contract,cain burns d.appellant is at least equally culpable as respondent by entering into a contract that contravenes public policy by failing to include terms and conditions necessary to protect the client.although the client has not personally sought to void the agreement in this litigation,we must nevertheless further the public policy objectives of rule by denying enforcement of a arrangement that fails to fulfill the requirements of disclosure and informed written consent.the rule that the courts will withhold relief under the terms of an illegal contract or agreement which is violative of public policy is intended to prevent the guilty party from reaping the benefit of his wrongful conduct,or to protect the public from the future consequences of an illegal contract.jacobs universal development th,d,quoting,cal d.the public policy violation is found in the contract itself,and a participating attorney may not obtain enforcement of it.see cain burns,supra,at.recovery by an attorney under an illegal agreement that violates the canons of professional ethics can not be countenanced.birbrower,montalbano,condon frank superior court cal th,d,campagna city of sanger th,d kallen delug,supra,d at.
in scolinos kolts,supra,th,d,summary judgment was granted in favor of the defendant attorneys in the plaintiff attorney action for breach of an agreement to pay him a referral fee share of the attorney fees paid by the client.on appeal,the court bluntly concluded that because it is uncontroverted there was no compliance with rule,the predecessor to rule,the alleged referral fee agreement is unenforceable on public policy grounds.scolinos kolts,supra,at,d.the same court very recently in margolin shemaria th,d,reaffirmed its ruling that noncompliance with rule renders a agreement unenforceable,despite evidence that the defendant referring attorney,shemaria,not only promised the plaintiffs to facilitate fulfillment of the requirements of the rule,but also explained the referral contract to the client and obtained her oral consent to it we see no reason to depart from the rationale in scolinos and margolin,and therefore conclude that the agreement between appellant and respondent for division of fees is unenforceable on public policy grounds 
we further reject appellant contention that substantial compliance with rule renders the agreement enforceable.according to the judicial doctrine of substantial compliance articulated by our supreme court in asdourian araj cal d,literal compliance with a regulatory statute may not be demanded in the situation in which the party seeking to escape his obligation has received the full protection which the statute contemplates,at,quoting latipac,superior court cal d,see also construction financial perlite plastering th,d.where,by applying the rule,the public can not be protected because the transaction has been completed,where no serious moral turpitude is involved,where the defendant is the one guilty of the greatest moral fault,and where to apply the rule will be to permit the defendant to be unjustly enriched at the expense of the plaintiff,the rule should not be applied.jacobs universal development,supra,th at,quoting norwood judd d.
we find no substantial compliance with the requirement of written consent by the client.contrary to appellant suggestion,we can not infer compliance with rule in the present case from evidence of respondent customary use of written contingency fee retainer agreements with his other clients that authorized his use of cocounsel without an increase in attorney fees.nor does the reference to the client concurrence with the termination of appellant as cocounsel in the letter of september,constitute fulfillment in substance with the conditions imposed by rule for a valid agreement to divide a fee for legal services.the letter did not precede or accompany the agreement,and did not furnish the client consent to the division of fees in writing,as rule demands,but rather was merely counsel declaration of the client approval of appellant removal from the weeks case long after the division had been agreed upon.the letter also does not contain the requisite disclosure to the client in writing that a division of fees will be made and the terms of such division.see campagna city of sanger,supra,th at,d.neither the letter nor any other evidence even approaches substantial compliance with rule.
further,the doctrine of substantial compliance can not be invoked here.we are not unmindful that this fee dispute is between attorneys only,and does not involve a client.we also realize that respondent appears to be taking advantage of his own violation of the professional rules.even so,rule exists to protect the public and to benefit clients by insuring that fee agreements are fair and understood.margolin shemaria,supra,th at,d.to enforce the agreement despite noncompliance with rule would thwart the focus and the object of rule,which is consumer protection,not attorney protection.the consumer protection comes from the attorney written disclosure and the client written consent,just as the consumer protection for clients of licensed real estate brokers comes from the necessity of having a written contract for broker fees.margolin shemaria,supra,at,d.without stringent and complete compliance with professional ethical standards,the fee agreement can not be enforced.see alderman hamilton,supra,d at.the recognized public policy to strictly enforce violations of ethical duties which attorneys owe to their clients precludes recovery by appellant under the terms of the illegal and void agreement with respondent for division of fees.margolin shemaria,supra,at,d scolinos kolts,supra,th at,d kallen delug,supra,d at.
ii.the quantum meruit cause of action.
we turn to appellant claim for recovery in quantum meruit for the reasonable value of the legal services he provided before his termination by respondent.appellant maintains that if the agreement for division of fees is voided,he is nevertheless entitled to recover for the reasonable value of his services and the costs he advanced under a quantum meruit theory.he asks for an award based upon a reasonable division of the contingency fee ultimately received.
appellant entitlement to quantum meruit recovery following his dismissal.
we proceed from the fundamental premise that an illegal contract may be enforced to avoid unjust enrichment or to prevent unconscionable injury.asdourian araj,supra,cal d at.the effect of illegality on a transaction depends on the facts and equities of the particular case.citation.in each case,the extent of enforceability and the type of remedy granted depend upon a variety of factors,including the nature of the illegality,the policies to be served by enforcing or denying enforcement of the agreement,and the relative culpability and equities of the parties.citations.the appropriate remedy would depend upon a weighing of these factors.citation.dunkin boskey,supra,th at,d see also arya group,cher th,d.
a quantum meruit or recovery rests upon the equitable theory that a contract to pay for services rendered is implied by law for reasons of justice.see,witkin,summary of california law ed.contracts,sections,page,pages,pages.hedging concepts,first alliance mortgage th,d.we agree with appellant that his quantum meruit cause of action is cognizable,but the award can not be based upon a division of the contingency fee.an attorney engaged pursuant a contingent fee agreement and discharged prior to occurrence of the contingency may recover in quantum meruit recovery for the reasonable value of services rendered up to the time of discharge,rather than the full amount of the agreed contingent fee.cazares saenz d.we recognize that appellant seeks recovery based upon a void agreement between attorneys,but we are persuaded that the illegality does not foreclose a quantum meruit cause of action.although both appellant and respondent failed to comply with the requirements of rule,appellant did perform legal services and advanced costs in the weeks case that contributed some benefit to the client and respondent.
despite violation of ethical duties to a client,the appellate courts have allowed partial fee recovery or acknowledged that some fees could be recovered by the attorney where there was no objection by the client clark millsap cal,for services rendered before the ethical breach jeffry pounds d.or on an unjust enrichment theory where the client recovery was a direct result of the attorney services estate of falco d.cal pak delivery,united parcel service,supra,th at,d.nothing in the record reveals that appellant relations with the client are tainted with fraud,or that the client objected to the agreement by which appellant acted as cocounsel,at least until the distinct alleged acts that precipitated his disc
