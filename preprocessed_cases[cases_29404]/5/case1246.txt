factual background 
this dispute centers around a material tlm that bnsf alleges moved onto its property from adjacent property owned by grant.the property bnsf and grant now own was once the location of an oil refinery which operated from until.tlm was a waste of the refinery operation.
bnsf property is located immediately east,and allegedly downhill,from grant property.bnsf alleges that in the early grant personally directed,or had reason to know of,substantial earth moving and construction on his property which bnsf alleges precipitated the migration of tlm onto its property.bnsf contends the migration of tlm has continued over a period of decades as a result of repeated heat expansion occurring each summer.bnsf investigated the tlm and methods for removing it from its property and undertook the removal and disposal of the material in july,expending a total of on this project.bnsf also constructed a foot berm on the property line to stop the alleged continued migration of tlm onto its property.
procedural background 
bnsf brought suit against grant seeking damages and injunctive relief asserting various legal theories,including claims under the provision of the resource conservation and recovery act rcra.bnsf also alleged the tlm was a public and private nuisance,and sought injunctive relief against grant in the form of abatement,and damages for unjust enrichment as a result of bnsf cleanup activities.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of grant on several of bnsf claims.first,it found that bnsf had failed to present a genuine issue of material fact on the imminent and substantial endangerment element of its rcra claim.a b.next,the district court concluded that bnsf could not proceed under.stat.tit,a,an oklahoma public nuisance statute,because the oklahoma department of environmental quality odeq had not issued a prior order.third,the district court held that bnsf failed to present a triable issue to obtain injunctive relief on its abatement claim because there was no present tlm migration,and because the court excluded as unreliable the testimony of bnsf expert regarding the likelihood of future migration.
bnsf proceeded to trial on its private nuisance and unjust enrichment claims.at the close of bnsf,the district court entered judgment as a matter of law for grant on all remaining claims.specifically,the district court held that grant role in the construction activities of the did not subject him to personal liability because he was protected by the corporate shield.the district court also held that grant could not be held personally liable as a successor landowner because bnsf never demanded that grant abate the alleged tlm migration.as for bnsf claim of unjust enrichment,the district court held that bnsf failed to establish that it had discharged an affirmative duty for which grant was responsible.
alternatively,the district court dismissed all of bnsf remaining claims on the ground that it had failed to set forth evidence of its damages.specifically,the district court entered judgment as a matter of law in favor of grant because it found that bnsf failed to prove the diminution in value that its property suffered as the result of the alleged tlm migration.further,the district court held that bnsf proof of damages was deficient because it failed to identify what costs it had expended within the applicable statute of limitations.
the district court also made various evidentiary rulings which limited the evidence bnsf could introduce at trial.specifically,the district court excluded the expert opinion of bnsf expert robert brownlee brownlee,who would testify that tlm migrated from grant property onto bnsf property.the district court also excluded various photographs and visual descriptions which bnsf proffered to address the alleged tlm migration.finally,after the entry of judgment as a matter of law,the district court awarded grant in attorney fees.
bnsf appeals the district court grant of summary judgment on its rcra,abatement and public nuisance claims.bnsf also appeals the district court judgment as a matter of law on its private nuisance and unjust enrichment claims,several of the district court evidentiary rulings,and the district court order awarding grant attorney fees.grant,in turn,the district court dismissal of its spoliation claim.
summary judgment 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party.see roberts printup,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
bnsf sought relief under rcra,a comprehensive environmental statute designed to make certain that solid and hazardous wastes are not disposed of in a manner harmful to the public health or the environment.see a.to meet these objectives,rcra regulates the generation,handling,treatment,storage,transportation,and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes.see.to ensure enforcement of these provisions,congress conferred enforcement power upon affected united states citizens.rcra provision,a,provides 
e xcept as provided in subsection b or c of this section,any person may commence a civil action on his own behalf 
b against any person,including the united states and any other governmental instrumentality or agency,to the extent permitted by the eleventh amendment to the constitution,and including any past or present generator,past or present transporter,or past or present owner or operator of a treatment,storage,or disposal facility,who has contributed or who is contributing to the past or present handling,storage,treatment,transportation,or disposal of any solid or hazardous waste which may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment.
a b emphasis added.
section a b,requires the defendant must be a person,including,though not limited to,one who was or is a generator or transporter of solid or hazardous waste,or one who was or is an owner or operator of a solid or hazardous waste treatment,storage,or disposal facility that this defendant contributed to,or is contributing to,the handling,storage,treatment,transportation,or disposal of solid or hazardous waste and that such waste may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment.see,cox city of dallas,cir.
in this case,our focus is upon the may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment language of a b.as a threshold matter,it is well established that the operative word in a b is may thus,bnsf must demonstrate tlm may present such a danger.see interfaith community organization honeywell int l,cir cox,at dague city of burlington,cir,rev in part on other grounds,d.this expansive language is intended to confer upon the courts the authority to grant affirmative equitable relief to the extent necessary to eliminate any risk posed by toxic wastes.dague,at quoting united states price,cir emphasis in original.
the supreme court has also held that the phrase may present communicates an additional idea,that is,it quite clearly excludes waste that no longer presents the harm contemplated by a b.meghrig kfc western,d.as such,under an imminent hazard citizen suit,the endangerment must be ongoing,but the conduct that created the endangerment need not be.cox,at quoting.coastal fishermen ass remington arms,cir see also price united states navy,cir holding that rcra does not require actual harm,but threatened or potential harm will suffice.
second,the term endangerment has been interpreted by courts to mean a threatened or potential harm,thus,it is not necessary that bnsf show proof of actual harm to health or the environment.see dague,at united states price,at.in other words,injunctive relief is authorized when there may be a risk of harm.this gives effect to congress intent to confer upon the courts the authority to grant affirmative equitable relief to the extent necessary to eliminate any risk posed by toxic wastes.dague,at emphasis in original.
third,the term imminent is not defined by rcra,however,the supreme court has held that a n endangerment can only be imminent if it threatens to occur immediately.meghrig,at.quotations omitted.nonetheless,a finding of imminency does not require a showing that actual harm will occur immediately as long as the risk of threatened harm is present.id.at.holding that there must be a threat which is present now,although the impact of the threat may not be felt until later quotations omitted.in other words,a n imminent hazard may be declared at any point in a chain of events which may ultimately result in harm to the public.davis sun oil,cir quoting dague,at see also united states navy,at.imminence,thus,refers to the nature of the threat rather than identification of the time when the endangerment initially arose.united states navy,at citation omitted.
finally,the word substantial is not defined in rcra or its legislative history.nonetheless,relevant case law has held that an endangerment is substantial under rcra when it is serious.interfaith,at parker scrap metal processors,cir cox,at.this does not necessitate quantification of endangerment,as an endangerment is substantial where there is reasonable cause for concern that someone or something may be exposed to risk of harm by release,or threatened release,of hazardous substances in the event remedial action is not taken.see.of toxic substances control interstate,d.as such,given rcra language and purpose,if an error is to be made in applying the endangerment standard,the error must be made in favor of protecting public health,welfare and the environment.interfaith,at quoting united states conservation chemical.
here,the district court found that the tlm removed from bnsf property and remaining on grant property failed to satisfy the rcra imminency requirement.the district court concluded imminency had not been established because bnsf failed to point to any person who had been injured by tlm or to any study establishing the material threatened to immediately cause harm to a person or the environment,neither the odeq or the environmental protection agency epa had ever ordered the tlm removed,and bnsf monitored the alleged migration of the tlm onto its property for years without acting.
bnsf claims the district court rationale for entering summary judgment on this claim is erroneous.we agree.bnsf correctly points out that it is irrelevant when the tlm was deposited on the property and equally irrelevant how long bnsf monitored the tlm before acting.see parker,at the section applies retroactively to past violations,so long as those violations are a present threat to health or the environment.also,the district court erred by limiting its consideration to only injury to persons when a b also requires consideration of imminent and substantial endangerment to the environment.section a b phrasing in the disjunctive indicates proof of harm to a living population is unnecessary to succeed on the merits.see interfaith,at.moreover,such a holding would remove from consideration tlm potential harm to health or the environment.see united states navy,at holding that rcra does not require actual harm,but threatened or potential harm.likewise,a finding of imminency does not require a showing that actual harm will occur immediately,as long as the risk of threatened harm exists.see meghrig,at.finally,prior administrative action on the part of the odeq or the epa is simply not a prerequisite to a citizen suit.in fact,no citizen suit can proceed if either the epa or the state has commenced,and is diligently prosecuting,a separate enforcement action.id.at.in short,the district court read too narrowly the imminent and substantial endangerment prong of a b.
we also conclude that there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether tlm may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment.a b.by way of example,various organizations,including the epa,have generated reports over a number of years which have analyzed tlm samples taken from both on and near grant property.many of these reports indicate that tlm contains carcinogens in quantities greater than those suggested by the epa.perhaps the most pertinent of these studies is a report conducted at the behest of bnsf the erm report which analyzed samples of tlm removed from grant property.the erm report states that the tlm sampled reveals the presence of certain contaminants which bnsf expert,diane delillio,testified were present in levels exceeding epa human health screening levels for industrial outdoor workers.delillio testified further that these contaminants were a cancer risk.likewise,brownlee testified that this tlm 
contain s elevated levels of known carcinogens in excess of current epa region human health screening levels specific to industrial outdoor concentrations.the materials also pose a threat to pets and wildlife as they are completely exposed.the presence of this material on the grant property,which is threatening to recontaminate the bnsf property,is an imminent and substantial health risk and endangerment to human health and the environment.the presence of this exposed material and its eruptive nature constitutes a potential threat to stormwater runoff and waters of the united states.
although grant vigorously argues that brownlee later retracted this testimony,we conclude that the record does not support such a reading.we also reject grant arguments asking us to weigh the credibility of brownlee testimony.anderson liberty lobby,d holding that c redibility determination,the weighing of the evidence,and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions,not those of a judge.therefore,based on this and additional evidence in the record,we conclude that there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether the tlm on grant property may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment.a b.accordingly,we reverse the district court and remand bnsf rcra claim for further proceedings.
bnsf next argues that the district court erred in dismissing its claim for injunctive relief seeking removal of the tlm from grant property to prevent its future migration.as a threshold matter,we resolve two issues raised by grant.first we conclude that this issue has been properly preserved for appeal.second,it is that we review the district court dismissal of bnsf claim at the summary judgment stage de novo and not,as grant suggests,for clear error.see roberts,at reviewing district court grant of summary judgment de novo.
we conclude that the district court erred in dismissing bnsf claim for injunctive relief.to the extent the district court read oklahoma law to require an tlm migration as a prerequisite to a plaintiff obtaining injunctive relief,it erred as a matter of law.under oklahoma law,injunctive relief is proper upon a showing that there is a reasonable probability that the injury sought to be prevented will occur if no injunction is issued a mere fear or apprehension of injury is insufficient.see sharp street landfill.moreover,insofar as the district court discounted the testimony of bnsf witness,jennifer hurley,as unreliable,because it was based upon a visual inspection of the tlm in relation to the berm,rather than a more scientific examination,the district court erred.see liberty lobby,at.see also seamons snow,cir i t is axiomatic that a judge may not evaluate the credibility of witnesses in deciding a motion for summary judgment.
we also agree with bnsf that there are genuine issues of material fact remaining.in oklahoma,entitlement to injunctive relief must be established by clear and convincing evidence and the injury alleged must not be speculative.thomas hampton.the supreme court has held that the inquiry involved in a ruling on a motion for summary judgment or for a directed verdict necessarily implicates the substantive evidentiary standard of proof that would apply at the trial on the merits.liberty lobby,at.therefore,because oklahoma law requires clear and convincing proof before a nuisance can be enjoined,we review the grant of summary judgment on the issue of injunctive relief in light of that standard.clear and convincing evidence is that measure or degree of proof produc ing in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief or conviction as to the truth of the allegation sought to be established.matter of.
when applying this standard to the record presented,we conclude that bnsf evidence was sufficient to create a triable issue as to whether there is a reasonable probability that tlm on grant property will migrate onto the property of bnsf.first,bnsf experts,hurley and brownlee,unambiguously assert that the tlm has continued to move towards the berm,and against it,and that,absent intervention,it threatens to overtop the berm.next,bnsf points to considerable evidence in the record of past tlm migration onto bnsf property,an issue which the district court did not resolve and about which there is vigorous dispute.third,bnsf also points to studies of soil borings which show substantial remaining tlm deposits near the berm.finally,both bnsf and grant experts set forth the mechanics of tlm migration heat,expansion,and settling to the lowest elevation.taken together,we agree that this past tlm migration,current tlm migration against the berm,ample quantities of tlm next to the berm,and the mechanics of tlm a triable issue as to whether there is a reasonable probability that the tlm on grant land will overtop the berm and contaminate bnsf land.accordingly,we reverse the district court and remand this issue for further proceedings on the abatement issue.
public nuisance 
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of grant on bnsf public nuisance claim brought pursuant to.stat.tit,of the oklahoma environmental quality code based upon its conclusion that an odeq enforcement action was a precondition to the existence of a public nuisance.on appeal,bnsf argues that the district court misread in reaching this conclusion.we agree.
section states 
a.it shall be unlawful for any person to cause pollution of any waters of the state or to place or cause to be placed any wastes in a location where they are likely to cause pollution of any air,land or waters of the state.any such action is hereby declared to be a public nuisance.
b.if the executive director finds that any of the air,land or waters of the state have been,or are being,polluted,the executive director shall make an order requiring such pollution to cease within a reasonable time,or requiring such manner of treatment or of disposition of the sewage or other polluting material as may in his judgment be necessary to prevent further pollution.it shall be the duty of the person to whom such order is directed to fully comply with the order of the executive director.
we review a district court statutory interpretation under a de novo standard.ward allstate ins,cir.the primary goal of statutory interpretation is to determine and follow legislative intent.head mccracken.to determine legislative intent,we look at the whole act in light of its general purpose and objective.rout crescent pub.works.when interpreting any statute,we begin with the plain and ordinary meaning of the language employed in the text.george failing watkins.
we conclude that the district court erred in holding that odeq enforcement action was a precondition to the existence of a public nuisance.to begin with,the language of.stat.tit,is unambiguous.nothing in the plain language of.stat.tit,requires an order by the executive director of the odeq before an act can be declared a public nuisance.nothing in subsection b purports to limit the scope of subsection a definition of the term public nuisance.see cox state ex rel.dep t of human.this court does not read exceptions into a statute nor may we impose requirements not mandated by the legislature.in fact,a reading of subsections a and b indicates subsection b was not intended to limit subsection 
subsection a states,in part,that i t shall be unlawful for any person to cause pollution of any waters of the state or to place or cause to be placed any wastes in a location where they are likely to cause pollution.stat.tit,a emphasis added.we view subsection a as a declaration of the type of conduct that constitutes a public nuisance under oklahoma law,and it is clear that the intent of subsection a is to deem as a public nuisance conduct that either has caused or is likely to cause pollution.accordingly,pollution need not have already occurred before conduct likely to cause pollution can be deemed a public nuisance.subsection b,on the other hand,demonstrates that the executive director authority under this section is more limited.it states,in part,that i f the executive director finds that any of the air,land or waters of the state have been,or are being polluted,the executive director shall make an order requiring such pollution to cease.stat.tit,b emphasis added.the function of subsection b,therefore,is to direct the executive director of odeq to order abatement of pollution where it has already occurred.
the district court reading of subsection b to effectively limit subsection a would mean that the placement of any wastes in a location where they are likely to cause pollution could never be a public nuisance because subsection b requires the pollution to have occurred before the executive director of the odeq can act to abate the nuisance.this reading contradicts the plain language of.stat.tit.see villines szczepanski,it is presumed that the body has expressed its intent in a statute language and that it intended what it so expressed.
furthermore,the district court reading also belies the legislative intent behind.stat.tit.the oklahoma legislature intent that conduct that causes or is likely to cause pollution be declared a public nuisance is longstanding,and predates the enactment of the present subsection b.in fact.stat.tit,a,from which.stat.tit,a was derived,had almost identical language notably.stat.tit,did not contain a parallel to.stat.tit,b.we agree with the amici that to conclude,upon adoption of and its relocation to,that the oklahoma legislature intended to depart from its prior position,and to now require an odeq order before conduct could be declared a public nuisance,would call for a clearer linguistic signal than mere silence.
we reach a similar conclusion when considering the purpose of the entire code.stat.tit,a states,in pertinent part,that 
i t is the purpose of this code to provide additional and cumulative remedies to prevent,abate and control pollution.nothing contained in this code shall be construed to abridge or alter rights of action or remedies under the common law or statutory law,criminal or civil nor shall any provision of this code,or any act done by virtue thereof,be construed as estopping the state,or any municipality or person in the exercise of their rights under the common law to suppress nuisances or to abate pollution.nothing in this code shall in any way impair or affect a person right to recover damages for pollution.
stat.tit,a.to require an order of abatement from the executive director of the odeq as a precondition to asserting a public nuisance claim under.stat.tit,not only undercuts the additional and cumulative remedies the code is intended to provide,but also precludes an action to prevent pollution under this section and would impair or affect a person right to recover damages for pollution,contrary to the express intent of the legislature.see.stat.tit,a.this result would violate the maxim of statutory construction that w hen possible,different provisions must be construed together to effect an harmonious whole.villines,at.
judgment as a matter of law 
bnsf next challenges the district court entry of judgment as a matter of law on its private nuisance and unjust enrichment claims.we review a district court judgment as a matter of law de novo,applying the same legal standards used by the district court.knowlton teltrust phones,cir.
personal liability 
bnsf first argues that grant,the individual,may be held liable to the extent he was responsible for the maintenance of a nuisance that was under his possession or control.this is an accurate statement of oklahoma law.see branch mobil oil,duncan flagler.however,we disagree that there are genuine issues of material fact in the record that grant personally directed,participated in or controlled the commission of a tort.while grant former employee,bill rother,stated that grant personally stopped by the construction site regularly while the property in question was being converted to a pipeyard,one can not reasonably infer from this that grant personally managed the construction,and thereby directed,sanctioned,or actively participated or cooperated in,a positively wrongful act.additionally,while the record contains an invoice signed by grant for a substantial amount of dirt to be used as filler during the conversion of the property to a pipeyard,we conclude that this can not reasonably be viewed as evidence of grant management of the how,when,and where of the construction.
nevertheless,bnsf next argument,that grant may be held personally liable as a successive owner,is more convincing.stat.tit,provides e very successive owner of property who neglects to abate a continuing nuisance upon,or in the use of such property,created by a former owner,is liable therefor in the same manner as the one who first created it.this section provides for liability of successor owners who have or should have knowledge of the existence of the nuisance and of its liability to cause injury.union texas petroleum jackson.despite grant arguments to the contrary,the oklahoma supreme court held long ago that an injured landowner need not request abatement from the tortfeasor responsible for a nuisance prior to bringing a nuisance action in instances where the tortfeasor knew or should have known of the nuisance.see chicago,ry.morton.
we conclude that there is sufficient evidence in this record to submit to a jury the question of whether grant,as an individual,had constructive or actual knowledge that the tlm on his property constituted a nuisance to bnsf.this evidence ranges from grant stipulation that he was aware of the existence of tlm on his property when he took title to it,to evidence that tlm incursions were open and notorious,in that there is sworn testimony that tlm emerging from grant land pushed down a fence between the properties in question and caused a utility pole to list.thus,while there is not sufficient evidence in the present record to establish grant personal liability as a corporate officer,there is sufficient evidence to put before a trier of fact the question of whether grant was on actual or constructive notice that the tlm on his property constituted a nuisance to bnsf.
bnsf next challenges the district court determination that it failed to submit a triable issue on the question of damages.specifically,bnsf disputes the district court holding that damages for a continuing temporary nuisance are limited to the diminution in value of the property in question.however,assuming that diminution in value is indeed the limit on damages recoverable,bnsf next argues that the district court erred in requiring bnsf to carry the burden of proving the amount of that lost value.finally,bnsf contends that the district court erred in concluding bnsf had failed to prove that its damages were incurred within the applicable limitations period.
measure of damages 
first,bnsf asserts that the amount of damages it may recover for nuisance is the total of the reasonable costs it incurred in attempting to minimize the loss with which it was threatened.we disagree.
damage or injury,as typically used in nuisance cases,is the damage or injury resulting from the nuisance.permanent damages,as well as temporary damages,may be recovered for the maintenance of a temporary nuisance.briscoe harper oil.in nuisance cases,damages are determined by whether the injury suffered is permanent or temporary,rather than whether the cause of injury is permanent or temporary.id.accordingly,damages awarded in an action predicated on a nuisance theory may include temporary and permanent injury to land.id.an injury is deemed temporary,and not permanent,if it is reasonably abatable,that is,capable of being corrected by a reasonable expenditure of money within a reasonable period of time.moneypenney dawson.damages reasonably incapable of abatement are permanent.briscoe,at.
as for temporary injury to land,the measure of damages is.schneberger apache,oklahoma case law from statehood to the present ha s interpreted the proper measure of damages to be diminution in value.t he measure of damages is the cost of restoring the land to its former condition,with compensation for loss of use of it,if this altogether is less than the diminution in value with the injuries left standing.houck hold oil,see also tenneco oil allen,holding that nuisance damages include clean up costs in addition to temporary injuries to land.when the cost of repairing the injury is greater than the diminution in the land value,the latter is the true measure of damages.houck,at.underlying this rule is the principle of avoidable consequences,which requires plaintiffs to mitigate their damages.id.
the district court was correct in holding that bnsf can only recover the costs of removing the tlm if its restoration costs do not exceed the diminished value of the land.bnsf,in effect,is requesting that we carve out an exception and hold that where restoration costs have been expended prior to the institution of suit,the measure of damages should be the full cost of restoration.bnsf cites no authority from this circuit or from oklahoma case law which supports its view.instead,it attempts to distinguish existing precedent by arguing that the cases relied upon by the district court,schneberger,at and peevyhouse garland coal mining,hold that estimated repair costs are not recoverable if they are grossly disproportionate to the diminution in value of a plaintiff land,because any contrary ruling would overcompensate the plaintiff.bnsf argues further that both schneberger and peevyhouse involved plaintiffs seeking recovery of estimated costs for work they had not performed,and which the court found would likely never be performed.while bnsf arguments are not entirely without merit,we see no need to depart from the oklahoma law that when the cost of repairing the injury is greater than the diminution in the land value,the latter is the true measure of damages.houck,at schneberger,at whatever the rationale,the essence of peevyhouse has been consistently adhered to in cases giving rise to temporary and permanent injuries to property.
burden of proof 
next,bnsf argues that even if the diminution in market value is the upper limit for temporary damage to property,the district court improperly allocated the burden of proof to bnsf.we agree.
while it is true a plaintiff must prove all elements of a claim,including damages,wilcox oil walters,it is equally true that in applying the diminution in value rule,numerous courts have expressly held that any limit on recoverable damages is a matter that must be pleaded by the defendant,as it grows out of the rule of avoidable consequences.see,mcfarland brier,davis first interstate bank of idaho,idaho.this follows from the recognition that the doctrine of avoidable consequences is an affirmative defense.see mcfarland,at davis,at.oklahoma case law suggests as much.it is under oklahoma law that with regard to similar issues in tort and contract actions,the burden of proving that damages should have been reduced or minimized is on the defendant.see cities serv.gulf oil,sackett rose,the burden of proving circumstances in mitigation of damages is upon the party guilty of the tortious act or breach of contract.we conclude that oklahoma case law
