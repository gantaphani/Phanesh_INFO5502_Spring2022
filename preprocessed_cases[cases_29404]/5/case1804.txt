a jury convicted miguel flores of possession of a firearm by a person prohibited from possessing a firearm,subd.c carrying a concealed firearm,subd.a,carrying a loaded firearm in a public place,subd.a,and resisting a peace officer,subd.a.the trial court sentenced him to three years of probation.
flores appeals,contending that his convictions must be reversed because i the trial court failed to instruct the jury on the defenses of necessity and duress ii the trial court erroneously instructed the jury regarding the criminal intent required for the offense of carrying a loaded firearm and iii the firearm convictions violate his federal constitutional right to bear arms.as discussed below,we find these contentions to be without merit.
flores also argues that the trial court erred in requiring payment of probation costs and attorney fees as a condition of probation.we agree,as does the attorney general,that the trial court probation order must be modified to delete the requirement that flores pay probation costs and attorney fees as a condition of probation.in all other respects,we affirm.

discussion 
flores raises a number of challenges to his convictions.we address each challenge separately below.
flores convictions do not violate his federal constitutional rights 
in a supplemental brief,flores contends that his convictions are invalid in light of the united states supreme court recent decision in district of columbia heller,d heller,which held that the second amendment protects an individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation.heller,at.we disagree.
prior to the decision in heller,it was well settled in our courts that state laws regulating the possession of firearms were not vulnerable to constitutional challenge.see kasler lockyer cal th,d,i t is long since settled in this state that regulation of firearms is a proper police function galvan superior court cal d,the claim that legislation regulating weapons violates the second amendment has been rejected by every court which has ruled on the question in re rameriz cal,rameriz stating that the legislature is entirely free to deal with the subject of firearm regulation.
in heller,the united states supreme court ruled that the district of columbia absolute prohibition of handguns held and used for in the home as well as its prohibition against rendering any lawful firearm in the home operable for the purpose of immediate violated the second amendment to the federal constitution.heller,supra.at.in reaching its conclusions,the court repeatedly stressed the broad sweep of the local prohibitions at issue in the case.for example,the court emphasized that the district of columbia handgun ban amounts to a prohibition of an entire class of arms that is overwhelmingly chosen by american society for th e lawful purpose of.id.at.the prohibition extends,moreover,to the home,where the need for defense of self,family,and property is most acute.ibid.given these circumstances the court concluded,under any of the standards of scrutiny that we have applied to enumerated constitutional rights,banning from the home the most preferred firearm in the nation to keep and use for protection of one home and family violated the second amendment,fn.omitted.
the firearm statutes that flores challenges in the instant case have nowhere near the broad sweep of the statutes at issue in heller.flores was convicted of violating three firearms laws i possession of a firearm by a person prohibited from possessing a firearm,subd.c ii carrying a concealed firearm,subd.a and iii carrying a loaded firearm in a public place,subd.a.flores fails to point to any authority in the state or federal courts interpreting heller as invalidating statutes analogous to these,and our reading of heller convinces us that nothing in that opinion requires such a result.
in heller,the court emphasized that l ike most rights,the right secured by the second amendment is not unlimited.heller,supra.at see also people bland cal th,fn,d,recognizing that even if the second amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms,the united states supreme court has not treated that right as absolute.the court then provided a nonexhaustive list of presumptively lawful regulatory measures under the second amendment,including longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons.heller,at fn.the first of flores convictions for possession of a firearm by a prohibited person falls into this category.section prohibits a ny person who has been convicted of a felony from possessing a firearm.the statute expands this prohibition as well to persons who have committed certain misdemeanor offenses,subds.a c.flores possession of a firearm contravened this statute by virtue of his prior conviction for violating section,subdivision a,which prohibits an assault upon the person of another by any means of force likely to produce great bodily injury,subd.a.
flores emphasizes that the heller opinion carves out an exception to the second amendment protections for felons in possession of a firearm,but says nothing about a ban based on a mere misdemeanor.we find this argument unconvincing.if,as heller emphasizes,the second amendment permits the government to proscribe the possession of a firearm by any felon including offenders,we can see no principled argument that the government can not also add certain misdemeanants,particularly those who have committed an assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury,subd.a.the public interest in a prohibition on firearms possession is at its apex in circumstances,as here,where a statute disarms persons who have proven unable to control violent criminal impulses.see united states chester,no.cr,wl,dist.lexis upholding federal statute criminalizing possession of firearm by misdemeanants found guilty of domestic violence united states bonner,no.cr sba,wl,dist.lexis recognizing that courts continue,after heller,to reject claims by felons and others who have previously committed crimes of violence that they possess an absolute right to possess firearms.consequently,we do not read heller to undermine the constitutionality of flores section conviction.
heller also contains guidance with respect to flores conviction for violating section,which prohibits any person from carrying concealed upon his or her person any pistol,revolver,or other firearm capable of being concealed upon the person,subd.a.
in addition to the list of presumptively lawful regulatory measures noted in our earlier discussion,the heller opinion emphasizes,with apparent approval,that the majority of the courts to consider the question held that prohibitions on carrying concealed weapons were lawful under the second amendment or state analogues.heller,supra.at,fn.see also id.at dis.opn.of breyer,noting that the majority implicitly,and appropriately,broadly approv es a set of laws restricting firearm use,including prohibitions on concealed weapons and forfeiture by criminals of the second amendment right.given this implicit approval of concealed firearm prohibitions,we can not read heller to have altered the courts longstanding understanding that such prohibitions are constitutional.see also robertson baldwin.stating in dicta,the rig
