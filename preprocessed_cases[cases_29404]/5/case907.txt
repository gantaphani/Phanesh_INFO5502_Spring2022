background 
on january,appellants and several others entered into a stock purchase agreement hereinafter the agreement with century.the agreement provided that century would buy of the stock in peacock radio wild computer service,hereinafter peacock radio for to be paid in century stock to be issued on closing.section of the agreement provided that the number of century shares to be issued was to be determined by using the closing bid price for the stock on the first day it was listed on a national,regional or stock exchange.section e of the agreement provided that,subject to appellants discretion,at closing the century stock would be listed on a national,regional or exchange.after the agreement,appellant peacock,who had owned about of the peacock radio stock,became a member of century board of directors and the company for regulatory affairs.he also served as a representative of the other appellants in dealing with century.although at the august closing,the century stock was not listed on an exchange,appellants,who owned collectively about percent of the peacock radio stock,exchanged their stock for the century stock.in addition to not being listed on a public exchange,the century stock was not registered or exempt from registration,as required by arkansas securities law.see ann.
in june,peacock and harvey agreed to waive the provision in section of the agreement providing that the stock would be priced as of the first day of public trading in exchange for receiving additional shares of century stock peacock,who had received about shares in,received an additional shares of century common stock,which also were not registered.on december,the state of arkansas revoked the corporate status of peacock radio and its operations were consolidated into the operations of century.
in february,appellants filed the instant action against century,seeking rescission of the agreement or alternatively damages.in an amended complaint,they asserted that century had violated arkansas securities law by failing to register the stock and had breached the agreement and committed fraud by failing to have the stock listed on a public exchange.century moved for partial summary judgment on the three claims.century did not dispute that the sale of the unregistered stock violated ann.however,it argued that the remedy for the statutory violation was prescribed by ann.a,which provides that the buyer of an unregistered security may recover from the seller the consideration paid for the security,together with interest at six percent per year,costs,and reasonable attorney fees,less the amount of any income received on the security,upon tender of the security,or for damages if the buyer no longer owns the security.because appellants still held the century stock,the company argued that their remedy was limited to rescission and that the consideration paid was their pro rata portion of the purchase price.appellants opposed the motion,arguing that they were entitled either to the return of their peacock radio stock or to the profits century earned on the stock.
the district court granted century motion in part and denied it in part.the district court agreed with century that the remedy for the statutory violation was prescribed by ann.a and that,upon tender of the century stock,appellants would receive their pro rata portion of the purchase price,plus interest,costs,and attorney fees,less any income received.the district court denied the motion as to the breach of contract and fraud claims.
at trial,which began before a jury,appellants counsel spent much time examining witnesses concerning the fact that the century stock was not registered.the district court questioned counsel about the relevancy of the testimony in light of its grant of summary judgment on the statutory rescission claim arising from the lack of registration.counsel told the district court that the statutory violation was not relevant to either the breach of contract or fraud claims.when counsel continued with the line of questioning,the district court again questioned the relevancy of the testimony.counsel again assured the district court that the breach of contract and fraud claims were based on alleged promises to take the century stock public,not on the failure to register the stock.
concerning the alleged promise to go public,peacock and harvey testified that trading on a public exchange was an important inducement to their entering into the stock purchase agreement.although they believed that if the century stock had been traded publicly,it would have increased in value,they admitted its value might have declined.rodney hutt,who was century executive and executed the agreement on the company behalf,testified that the company had every intention of going public,but,despite spending a lot of time,money,and effort,it could not do so.
at the close of the evidence,century moved for judgment as a matter of law.appellants counsel told the district court that there wa s no point to submit the issues of fraud,common law or statutory fraud to the jury and that the jury could be released because all that remained to be decided were equitable remedies.the district court asked counsel,so you moving to dismiss your remaining fraud claims appellants counsel responded,yeah,both of them.after the district court stated it would dismiss the fraud claims with prejudice,counsel stated that what i thought i was asking.the district court then dismissed the jury.
in january,the district court issued an order disposing of the remaining claims.the district court held that century had not breached the agreement by failing to list the stock on a public exchange.as to the fraud claims,the district court noted that,although appellants had voluntarily dismissed the claims with prejudice,they raised a constructive fraud claim in their brief.the district court went on to hold that,even if the constructive fraud claim had not been dismissed,it was without merit.the district court found that any representations century had made about going public could not,under arkansas law,serve as a basis for a fraud claim because they related to future events and were made in good faith.see delta sch.of commerce,wood.
as to the statutory rescission claim,the district court held that,upon tender of the century shares appellants had received,both in and,they would receive to be distributed on a pro rata basis according to their ownership of the stock.the district court calculation of the rescissory damages was based on the total value of the original block of the century stock,less a advance made by century before closing,multiplied by appellants percentage of the century stock plus interest from the closing date of august,until the entry of the order,and less a cash distribution.
appellants filed motions for new trial or reconsideration and for attorney fees and costs.the district court denied the motion for new trial or reconsideration.as to the statutory damages,the district court rejected appellants argument that they were entitled to a separate rescissory measure of damages in return for the tender of stock received in,finding that the transaction was part and parcel of the overall effort to ensure that appellants received the full value of the agreed upon purchase price for their shares of.add.at.as to the fraud and breach of contract claims based on alleged promises to take century public,the district court noted that even if it were inclined to fashion an equitable rescission remedy on the claims,it could not do so
