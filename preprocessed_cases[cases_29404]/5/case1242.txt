the united states forest service appeals from the district court award of attorneys fees under the equal access to justice act eaja,d to plaintiff biodiversity conservation alliance bca.because we hold that plaintiff was not a prevailing party in the underlying litigation,we reverse the district court award of fees and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the eaja provides that a court shall award to a prevailing party fees and other expenses incurred by that party in any civil action.d.bca claims it is entitled to attorneys fees under the eaja as a prevailing party because of victories it obtained in a dispute over defendant united states forest service proposed usage of land in the black hills national forest.
in,the forest service came up with several proposals for the management and future development of the black hills national forest.one of the proposals,called the cement project,included a sale of timber in the cement area of that forest.the forest service sought an environmental assessment of this sale and concluded that there would be no significant environmental impact.as a result,the forest service authorized the sale of several thousand acres of timber in the cement area.
bca,who had registered its opposition to the cement project before the agency,filed suit in.it claimed that the forest service actions with regards to the cement project violated the national environmental policy act nepa and the administrative procedures act apa because the forest service acted arbitrarily and capriciously in failing to evaluate a reasonable range of alternatives,failing to take a hard look at the direct,indirect,and cumulative impacts of the cement project.bca also claimed that the forest service violated the national forest management act nfma and the apa by failing to comply with nfma regulations governing viable populations of sensitive and indicator species.
after filing suit,bca moved for a preliminary injunction in order to halt the imminent timber sale.the district court granted the motion.in so doing,it explained that as a preliminary matter,the plaintiff will suffer irreparable injury due to the possibility of permanent species loss.because the equities tip ped heavily towards the movant,the district court only required that plaintiff raise questions going to the merits so serious,substantial,difficult,and doubtful as to make them a fair ground for litigation and thus for more deliberate investigation.it concluded that plaintiff had raised such doubts,and therefore granted a preliminary injunction in order to maintain the status quo antebellum during the pendency of bca suit.
while discovery was still going forward,however,a forest by a lightning the cement project area.several thousand acres of forest were burned,including around ten percent of the planned cement timber sale.
the forest service subsequently withdrew the cement project.it cited,as reasons for its withdrawal,two recent changes.first,the forest service issued a new set of regulations in january of,which constituted a paradigm shift away from the regulations governing forest planning under which the plan had originally been proposed.the forest service suggested that its use of the black hills national forest would be reevaluated under those new regulations.second,the forest service claimed the fire undermined the viability of the proposed timber sale,and so new plans would need to be drawn up to assess the proper course of action.
based on the forest service representation that the cement project had been withdrawn and would not be resuscitated,the district court dismissed plaintiff cause of action as moot.in so doing,it stated that its determination of mootness was conditioned upon the government representation that the cement project has been permanently withdrawn and will never be revived.any new project must begin anew to comply with the mandates of all applicable statutes,including nfma and nepa.
after the case was dismissed,bca moved for attorneys fees.it argued that it was entitled to attorneys fees under the eaja as a prevailing party because the order dismissing the case as moot was conditioned upon the government representation that the cement project had been permanently withdrawn,and because it had prevailed over the government when it obtained a preliminary injunction.
the district court agreed with bca,and awarded in attorney fees.the forest service appealed.
the district court determined that bca was a prevailing party for two reasons.first,the forest service represented that the project had been permanently withdrawn and would never be revived.the district court conditioned its dismissal of the case as moot based on that representation,and found that plaintiff had thus prevailed because it had secured a binding commitment from the government not only to withdraw the project,but never to revive it.second,the district court claimed bca had obtained affirmative relief in the form of a preliminary injunction against the forest service,which put a stop to the imminent sale of timber on forest service lands.
neither reason is sufficient to support a finding that bca is a prevailing party.we address each in turn.
a.the conditional mootness order 
bca claims that the district court conditional mootness order,which rested on its receiving a binding commitment from the government not to revive the cement project,justifies a finding that it prevailed.
the supreme court has clearly spoken on the standards for determining when a litigant should be granted prevailing party status.buckhannon board care home,west virginia of health and human resources,d.buckhannon involved a challenge to state law brought by assisted living facilities in west virginia.the plaintiff there alleged that state codes,which required that residents of assisted living facilities be capable of in the event of a fire or some other danger,ran afoul of the fair housing amendments act.id.at.while the case was pending,the west virginia legislature enacted two bills that eliminated the requirement,rendering the plaintiff claim moot.id.
the district court denied the plaintiff request for attorney fees,on the grounds that even though plaintiff suit may have been a catalyst for the west virginia legislature actions,the legislative change did not confer prevailing party status upon plaintiff.
the supreme court affirmed,explaining that it had found parties prevailed when they obtained enforceable judgments on the merits or consent decrees.id.at.but a defendant voluntary change in conduct,although perhaps accomplishing what the plaintiff sought to achieve by the lawsuit,lacks the necessary judicial imprimatur on the change.id.at.the court thus held that an award of attorneys fees was improper when the plaintiff had simply fil ed a nonfrivolous but nonetheless potentially meritless lawsuit it will never be determined,and had reached the destination without obtaining any judicial relief.id.at.
bca argues that it is a prevailing party under the standard issued by buckhannon because the forest service withdrew the cement project,and the district judge conditioned his mootness order on the forest service representation that it would not reinstate the project.but while the district judge stated that bca had obtained a binding commitment from the forest service not to reinstate the cement project,the commitment made by the forest service is not sufficient to qualify bca for prevailing party status.
in finding the case moot,the district court explained t his determination of mootness is conditioned on the government representation that the cement project has been permanently withdrawn and will never be revived.any new project must begin anew to comply with the mandates of all applicable statutes.the representation that the government made in withdrawing the project was as follows i am withdrawing the cement project decision notice and i will make a new decision that takes these changed conditions into account after conducting a supplemental environmental assessment i t is clear that whatever management action is selected,it will not be the same as the cement project.
certainly,as plaintiff argue
