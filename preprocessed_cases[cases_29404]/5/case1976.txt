in vasquez state of california th,d vasquez i,we held as a matter of first impression that the state of california the state has a duty under proposition,the prison inmate labor initiative of,to require a private sector manufacturer payment of comparable or prevailing wages to inmate employees.we reversed a judgment entered for the state after the sustaining of a demurrer to cristina vasquez taxpayer waste cause of action.code civ.
in this appeal,the state challenges the propriety of a judgment awarding vasquez in attorney fees,under a private attorney general theory,as the prevailing party at trial.the state contends vasquez did not satisfy the elements of section,in that,she was not a successful party within the meaning of the statute she neither enforced an important right affecting the public interest nor conferred a significant benefit on the general public or a large class of persons there was no necessity of private enforcement and she made no prelitigation settlement demand.the state also contends the trial court improperly awarded her attorney fees for services rendered before she or the state were parties to the litigation and for causes of action in which they were not named,the fees awarded are duplicative of a fee award rendered against and for other parties,and the court employed an improper procedure in reviewing attorney billings.we affirm the judgment with directions.
factual and procedural background 
under proposition codified in,et,which the voters approved in november,the director of corrections the director is required to establish joint venture programs with prisons to allow private businesses to employ inmates to produce goods or services.proposition requires a private business to pay inmates wages comparable to those it pays noninmate employees for similar work,or if the business has no such employees,to pay inmates prevailing wages in the relevant locality.joint venture employers receive incentives such as favorable rents and utility rates at prison facilities,and they are not required to give inmate employees vacation pay or health coverage.
in february the department of corrections the department entered into a joint venture agreement with cmt blues for its manufacture of clothing at the richard donovan correctional facility donovan.this action commenced in august when former donovan inmates shearwood fleming and charles ervin sued cmt blues for unfair business practices and a variety of other causes of action.they alleged,among other things,that cmt blues violated proposition by failing to pay them prevailing wages and overtime compensation.
in october fleming and ervin filed a first amended complaint,and in july they filed a second amended complaint.the former pleading added the union of needletrades,industrial textile employees unite as a plaintiff in causes of action for unfair business practices,and the latter pleading added class allegations for the recovery of wages on behalf of all donovan inmates cmt blues employed.further,the second amended complaint added a new plaintiff,vasquez,the international vice president for unite,in a cause of action against the state for taxpayer waste under section 
in november a third amended complaint was filed.in may a fourth amended complaint was filed,which alleged in vasquez cause of action that inmates hired into joint venture programs were not permitted to receive any compensation for the work they performed unless and until they had completed an unpaid training period which usually lasted between thirty and sixty days.during this training period,the inmate workers,including plaintiffs fleming,ervin and all members of the inmate worker class,were denied any and all compensation for the hours they worked.
the court granted the state demurrer to vasquez taxpayer cause of action in the fourth amended complaint,determining such a claim requires the actual or threatened expenditure of funds,and may not be based on the state failure to collect funds.the court also found the state expenditures to implement proposition did not support a section action because they are not illegal or wasteful.
vasquez appealed the resulting judgment,and during the pendency of the appeal the inmate class action against cmt blues proceeded to a bench trial.in may the court entered a judgment against cmt blues,ordering it to pay the plaintiff inmate class a total of in minimum wages,liquidated damages,waiting time and civil penalties,prevailing wages,and interest due.the court also approved a stipulated order requiring cmt blues to pay attorney fees of and costs of to the inmates.
in january we issued our opinion in vasquez i reversing the judgment against vasquez and concluding she stated a valid cause of action for taxpayer waste.we explained that an action lies under section not only to enjoin wasteful expenditures,but also to enforce the government duty to collect funds due the state.a taxpayer may sue a governmental body in a representative capacity in cases involving its failure to perform a duty specifically enjoined.vasquez i,supra,th at,d.a purpose of proposition is to defray the costs of inmates room and board,and the director is required to select a joint venture employer on the basis of its ability to meet that objective.we concluded that given the state right to percent of inmate wages,it can not sit idly by while cmt blues violates proposition and the express terms of the joint venture agreement.id.at,d.
in june a fifth amended complaint was filed,adding allegations to vasquez taxpayer waste cause of action that other joint venture employers,pub brewery,located at donovan,and western manufacturing,located at calipatria state prison,also required inmates to complete an initial period of unpaid employment and,along with cmt blues,failed to pay prevailing wages.
in january vasquez taxpayer claim proceeded to a bench trial.after the second day of testimony,the parties agreed to a stipulated injunction,which the court entered on february.the injunction is for an initial period of two years,and requires the state to obtain wage plans from all joint venture employers similar to wage plans of the employer s outside factories if any or be based on comparable wages for similar work in the locality of the prison,taking into account factors such as seniority,performance,the technical nature of the work being performed and the provisions of proposition to take reasonable steps to identify comparable wages required under proposition to inform joint venture employers of their obligation to comply with applicable requirements of the labor code and the industrial welfare commission and to include the obligation in state contracts to inform inmates of their rights under joint venture programs to prevailing wages and to file grievances and to provide plaintiffs counsel with payroll data for employees of each joint venture employer beginning june,and thereafter every days for the duration of the injunction.
further,the injunction requires the state to notify the court and plaintiffs counsel if a joint venture employer fails to pay the full payroll due and owing,and describe the steps it is taking to rectify the problem.the injunction also requires each joint venture employer to post a security bond or equivalent in the amount of two months wages for the workforce contemplated after months of operation.
vasquez then moved for attorney fees under a private attorney general theory.the court took the matter under submission after a hearing on july,and on august it issued an ex parte order awarding her a lodestar amount of and applying a multiplier of,for a total fee award of.the court held a second hearing,and on october it entered a judgment on the stipulated injunction and attorney fees,confirming its previous award of in fees and also awarding in costs.
discussion 
istandard of review 
an important exception to the american rule that litigants are to bear their own attorney fees is found in section graham daimlerchrysler cal th,d,graham,which codifies the private attorney general doctrine the california supreme court adopted in serrano priest cal d.hull rossi th,d.section provides in part upon motion,a court may award attorneys fees to a successful party against one or more opposing parties in any action which has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest if a a significant benefit,whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary,has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons,b the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement are such as to make the award appropriate,and c such fees should not in the interest of justice be paid out of the recovery,if any.
t he private attorney general doctrine rests upon the recognition that privately initiated lawsuits are often essential to the effectuation of the fundamental public policies embodied in constitutional or statutory provisions,and that,without some mechanism authorizing the award of attorney fees,private actions to enforce such important public policies will as a practical matter frequently be infeasible.thus,the fundamental objective of the doctrine is to encourage suits enforcing important public policies by providing substantial attorney fees to successful litigants in such cases.graham,supra,cal th at,d.
whether the applicant for attorney fees has proved section elements is a matter primarily vested in the trial court.ciani san diego trust savings bank th,d.we review the entire record,attentive to the trial court stated reasons in denying or granting the fees and to whether it applied the proper standards of law in reaching its decision.citation.we will reverse the trial court decision only if there has been a prejudicial abuse of discretion,when there has been a manifest miscarriage of justice or where no reasonable basis for the action is shown.hull rossi,supra,th at,d.
vasquez showing under section asuccessful party 
the state contends vasquez is not entitled to attorney fees because she did not satisfy the elements of section.it first asserts she was not the successful party within the meaning of section because the comparable wages required under proposition are neither objectively identifiable nor readily ascertainable.
the state makes factual assertions that are not supported by citations to the appellate record.when a party provides a brief without citation of record references we may treat the point as waived or meritless and pass on it without further consideration.troensegaard silvercrest industries,d.in any event,vasquez was the successful party as she obtained a stipulated injunction requiring the state to comply with its duties under proposition to ensure the payment of comparable or prevailing wages to inmates.the state is apparently attacking the terms of the injunction,but the state stipulated to it and it is not at issue on appeal.
public interest and substantial benefit 
the state also contends vasquez taxpayer action did not result in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest,as she is an officer of unite and t here can be little doubt that her true intent was to protect union jobs and not the public at large.the state asserts her claim is substantially composed of fees expended on behalf of a relatively small number of inmates who sued a single joint venture business employer to recover exclusively personal monetary interests.
the question whether there was an important public interest at stake merely calls for an examination of the subject matter of the,whether the right involved was of sufficient societal importance.beasley wells fargo bank d,d.the trial court must realistically assess the litigation and determine,from a practical perspective,whether the action served to vindicate an important right so as to justify an attorney fee award under a private attorney general theory.woodland hills residents,city council cal d.of course,important rights are not necessarily confined to any one subject or field.id.at.
the purposes of proposition are to require inmates to work as hard as the taxpayers who provide for their upkeep,provide funds from which inmates can reimburse the state for a portion of their costs of incarceration,satisfy restitution fines and support their families,and assist in inmates rehabilitation and teach skills they may use after their release from prison.vasquez i,supra,th at,d,citing historical and statutory notes,west ann.ed.foll.an inmate wages are subject to deductions,not exceeding a total of percent of gross wages,for taxes,reasonable charges for room and board,restitution fines and contributions to victims crime funds and family support.the director has determined that an inmate net wages are subject to a percent deduction for room and board,tit,subd.h.
the court properly exercised its discretion by finding vasquez litigation resulted in the vindication of important public interests.our holding in vasquez i establishes,as a matter of first impression,a taxpayer waste cause of action against the state if it fails to obtain joint venture employers compliance with proposition wage provisions.vasquez i,supra,th at,d.
on remand,vasquez obtained a stipulated injunction that places the state joint venture program under the court supervision for an initial period to ensure any joint venture employers compliance with proposition.the payment of comparable or prevailing wages to inmates in accordance with proposition will,in turn,protect the interests of voters who approved the initiative benefit taxpayers by further defraying the costs of inmate incarceration allow employed inmates to pay more in restitution fines,victim compensation and family support and protect law abiding workers from having their wages undermined by joint venture employers payment of low wages to inmates.
noreen blonien,the director of the state joint venture program between and december,testified that in addition to the percent of inmate wages the state obtained to defray the costs of incarceration,another percent went to families,which impacted welfare costs.she also explained that ordinarily inmates do not pay ordered restitution,but those in the joint venture program pay that right away.further,when inmates are not subject to support or restitution orders,a portion of their wages go to organizations,which made a tremendous impact in the communities of imperial county,blythe,wherever there was a joint venture.blonien also explained that prisons benefit from the joint venture program because inmates remain discipline free to qualify for the program,and the program gives them skills that allow them to transfer into the community,get jobs,keep jobs,and not come back to prison.higher wages would stimulate greater interest in the program.vasquez action vindicated a variety of important societal interests 
we also reject the state assertion vasquez action did not confer a significant benefit on the general public or a large class of persons.the significant benefit criterion calls for an examination whether the litigation has had a beneficial impact on the public as a whole or on a group of private parties which is sufficiently large to justify a fee award.this criterion thereby implements the general requirement that the benefit provided by the litigation inures primarily to the public.beasley wells fargo bank,supra,d at,d.certainly,the state voters and taxpayers constitute a large class of persons,and a significant benefit was conferred on them as discussed above.the state is incorrect in asserting that the only potential benefit that can be discerned was to the inmates.
necessity of private enforcement 
the state also contends the attorney fees award was improper because private enforcement was not a necessity within the meaning of section,subdivision b.this factor looks to the adequacy of public enforcement and seeks economic equalization of representation in cases where private enforcement is necessary.committee to defend reproductive rights v.a free pregnancy center d.an important question in determining whether the services of the private party were necessary is,did the private party advance significant factual or legal theories adopted by the court,thereby providing a material non de minimis contribution to its judgment,which were nonduplicative of those advanced by the governmental entity id.at.
the state contends vasquez taxpayer cause of action was unnecessary because the core of this case was to vindicate and enforce the pecuniary interests of the inmate class of employees at cmt blues,and under the judgment against cmt blues the right was vindicated.the state asserts the taxpayer claim as a peripheral add on.
the state position lacks merit.as discussed,the taxpayer claim vindicated many important rights in addition to inmates individual rights to receive comparable or prevailing wages from joint venture employers under proposition.further,when the plaintiff must act on his or her own behalf because the appropriate governmental agency has failed or refuses to act to protect his or her rights,private as contrasted with public enforcement is necessary.daniels mckinney d.enforcement of prisoners rights to reasonable weekly exercise period required private action since the agency charged with their custody was the party against whom enforcement must be sought woodland hills residents,city council,supra,cal d at,inasmuch as the present action proceeded against the only governmental agencies that bear responsibility for the subdivision approval process,the necessity of private,as compared to public,enforcement becomes clear.
vasquez taxpayer action was against the public entity responsible for ensuring joint venture employers compliance with proposition,and the state does not contend it met its duty to ensure such compliance.that inmates may have incentive to sue private employers for wages does not mean an action against the state to obtain compliance with its obligations under proposition lacked necessity.vasquez suit addressed the issue of taxpayer waste on a basis,a more effective resolution than piecemeal lawsuits inmates may bring against noncompliant joint venture employers.
prelitigation settlement efforts 
the state next contends vasquez is not entitled to attorney fees under section because she did not make a reasonable attempt to settle her claim before resorting to litigation.the state relies on graham,supra,cal th at page,d,which involves the catalyst theory of recovery under section.under the catalyst theory,attorney fees may be awarded even when litigation does not result in a judicial resolution if the defendant changes its behavior substantially because of,and in the manner sought by,the litigation.graham,supra,at,d.the catalyst theory is an application of the principle that courts look to the practical impact of the public interest litigation to determine whether the party was successful,and therefore potentially eligible for attorney fees.id.at,d.
in graham,the defendant criticized the catalyst rule because it could encourage nuisance suits by unscrupulous attorneys hoping to obtain fees without having the merits of their suit adjudicated.graham,supra,cal th at,d.the defendant cited the following from the concurring opinion of justice scalia,joined by justice thomas,in buckhannon board care home,west virginia of health and human resources,d buckhannon if the catalyst theory sometimes rewards the plaintiff with a phony claim there is no way of knowing,its absence sometimes denies fees to the plaintiff with a solid case whose adversary slinks away on the eve of judgment.but it seems to me the evil of the former far outweighs the evil of the latter.there is all the difference in the world between a rule that denies the extraordinary boon of attorney fees to some plaintiffs who are no less deserving of them than others who receive them,and a rule that causes the law to be the very instrument of the payment of attorney fees to the extortionist.graham,supra,cal th at,d,citing buckhannon,supra,at.conc.opn.of scalia.
in graham,the california supreme court held the catalyst theory should not be abolished in california,but clarified it to mean a plaintiff must not only be a catalyst to defendant changed behavior,but the lawsuit must have some merit,and the plaintiff must have engaged in a reasonable attempt to settle its dispute with the defendant prior to litigation.graham,supra,cal th at,d.the attorney general,appearing as amicus curiae,sought the element of a reasonable settlement attempt in a catalyst theory case,and the court found it fully consistent with the basic objectives behind section and with one of its explicit necessity of private enforcement of the public interest.awarding attorney fees for litigation when those rights could have been vindicated by reasonable efforts short of litigation does not advance that objective and encourages lawsuits that are more opportunistic than authentically for the public good.lengthy prelitigation negotiations are not required,nor is it necessary that the settlement demand be made by counsel,but a plaintiff must at least notify the defendant of its grievances and proposed remedies and give the defendant the opportunity to meet its demands within a reasonable time.graham,supra,at,d,see also city of los angeles cal th,d.
this case,however,does not involve a catalyst theory or uncertainty as to the merits of vasquez taxpayer action.rather,during trial she obtained a stipulated injunction that was reduced to a judgment.although the court reasoning in imposing the element of a reasonable settlement effort in graham also appears applicable in the context of noncatalyst theory cases,a decision is authority only for the point actually passed on by the court and directly involved in the case.general expressions in opinions that go beyond the facts of the case will not necessarily control the outcome in a subsequent suit involving different facts.gomes county of mendocino th,d chevron,workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d.the court stated,in addition to some scrutiny of the merits,we conclude that another limitation on the catalyst rule reasonable settlement effort should be adopted by this court.graham,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.
the state develops no argument that the holding of graham should be extended to section cases not based on a catalyst theory.indeed,the state does not mention the catalyst theory in its opening brief,and in its reply brief it ignores vasquez assertion in her respondent brief that graham is inapplicable because it concerns the catalyst theory.where a point is merely asserted by counsel without any argument of or authority for its proposition,it is deemed to be without foundation and requires no discussion.people ham d,disapproved on another ground in people compton cal d,fn,people sierra th,fn,d.the appellate court is entitled to the assistance of counsel,and it is not required to develop a party argument.witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal.
moreover,the state vigorously opposed an attorney fees award to vasquez on numerous grounds,but it did not raise a prelitigation settlement demand issue ordinarily the failure to preserve a point below constitutes a waiver of the point.citation.this rule is rooted in the fundamental nature of our adversarial system in the hurry of the trial many things may be,and are,overlooked which could readily have been rectified had attention been called to them.the law casts upon the party the duty of looking after his or her legal rights and of calling the judge attention to any infringement of them.the same policy underlies the principles of theory of the trial.a party is not permitted to change his or her position and adopt a new and different theory on appeal.to permit him or her to do so would not only be unfair to the trial court,but manifestly unjust to the opposing party.citation.the principles of theory of the trial apply to motions sommer gabor th,d.although we have discretion to consider a belatedly raised question of pure law ibid,we decline to do so here given the lack of any cogent argument by the state that graham should be extended.under all the circumstances,we deem the matter waived or forfeited.royster montanez d.
the court properly exercised its discretion in finding vasquez satisfied the requirements of section.
issues pertaining to the amount of the fee awardafees incurred before vasquez taxpayer cause of action was filed 
the state contends the court improperly awarded vasquez attorney fees the inmate plaintiffs incurred before she and the state became parties to the litigation.the state seeks the deduction of in lodestar fees it asserts were billed before the second amended complaint was considered and prepared.it appears that the first billing entry pertaining to the second amended complaint is dated april,the pleading was filed on july.
in support of her motion for attorney fees,vasquez submitted separate billings from her cocounsel,the law offices of robert berke exhibit a,consisting of pages,and bahan herold exhibit b,consisting of pages.at the july,hearing on the matter,berke explained that no billings were submitted for fees incurred on a cause of action by the inmates for a violation of their civil rights,which was unrelated to the payment of wages and was dismissed.he further explained there were depositions in which both the civil rights and the prevailing wages claims were discussed,and in those instances the time entries were cut either by percent or by a third or by two thirds depending on how much of the deposition was related to those causes of action.berke argued that fees incurred in the action against cmt blues pertaining to wages were sufficiently related to the vasquez taxpayer action to justify an award to her.
the court essentially agreed with berke analysis.because of the complexity of the matter,given different plaintiffs and defendants,the court decided to review the billings on a basis in counsels presence,and asked the parties to stipulate to undergoing that process off the record.the parties agreed,with the court granting the state request to put matters on the record for purposes of the record at the end of the hearing.
the reporter transcript resumed after the court review of the first pages of exhibit a,which took the entire day.the court noted vasquez attorneys explained the nature of their work with input from the state.the court also noted w e gone through all of the requests under exhibit a up through the time that the trial against cmt blues is over and the state is now back in the case after our remittitur in vasquez i.and so from here on out almost all the time should relate to work directly on the case against the state,and the court will review that.the court also intended to review exhibit b on its own,explaining we already eliminated duplication of attorneys from each of the two law firms at the same deposition,but there may be other duplication and so the state is given leave to point out,in the materials they lodged with the court or otherwise,what areas of duplication they think are in appropriate so the court can address that.the court also explained its handwritten notations on exhibits a and b would be included in the record.
it is established that in awarding fees the court has discretion to determine that time reasonably expended on an action includes time spent on other separate but closely related court proceedings.wallace consumers cooperative of berkeley,d,citing bartholomew watson cir,bartholomew.in bartholomew,the federal court affirmed an award to inmate plaintiffs in a civil rights action under united states code section for attorney fees incurred in a state court proceeding.the court concluded the state issues were substantially the same as those raised in the federal claim the initial determination of potentially conclusive state law issues was an integral part of the united states code section claim and as such was a necessary preliminary to the enforcement of a provision of that statute.bartholomew,supra,at.
in webb dyer county bd.of ed,d webb,the court indicated that attorney fees incurred in an optional administrative proceeding before commencement of an action for civil rights violations under united states code section would have been compensable in the federal action had the work been both useful and of a type ordinarily necessary to advance the civil rights litigation to the stage it reached before settlement.the court,however,found that on the record there the lower court did not abuse its discretion by disallowing fees incurred in the administrative proceeding.ibid.in pennsylvania delaware valley citizens council for clean air,d pennsylvania,relying on webb,the court affirmed an award under the clean air act et of fees incurred in regulatory proceedings.the court explained that participation in these administrative proceedings was crucial to the vindication of delaware valley rights under the consent decree and compensation for these activities was entirely proper and well within the zone of discretion afforded the district court.pennsylvania,supra,at.
we conclude it was within the court discretion to award vasquez fees incurred before she and the state became parties to the action,as services rendered on the cmt blues wage claim were useful and of the type necessary to advance vasquez taxpayer claim.the cmt blues claim was based on its failure to pay comparable or prevailing wages to inmate employees in violation of proposition.the taxpayer cause of action was based on the state failure to ensure that joint venture employees comply with the wage provisions of proposition.the taxpayer claim depended on proof of cmt blues violations of the initiative,and thus discovery and other services rendered to develop the inmates claim directly benefited vasquez and were a necessary element of her proof.
the state focuses on the court use of the term discreet sic in referring to the taxpayer cause of action.the court,however,used that term at the very beginning of the july,hearing,which was approximately six months after conclusion of the vasquez trial.later in the hearing,the court determined the inmates wage claims and vasquez taxpayer claim were sufficiently related to award her a portion of the fees incurred in the inmates action,given adequate explanations from her counsel.
the state attempts to distinguish pennsylvania,supra.bartholomew,supra,and wallace,supra,d,on the ground they each involved attorney fees to a single plaintiff,when this case involves a plaintiff recovering fees incurred for services rendered to other plaintiffs.although the state distinction is correct,it offers no authority for the notion the court lacks discretion to make the type of award the court made here,when litigation on behalf of one party is useful and necessary to another party action,and all plaintiffs were represented by the same counsel.obviously,the outcome in the inmates case against cmt blues litigation was likely to have an important effect on the outcome of vasquez taxpayer action.armstrong davis cir.proof that cmt blues did not pay compensable or prevailing wages was required in both the inmates and vasquez actions,and the inmates development of that proof relieved vasquez of that burden.had the inmates not brought an action,vasquez would have had to develop the evidence herself.
specific billing entries 
additionally,the state challenges the award of certain fees incurred in representation of the inmates on grounds,for instance,that they concerned their civil rights claims rather than wage claims.many of the challenged entries,however,appear on the first pages of exhibit a,which the court reviewed line by line with counsels input at the july,hearing,a process the court characterized as grueling.the court employed a thorough process,and a mere review of the written description of a billing entry does not permit a finding of impropriety.
the court reviewed the remainder of exhibit a and the entire exhibit b without counsel present.it explained at the july hearing,however,that after reviewing the first pages of exhibit a with counsel assistance,the court has set parameters as to how it thinks various matters should be handled with various types of research,because what we have is an overlay of actions against the state and then actions for private relief,civil rights relief,and various other causes of action.and it seemed pretty clear that some of the work on the one cause of action would have relation to the claim against the state and other times that work did not,and then we had a separate trial that was interposed after the state had gotten out of a demurrer,and now the state back
