introduction 
we now partially reverse the order of the trial court denying any fees at all under the private attorney general doctrine code civ,to larry agran,the prevailing party in hammond agran th,d hammond i.in doing so we come to the following conclusions 
the trial court was correct in not awarding any fees based on agran trial work in hammond i.as one seeking elective office,agran had a specific,concrete and significant interest in the trial litigation,which involved a challenge to his candidate statement for a voter pamphlet.
the trial court was correct to the extent that it did not award fees for agran appellate work in hammond i for work attributable a to the defense of that portion of his candidate statement which was claimed to be factually misleading and b to his attempt to obtain fees under section just in case he won.again,as a political candidate,he had specific,concrete and significant interest in defending the veracity of his candidate statement his personal credibility was at stake.
however,the trial court erred to the extent that it precluded fees for that portion of agran appellate work in hammond i attributable to the important issue of the scope of elections code section,and specifically whether the word qualifications as used by that statute could include statements of a candidate views or positions.in litigating the issue of the scope of section,agran transcended his personal interest and his efforts resulted in the enforcement of an important public right.
ii.background 
agran was running for a seat on the irvine city council.he submitted a candidate statement for the voters pamphlet indicating that he was opposed to a commercial airport at the nearby el toro marine base,and that during previous terms on the council,including six years as mayor,he had led the council in drafting irvine general plan.barry hammond,a rival of agran in irvine politics,challenged that statement,as provided for by elections code section.the statute allows any voter,within a specified time frame,to seek writ of mandate for amendment or deletion of material in a candidate statement upon clear and convincing evidence that it is false,misleading,or inconsistent with the pertinent requirements of the elections code.
hammond challenge was.first,he maintained that agran claim to have led the irvine city council in developing the city general plan was factually false or misleading.second,he argued that the articulation of agran opposition to the airport was inconsistent with the pertinent requirements of the elections code,specifically elections code section,which authorizes candidate statements to include,a brief description,of no more than words,of the candidate education and qualifications expressed by the candidate himself or herself.hammond contended that agran views on the airport were not within the scope of the word qualifications as set forth in section,and therefore agran statement was inconsistent with requirements of the elections code under section.
hammond prevailed in the trial court.the court deleted the middle paragraphs of the statement the ones plainly expressing opposition to the airport because the trial judge did not believe that campaign statements or platforms were within the proper ambit of the word qualifications.the trial judge also had agran modify his statement about leading the city council in developing the city general plan.
agran appealed from the order to this court.meanwhile,he won a seat on the city council anyway.
the appeal resulted in a published decision,hammond i,supra,th,d,construing section.the court specifically held that the word qualifications did include a candidate views on public issues.indeed,almost all of the opinion was devoted to that issue.only one paragraph was devoted to the question of the accuracy of the statement concerning agran leadership of the city council in developing the city general plan.see hammond i,supra,th at,d.
agran clearly wanted attorney fees for his efforts on appeal if he won.his opening brief totalled pages.the first half addressed the merits.the second half was devoted entirely to a request for attorney fees under the private attorney general doctrine code civ.only the final four pages of agran page reply brief were devoted to his attorney fee request.
as regards the attorney fee issue,this court opted to have the trial court determine whether,and if so how much,attorney fees should be awarded.see laurel heights improvement regents of university of california cal d,it is proper for a reviewing court to defer to the trial court in making the determination of whether to award fees in the first instance.we noted that the issue could be problematic given that no previous decision had ever considered the question of attorney fees under the private attorney general doctrine in the context of a challenge to a candidate voter pamphlet statement.hammond,supra,th at,d.
agran filed a disqualification declaration against the original trial judge see code civ,and the case was transferred to judge william mcdonald.agran requested attorney fees and costs aggregately totaling,broken down as follows for trial work in hammond i,for appellate work in hammond i,and for trial work on remand.
judge mcdonald denied agran fee request in its entirety.it is clear from the reporter transcript of the hearing that he concluded that one of the statutory elements necessary for any award of fees under section was missing,namely that the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement,or of enforcement by one public entity against another public entity,are such as to make the award appropriate.see woodland hills residents,city council cal d,breaking down statutory criteria into three constituent elements,of which the necessity and financial burden language is the third element.judge mcdonald reasoned that agran,as a candidate for city council in the election,had a personal stake that was sufficient enough motivation to pursue the litigation without an award of attorney fees.this appeal followed.
iii.discussion 
a.the background of the necessity and financial burden problem in section jurisprudence 
as our high court explained in woodland hills,eligibility for a fee award under the private attorney general doctrine as codified in section requires three elements.see woodland hills,supra,cal d at.
we have already mentioned the necessity and financial burden element,which is language lifted directly from the first paragraph of the statute.the other two are that the plaintiffs action has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest and a significant benefit,whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary,has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons.
there can be no doubt that agran prior appeal,resulting in hammond i,supra,th,d,satisfied the latter two elements.the right of a candidate to express his or her views in a voter pamphlet obviously affects the public interest in providing the voters with information to aid them in making their choices at the ballot box.see griset fair political practices com.cal th,d.moreover,the dissemination of a candidate views confers a benefit on the general voting public,many of whom often crave,particularly in local elections,information about what the candidate thinks and what he or she is likely to do in office,which is far more likely to be revealed by the candidate positions on issues than his or her work experience 
it is the third element which was the sticking point.much of the case law bearing on the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement element has emerged from the land use context,where courts have been forced to distinguish a litigant obvious personal financial interest based on property ownership from a broader or more transcendent public purpose,woodland hills,supra,cal d,local landowners used environmental statutes to litigate against proposed development of nearby property pacific legal foundation california coastal com.cal d,coastal property owners challenged easement dedication requirements beach colony ii california coastal com.d.landowners adjacent to lagoon challenged land use regulations regarding effects of encroaching lagoon waters williams san francisco bd.of permit appeals th,d landowner challenged development of neighboring lot christward ministry county of san diego th,d neighbor of public landfill challenged vertical and horizontal expansion of the landfill that would affect their ocean view terminal plaza city and county of san francisco d.owner of residential hotel used environmental statutes to attack local ordinance families unafraid to uphold rural el dorado county board of supervisors th,d local residents brought action against proposed large development project in rural area.
even beyond the land use area,section puts courts to the often difficult task of divining a party general economic incentive to litigate,as,for example,when the party seeks damages or other monetary relief,satrap pacific gas electric th,d no fees in wrongful termination,whistleblower context planned parenthood city of santa maria th,d no fees because litigation sought wrongfully conditioned grant funds luck southern pacific transportation d.no fees in case based on wrongful termination arising out of refusal to be tested for drugs.
paradoxically,the less direct or concrete a personal interest someone has,the more likely he or she will satisfy the element and be eligible for fees under the statute.thus,in practice,the necessity and financial burden element of section tends to be analyzed like golf is scored the lower the better.
in the non case before us,the degree to which a nonfinancial or nonpecuniary interest might otherwise disqualify a litigant seeking attorney fees under section has commanded considerable attention from both parties we are about to see why agran asserts that only a financial interest could work to disqualify him from seeking fees,based essentially on an observation in a footnote in press lucky stores,cal d,and justice sims concurring and dissenting opinion in families unafraid,supra,th,d.
a brief history of the controversy as it has developed in the cases so far goes like this first there was press,which was a case where a group of activists sought to qualify an oil profits initiative measure,proposition,for the ballot.the proponents of the initiative were trying to gather signatures in the area in front of a supermarket.the supermarket did like it and threatened them with arrest.they sought an injunction,won,and went on to obtain signatures at the store.they then sought fees under section.the trial court granted fees,but in an extremely low amount,and the activists appealed.in returning the case for a higher fee award,the supreme court observed,in a footnote pegged to a sentence concerning the necessity and financial burden prong,that section focuses not on plaintiffs abstract personal stake,but on the financial incentives and burdens related to bringing suit.press,supra,cal d at,fn,emphasis added.
next came williams san francisco bd.of permit appeals,supra,th,d,which arose out of a landowner attempt to prevent the victorian structure next door from being replaced with a apartment building.in denying fees,the court said that the kind of personal interest which might give someone an adequate incentive to litigate was not limited to pecuniary or economic interests.id.at,d.purely aesthetic considerations could also give a litigant a powerful enough individual stake to obviate the need for a fee award.id.at,d.in the process,the williams court took the position that the language in press was essentially dicta,not in any way central to the holding of the case.id.at,d.
most recently,the issue was more sharply joined in families unafraid,supra,th,d,where the panel divided on it.that case arose out of the efforts of a city,a conservancy group,and a group of people who lived in the general rural area,all of whom opposed a large upscale residential subdivision project.they sought fees for having obtained an appellate opinion holding that the project was inconsistent with the county general plan and contravened several environmental laws.when the fee issue came before the court in a second appeal,the majority used the opportunity to elaborate on the problem of whether aesthetic,as distinct from pecuniary interests,might serve to defeat a fee award request under section.it turned out that one of the attorneys for the claimants had declared that none of the claimants had any financial or economic interest in the outcome,and in fact opined that his own house would actually increase in value if the upscale development were built.id.at,d.
the families unafraid majority said two things in that regard a they agreed with williams that interests beyond strictly financial ones could defeat a fee award,but b not just any old nonfinancial interest could defeat a fee award the interest had to be specific,concrete and significant to defeat a fee award.see families unafraid,supra,th at,d.for the families unafraid majority an aesthetic or environmental interest will not be considered sufficient to block an award of attorney fees unless the interest is specific,concrete and significant,as shown by objective evidence.see id.at,d,emphasis added.the majority reversed the trial court decision not to award fees and sent the case for further consideration,including whether the cost of the litigation was out of proportion to plaintiffs nonfinancial interests in the litigation.id.at,d.
justice sims,however,disagreed with the majority conclusion that the aesthetic interest of plaintiffs may serve to defeat an award of fees under code of civil procedure section.families unafraid,supra,th at,d conc.dis.opn.of sims.he argued that the necessity and financial burden clause should be strictly confined to financial or pecuniary interests.id.at,d.
nonfinancial personal interests can defeat an award of fees under section 
the text permits nonpecuniary considerations 
sometimes,when all else fails,one must actually read the statute see greenwood united states.the operative language from section sets up as a requisite for a fee award in any action which has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest that the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement are such as to make the award appropriate.
nothing in the text confines the consideration of the necessity and financial burden clause to just financial interests.true,the words financial burden certainly imply that a court should look at what the claimant hoped to gain financially from the litigation in comparison to what it cost.but it does follow that a court must stop there.the addition of the word necessity suggests,lest it be redundant,that factors beyond just financial burden also may be looked at.
the case law permits nonpecuniary considerations 
woodland hills,decided in,was our high court first encounter with section,enacted in,and the court had every reason to focus on the elements of the statute for the benefit of lower courts in future litigation thus it explicated the necessity and financial burden clause to mean that the cost of the claimant legal victory transcends his personal interest.woodland hills,supra,cal d at,quoting county of inyo city of los angeles d,our emphasis.
the words personal interest,without qualification,however,pose a semantic problem.in a vacuum they cut a wide swath,perhaps too wide.it was that problem which our high court addressed in press.
there,the plaintiffs were ideologically motivated see press,supra,cal d at,fn.as such,it could hardly be contended that they did not have a personal interest in the litigation in the broad sense that they were emotionally and intellectually connected to the litigation in ways that the general public was not.but it would have been ridiculous to disqualify them from a fee award because of their interest.if anyone should have gotten fees under section,they should were,after all,litigating over such fundamental issues as the right to petition government and speak freely.see id.at,fn.
so it was in that context that the press court penned footnote,which juxtaposed plaintiffs abstract personal stake with the financial incentives and burdens related to bringing suit.our emphasis.that contrast makes perfect sense,because,surely,abstract or ideological personal interests were never intended by the legislature to defeat fee claims under section.as the court went on to recognize in the same footnote,you got to have some sort of personal interest just to establish standing.press,supra,cal d at,fn,the absence of some concrete personal interest would mean a lack of standing.
the lesson of the press decision is that personal interest in the abstract is too broad a test to simplistically plug in to the necessity and financial burden clause.but the press court did say that nonpecuniary considerations were irrelevant.the operative word in the press footnote is not financial,but focus.the press court used the word twice in the sentence to which it appended its footnote this requirement focuses on the financial burdens and incentives involved in bringing the lawsuit and in the footnote itself the statute focuses on the financial incentives.
just because you have a photograph that is focused on the centerpoint of a picture does mean you arbitrarily refuse to look at the rest of the picture.there may be things off to the sides that are interesting as well.
it stands to reason that in considering a claim for fees under section a court will initially focus on the financial calculus.the first thing a court will want to know is what sort of financial stake the litigant had in the outcome.see families unafraid,supra,th at,d the traditional focus of personal interest,then,is on financial interest.but that hardly precludes other considerations.it is reading too much into the press footnote to say that it straightjackets consideration of section claims to just pecuniary considerations.
the central concept behind the statute permits consideration of nonpecuniary factors 
as almost all courts have recognized in this area,the underlying idea behind the necessity and financial burden clause is disproportionality of the claimant stake in the litigation to the public result.see generally woodland hills,supra,cal d at,when the necessity for pursuing the lawsuit placed a burden on the plaintiff out of proportion to his individual stake in the matter planned parenthood city of santa maria,supra,th at,d no evidence was presented that the litigation imposed a financial burden disproportionate to its individual stake williams,supra,th at,d quoting woodland hills above families unafraid,supra,th at,d we remand for the trial court to consider whether the cost of the future i appeal is out of proportion to plaintiffs nonfinancial interests in the appeal satrap pacific gas electric,supra,th at,d trial court has discretion to deny fees on the ground that the plaintiff personal stake in the outcome was not disproportionate to the burden of private enforcement.
the word transcend also appears throughout the cases.the idea is that the litigation for which fees are claimed must transcend one interests,whether pecuniary or not,woodland hills,supra,cal d at,fees are appropriate when the cost of claimant legal victory transcends his personal interest planned parenthood city of santa maria,supra,th at,d no evidence was presented that the litigation transcended planned parenthood financial interests.
the idea of transcendent disproportionality gives us an important insight into the purpose of the statute.the claimant objective in the litigation must go beyond transcend those things that concretely,specifically and significantly affect the litigant to borrow from the families unafraid court words in this regard,see th at page,d,to affect the broader world or general public as the statute puts it.
in press,the interests of the plaintiffs easily transcended any tangible or sensory benefits they might have received from the litigation.some people idealists,citizens,ideologues,busybodies,activists,call them what you will,it makes no difference in this context will litigate for their principles no matter what.hence the plaintiffs in press carried a genuinely disproportionate burden in terms of their material,interest.they were entitled to fees.
by contrast,the claimant in williams was concerned with the tangible,quite physical impact on him personally.it can make a big difference to your lifestyle whether you come home at night and find a quaint victorian structure next door,or a large apartment building,even if your balance sheet remains the same.there was no significant element of transcendence in the claimant efforts.forcing the local land use body to consider its own guidelines see williams,supra,th at,d was merely a means to preserving the tranquility of his neighborhood by delaying the project.the plaintiff was not some guideline geek maniacally out to make sure that all local entities of government follow their rules just for the sake of following their simply wanted to control his own immediate environment.he got no fees at all.
in the middle is families unafraid.nobody property values were threatened by the upscale project slated for grazing land pretty much out in the middle of nowhere see families unafraid,supra,th at,d.but it could not be that the plaintiffs lifestyles were wholly immune to the project,either.the degree to which the character of a community may be changed is the subject of a whole different body of law in the land use area,but suffice to say that the character of the rural area in families unafraid was threatened with change.the claimants may have gotten fees.the court remanded the matter to the trial court to see if there really was a disproportion between the costs of the earlier litigation and the plaintiffs nonfinancial interests there.see id.at,d.
c.the case before us 
no fees for trial work in hammond i 
we return to the facts behind agran fee application in the appeal before us.clearly,there was no abuse of discretion on the trial court in denying fees for the trial court work leading up to the appeal in hammond,supra,th,d.
the trial work done by agran lawyers was directly and intimately connected to agran quest for elective office.as the trial court pointed out,agran had a palpable personal stake in the statement and the election.he was a candidate and there was a pressing immediate need to have a candidate statement of some kind in the voter pamphlet,lest agran be conspicuously missing from the voter pamphlet.
no fees for appealing the ruling concerning the statement about leading the council in hammond i 
one of the issues in hammond i was the accuracy of agran statement he led the city council in developing irvine general plan.while the trial court was clearly concerned with the qualifications issue,general appellate procedure given that the trial court had ordered that portion of the statement to be amended meant there had been an implied finding that the statement was not factually accurate.on appeal,we disagreed,concluding that the statement was not inaccurate.hammond i,supra,th at,d.
material defending the statement about leading the city council occupied pages through of agran opening brief in hammond i part,and pages bottom half through of the reply brief part.we affirm the trial court denial of fees insofar as it applied to this work.
political candidates have intense personal interests in their reputations,and there is a recognition in our culture of its importance.the biblical proverb that a good name is rather to be chosen than great riches is on point in this context,because it underscores the idea that reputational interests can be more important than financial ones.moreover,reputational interests tend to be intensely personal,they do not implicate the public interest in a way that perhaps other nonpecuniary interests might,as in press,trying to curb oil company profits.here,the major importance of the led the city council issue was to agran personally,who had had his reputation for veracity besmirched by the trial court implied finding.
and in fact it was a personal concern of agran that extended beyond the election that agran won.a candidate ability to govern effectively after taking office is directly related to his or her good reputation.this close proximity between the candidate reputational interests undercuts the transcendence and disproportionality of interest to burden that is the essence of the necessity and financial burden clause of section.because of a candidate understandable protectiveness over his or her reputation,any fees here would undercut the proportionality test inherent in the statute.
no fees for seeking fees in hammond i 
agran devoted almost half his opening brief in hammond i to a request that this court determine that he should receive fees in the event that he prevailed and obtained a reversal of the trial court order.
the question of fees for work was addressed by our high court in serrano unruh cal d,sometimes referred to as serrano iv.there the court faced the question of whether the prevailing public interest litigants could obtain fees for a previous win serrano priest cal d,serrano iii which had merely established their right to fees.the problem with awarding such fees,as justice richardson pointed out in his dissent,was that fees for work simply did meet the requisites of section.no public benefit was conferred all the benefit was personal the only right secured on appeal in serrano iii was respondents entitlement to a fee award,and the only benefit conferred by that litigation was personal to the public interest law firms involved.serrano iv,supra,cal d at,dis.opn.of richardson.
what persuaded the majority to hold otherwise were certain necessary implications of the statute.if a public interest litigant could not obtain any fees for work,then the private attorney general doctrine could often be frustrated,sometimes nullified,if awards are diluted or dissipated by lengthy,uncompensated proceedings to fix or defend a rightful fee claim.serrano iv,supra,cal d at.a corollary to that idea was that if attorneys were required to expend time litigating the fee claim itself,yet go uncompensated for that time,their effective hourly rate could be cut at will by their opponents.id.at.specifically,the high court was worried that a firm rule precluding fees for work would give too much power to a claimant opponents it could permit fees to be determined by the litigiousness of losing parties.see also id.at,observing that a party could not litigate tenaciously and then be heard to complain about the time necessarily spent by the plaintiff in response.
however,the serrano iv majority also recognized that a rule allowing fees for work was not hard and fast the rule operated only ordinarily and was subject to the exception that special circumstances could indeed render a fee for work award unjust.see serrano iv,supra,cal d at.on that score the serrano iv majority recognized that fee claimants should not be able to force their opponents to a hobson choice of acceding to exorbitant fee demands or incurring further expenses by voicing legitimate objections.id.at.elaborating,the court said that fee claimants should be compensated for hours reasonably spent on issues and that a fee request that appears unreasonably inflated is a special circumstance permitting the trial court to reduce the award or deny one altogether.id.at.
we conclude that special circumstances here require that there by no fees for the fee work on appeal in hammond i.the core concern in serrano iv was that the private attorney general doctrine could be frustrated if fees were not awarded for fee work because tenaciously litigating opponents could unilaterally exact costs on the fee claimant.that concern is completely inapplicable with regards to the appellate work in hammond indeed,hammond i presents almost an exact opposite of the situation which the serrano iv court feared.
the fee work in the opening brief was fundamentally premature.the best one could say was that it was a preemptive request to have the appellate court determine agran entitlement to fees under section rather than,as happened,have the matter remanded for consideration by the trial court in the first instance.but such a preemptive request was hardly necessary to any possible right to fees under the statute,and does implicate any of the ideas on which serrano iv was based.the fee request work was not done in response to any tenaciousness on hammond part.hammond filed about as light a respondent brief in hammond i as possible,and did respond to much of agran fee request at much so that agran only had to devote four pages in his reply brief to a subject that he had devoted more than pages to in his opening brief.no fee award was under attack.to award fees for the premature fee request work on appeal in hammond i would convert the rationale in serrano was to protect fee claimants from having their right to a fee award unilaterally diluted by the litigiousness of an an offensive weapon whereby fees could be gratuitously inflicted without significant provocation on the part of an opponent.
agran should obtain fees for the appellate work in hammond i on the scope of the statute 
the trial court rationale for denying any fees at all applies precisely to the trial work in hammond i,and to the appellate work on the factual accuracy issue as well.but it collapses completely when applied to the appellate fee request concerning the issue of whether elections code section would allow statements of candidates viewpoints.that issue did concern itself with some factual point peculiar to one candidate,but to a matter that affects all voters and candidates.and on that issue,agran appeal was the quintessential undertaking of litigation in the public interest removed from one own immediate lifestyle benefits.
the election was over.agran had won.he could just as easily have gone fishing as undertaken the task of litigating in the appellate court the question of whether a candidate,not just the right under section to express his or her views in a ballot pamphlet candidate statement.that was litigation over a point that readily transcended his personal stake in his own particular candidate statement,and will necessarily inure to every voter who reads a ballot pamphlet in a local election wondering what policies a candidate intends to pursue in office.
hammond counters that agran was possessed of two interests to prosecute the appeal,undercutting the disproportionality of his interest to his efforts.we have already dealt with reputational interest.as we have seen,to the degree that the appellate litigation encompassed an effort by agran to remove any implied stain on his veracity concerning the led the council statement,agran should not receive fees for appellate efforts devoted that minor issue.
but any reputational interest of agran in the scope of the statute issue was attenuated indeed.by definition any litigant who qualifies for a section fee award will necessarily be a public benefactor in some sense,and will have his or her reputation thereby enhanced.
the other interest asserted by hammond is a little more elliptical.let call it the interest.according to hammond,agran litigated hammond i with a hiring his own son to overlitigate the so that agran could obtain a large fee award under the private attorney general doctrine,and thereby make an example of hammond no one would ever again have the temerity to go to court against agran,at least in a political context.for hammond,this attempt to make an example of him is a special circumstance that renders any fee award unjust.see bartling glendale adventist medical center d.bartling ii if special circumstances render an award unjust,the court can deny attorney fees.
we reject the contention.the basic reason is that the object of the appellate work in hammond i which merits scope of the statute inherently removed from any particular spite agran may have had for hammond,or any need to make an example of him.it was a discrete legal issue serenely independent of the personalities of the litigants.to the degree that agran may have incurred unreasonable fees litigating that particular issue,with the idea in the back of his mind that he could impose an exorbitant fee award on an opponent,the problem is.on remand the trial court will be charged with determining the reasonable hours spent to prosecute the appeal of the qualifications issue and the reasonable rate for those hours.see lealao beneficial california,th,d.if agran incurred more than was reasonable under those established standards,he will end up paying them himself or the fees will be forgiven by the attorneys.
the problem is also because on remand agran will not be entitled to recover fees for the amount of work that was futilely as it turned out devoted to the attorney fee issue itself in hammond 
finally,an animus theory wo hold up on this record.recall that it was hammond who initiated the litigation against agran in hammond agran no doubt has some reason to have at least a little animosity toward hammond on that basis alone.but the record fails to disclose anything near the kind of animosity that would make an otherwise appropriate award unjust.besides the political rivalry and the large fees incurred to seek fees,there is nothing to indicate any personal retribution or malicious motivation on agran part there is only the fact that agran was sued by hammond.indeed,on this record we only see a highly professional political contest and a highly civilized joining of the issues on appeal.both parties and their attorneys have conducted this litigation with an exemplary degree of professionalism that belies any personal animosity extrinsic to the issues.
a related argument made by hammond is his assertion,based on the special circumstance language discussed above in serrano iv to the effect that the very act of making an outrageously unreasonable fee request can be grounds for the complete denial of fees.the argument,of course,rests on the assumption that the claimant has indeed made an outrageously unreasonable fee request.hammond argues that agran total fee request in excess of is a figure that does even pass the smell test.
the argument,however,fails factually when one breaks down that fee request into its constituent parts.remember that we have already determined that agran should not receive fees for the trial work in hammond i,nor any fees for trying to obtain fees in hammond and we need not address fees spent in the trial court after hammond i.the requested fees attributable to the scope of the statute issue would appear to be about half the fee request the exact amount will be up to the trial court to determine.when viewed in that light,agran fee request can not be said to be so outrageously unreasonable that a total denial of all fees would be justified.
finally,the parties have raised some interesting public policy arguments regarding the consequences of fee awards for litigation arising out of challenges to candidate statements as permitted by elections code section.for hammond,allowing any fee award for such litigation has an unwarranted deterrent effect on challenges permitted by the statute.he points out that citizens interested in keeping public officials honest might be deterred from seeking to correct false or misleading statements proffered in proposed candidate statements if the litigation goes against them.for agran,not allowing such fee awards only encourages what he calls a veritable cottage industry of lawyers and professional plaintiffs specializing in challenges under sections and.
these arguments stray from the focus of the statute and specifically the necessity and financial burden clause.the critical point here is that the qualification issue was one which transcended agran personal interests because it dealt with the generic scope of section,and not with the typical,mundane squabbles over the factual accuracy of a statement peculiar to one candidate personal history.
considerations on remand 
because we break down the fee request into its constituent parts,we must deny agran request that this court simply direct the trial court,on remand,to award him all fees previously requested.we do,however,honor his alternative request to remand the matter only for a determination of the amount of fees to which he is entitled.
the basic lodestar methodology by which a court determines fees is well established,having its genesis in serrano priest cal d,serrano iii.it is nicely summarized in lealao beneficial california,supra,th at page,d the lodestar or touchstone is produced by multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended by counsel by a reasonable hourly rate.once the court has fixed the lodestar,it may increase or decrease that amount by applying a positive or negative multiplier to take into account a variety of other factors,including the quality of the representation,the novelty and complexity of the issues,the results obtained,and the contingent risk presented.
because the trial court here precluded attorney fees a priori,it never was forced to engage in the usual lodestar analysis required when fees should be awarded under section.this it will have to do on remand.
a few comments need be made in that regard.first,as the lealao court demonstrated,the factors which a trial court may consider are not fixed see lealao,supra,th at,d our state has a relatively permissive attitude as to the elements that go into what will ultimately make up the multiplier.
given that flexibility,we must conclude that several of hammond concerns about the amount of any fee award may be addressed for the first time by the trial court on remand.specifically,hammond complains that agran hired his own son as his lawyer so as to facilitate the inflation of attorney fees.after all,when your own son is doing your legal work,odds are that you do have to worry about being sued just in case the fee award does cover all the time he spent on the case.well maybe maybe not.the trial court will be able to examine the degree to which fees attributable to the scope of the statute issue have been inflated by nepotism,or,alternatively,might be independently justified regardless of the familial relationship between client and attorney.
additionally,hammond argues that,as a private citizen,it would be unfair to penalize him for initially bringing the challenge to agran candidate statement,which was itself brought in the public interest of a better informed electorate.see hull rossi th,d the state has a strong interest in providing the electorate with accurate information in the voter pamphlets.
to the degree that hammond attacked agran for the inaccuracy of the led the council statement,he is on the hook for attorney fees.the statement was not the one that made law in hammond i.our brief comments on it there did not enforce any important right affecting the public interest.as to the degree to which hammond himself arguably undertook to defend the appeal in hammond i in the public interest,it is a matter which may involve disputed factual issues as yet undecided,hammond true motive in bringing suit against agran.we shall therefore leave to the trial court for consideration in the first instance on remand the question of whether any public spiritedness on hammond part has any bearing on the amount of fees which agran should be awarded 
iv.disposition 
the order denying fees is affirmed a insofar as it denies fees for trial work in hammond i,and b insofar as it denies fees for appellate work in hammond i attributable to i the led the council statement and ii the request for fees itself.the order is reversed insofar as it denies fees for the appellate work in hammond i attributable to the scope of the statute issue.
in considering the amount of fees to be awarded,the trial court is to isolate the hours reasonably attributable to the scope of the statute issue,and then determine reasonable compensation for those hours it should then determine a multiplier,positive or negative,based on a variety of factors pertaining to the facts of this case,including the novelty and difficulty of the scope of the statute issue in the hammond i appeal,the extent to which that appeal precluded other work by agran son,and the contingent nature of any fee award.our opinion is without prejudice to either side proffering yet more factors.
any question of seeking attorney fees for work done after hammond i is now premature.in the interests of justice,each side will bear its own costs on appeal.
