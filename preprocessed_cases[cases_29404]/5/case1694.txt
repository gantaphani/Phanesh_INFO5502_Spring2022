factual and procedural background 
kramer kaslow,a law firm,and kramer as a member of the firm represented brake land,and abolfalz sharjari as plaintiffs in a prior action.birke also was a member of the firm.chitsazzadeh and mansoureh shajari were awarded summary judgment as defendants in that action.
plaintiffs filed their complaint for malicious prosecution in the present action in july.defendants filed a demurrer to the complaint in december.defendants also filed a special motion to strike pursuant to section on january,arguing that plaintiffs complaint arose from defendants constitutionally protected petitioning activity and that plaintiffs could not establish a probability of prevailing on the merits.
plaintiffs argued in opposition that defendants had failed to file their special motion to strike within days after service of the complaint as required by section,subdivision f,and had failed to request leave of court to file an untimely motion,so the motion should be stricken.plaintiffs further argued that because it was untimely,the special motion to strike was frivolous and made solely for purposes of delay,and that plaintiffs therefore were entitled to an award of attorney fees as a monetary sanction under sections,subdivision c and.
defendants argued in reply that they were never properly served with the complaint and that,under the doctrines of equitable estoppel and judicial estoppel,plaintiffs failure to seek their defaults precluded plaintiffs from asserting that defendants were served with the complaint more than days before the filing of the special motion to strike.defendants also argued that their special motion to strike should not be stricken because plaintiffs had failed to file a timely motion to strike.
the demurrer and special motion to strike both were heard on february.the trial court issued a tentative ruling stating that both the demurrer and the special motion to strike were untimely,and the demurrer also lacked substantive merit defendants were served by substituted service on september,they failed to file their special motion to strike within days after that date they were required to but did not seek leave of court before filing their untimely special motion to strike the special motion to strike therefore should be stricken the court had received no reply in support of the special motion to strike and defendants should have been aware of the day deadline to file a special motion to strike and,absent a reply explaining why the motion was not frivolous,plaintiffs were entitled to an award of a in attorney fees as a monetary sanction under section,subdivision c.
the trial court overruled the demurrer on february.the court then heard argument on the special motion to strike at that time and took the matter under submission.the court filed a order on february,finding that defendants were served by substituted service on september,and that plaintiffs request to strike the special motion to strike as untimely was,in effect,an opposition to the special motion to strike.the court concluded that its tentative ruling was correct and adopted it as the court final decision.defendants timely appealed 
contentions 
defendants contend the trial court failed to consider their special motion to strike on the merits,as required,and had no authority to strike the motion absent a properly noticed motion to strike by plaintiffs defendants should prevail on the merits of their special motion to strike and the award of attorney fees as a monetary sanction under section is unauthorized because section applies only in cases where the complaint was filed before.
