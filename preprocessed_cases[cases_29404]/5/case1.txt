petitioner marx filed suit,alleging that general revenue corporation grc violated the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa by harassing and falsely threatening her in order to collect on a debt.the district court ruled against marx and awarded grc costs pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure frcp d,which gives district courts discretion to award costs to prevailing defendants u nless a federal statute provides otherwise.marx sought to vacate the award,arguing that the court discretion under rule d was displaced by a,which provides,in pertinent part,that o n a finding by the court that an action under this section was brought in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment,the court may award to the defendant attorney fees reasonable in relation to the work expended and costs.the district court rejected marx argument.the tenth circuit affirmed,in pertinent part,agreeing that costs are allowed under the rule and concluding that nothing in the statute text,history,or purpose indicates that it was meant to displace the rule.
held section a is not contrary to,and,thus,does not displace a district court discretion to award costs under,rule d.
a rule d gives courts discretion to award costs to prevailing parties,but this discretion can be displaced by a federal statute or frcp that provides otherwise,is contrary to rule d.contrary to the argument of marx and the united states,as amicus,language of the original version of the rule does not suggest that any express provision for costs should displace rule d,regardless of whether it is contrary to the rule.
b section a language and context demonstrate that the provision is not contrary to rule d.
grc argues that since a does not address whether costs may be awarded in an fdcpa case brought in good faith,it does not set forth a standard that is contrary to the rule and therefore does not displace the presumption that a court has discretion to award costs.marx and the united states concede that the statute does not expressly limit a court discretion to award costs under the rule,but argue that it does so by negative implication.they claim that unless a sets forth the exclusive basis on which to award costs,the phrase and costs would be superfluous with rule d.and the united states also argues that a more specific cost statute displaces rule d more general rule.
the argument of marx and the united states depends critically on whether a allowance of costs creates a negative implication that costs are unavailable in any other circumstances.the expressio unius canon that they invoke does not apply unless it is fair to suppose that congress considered the unnamed possibility and meant to say no to it,barnhart peabody coal,and can be overcome by contrary indications that adopting a particular rule or statute was probably not meant to signal any exclusion,united states vonn.here,context indicates that congress did not intend a to foreclose courts from awarding costs under the rule.first,under the american rule,each litigant generally pays his own attorney fees,but the court has long recognized that federal courts have inherent power to award attorney fees in a narrow set of circumstances,when a party brings an action in bad faith.the statute is thus best read as codifying a court authority to award both attorney fees and costs.next,a second sentence must be understood in light of its first,which provides an award of attorney fees and costs,but to prevailing plaintiffs.by adding and costs to the second sentence,congress foreclosed the argument that defendants can only recover attorney fees when plaintiffs bring an action in bad faith and removed any doubt that defendants may recover costs as well as attorney fees in such cases.finally,a language sharply contrasts with that of other statutes in which congress has placed conditions on awarding costs to prevailing defendants.see.
even assuming that their surplusage argument is correct,the canon against surplusage is not absolute.first,the canon assists only where a competing interpretation gives effect to every clause and word of a statute.microsoft.partnership.here,no interpretation of a gives effect to every word.second,redundancy is not unusual in statutes addressing costs.see,d.finally,the canon is strongest when an interpretation would render superfluous another part of the same statutory scheme.because a is not part of rule d,the force of this canon is diminished.
lastly,contrary to the united states claim that specific standards displace general ones,the context of the statute indicates that congress was simply confirming the background presumption that courts may award to defendants attorney fees and costs when the plaintiff brings an action in bad faith.because marx did not bring this suit in bad faith,the specific provision is not applicable.

justice thomas delivered the opinion of the court.
federal rule of civil procedure d gives district courts discretion to award costs to prevailing defendants u nless a federal statute provides otherwise.the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa,stat,a,provides that o n a finding by the court that an action under this section was brought in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment,the court may award to the defendant attorney fees reasonable in relation to the work expended and costs.this case presents the question whether a provides otherwise than rule d.we conclude that a does not provid e otherwise,and thus a district court may award costs to prevailing defendants in fdcpa cases without finding that the plaintiff brought the case in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment.
petitioner olivea marx defaulted on a student loan guaranteed by edfund,a division of the california student aid commission.in september,edfund hired respondent general revenue corporation grc to collect the debt.one month later,marx filed an fdcpa enforcement action against grc marx alleged that grc had violated the fdcpa by harassing her with phone calls several times a day and falsely threatening to garnish up to of her wages and to take the money she owed directly from her bank account.shortly after the complaint was filed,grc made an offer of judgment under federal rule of civil procedure to pay marx,plus reasonable attorney fees and costs,to settle any claims she had against it.marx did not respond to the offer.she subsequently amended her complaint to add a claim that grc unlawfully sent a fax to her workplace that requested information about her employment status.
following a bench trial,the district court found that marx had failed to prove any violation of the fdcpa.as the prevailing party,grc submitted a bill of costs seeking in witness fees,witness travel expenses,and deposition transcript fees.the court disallowed several items of costs and,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure d,ordered marx to pay grc.marx filed a motion to vacate the award of costs,arguing that the court lacked authority to award costs under rules d and d because a sets forth the exclusive basis for awarding costs in fdcpa cases section a provides,in relevant part on a finding by the court that an action under this section was brought in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment,the court may award to the defendant attorney fees reasonable in relation to the work expended and costs.marx argued that because the court had not found that she brought the case in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment,grc was not entitled to costs.the district court rejected marx argument,concluding that a does not displace a court discretion to award costs under rule d and that costs should also be awarded under rule d.
the tenth circuit affirmed but agreed only with part of the district court reasoning.in particular,the court disagreed that costs were allowed under rule d.it explained that rule applies only where the district court enters judgment in favor of a plaintiff for less than the amount of the settlement offer and not where the plaintiff loses outright.ibid.citing delta air lines,august.because the district court had not entered judgment in favor of marx,the court concluded that costs were not allowed under rule d,at.nevertheless,the court found that costs were allowed under rule d,which grants district courts discretion to award costs to prevailing parties unless a federal statute or the federal rules of civil procedure provide otherwise,at.after describing the venerable presumption that prevailing parties are entitled to costs,at,the court concluded that nothing in the text,history,or purpose of a indicated that it was meant to displace rule d,at.judge lucero dissented,arguing that t he only sensible reading of a is that the district court may only award costs to a defendant upon finding that the action was brought in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment and that to read it otherwise rendered the phrase and costs superfluous,at emphasis in original.
we granted certiorari,to resolve a conflict among the circuits regarding whether a prevailing defendant in an fdcpa case may be awarded costs where the lawsuit was not brought in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment.compare,at case below,with rouse law offices of rory clark.we now affirm the judgment of the tenth circuit.
as in all statutory construction cases,we assum e that the ordinary meaning of the statutory language accurately expresses the legislative purpose.hardt reliance standard life ins,slip,at quoting gross fbl financial services,alteration in original.in this case,we must construe both rule d and a and assess the relationship between them.
rule d is straightforward.it provides,in relevant part unless a federal statute,these rules,or a court order provides otherwise,costs other than attorney fees should be allowed to the prevailing party.
as the tenth circuit correctly recognized,rule d codifies a venerable presumption that prevailing parties are entitled to costs notwithstanding this presumption,the word should makes clear that the decision whether to award costs ultimately lies within the sound discretion of the district court.see taniguchi kan pacific saipan,slip,at federal rule of civil procedure d gives courts the discretion to award costs to prevailing parties rule d also makes clear,however,that this discretion can be displaced by a federal statute or a federal rule of civil procedure that provides otherwise.
a statute provides otherwise than rule d if it is contrary to the rule.see moore,moore federal practice c,ed.hereinafter moore.because the rule grants district courts discretion to award costs,a statute is contrary to the rule if it limits that discretion.a statute may limit a court discretion in several ways,and it need not expressly state that it is displacing rule d to do so.for instance,a statute providing that plaintiffs shall not be liable for costs is contrary to rule d because it precludes a court from awarding costs to prevailing defendants.see,d the petitioner shall not be liable for costs in the district court similarly,a statute providing that plaintiffs may recover costs only under certain conditions is contrary to rule d because it precludes a court from awarding costs to prevailing plaintiffs when those conditions have not been satisfied.see,n o costs shall be included in such judgment,unless the proper disclaimer has been filed in the united states patent and trademark office 
importantly,not all statutes that provide for costs are contrary to rule d.a statute providing that the court may award costs to the prevailing party,for example,is not contrary to the rule because it does not limit a court discretion.see moore c,at a number of statutes state simply that the court may award costs in its discretion.such a provision is not contrary to rule d and does not displace the court discretion under the rule 
marx and the united states as amicus curiae suggest that any statute that specifically provides for costs displaces rule d,regardless of whether it is contrary to the rule.brief for petitioner brief for united states as amicus curiae hereinafter brief for united states.the united states relies on the original version of rule d,which provided,except when express provision therefor is made either in a statute of the united states or in these rules,costs shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs.at quoting rule.though the rules committee updated the language of rule d in,the change was stylistic only.advisory committee notes,supp.v.accordingly,the united states asserts that any express provision for costs should displace rule d.
we are not persuaded,however,that the original version of rule d should be interpreted as marx and the united states suggest.the original language was meant to ensure that rule d did not displace existing costs provisions that were contrary to the rule.under the prior language,statutes that simply permitted a court to award costs did not displace the rule.see moore,moore federal practice,ed.w hen permissive language is used in a statute regarding costs the district court may,pursuant to rule d,exercise a sound discretion relative to the allowance of costs rather,statutes had to set forth a standard for awarding costs that was different from rule d in order to displace the rule.see friedman ganassi,holding that e is not an express provision under rule d because it does not provide an alternative standard for awarding taxable costs.the original version of rule d is consistent with our conclusion that a statute must be contrary to rule d in order to displace it 
we now turn to whether a is contrary to rule d.the language of a and the context surrounding it persuade us that it is not.
the second sentence of a provides on a finding by the court that an action under this section was brought in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment,the court may award to the defendant attorney fees reasonable in relation to the work expended and costs.
grc contends that the statute does not address whether costs may be awarded in this case where the plaintiff brought the case in good faith and thus it does not set forth a standard for awarding costs that is contrary to rule d.in its view,congress intended a to deter plaintiffs from bringing nuisance lawsuits.it,therefore,expressly provided that when plaintiffs bring an action in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment,the court may award attorney fees and costs to the defendant.the statute does address this type of case,cases in which the plaintiff brings the action in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment.but it is silent where bad faith and purpose of harassment are absent,and silence does not displace the background rule that a court has discretion to award costs.
marx and the united states take the contrary view.they concede that the language does not expressly limit a court discretion to award costs under rule d,brief for petitioner brief for united states,but argue that it does so by negative implication.invoking the expressio unius canon of statutory construction,they contend that by specifying that a court may award attorney fees and costs when an action is brought in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment,congress intended to preclude a court from awarding fees and costs when bad faith and purpose of harassment are absent.they further argue that unless a sets forth the exclusive basis on which a court may award costs,the phrase and costs would be superfluous.according to this argument,congress would have had no reason to specify that a court may award costs when a plaintiff brings an action in bad faith if it could have nevertheless awarded costs under rule d.finally,the united states argues that a is a more specific cost statute that displaces rule d more general rule.
the context surrounding a persuades us that grc interpretation is correct.
the argument of marx and the united states depends critically on whether a allowance of costs creates a negative implication that costs are unavailable in any other circumstances.the force of any negative implication,however,depends on context.we have long held that the expressio unius canon does not apply unless it is fair to suppose that congress considered the unnamed possibility and meant to say no to it,barnhart peabody coal,and that the canon can be overcome by contrary indications that adopting a particular rule or statute was probably not meant to signal any exclusion,united states vonn.in this case,context persuades us that congress did not intend a to foreclose courts from awarding costs under rule d.
first,the background presumptions governing attorney fees and costs are a highly relevant contextual feature.as already explained,under rule d a prevailing party is entitled to recover costs from the losing party unless a federal statute,the federal rules of civil procedure,or a court order provides otherwise.the opposite presumption exists with respect to attorney fees.under the bedrock principle known as the american rule,e ach litigant pays his own attorney fees,win or lose,unless a statute or contract provides otherwise.hardt,at slip,at quoting ruckelshaus sierra club.notwithstanding the american rule,however,we have long recognized that federal courts have inherent power to award attorney fees in a narrow set of circumstances,including when a party brings an action in bad faith.see chambers nasco,explaining that a court has inherent power to award attorney fees to a party whose litigation efforts directly benefit others,to sanction the willful disobedience of a court order,and to sanction a party who has acted in bad faith,vexatiously,wantonly,or for oppressive reasons alyeska pipeline service wilderness society,same.
it is undisputed that a leaves the background rules for attorney fees intact.the statute provides that when the plaintiff brings an action in bad faith,the court may award attorney fees to the defendant.but,as noted,a court has inherent power to award fees based on a litigant bad faith even without a.see chambers,supra,at.because a codifies the background rule for attorney fees,it is dubious to infer congressional intent to override the background rule with respect to costs.the statute is best read as codifying a court authority to award both attorney fees and costs 
next,the second sentence of a must be understood in light of the sentence that precedes it the first sentence of a provides that defendants who violate the fdcpa are liable for the plaintiff attorney fees and costs.the second sentence of a similarly provides that plaintiffs who bring an action in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment may be liable for the defendant fees and costs.
if congress had excluded and costs in the second sentence,plaintiffs might have argued that the expression of costs in the first sentence and the exclusion of costs in the second meant that defendants could only recover attorney fees when plaintiffs bring an action in bad faith.by adding and costs to the second sentence,congress foreclosed that argument,thereby removing any doubt that defendants may recover costs as well as attorney fees when plaintiffs bring suits in bad faith.see ali federal bureau of prisons,explaining that a phrase is not superfluous if used to remove doubt about an issue fort stewart schools flra,explaining that technically unnecessary examples may have been inserted out of an abundance of caution the fact that there might have been a negative implication that costs are precluded,depending on whether congress included or excluded the phrase and costs,weighs against giving effect to any implied limitation.
finally,the language in a sharply contrasts with other statutes in which congress has placed conditions on awarding costs to prevailing defendants.see,n o costs shall be included in such judgment,unless the proper disclaimer has been filed in the united states patent and trademark office prior to the commencement of the action emphasis added b i n any action brought against a judicial officer such officer shall not be held liable for any costs unless such action was clearly in excess of such officer jurisdiction emphasis added.
although congress need not use explicit language to limit a court discretion under rule d,its use of explicit language in other statutes cautions against inferring a limitation in a.these statutes confirm that congress knows how to limit a court discretion under rule d when it so desires.see small united states,thomas,dissenting explaining that congress explicit use of language in other provisions shows that it specifies such restrictions when it wants to do so had congress intended the second sentence of a to displace rule d,it could have easily done so by using the word only before setting forth the condition o n a finding by the court that an action was brought in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment 
as the above discussion suggests,we also are not persuaded by marx objection that our interpretation renders the phrase and costs superfluous.as noted,supra,at,the phrase and costs would not be superfluous if congress included it to remove doubt that defendants may recover costs when plaintiffs bring suits in bad faith.but even assuming that our interpretation renders the phrase and costs superfluous,that would not alter our conclusion.the canon against surplusage is not an absolute rule,see arlington central school dist.bd.of ed.murphy,while it is generally presumed that statutes do not contain surplusage,instances of surplusage are not unknown connecticut nat.bank germain,redundancies across statutes are not unusual events in drafting and it has considerably less force in this case.
first,the canon against surplusage assists only where a competing interpretation gives effect to every clause and word of a statute.microsoft.partnership,slip,at internal quotation marks omitted.but,in this case,no interpretation of a gives effect to every word.both marx and the united states admit that a court has inherent power to award attorney fees to a defendant when the plaintiff brings an action in bad faith.because there was,consequently,no need for congress to specify that courts have this power,a is superfluous insofar as it addresses attorney fees.in light of this redundancy,we are not overly concerned that the reference to costs may be redundant as well.
second,redundancy is hardly unusual in statutes addressing costs.see,at slip,at.numerous statutes overlap with rule d.see,d t he court may award to the prevailing party the court costs of the action b,supp.v the consumer financial protection bureau may recover its costs in connection with prosecuting such action if it is the prevailing party in the action d ed.the court may award costs of suit and reasonable fees for attorneys and expert witnesses to the prevailing party f in the case of any successful action the court,in its discretion,may award the costs of the action b t he court may award to the prevailing party costs supp.v the court may also,in its discretion,award costs and attorneys fees to the prevailing party c ed.the court may,in its discretion allow a reasonable attorney fee to be paid by the defendant,and costs of the action p t he court in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney fee and costs c t he court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney fee and costs f t he court may award other litigation costs reasonably incurred 
finally,the canon against surplusage is strongest when an interpretation would render superfluous another part of the same statutory scheme.united states jicarilla apache nation,slip,at as our cases have noted in the past,we are hesitant to adopt an interpretation of a congressional enactment which renders superfluous another portion of that same law quoting mackey lanier collection agency service.because a is not part of rule d,the force of this canon is diminished.
lastly,the united states contends that a establishes explicit standards that displace rule d more general default standard.brief for united states see also ec term of years trust united states,a precisely drawn,detailed statute more general remedies quoting brown gsa.were we to accept the argument that a has a negative implication,this argument might be persuasive.but the context of a indicates that congress was simply confirming the background rule that courts may award to defendants attorney fees and costs when the plaintiff brings an action in bad faith.the statute speaks to one type of case the case of the and harassing plaintiff.because marx did not bring this suit in bad faith,this case does not fal l within the ambit of the more specific provision.brief for united states see also radlax gateway hotel,llc amalgamated bank,slip,at when the conduct at issue falls within the scope of both provisions,the specific presumptively governs emphasis in original accordingly,this canon is inapplicable.
because we conclude that the second sentence of a is not contrary to rule d,and,thus,does not displace a district court discretion to award costs under the rule,we need not address grc alternative argument that costs were required under rule.

federal rule of civil procedure d is a default standard that grants district courts discretion to award litigation costs to a prevailing party.this default,however,gives way when a federal statute includes a costs provision that provides otherwise.the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa,stat,et,contains a costs provision,a,and it provides otherwise.that is apparent from the statute plain language,which limits a court discretion to award costs to prevailing defendants to cases brought in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment.in reaching the opposite conclusion,the court ignores the plain meaning of both the fdcpa and rule d and renders the statutory language at issue in this case meaningless.i respectfully dissent.
the majority correctly recognizes,see ante,at,the fundamental principle of statutory construction that we begin with the language of the statute itself.united states ron pair enterprises,ingalls shipbuilding,director,office of workers compensation programs,caminetti united states.we presume that congress means in a statute what it says there,connecticut nat.bank germain,and where the statute language is plain,the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms.ron pair,at internal quotation marks omitted.this basic tenet is the appropriate starting point for interpreting both rule d and a.after invoking this principle,however,the majority casts it aside entirely in interpreting the statute and the rule.
rule d states,as relevant here,that u nless a federal statute provides otherwise,costs other than attorney fees should be allowed to the prevailing party.the first question is what it means for a statute to provid e otherwise than rule d.
because the phrase provides otherwise is not defined in the federal rules of civil procedure,we look to its ordinary meaning.asgrow seed winterboer.in common usage,to provide otherwise means to make a stipulation that is differen t.webster third new international dictionary,webster third defining provide and otherwise,respectively see random house dictionary of the english language,ed.random house to arrange for or stipulate i n another manner oxford english dictionary ed.oxford dictionary,at to stipulate i n another way in a different manner this reading of the plain text is confirmed by the original codification of the rule,which made clear that any express provision relating to costs in a statute is sufficient to displace the default 
accordingly,to displace rule d,a federal statute need only address costs in a way different from,but not necessarily inconsistent with,the default the reason is straightforward.if congress has enacted a provision with respect to costs in a statute,there is no longer any need for the default,so it gives way.this design of the rule is sensible,because many statutes contain specific costs provisions.moore federal practice c,ed.noting that such statutes are far too numerous to list comprehensively rule d is therefore consistent with the canon of statutory interpretation that a precisely drawn,detailed statute more general remedies.hinck united states,crawford fitting gibbons,united states erika.
while purporting to interpret the ordinary meaning of rule d,ante,at,the majority immediately abandons the ordinary meaning.the majority concludes that a statute provides otherwise for purposes of rule d only if it is contrary to the default.ante,at.but the majority does not cite even a single dictionary definition in support of that reading,despite the principle that a definition widely reflected in dictionaries generally governs over other possible meanings lacking any dictionary support for its interpretation,the majority relies instead upon a treatise published nearly years after the rule adoption.see ante,citing moore,moore federal practice,ed.
otherwise means different.webster third see supra,at.the majority preferred term of art,contrary,sets a higher bar it signifies the opposite,or a proposition,fact,or condition incompatible with another.webster third emphasis added.see also american heritage dictionary of the english language ed.opposed,as in character or purpose oxford dictionary opposed in nature or tendency diametrically different,extremely unlike random house o pposite in nature or character diametrically or mutually opposed 
indeed,the majority reading does not square with the everyday meaning of otherwise.consider,for example,a medication labeled with the instruction,take twice a day unless otherwise directed.if a doctor advises her patient to take the medicine in the morning,the patient would understand her to mean that he should take the medicine once a day,each morning.although the instruction to take the medication in the morning is not incompatible with taking it twice a day it could be taken in the evening as well an ordinary english speaker would interpret otherwise to mean that the doctor more specific instructions entirely supersede what is printed on the bottle.rule d is just the same its default is supplanted whenever congress provides more specific instructions,not only when they are diametrically opposed to it.
thus,the straightforward question in this case is whether a implements a different standard with respect to costs than rule d,and so provides otherwise.as relevant,a states on a finding by the court that an action under this section was brought in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment,the court may award to the defendant attorney fees reasonable in relation to the work expended and costs.
it is readily apparent that this provision is different from the default of rule d.in a,congress described with specificity a single circumstance in which costs may be awarded.far from merely restating a district court discretion to award costs,this provision imposes a prerequisite to the exercise of that discretion a finding by the court that an action was brought in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment.
because the text is plain,there is no need to proceed any further.even so,relevant canons of statutory interpretation lend added support to reading a as having a negative implication.that reading accords with the expressio unius,exclusio alterius canon,which instructs that when congress includes one possibility in a statute,it excludes another by implication.see chevron echazabal.this rule reinforces what the text makes clear.by limiting a court discretion to award costs to cases brought in bad faith or for the purpose of harassment,congress foreclosed the award of costs in other circumstances 
petitioner interpretation of the statute is also s
