plaintiff les jankey,an individual with a physical disability,sued defendant poop deck,a beer and wine bar,and its owners,defendants quentin thelen and the poop deck,under the americans with disabilities act of ada.plaintiff alleged that defendants failed to remove architectural barriers at a place of public accommodation,in violation of the ada.the parties entered into a settlement agreement,which the district court approved,that required defendants to remedy the problems.plaintiff then sought attorney fees as a prevailing party under the ada.the district court denied the request,ruling that an award of attorney fees and costs under the circumstances would be unjust.we reverse and remand.
factual and procedural history 
plaintiff has a congenital deformity of his lower extremities,requiring that he use a wheelchair.plaintiff alleges the following facts.on september,he visited the mermaid,a restaurant in hermosa beach,california,to have a snack.after being unable to use the restroom at the mermaid,he visited the poop deck,a beer and wine bar adjacent to the mermaid,to have a drink and use the restroom.when he attempted to visit the poop deck,he encountered architectural barriers that denied him legally required access to the bar and restrooms.he found that there was no lowered bar area from which to order a drink or to sit at the bar,that he had difficulty wheeling through the narrow door of the restroom,as it only had a inch clearance,and that,when he attempted to transfer to and from the toilet without the use of a grab bar,he stressed and strained himself in the transfer process.
on november,plaintiff and the organization disability rights enforcement,education,services helping you help others drees filed suit against defendants in the central district of california they alleged violations of the ada,the california disabled persons act,cal.california health safety code the unruh civil rights act,cal.and the california unfair competition act,cal.bus.under the ada,they sought injunctive relief to compel defendants to make the poop deck accessible to individuals with disabilities,and they requested attorney fees and costs.on the california state law claims,they sought injunctive relief,attorney fees and costs,general and compensatory damages,punitive damages,statutory damages,special and consequential damages,and prejudgment interest.
neither plaintiff personally nor his lawyers provided defendants with any form of prelitigation notice,whether formal or informal.in other words,they did not notify defendants in any way of the alleged accessibility violations before they filed suit 
on july,the district court dismissed drees for lack of standing and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiff state law claims,ruling that the claims predominated over the federal ada claim.those rulings are not at issue on appeal.
on july,defendants counsel,thomas moroney,sent plaintiff counsel,julia adams at the frankovich group,a letter as a to a telephone conversation that had taken place one month earlier.the letter expressed defendants belief that they were not violating the ada because the poop deck had accessible seating and because of the age and size of the facility the letter proposed a compromise 
the poop deck and the mermaid restaurant are located in a common building with a dividing wall.the property is owned by thelen.the mermaid is a defendant in a separate lawsuit brought by your client.the poop deck and mermaid are willing to build a third unisex ada compliant restroom in the mermaid and have that restroom available to poop deck and mermaid customers.the poop deck would post appropriate signage.the poop deck and mermaid front the strand,which is the beach bike,skate,and pedestrian walk way.a disabled customer from the poop deck can get to the mermaid on the strand without crossing streets or the mermaid parking lot.
the poop deck is also willing to address accessible seating by trying to lower and widen a portion of the that runs along the northern wall.
i believe a shared facility is a reasonable and appropriate response.given the age of the building and its common ownership it is unreasonable to expect the parties to incur the expense of completely remodeling several existing restrooms,all of which are undersized and likely could not meet new construction ada requirements in any event.
last month i asked whether these modifications would satisfy your client demands and allow us to settle the litigation.my clients would like to proceed with these modifications knowing that it will bring the lawsuits to an end.we do not want to be in a position of spending money on these modifications only to later learn that your client disapproves of them or demands something else.if your client does not respond or if we can not reach agreement on the modifications,we will do what we believe is reasonably required under the circumstances and defend the litigation.but our first preference is to try and reach some agreement.
on august,moroney sent adams a second letter i would greatly appreciate some response to the proposal that has been on the table since june.
on october,moroney again sent adams a letter.the district court had appointed a mediator to the case,and moroney proposed a mediation date.moroney also wrote 
in june,i proposed a resolution that addressed the site issues as alleged in your complaint against the poop deck as tenant and thelen as landlord.i confirmed that proposal in writing.i with phone calls.to date,i have heard nothing from your office.my understanding is that the same is true with regard to the separate case alleging site issues specific to the mermaid restaurant owned by thelen,which is being defended by different counsel.
it may be utterly unnecessary for you to travel to los angeles for a mediation in this case,but we will not know that unless and until we get a response to,or at least a discussion about,the proposal on the table.if you have some fondness for downtown los angeles,then i suppose we will have the discussion during the mediation.but the trip and expense may be unnecessary.
on november,moroney sent adams an any word on your end re the proposal on the table three days later,moroney followed up the with another letter 
as you know,we have a mediation scheduled for november.in june,i put a proposal on the table involving structural modifications to the poop deck and mermaid that addressed your client concerns.i have on that proposal with phone calls and letters to you asking for a response.to date,your client still has not responded.
i am concerned that the mediation will be quite unproductive if you do not provide a response to or at least engage in some dialogue about the proposed modifications before we meet on the.if you take the position at the mediation that our existing proposal is inadequate in some way and have some other modifications in mind,we will not be able to agree or disagree with any counter proposal without first having input from an architect and contractor and an understanding of what the city,county,and alcohol beverage control board might say about different modifications.so if,at the mediation,you come in and say we want x,the very best response we could give you is we have to run that by all sorts of other folks before we can give you a response.the mediation will end.our clients and the mediator time will have been wasted,and you will have flown to los angeles for nothing.
we will have the same problem if you respond before the mediation but wait until the last minute before doing so.please give us a response to the proposal by next wednesday.hopefully that will give us enough lead time to be able to productively discuss resolution on the.thank you.
the following wednesday,november,thomas frankovich,the frankovich group namesake,finally responded to moroney entreaties with a letter that he jointly wrote with adams.the letter accepted defendants proposal of a single,unisex,restroom located in the mermaid restaurant.frankovich also requested that the restaurant add signage of significant size indicating the location and path of travel to the accessible restroom,that an accessible area in the bar be created,and that a sign bearing the international symbol of accessibility be posted adjacent to the front door,all of which moroney had proposed in varying levels of detail.frankovich then ma d e a monetary demand contingent on an agreement being reached as to the requested injunctive relief.he stated 
i f this case were to go to trial,defendants potential exposure for statutory damages under state law alone is potentially.
of course,we are cognizant that settlement value is less than what could be expected at time of trial and have,therefore,taken this into consideration.based upon the facts of this case and the methods by which damages may be calculated,plaintiff demand to settle the compensatory damage claim for les jankey is.additionally,our attorneys fees,costs and litigation expenses to date are which includes expert fees in the sum of.thus,plaintiffs global demand to settle all monetary claims would be.
moroney called adams to confirm the content of the letter,and he responded the next day with a letter that reconfirmed the modification plans to which frankovich had agreed in writing and to which adams had agreed over the,the shared restroom in the mermaid and the addition of signage and an accessible seating area in the poop deck.the letter noted that defendants had submitted the restroom construction plans to the city for approval months earlier and that the construction plans also included widening the entrance to the poop deck,an accessibility modification that plaintiff had not requested.the letter concluded i believe these plans address the ada concerns.if your client believes that these plans are inadequate or something else is required please advise me by the end of the week november.i will call you in response to your letter of november early next week.plaintiff did not object to the plans that week.
on november,two days before the scheduled mediation session,moroney called adams and told her that defendants would settle all monetary claims for.in response,frankovich faxed to moroney a letter that rejected defendants counteroffer p laintiff demand remains at.plaintiff will be happy to entertain a reasonable that takes both damages and attorneys fees and costs into consideration.in addition,the letter objected,for the first time,to the fact that poop deck customers would have to go outside and around the building to reach the restroom.frankovich stated that t he shared restroom with the mermaid restaurant will only work if interior access is provided.if not,two fully accessible restrooms are required.
moroney immediately sent a letter to the mediator requesting that the mediation session be postponed in light of frankovich letter.he wrote 
frankovich just faxed me a letter that places us exactly in the situation i expressed concerns about last week and one i have been trying to avoid since june i will refrain in this letter from characterizing frankovich last minute response as either a withdrawal of their prior agreement or a misunderstanding.i will,however,say that i called adams after receiving her office november letter and before writing my confirming november letter to make sure we were on the same page.
in either case,it is certain that we will not be in any position to discuss opening walls between two separate businesses with different owners and different type abc licenses on wednesday.we will need input from an architect,contractor,department of alcohol beverage control and city of hermosa beach 
since the monetary award plaintiff seeks in the pending action is driven entirely by a possibility that he might recover attorneys fees,i am frustrated that we will be participating in a mediation that can not possibly resolve the matter.i am particularly disturbed that plaintiff lawyers will be incurring and seeking recovery of fees for participating in a mediation rendered unproductive by their failure to communicate about these issues months ago,or at the very latest last week when we had experts on location to evaluate the issues.
i suggest we delay mediation until my clients and i can confirm one way or the other the feasibility,legality and expense of what frankovich now proposes i t makes little sense for us to chat about them without having had an opportunity to evaluate the situation.
the mediator rescheduled the mediation for december.
on november,moroney sent adams and frankovich a letter asking that,before the scheduled mediation,our two contractors have a discussion via phone,without lawyers,to see whether they can reach common ground on what is readily achievable with respect to the poop deck restroom issue.adams and frankovich declined moroney offer.
on december,frankovich called moroney to discuss a possible settlement to obviate the need for mediation.although the record is unclear whether the parties met for mediation on december,the next day moroney sent adams and frankovich a letter that memorialized their december discussion 
you again agreed to our proposal to construct a unisex accessible restroom in the mermaid adjacent to the existing mermaid restrooms with that restroom also being available to poop deck customers,and the path of travel being outside along the strand and into the south facing entrance of the mermaid the main entrance.appropriate signage will be posted.
you had previously agreed that our proposal to increase accessible seating in the poop deck is adequate.as of friday,no other access issues had been raised in our discussions or correspondence.
although the parties appeared to agree on the necessary modifications,they did not have an agreement in writing,nor did they have an agreement on plaintiff claim for monetary damages.consequently,on december,moroney sent adams and frankovich another letter 
so far as i know,we have agreed on modifications that adequately address the access issues at the poop deck.the poop deck is proceeding with those modifications.
the court dismissed all plaintiff damage claims.with agreement on the access issues,the appropriate response would be for you to dismiss the complaint,or alternatively,confirm in a document we can present to the court that the access issues have been resolved.at that point,you can file a motion seeking your attorneys fees,which we will oppose.
if you proceed with the lawsuit seeking unnecessary or moot injunctive relief,we will file a motion for summary judgment.given our agreement on access,such a motion should be unnecessary and one of the options we will consider is a request that the court order that plaintiff pay defendants fees in having to file the motion.
please immediately dismiss the lawsuit or prepare a document for filing with the court confirming that the access issues have been resolved.
on december,adams and frankovich responded by faxing moroney a proposed settlement.after minor revisions,the parties finally entered into a settlement agreement.under the terms of the settlement,defendants agreed to the following modifications 
a post a sign bearing the international symbol of accessibility isa adjacent to the front door 
b widen entrance doorway to a width of when the door is open to degrees the parties agree and acknowledge that this modification has been completed.
c lower and bevel the front entrance threshold to a maximum of in.above the floor the parties agree and acknowledge that this modification has been completed.
d provide an ada accessibility guidelines compliant accessible seating area for service to persons with disabilities the parties agree and acknowledge that this modification has been completed.and 
e provide a fully accessible restroom facility,per plans of architect steve jones,located within the mermaid restaurant to be shared by patrons of both the mermaid and the poop deck.provide signage at each restroom door indicating location of accessible restroom.
the agreement required defendants to complete all modifications by june.in addition,the agreement provided that t he issues of attorneys fees,costs and litigation expenses remain before the court and that the district court retained jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the agreement.
on april,the district court accepted the settlement agreement 
plaintiff les jankey,by and through his counsel,and defendants quentin thelen and the poop deck,by and through their counsel,stipulate to dismissal of this action in its entirety with prejudice pursuant to.a.the issue of plaintiff attorneys fees,costs and litigation expenses shall be resolved by plaintiff filing a motion for reasonable attorneys fees,costs and litigation expenses with the court.the parties further consent to and request that the court retain jurisdiction over enforcement of the parties equitable settlement agreement and release.
it is hereby ordered that matter is dismissed with prejudice pursuant to.a.it is further ordered that the court shall retain jurisdiction for the purpose of enforcing the parties settlement agreement and general release should such enforcement be necessary.
citation omitted.
on may,plaintiff filed a notice of motion and motion for award of reasonable attorneys fees,including litigation expenses and costs.in a memorandum in support of his motion,plaintiff argued that he was entitled to attorney fees as a prevailing party because the settlement agreement legally obligates defendants to provide fully accessible accommodations facilities at the poop deck and,a s a term of the parties settlement is for the federal court to retain full jurisdiction over enforcement of the agreement,the settlement agreement has the necessary judicial imprimatur.
defendants opposed plaintiff fee request.they argued that the district court should exercise its discretion to deny plaintiff request because he did not provide prelitigation notice and because defendants proposed a prompt resolution of the access issues.alternatively,defendants argued that plaintiff was not a prevailing party under supreme court and ninth circuit precedent and that plaintiff request for fees was unreasonable because defendants proposed the final modifications six months before plaintiff accepted them.
the district court denied plaintiff motion for award of reasonable attorneys fees,including litigation expenses and costs.the court ruled 
in cases the court may decline to award attorney fees and costs to the prevailing plaintiff when such an award would be unjust.
here plaintiff has failed to provide prelitigation notice and has unreasonably protracted litigation by waiting nearly five months to reply to defendants proposal remedy of the violation.frankovich and his firm abusive litigation tactics have been well documented.the purpose of the is to ensure accessibility to public accommodations for disabled individuals,not to enrich attorneys.
because an award of attorney fees and costs under the circumstances would be unjust,the plaintiff motion is denied.
plaintiff timely appealed the district court denial of his motion for attorney fees.
standards of review 
we review de novo the legal standard applied by a district court to rule on a request for attorney fees.thomas city of tacoma,cir.we also review de novo questions of law underlying that decision.id.we review for clear error questions of fact resolved by the district court.id.if the district court applied the correct legal standard and if its findings of fact were not clearly erroneous,then we review for abuse of discretion the district court decision on the award of attorney fees.id.
discussion 
plaintiff was a prevailing party.
as a threshold matter,defendants argue that we should affirm the denial of fees because plaintiff was not a prevailing party under the ada.we disagree.
in a case pursued under the ada,a court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney fee.f or a litigant to be a prevailing party for the purpose of awarding attorneys fees,he must meet two criteria he must achieve a material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties,and that alteration must be judicially sanctioned.seattle sch.dist,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in other words,the alteration must have a judicial imprimatur.buckhannon bd.care home.dep t of health human,d.
here,the district court dismissed plaintiff case pursuant to a settlement agreement between the parties under which the court retained jurisdiction to enforce the settlement.defendants argue that those actions by the district court do not constitute a sufficient judicial imprimatur.that argument is foreclosed by skaff meridien north america beverly hills,llc,cir per curiam.there,we held that a settlement agreement and the district court order dismissing the case,which provided that the district court would retain jurisdiction to enforce the agreement,satisfied the requirements of buckhannon to render the plaintiff a prevailing party under the ada.id.at.the settlement agreement in this case both authorized judicial enforcement of its terms and expressly referred resolution of the issue of attorney fees to the district court.
alternatively,defendants argue that the settlement agreement did not meaningfully alter the legal relationship between the parties because,by the time the parties signed the settlement agreement,the only modifications that defendants had not completed were construction of the accessible restroom in the mermaid restaurant and signage about that restroom in the poop deck.defendants reason that defendant thelen already was bound to construct the restroom by a settlement agreement in plaintiff action against the mermaid restaurant and,therefore,that the settlement agreement in this case obligated defendants to do nothing that they had not previously completed or were obligated to complete.
defendants are mistaken.a settlement agreement meaningfully alters the legal relationship between parties if it allows one party to require the other party to do something it otherwise would not be required to do.fischer,cir.defendants argument,on its face,acknowledges that the mermaid settlement agreement did not bind defendants poop deck and the poop deck to construct an accessible restroom.plaintiff had the authority to require them to do to do so by june,and only because of,the settlement agreement at issue here.in addition,the instant settlement agreement,and only that agreement,bound defendants to install the appropriate signage in the poop deck informing patrons about the accessible restroom located in the mermaid restaurant and to inform frankovich when all of the agreed modifications were completed.thus,plaintiff was the prevailing party on his ada claim.
b.the district court erred in denying plaintiff attorney fees.
the supreme court has explained that,in civil rights cases,the district court discretion is limited.fischer,at.a prevailing plaintiff under the ada should ordinarily recover an attorney fee unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.barrios cal.interscholastic fed n,cir quoting hensley eckerhart,d.
congress passed the ada in to provide clear,strong,consistent,enforceable standards addressing discrimination against individuals with disabilities.molski cable,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.and congress enacted the provisions of civil rights statutes to ensure effective access to the judicial process for persons with civil rights grievances.hensley,at.internal quotation marks omitted.if successful plaintiffs were routinely forced to bear their own attorneys fees,few aggrieved parties would be in a position to advance the public interest by invoking the injunctive powers of the federal courts.newman piggie park,d per curiam.consequently,recovery is the rule rather than the exception.herrington county of sonoma,cir order internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court applied the correct legal standard to plaintiff request for attorney fees under the ada,asking whether an award of fees to plaintiff would be unjust.however,plaintiff argues that the district court erred by considering the lack of prelitigation notice in making that decision.
in skaff,at,we reviewed a district court denial of an award of attorney fees where the court did not explicitly indicate the significance of the fact that the plaintiff did not give notice but apparently viewed notice as a prerequisite to recovering attorneys fees under the ada.emp
