opinion of the court 
under a statutory provision known as the hyde amendment,a district court in criminal cases may award to a prevailing party,other than the united states,a reasonable attorney fee and other litigation expenses,where the court finds that the position of the united states was vexatious,frivolous,or in bad faith,unless the court finds that special circumstances make such an award unjust,stat,reprinted in,statutory note.louis manzo appeals a decision of the united states district court for the district of new jersey denying him such relief.for the following reasons,we will affirm.
background 
in october,a grand jury returned a indictment against manzo,charging him with four counts of conspiring and attempting to commit extortion,in violation of a the hobbs act,and two counts of traveling in interstate commerce to promote and facilitate bribery,in violation of a the travel act.in pertinent part,the hobbs act defines extortion as the obtaining of property from another,with his consent,induced under color of official right.id.b.the relevant portions of the travel act criminalize travel in interstate commerce with intent to promote,manage,establish,carry on,or facilitate the promotion,management,establishment,or carrying on,of any unlawful activity.id.a.an unlawful activity includes bribery as established by the laws of the state in which the bribery is committed.id.b.
the government alleged that manzo,while he was a candidate for mayor of jersey city,new jersey,sought cash payments and campaign contributions from solomon dwek,who was posing as a real estate developer,and that,in exchange,manzo indicated he would help dwek in the future with matters involving jersey city government.according to the indictment,manzo and his brother,ronald manzo,accepted as bribes three cash payments prior to the election,totaling.the indictment also alleged that dwek had agreed to pay additional money after the election,assuming manzo won which he did not.unbeknownst to the manzo brothers,dwek was a government informant.
on may,following a motion to dismiss filed by manzo,the district court dismissed each count alleging that manzo had violated the hobbs act.the court held that the alleged extortion did not constitute a violation of the act because manzo was not a public official at the time of the conduct and therefore could not have acted under color of official right.order on motion in limine at may,ecf quoting a.the court did not dismiss the remaining travel act charges,however,reasoning that the plain reading of new jersey bribery statute supplemental app.at which provides that i t is no defense to prosecution that a person whom the actor sought to influence was not qualified to act in the desired way whether because he had not yet assumed office or for any other reason,stat.ann.is that it encompasses prosecutions where the person whom the action was sought to influence was not yet qualified or able to act supplemental app.at.
the government filed an interlocutory appeal pursuant to challenging the dismissal of the hobbs act charges,and we affirmed.see united states manzo,cir.although we acknowledged that whether the hobbs act applies to a candidate for public office as opposed to someone who is already in office is a significant and novel question that was creatively framed and by the government,id.at,we ultimately affirmed the holding of the district court,reasoning that,i n accordance with the legislative history,the congressional purpose underlying the hobbs act and centuries of interpretation of the phrase under color of official right,manzo and his brother were not acting under color of official right,as defined in the hobbs act,id.at.
with the dismissal of the hobbs act charges,the case was remanded to the district court.in the meantime,the grand jury returned a second superseding indictment charging manzo with two counts of travel act violations,and one count of misprision of a felony,in violation of on february,however,the district court reversed its earlier position and held that the receipt of something of value by an unsuccessful candidate for public office in exchange for a promise of future official conduct does not constitute bribery under the new jersey bribery statute and therefore does not qualify as an unlawful activity under the travel act.the court accordingly dismissed all remaining charges against manzo 
after all of the charges against him had been dismissed,manzo filed a pro se petition on march,seeking attorney fees pursuant to the hyde amendment,which,as earlier quoted,permits an award of fees and expenses to a party subjected to vexatious,frivolous,or bad faith prosecution,stat,reprinted in,statutory note.the district court denied that petition,holding that manzo had not borne his burden of demonstrating that the prosecution in this case fits the criteria of the hyde amendment.manzo then filed this timely appeal of that order.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction under,and we have jurisdiction under.we have not considered what standard of review applies to a district court denial of a defendant request for attorney fees under the hyde amendment,but all of the courts of appeals that have considered the issue have concluded that review is for abuse of discretion.see united states lain,cir united states beeks,cir united states wade,united states true,cir united states lindberg,cir in re grand jury,cir united states truesdale,cir united states gilbert,cir.we agree and will review the district court order under that standard.
iii.discussion 
manzo contends that the district court abused its discretion in denying him a reasonable attorney fee and other litigation expenses for what he claims was a vexatious,frivolous,or bad faith prosecution by the government,stat.although we have not interpreted the hyde amendment,many of our sister circuits have.according to those courts,the hyde amendment places a daunting obstacle before defendants who seek to obtain attorney fees and costs from the government following a successful defense of criminal charges.united isaiah,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in particular,a defendant must show that the government position underlying the prosecution amounts to prosecutorial prosecution brought vexatiously,in bad faith,or so utterly without foundation in law or fact as to be frivolous.united states gilbert,cir.the defendant bears the burden of meeting any one of the three grounds under the statute,and acquittal by itself does not suffice.isaiah,at see also united states shaygan,cir t he hyde amendment place s the burden of showing that a prosecution is vexatious,frivolous,or in bad faith on the defendant,not on the government internal quotation marks omitted united states capener,cir noting that the burden is on the defendant internal quotation marks omitted united states knott,cir t he hyde amendment places the burden of proof on the defendant to demonstrate that the government position was vexatious,frivolous,or in bad faith.internal quotation marks omitted.
that burden is made more difficult by the approach courts take in assessing the government litigation position.in determining whether a position is vexatious,frivolous or in bad faith,courts make only one finding,which should be based on the case as an inclusive whole.a analysis is inconsistent with this approach.united states heavrin,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.in addition,when the legal issue is one of first impression,a court should be wary of awarding fees and costs so as not to chill the ardor of prosecutors and prevent them from prosecuting with earnestness and vigor.the hyde amendment was not intended to do that.gilbert,at.
with respect to the three grounds for relief under the statute,courts have held that a vexatious position is one that is without reasonable or probable cause or excuse.id.internal quotation marks omitted see also united states lain,cir same united states monson,cir same.to establish that the government prosecution was vexatious,a petitioner must show both that the criminal case was objectively deficient,in that it lacked either legal meri
