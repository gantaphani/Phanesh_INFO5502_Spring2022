facts and procedural history 
on may,plaintiff filed her complaint for damages alleging several violations of the elder abuse act.the complaint asserted that during the period from march until july,plaintiff was a resident at the assisted living facility operated by defendant referred to as sunrise.while a resident at sunrise,defendant allegedly engaged in conduct constituting elder abuse of plaintiff.such conduct allegedly included leaving plaintiff unattended and isolated in her room for prolonged amounts of time resulting in dehydration,ignoring plaintiff calls for help or assistance,and failing to respond to plaintiff basic health and personal hygiene needs.allegedly,defendant conduct was committed with recklessness,oppression,fraud,or malice and thus came within the scope of section.section provides in part where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that a defendant is liable for physical abuse as defined in section,or neglect as defined in section,and that the defendant has been guilty of recklessness,oppression,fraud,or malice in the commission of this abuse,the following shall apply,in addition to all other remedies otherwise provided by law a the court shall award to the plaintiff reasonable attorney fees and costs.

by entering into this agreement,you agree that any and all claims and disputes arising from or related to this agreement or to your residency,care or services at this community shall be resolved by submission to neutral,binding arbitration except that any claim involving unlawful detainer actions eviction or any claims that are brought in small claims court shall not be subject to arbitration unless both parties agree to arbitrate such proceedings.both parties give up their constitutional rights to have any such dispute decided in a court of law before a jury,and instead accept the use of arbitration.the arbitration shall be conducted in fresno county,california,by a single neutral arbitrator selected as provided in the california code of civil procedure,unless otherwise mutually agreed.in reaching a decision,the arbitrator shall prepare findings of fact and conclusions of law.each party shall bear its own costs and fees in connection with the arbitration.italics added.
plaintiff opposed the petition to compel arbitration on the ground that the above arbitration terms were unconscionable contrary to public policy.plaintiff argued the entitlement to attorney fees and costs under the elder abuse act was a substantive statutory remedy designed to increase the likelihood that attorneys would take elder abuse cases and ensure that victimized seniors would receive adequate representation.according to plaintiff opposition,that policy would be undermined if arbitration could be ordered while at the same time the trial court enforced a provision that each party bear his or her own costs and fees.at oral argument,plaintiff argued further that the provision relinquishing attorney fees recovery was contrary to public policy to the extent that it resulted in a waiver of statutory rights that were intended to be unwaivable.plaintiff pointed out that if the substantive remedies in the elder abuse act were waivable in this manner,every facility would just include a provision to waive attorney fees,which plaintiff argued would impede the goals of the elder abuse act.in its reply,defendant countered that arbitration is favored under state and federal law,and that the waiver provision was a matter of the freedom of contract that should not be disturbed by the courts.after oral argument,the trial court took the matter under submission.
in september,the trial court issued its written order granting the petition to compel arbitration.the trial court found that plaintiff failed to prove that the arbitration agreement was procedurally or substantively unconscionable.however,as noted,the trial court did find the discrete provision waiving recovery of attorney fees and costs to be in violation of public policy embodied in the elder abuse act,and the court severed that waiver provision.the trial court explained this aspect of its ruling as follows t he arbitration provision does provide for what is in effect a waiver of plaintiff right to recover,under certain circumstances,attorneys fees under the elder abuse act.to that extent,it is contrary to public policy and unlawful.citation.this does not require a finding that the arbitration agreement as a whole is unlawful as it is not permeated with unconscionability.armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,at armendariz.rather this provision of the agreement can be,and is,severed and the remainder of the agreement enforced,subd.a armendariz,at.in accordance with this determination,the trial court ordered the case to arbitration but held that plaintiff shall be entitled to assert all rights and claim all remedies available to her under the elder abuse act and the provision of the agreement requiring the parties to bear their own fees and costs is severed from the agreement and the parties will have such right to attorneys fees and costs as are provided for in and consistent with the elder abuse act.
arbitration of plaintiff causes of action was duly conducted in september and october before a neutral arbitrator.in march,the arbitrator issued an interim arbitration award regarding plaintiff elder abuse claims.the arbitrator found clear and convincing evidence of elder abuse based on,among other things,failure to make more prompt discovery of plaintiff dangerously low blood pressure and failure to take prompt action to obtain medical care to assist plaintiff after such discovery was made failure to respond to plaintiff numerous emergency calls for help in a timely fashion and failure to notify plaintiff family of the frequency of plaintiff calls for help and failure to notify plaintiff family of her falls on june and july.as compensatory damages,the arbitrator awarded special damages of and general damages in the amount of.in addition,the arbitrator found by clear and convincing proof that plaintiff was entitled to recover punitive damages for defendant conduct,which the arbitrator described as reckless conduct conducted with malice and oppression.punitive damages were awarded in the amount of.
