this dispute arises in an action brought by plaintiff moulton niguel water district district to condemn a nonexclusive pipeline easement under land owned by defendants ralph and ida colombo owners.the jury awarded damages substantially in excess of district pretrial offer.owners moved to recover their litigation expenses under code of civil procedure section,subdivision b all further statutory references are to this code,on the ground district pretrial offer was unreasonable.the court denied the motion owners contend this constitutes error.they further maintain the denial of their motion was motivated by judicial bias.the record supports neither of these claims.the law requires the trial court to evaluate the evidence independently to determine the reasonableness of the pretrial offer.it did so.and substantial evidence supports its denial of the motion.therefore,we affirm the order.
district filed this condemnation action to acquire a nonexclusive easement for underground water,reclaimed water and sewer pipelines and appurtenant facilities for transmission purposes owners answer,in part,contested district right to take.after trial,the court held that district had the right to take the easement a determination not contested here.the jury awarded owners for the easement and for severance damages,and the court added in prejudgment interest,for a total amount of.
shortly before the trial,as required by section,subdivision a,district filed and served its final offer of owners final demand was.based on the substantial difference between district pretrial offer and the jury verdict,owners sought for statutory costs and litigation expenses,and in attorney,appraisal,and expert witness fees,for a total of.district opposed the motion,contending among other things,that the evidence showed it made a reasonable offer and the larger verdict resulted from emotional factors owners improperly introduced into the trial.district asserted the court should itself evaluate the evidence to determine whether the pretrial offer and demand were reasonable.after argument,the court denied owners motion but stated it would allow normal litigation costs if owners filed a cost bill.the record furnished to us does not include such a cost bill.
discussion 
the trial court must independently review the reasonableness of pretrial offers 
section,subdivision b requires the court to determine whether the condemnor pretrial offer was reasonable if not,and if the condemnees made a reasonable demand,they are entitled to their litigation expenses.the issue here is obvious was the jury determination of damages binding on the judge in deciding whether district pretrial offer was reasonable,or does section require the court to evaluate the evidence independently if the latter,was the court determination here supported by substantial evidence 
the parties called our attention to only one california supreme court decision specifically dealing with the scope of the court power to determine the reasonableness of pretrial offers,los angeles county metropolitan transportation authority continental development cal th,d,mta.but to fully understand mta,we must first review an earlier supreme court decision,redevelopment agency gilmore cal d,gilmore.
gilmore compared the language of an earlier statute former and cases decided thereunder,with the language of present section,adopted effective.the earlier statute provided,if the court finds that the offer of the condemnor was unreasonable and that the demand of the condemnee was reasonable,all viewed in the light of the determination as to the value of the subject property,the costs allowed shall include litigation expenses.citation.gilmore,supra,cal d at.cases applying the statute had held it was error not to award litigation expenses whenever the amount of the judgment was significantly higher than the condemnor offer.but,as gilmore notes,the amended language of imposes a different standard.
section,subdivision b,the statute,instructs the court to judge the reasonableness of the offers viewed in the light of the evidence admitted and the compensation awarded in the proceeding italics added.gilmore noted the inapplicability of earlier cases such as county of los angeles kranz d.relied on by owners here,which bound the court to the size of the award in determining the reasonableness of the offer.gilmore,supra,cal d at.the opinion concluded that the mathematical relation between the plaintiff highest offer and the award is but one factor to be considered by the trial court under the new statute id.at and affirmed the trial court denial of litigation costs even though the award was substantially greater than the offer.id.at.
in mta,a transit authority sought to condemn a strip of land to construct a light rail line.the authority final offer was the owner final demand was the jury awarded in excess of million.the trial court denied the owner motion for litigation expenses,and the court of appeal reversed,holding the denial was an abuse of discretion because the authority offer had been less than percent of the award.mta,supra,cal th at,d.the supreme court concluded the appellate court erred.mta,supra,cal th at,d.
relying on gilmore,mta reiterated the mathematical relation between the condemner highest offer and the award is only one factor that should enter into the trial court determination.citations.mta,supra,cal th at,d.in so holding the court disapproved several court of appeal opinions issued after gilmore that strayed from the principle that the mathematical disparity between the offer and the award is but one factor for the trial court to consider.id.at,d,these disapproved cases had held that the condemnor offer was unreasonable as a matter of law based purely on mathematical disparity between the offer and the award.ibid.
mta extensively quoted from the trial court to demonstrate it had conducted its own evaluation of the evidence,and it supported the denial of litigation expenses.mta and gilmore hold that the phrase viewed in the light of the evidence admitted in section,subdivision b requires trial judges to evaluate that evidence independently rather than merely compare the jury condemnation award with the pretrial offers.thus,we must decide whether there is substantial evidence to support the trial court conclusion that district pretrial offer was reasonable.before we proceed with this determination,a few comments about owners attempts to distinguish mta.
owners first claim that contrary to the agency in mta,here the district does not fare well on the good faith,care and accuracy front.capitalization and italics omitted.but to assert that the court erred in concluding that district acted in good faith and evaluated the case accurately is merely another way to argue that substantial evidence does not support the decision of the trial court,an issue we discuss below.
owners next state,without discussion or explanation,that the mta case was less than on point.they support this pronouncement solely by quoting the trial court as having stated that mta is not on all fours with this one.on this score we can only acknowledge that few cases are on all fours with prior ones.but that does not necessarily diminish the earlier cases precedential value.if owners wanted us to ignore mta,they needed to persuade us that,to the extent there are factual distinctions between the two cases,they compel a different conclusion as to the scope of the trial judge duty to review the evidence to determine the reasonableness of the offers.contentions are waived when a party fails to support them with reasoned argument and citations to authority.badie bank of america th,d bernard hartford fire ins.d.
next,owners note t he core issue in mta arose from a disagreement over whether the damages to the land owner should be offset by any increase in value to the remainder by reason of the public improvement for which the property is taken.true.but so what although this was a major issue in mta,our supreme court nevertheless proceeded to address the argument that the court of appeal erred in reversing the trial court denial of defendant posttrial motion for litigation exp
