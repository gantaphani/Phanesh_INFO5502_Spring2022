background 
the facts leading up to this appeal are uncontested.the debtors hired the firm in to advise them about their financial situation.the debtors initially paid the firm a cash retainer.in october,the debtors executed an assignment to the firm,which assigned whatever tax refunds they might receive for tax years and earlier,as an additional retainer.one day later,the debtors filed a joint chapter petition,the debtors received tax refunds exceeding,all of which were delivered to the firm and were deposited into its trust account pursuant to the debtors assignment.
after paying all of its fees,the firm still had approximately remaining of the debtors initial cash retainer,which was applied in partial payment of fees.from the filing of the petition in october,through september,the debtors attorney fees and expenses totaled slightly more than.the trustee contends that none of the debtors fees are recoverable by the firm because a,as interpreted by lamie,only allows compensation of a debtor counsel for services if they were employed as authorized by.the parties agree that the firm was not employed pursuant to.
the supreme court decided lamie in january,approximately three months after the debtors filed their chapter petition.in june,the trustee filed an adversary proceeding against the firm,seeking recovery of all retainer funds that had not been applied to fees,relying on lamie.after subtracting agreed expenses,the trustee claimed approximately of the retainer funds on behalf of the estate.the bankruptcy court disagreed,however,and allowed the firm to pay its fees from the retainers,finding that the debtors assignment had transferred full ownership of the retainers to the firm,subject only to the debtors contingent right of reversion.therefore,the court reasoned,the retainer funds were neither the debtors property nor part of their estate.as such,the bankruptcy court ruled that payment of the firm fees was governed by,rather than by.

iii.issues and standard of review 
this court reviews a trial court legal conclusions that are based on uncontested facts de novo this court must also reach its own conclusions regarding state law legal issues,without deferring to the bankruptcy court interpretation of state law 
iv.discussion 
careful consideration of the lamie decision is critical to this court resolution of the issue presented by this appeal.in lamie,the debtor hired counsel to represent it in connection with a possible reorganization,and paid an initial security retainer following the filing of a chapter petition,debtor counsel was appointed by the bankruptcy court to represent the.several months later,the case was converted to chapter.at that time,debtor counsel still had not fully exhausted its security retainer.debtor counsel continued to represent the debtor,although not appointed to do so by the court.some of the work performed by debtor counsel was at the chapter trustee request.subsequently,the trustee opposed counsel request for approximately in fees,claiming that the fees were not allowable under a.
the bankruptcy court approved debtor counsel fee application and allowed it to retain the balance of the retainer,despite agreeing that precluded payment of counsel from estate funds,finding that the security retainer did not constitute estate property.in so doing,the bankruptcy court interpreted virginia law to exclude fees from estate property.on appeal,the district court for the western district of virginia affirmed.the court of appeals for the fourth circuit affirmed the lower courts conclusion that did not permit payment of fees from estate property,but reversed their conclusion that the retainer was not property of the estate.significantly,however,on appeal to the united states supreme court,the appellant questioned only whether authorizes payment to a debtor attorney,and failed to challenge the fourth circuit holding that the attorney retainer was property of the estate.
the difficulty with arose with its amendment in.prior to amendment,a specifically authorized payment to a trustee,to an examiner,to a professional person employed under section or of this title,or to the debtor attorney,authorized courts to award to a trustee,an examiner,a professional person employed under section or a reasonable compensation for actual,necessary services rendered by the trustee,examiner,professional person,or attorney and by any paraprofessional person employed by any such person thus,the principal,substantive alteration of the section by this amendment was its deletion in a of the words or to the debtor attorney.this deletion created an apparent legislative drafting error,which left the section with a missing or that affects its grammar,and also destroyed the neat parallelism between a and a a 
finding the amended statute to be awkward,and even ungrammatical,a majority of the supreme court refused to find it ambiguous,which would have required consideration of legislative history the court also held that application of the plain meaning of did not lead to absurd results,which would have required treatment of the section as if it were ambiguous under the plain meaning of,only attorneys that are employed under may be paid from estate property for services nonetheless,the court stated that compensation remains available to debtors attorneys through various permitted means,including in individual chapter and cases,and in chapter cases where the attorney is engaged by the trustee the court also noted with approval the apparent sound functioning of the bankruptcy system in the fifth and eleventh circuits,both of which had previously applied the same restrictions to payment of debtors attorneys under 
the lamie court then discussed what since has been referred to as the retainer exception,to payment restrictions 
it appears to be routine for debtors to pay reasonable fees for legal services before fi
