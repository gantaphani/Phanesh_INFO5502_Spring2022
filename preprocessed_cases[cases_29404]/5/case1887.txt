plaintiff plumbers and steamfitters,local local petitioned the superior court for a writ of mandate seeking to vacate a decision by john rea,the then acting director of the california department of industrial relations collectively the department,that renovation performed by real party in interest cruz plumbing,cruz of a building owned by real party in interest kramer properties,kramer and leased in part to humboldt county the county was not a public works project under california prevailing wage law,et the court granted relief,finding that the project qualifies as public work under section.the court also awarded local attorney fees under code of civil procedure section.the department appeals,challenging both the issuance of the writ and the award of attorney fees.we shall affirm the judgment in its entirety.
factual and procedural background 
the facts are undisputed.in april,kramer purchased a professional building at f street in eureka,california.on january,kramer leased to the county square feet of office space,or percent of the total assignable square footage of the building.the county agreed to pay per square foot in monthly rent,cents of which was earmarked for compliance with the prevailing wage.section of the lease provides,landlord acknowledges and agrees that all work on building modifications performed by landlord at the request of tenant,as specified in exhibit c,shall be governed by and performed in accordance with the provisions of the prevailing wage law.exhibit c,entitled leasehold improvement agreement,consists of two sections section,governing construction of building,and section,governing design and construction of premises.section requires kramer to construct,at its sole cost,utility services to the building,including water,sewer,gas,a minimum of one restroom core to serve at least employees in accordance with the california plumbing code,sewer and water laterals and underground drainage systems and other improvements and costs pursuant to the building plans and specifications.section,which pertains to improvements within the office space,requires kramer to install,among other things,general plumbing,drains and water coolers.
on march,kramer entered into two separate contracts with cruz.one contract pertains to performance of the plumbing improvements within the office space required by section of exhibit c to the county lease the tenant improvement contract.the other contract pertains to plumbing work for the building improvements required under section of exhibit c the shell improvement contract.kramer acknowledges that cruz was required to pay prevailing wages for work performed under the tenant improvement contract,and local does not dispute that kramer did so.cruz did not,however,pay prevailing wages on plumbing work performed under the shell improvement contract.
on january,at the request of local,the former director of the department issued a public works coverage determination finding that the shell improvement contract relates to a public work under section,so that cruz was required to pay prevailing wages for work performed under that contract.kramer appealed the coverage determination and on june,the then acting director issued a decision on administrative appeal reversing the prior determination.
local filed a petition for a writ of mandate against the department seeking to vacate the acting director decision,and the trial court granted the petition.thereafter,the trial court granted local motion for attorney fees under code of civil procedure section.the department filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
petition for writ of mandate 
section requires that workers employed on public works be paid not less than the general prevailing rate of per diem wages for work of a similar character in the locality in which the public work is performed.city of long beach department of industrial relations cal th,d.the overall purpose of the prevailing wage law is to protect and benefit employees on public works projects.id.at,d,quoting lusardi construction aubry cal th,d,italics omitted.the legislature has declared that it is the public policy of california to vigorously enforce minimum labor standards in order to ensure employees are not required or permitted to work under substandard unlawful conditions,and to protect employers who comply with the law from those who attempt to gain competitive advantage at the expense of their workers by failing to comply with minimum labor standards.lusardi construction aubry,supra,at,d.
under section the definition of public works is expanded to include any construction work done under private contract when all of the following conditions exist a the construction contract is between private persons.b the property subject to the construction contract is privately owned,but upon completion of the construction work,more than percent of the assignable square feet of the property is leased to the state or a political subdivision for its use.c either of the following conditions exist the lease agreement between the lessor and the state or political subdivision,as lessee,was entered into prior to the construction contract.the construction work is performed according to plans,specifications,or criteria furnished by the state or political subdivision,and the lease agreement between the lessor and the state or political subdivision,as lessee,is entered into during,or upon completion of,the construction work.the department contends that the trial court erred in concluding that the plumbing work performed under the shell construction contract was a public work within the meaning of section.
in conducting our review,we exercise our independent judgment in resolving whether the project at issue constituted a public work within the meaning of section.mcintosh aubry th,d coverage determinations entail interpretations of section interpretation or construction of a statute is a matter of law not the exercise of discretionary authority see also greystone homes,cake th,d.while we must give careful consideration to the department interpretation of section,we are not bound by this interpretation,as the interpretation of a statute is ultimately a judicial function.city of long beach department of industrial relations,supra,cal th at,d,although we give the department interpretation great weight citation,this court bears the ultimate responsibility for construing the statute agnew state bd.of equalization cal th,d,quoting yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d,when an administrative agency construes a statute in adopting a regulation or formulating a policy,the court will respect the agency interpretation as one of several interpretive tools that may be helpful.in the end,however,the court must independently judge the text of the statute.
the department acknowledges that the elements of section a,b,and c are satisfied in that the shell improvement contract between kramer and cruz is between private persons,the building is privately owned and upon completion of the construction work,the county will lease approximately percent of the assignable square feet,and the march,shell improvement contract between kramer and cruz was executed after the january,lease agreement between kramer and the county.the department argues that the shell improvement contract nonetheless is not for public work because section is applicable only to new construction and not to the renovation of an existing building.alternatively,it argues that even if section is applicable to renovations,the phrase any construction work must be construed to mean only that portion of the project that involves work in the publicly leased space.
nothing in the language of the statute or the legislative history supports the interpretation that section applies only to the construction of a new building.the definition of public works in section includes any construction work when certain conditions are met.the plain meaning of the term construction includes not only the erection of a new structure but also the renovation of an existing one.see trb investments,fireman fund ins.cal th,d,there is no doubt that the term construction,as commonly understood,includes the building of a new structure h owever,the plain meaning of that term would not seem to exclude other types of building endeavors short of erecting a new structure,such as substantial improvements or modifications to an existing structure,including projects that transform a hovel into a mansion,raze and replace the entire interior of a structure,or otherwise fundamentally transform a building priest housing authority of oxnard d.construction as used in section includes the entire process,including construction of basements,foundations,utility connections and the like,all of which may be required in order to erect an structure.as the trial court observed,the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous.
the limited legislative history cited in the department brief does not demonstrate any ambiguity and is consistent with the trial court interpretation.as the department explains,section was enacted after concerned legislators learned that a privately owned facility in napa was being built for lease to a public agency by less expensive workers from los angeles.as stated in the report to the senate committee on industrial relations describing assembly bill cited by the department,the purpose of the bill was to require the payment of prevailing wages when a public agency leases or more of the assignable space of the completed building.this statement does not imply that the legislature intended to limit the scope of the provision to instances of new construction.neither is such a limitation found in the enrolled bill report on assembly bill prepared by the department of water resources,which recites that under the bill a building constructed privately for the express purpose of being leased to the state or a governmental entity is in effect a state building.appropriately,its construction should come within the prevailing wage law.like the trial court,we find no basis in these statements to differentiate between a building newly constructed for the purpose of being leased to a public entity and a building substantially renovated for that same purpose.
while the department urges the court to give deference to its interpretation of section,we do not perceive any ambiguity in the term construction that leaves room for the exercise of interpretive discretion to which the court should defer.moreover,we note that the interpretation the department now urges is contrary to its position in a prior prevailing wage case.public works case,arden way,sacramento,speiker partners lease.in that case,the department expressly rejected the argument made here that the bill creating labor code ab by assemblyman dunlap was meant only to cover construction of a completed building and not alterations.id.at.the department explained that the legislative history offered in support of that claim did not actually address the question which lessor claims that they answer.they merely refer to construction projects generally,and do not define the term in any manner.the legislative history which lessor has pressed is simply unpersuasive.id.at.while the department now emphasizes that the work at arden way was all within space leased to the public agency,the department extended analysis in that case was not dependent on that fact.ultimately the department concluded that the distinction between building rehabilitation and new building construction makes little sense because a gut rehabilitation job extending over several months like arden way uses construction labor,and has an effect on the local labor market,as much as building from the ground up.id.at.we agree with this earlier interpretation by the department.
the department alternate argument is that if section applies to renovation work,the language any construction work must be read as limited to work in areas actually leased by the county.it argues,examining the entire section in context,the public work created under section is predicated on a relationship between the construction work and the public entity lease.where there is no relationship between the construction and the public entity lease,there is no public work.the trial court interpreted c too broadly in concluding that section reference to any construction includes work performed on leased portions of the building shell.fn.omitted.this argument too ignores the unambiguous language of the statute and the legislature clear directive that a project be considered a public work if a public entity leases more than percent of the assignable square feet of the property,subd.b.the property to which this subparagraph refers is the entire structure,not simply the space that is subject to the lease.this is clear from the first requirement of subdivision b,that t he property subject to the construction contract is privately owned,which clearly refers to ownership of the entire building.the department interpretation would render the more than percent requirement meaningless,since an agency necessarily leases percent of the space that it leases.the legislative history confirms that the legislature intended to create a bright line rule for determining when construction on a privately owned building qualifies as a public works project.when assembly bill was originally introduced,subdivision b required only that the property be leased to the state or a political subdivision.assem.bill reg.sess.as introduced.subdivision b was initially amended to require that the property be primarily leased to the state or a political subdivision assem.amend.to assem.bill reg.sess.april,but was later amended to require that more than percent of the assignable square feet of the property be leased to the state or a political subdivision assem.amend.to assem.bill reg.sess.april.both the language and the legislative history of the provision thus confirm a legislative determination that construction work performed on a property that is mostly leased by a public agency should be considered public work for purposes of the prevailing wage law.
assuming,without deciding,that the statute may plausibly be read to exclude construction work within a structure that has no functional relationship to space leased to a public of a coffee shop in the building is the hypothetical posed by the is not the situation here.we can not agree that there is no functional relationship between the work performed under the shell improvement contract and the space leased to the county.the department argues that t he plumbing work performed under the shell improvement contract was part of an ongoing undertaking by kramer to renovate and rehabilitate an building and make it suitable for occupancy by tenants other than the county.it bears no relationship to the county lease.the external plumbing work,however,unquestionably is essential to the operation of the internal plumbing in the areas of the building.the fact that the rough plumbing may also benefit other tenants does not negate the functional relationship between the work performed under the shell contract and the county use of its lease space.
the department argues that the court interpretation unduly emphasizes whether the construction contract was signed before or after the county lease instead of focusing on the nature of the work performed.the date on which the construction contract was signed is important,however,because it affects whether the owner can recoup any increased construction costs through its lease with the public entity.as the trial court explained,if the contract is signed after the lease has been entered,the owner is on notice that the prevailing wage law may apply.in this case,kramer lease with the county was negotiated based on the understanding that of its monthly rent would be allocated to pay for compliance with the prevailing wage law the trial court thus properly rejected the suggestion that an unsuspecting property owner might be trapped into paying prevailing wages.contrariwise,if the construction contract is entered before the property has been leased to a public agency,there is no basis for the contracting parties to take the prevailing wage law into account when negotiating the terms of the contract 
finally,the court construction of section does not produce any of the absurd and unfair results that the department hypothesizes.the department first suggests that under the court interpretation kramer would be required to pay prevailing wages for work performed in interior space leased by private tenants.as indicated above,however,that is not the situation presented in this case and may not be correct if the improvements performed for another tenant have no functional relationship to the space leased to the public agency.as the trial court explained,a court may reasonably resolve the department concern in a subsequent case by understanding the phrase any construction work,as used in the statute,to refer to anything that has to do with the public entity occupancy or use of the building.the department also asserts that the court interpretation would require application of the prevailing wage law to work performed in perpetuity after the county lease has expired and the public entity is no longer a tenant.the expiration or termination of the lease,it asserts,will not extinguish kramer liability for prevailing wages or the liability of any subsequent purchaser of the building.we do not understand this contention.section applies only if upon completion of the construction work,more than percent of the assignable square feet of the property is leased to the state or a political subdivision for its use,subd.b.if the tenancy has expired,the prevailing wage law will not apply to construction work contracted for after the public agency no longer occupies the space.
the department also finds absurdity in the fact that prevailing wages are required whenever the building exterior,shell or common areas need construction work,in the potential market effects it suggests the court interpretation may cause,and in the fact that this interpretation may creat e a disincentive for private building owners to lease less than percent of the assignable space to public entities.these concerns,however,are properly addressed to the legislature.they reflect no absurdity and do not justify distorting the meaning of the statute as it now reads.
we therefore affirm the trial court order compelling the department to vacate its june,decision determining that the shell improvement contract is not a public work within the meaning of section.
attorney fees 
the trial court awarded in attorney fees to local pursuant to code of civil procedure section.the statute provides in pertinent part upon motion,a court may award attorneys fees to a successful party against one or more opposing parties in any action which has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest if a a significant benefit,whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary,has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons,and b the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement are such as to make the award appropriate the attorney fees were imposed upon both the department and upon the real parties in interest the department contends the award against it must be reversed because it is not an opposing party for purposes of this section,but a neutral public agency required by law to issue and defend its public works coverage decision.the department also contends the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that the elements necessary for an award of attorney fees under section are present in this case.
the department argues that the obligation of the director to perform ministerial acts,and thereafter defend them,while also remaining a neutral party in the administrative process,is inconsistent with the trial court imposition of liability on the director for the payment of local attorney fees.it suggests that it is the real parties who solely should bear the liability for payment of local attorney fees as they have the ultimate responsibility for compliance with the prevailing wage laws.
whether the department is an opposing party within the meaning of code of civil procedure section is a question of statutory construction subject to our de novo review.connerly state personnel bd.cal th,d,connerly.an opposing party against whom attorney fees may be awarded pursuant to code of civil procedure section is defined broadly as a party whose position in the litigation was adverse to that of the prevailing party.simply put,an opposing party within the meaning of section is a losing party.nestande watson th,d.in connerly,the court explained,because the term opposing parties is not defined,it can be assumed that the legislature was referring to the conventional definition of that term.as we have recognized,the edition of black law dictionary current at the time that section was drafted states that p arty is a technical term having a precise meaning in legal parlance it refers to those by or against whom a suit is brought,the party plaintiff or defendant citations.generally speaking,the opposing party liable for attorney fees under section has been the defendant person or agency sued,which is responsible for initiating and maintaining actions or policies that are deemed harmful to the public interest and that gave rise to the litigation.connerly,supra,at,d.
here,the department was the agency responsible for initiating and maintaining the relevant policy decision that was the subject of this litigation.the department acknowledges that c overage determinations are administrative opinions that interpret statutes that the director is responsible for enforcing.indeed,as noted above,the department argues that i n interpreting section,this court should give deference to the director interpretation as it involves an area of agency expertise and is performed by the director himself,the most senior agency official,after careful consideration of the facts,the relevant law and the parties positions.while the department emphasizes that coverage determinations are not regulations,it acknowledges that when designated as precedential they can be used as guidance in cases with similar facts.tidewater marine western,bradshaw cal th,d,interpretations that arise in the course of adjudication are not regulations,though they may be persuasive as precedents in similar subsequent cases.government code section,subdivision b,authorizes an agency such as the department to designate a coverage determination as precedential if it contains a significant legal or policy determination of general application that is likely to recur.although d esignation of a decision or part of a decision as a precedent decision is not rulemaking ibid,the law revision commission comments explain that t he first sentence of subdivision b recognizes the need of agencies to be able to make law and policy through adjudication as well as through rulemaking.the department designated the coverage determination decision in this case as precedential,thereby exercising its ability to make law and policy through adjudication.
nothing in connerly,supra,cal th,d,suggests that a public agency can not be deemed an opposing party liable for attorney fees when its decisions are challenged and set aside in litigation.in connerly,the court held that the california business council,which initially participated in that action as an amicus curiae,but was later named as a real party in interest and called upon to defend the state affirmative action statutes,was not an opposing party under code of civil procedure section.id.at,d.the court noted that the california business council clearly is not an opposing party because it was responsible neither for enacting nor enforcing the statutes that were judged to be unconstitutional in the underlying litigation.id.at,d.the court concluded that although the california business council actively participated in the litigation as the real party in interest,it was not liable for attorney fees because it did not have a direct interest in the litigation,the furtherance of which was generally at least partly responsible for the policy or practice that gave rise to the litigation,or were codefendants with a direct interest intertwined with that of the principal defendant.id.at,d.the court found that the council had only an
