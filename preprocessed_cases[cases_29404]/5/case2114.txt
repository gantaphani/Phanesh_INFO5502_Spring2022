the parties to a hastily drawn code of civil procedure section settlement agreement found themselves in litigation concerning its meaning.after numerous motions,hearings and court orders,the defendant filed an appeal from an order interpreting the judgment encapsulating the section settlement agreement.the defendant requests this court to resolve once and for all just one issue out of the portly ball of wax previously at issue in this complex employment litigation does the lump sum payment required by the judgment include an amount for retirement benefits,or are continuing retirement benefits to be provided to the plaintiff under the judgment provision requiring the defendant to continue employment benefits the judgment is clear and unambiguous.paragraph thereof requires the defendant to continue to provide specified employment benefits,including retirement benefits,to the plaintiff.consequently,the amount the defendant is required to pay as a lump sum under paragraph of the judgment does not resolve the defendant liability with respect to the plaintiff retirement benefits.we affirm the order.
donald roden roden was hired as president and chief operating officer of bergen brunswig corporation bergen in and he became president and chief executive officer in.roden and bergen signed an employment agreement in.it provided bergen could not terminate roden,except for cause,or upon three years notice,and provided substantial damages to roden on termination without cause.
on november,bergen terminated roden,without cause.for some time,bergen continued paying roden his salary and continued his participation in company benefit plans.roden filed suit against bergen,for breach of contract,intentional interference with prospective economic relations,slander,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and other causes of action.roden sought not only benefits due under his employment agreement,but also damages in connection with bergen purported false communications to prospective business relations and others regarding roden alleged mismanagement of bergen.
the parties developed strained relations and were interested in resolving bergen remaining financial obligations under the employment agreement in less than three years.bergen had a special incentive to resolve the matter quickly,since it was obligated to pay roden attorney fees in the event of a dispute under the employment agreement,pursuant to subsection d thereof.the parties discussed reducing certain benefits to present value.after lengthy negotiations,bergen made a section settlement offer and roden accepted it.
the rancor only increased thereafter.bergen had dashed off a stunningly brief offer.after roden had accepted it,bergen realized what petty few terms were contained therein and that more needed to be said,to make certain the parties agreed as to all the points not articulated in the offer.roden resisted any attempts at clarification and filed an application for entry of judgment.roden prevailed on that application.
bergen followed with a motion to set aside the judgment,which was denied.roden later filed a motion to enforce the judgment,and the court entered an order favorable to roden.bergen filed a motion for reconsideration,which was denied,and then an appeal from the order interpreting the judgment.

language of offer and employment agreement 
bergen june,settlement offer,which roden accepted,provided in relevant part,pursuant to california code of civil procedure section,bergen brunswig corporation hereby offers to have judgment entered on plaintiff first amended complaint on the following terms.in favor of plaintiff in the amount of,less legally required deductions.continuation of the benefits provided in section d,e,and i of his employment contract.reasonable attorney fees and costs in an amount to be determined by the court.those three terms were reiterated in the judgment.
a number of questions arose as to the scope and interpretation of the judgment.the only issue on appeal is whether benefits payable under bergen supplemental executive retirement plan serp were reduced to present value and incorporated into the lump sum payment under paragraph of the judgment,as bergen contends,or whether roden was to have continued serp participation pursuant to paragraph of the judgment,as roden contends.
a contract must be interpreted as to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties as it existed at the time of contracting,and where,as here,the contract is in writing,the intention is to be ascertained from the writing alone,if possible.brinton bankers pension services,th,d.in this case,it is not possible to ascertain the intent without looking outside of the settlement contract,to the employment agreement referenced therein.
subsections d,e and i of the employment agreement provide as follows d employee benefit programs.the executive shall be entitled to participate in all employee health and benefit programs of the company from time to time in effect for senior executives of the company,including,but not limited to,health,life,disability and dental insurance and retirement plan benefit programs,subject to a determination of executive eligibility under the terms of said plans and otherwise in accordance with their respective terms.e automobile allowance.the company shall elect to provide to the executive a minimum automobile allowance of per month,or,in lieu of an automobile allowance,an automobile which will be owned by the company i other.the executive shall be entitled to receive participate in all other benefits and programs made available,from time to time,to other senior executives of the company 
the language of the employment agreement is clear.subsection d thereof specifically provides that roden may participate in the company retirement plan benefit programs,and bergen does not dispute that the benefit at issue is a retirement plan benefit.inasmuch as paragraph of the judgment requires the continuation of subsection d benefits,and subsection d addresses retirement benefits,the resolution of retirement benefits is covered by paragraph of the judgment,not paragraph.
extrinsic evidence 
a introduction 
the plain language of the judgment and employment agreement notwithstanding,bergen asks us to look at extrinsic evidence to interpret the judgment.as bergen points out,subsection b of the employment agreement provides that roden damages for termination without cause shall equal,the present value determined on the date such damages are received of the compensation the executive would otherwise have received under this agreement for the remaining term of this agreement bergen states that it sought to comply with its subsection b obligation to pay roden the present value of three years of compensation.bergen also says that,in furtherance of this intention,it calculated the value of roden serp benefits,had he remained employed for another three years,reduced the amount to present value,and included the present value in the lump sum payment under paragraph of the judgment.it also explains that it did not do the same with the insurance benefits because they could not be reduced to present value.it does not comment as to why it could not reduce to present value either the total of the insurance premium payments or the automobile allowance.
bergen requests us to consider extrinsic evidence showing that roden was aware of this intention before the section offer and acceptance were filed with the court and judgment was entered and before the hearing on the motion to set aside the judgment.it argues the evidence is admissible because the settlement agreement is reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation and the evidence proves that the serp payment was intended to be included in the lump sum payment.see appleton waessil,supra,th at,d if language is reasonably susceptible of proffered interpretation,extrinsic evidence is admitted to aid in interpretation.
the evidence bergen seeks to have considered includes a december,section offer that had been rejected,certain correspondence between the parties both before and after the june,section offer was accepted,certain declarations,and excerpts from the transcript of the hearing on the motion to set aside the judgment.the trial court rejected most of the evidence based on relevance or hearsay grounds or on evidence code section whether the particular evidentiary rulings as to each individual item of evidence were correct,we need not decide.even were we to consider all the evidence bergen sought to put before the court,the outcome would be the same.
b writings 
on december,bergen sent roden a section settlement offer.in that offer,bergen specifically itemized amounts offered for base salary,bonus and serp benefits and provided the methods of calculation.the offer included a lump sum amount for the serp benefits.in addition,the offer specified that health,life and income protection benefits would be continued in accordance with their terms and bergen would continue to provide the automobile allowance.it also specifically addressed stock options,attorney fees,roden outstanding company loan,and other matters.
by contrast,the june,settlement offer did not mention the serp benefits as a lump sum,and made no mention of the component parts of the lump sum or how it was calculated.it simply said roden would be paid a lump sum and receive in addition a continuation of the benefits specified in subsections d,e and i of the employment agreement and certain attorney fees.comparing the two settlement offers,it is reasonable to construe the later one as resolving the serp benefit issue under the umbrella of section of the employment agreement,because that section addresses retirement benefits.moreover,the later settlement offer contained no indication that serp benefits were intended to be excluded from the explicit reference to section.finally,the later offer,unlike the earlier one,made no mention of a lump sum earmarked for serp benefits.
next,after the june,settlement offer had been sent,but before it was accepted on july,bergen sent a letter dated july,to roden individually,not to his attorney.that letter made no reference to the pending settlement offer,but rather was made in response to a may letter from roden to bergen.enclosed with the july,letter was a check in the amount of,representing a total amount of,less certain deductions and offsets.the letter and payment were sent given roden request that bergen pay him then the full amount owed under the employment agreement.the letter also indicated bergen desire to cut off the accrual of further attorney fees.the letter explained that the amount included for the serp benefit.it also mentioned therein the continuation of benefits under subsections d,e and i of the employment agreement.
there was no explanation of how the july,letter related to the pending june,settlement offer.there was no indication of whether the amount referenced in the july,letter would be credited to the lump sum specified in the june,settlement offer if the check were cashed and the june,settlement offer were accepted.there was no hint as to whether the july,letter was intended to be a settlement offer that superseded the june,offer.lastly,there certainly was no statement that the serp benefit amount,or for that matter any of the other amounts referenced in the july,letter,correlated in any way to the pending offer of june.twas a puzzlement.
c writings 
bergen chairman,robert martini,who had signed the july,letter,provided a retroactive explanation of the correlation in an august,declaration.in that declaration,he stated that his intention was to provide roden with two alternatives.roden could either decline the june,offer,accept the check,and continue the litigation to see if he could obtain a greater total recovery that way,or accept the june,offer under the terms which bergen intended,thereby ending the litigation furthermore,martini intention with respect to the june,offer was to provide for settlement of salary,bonus and serp benefits,plus an additional to cover all additional claims under roden first amended complaint.
if indeed bergen intended to present alternative offers,why would roden assume that the deal points contained in the july,offer were intended to be incorporated retroactively into the provisions of the alternative june,offer bergen offers no evidence of any communications made before the june,offer was accepted stating that the lump sum specified therein,as opposed to the lump sum referenced in the july,letter,was intended to include an amount for serp benefits and that the explicit june,settlement offer language concerning the continuation of benefits under section of the employment agreement was intended to exclude the continuation of serp benefits.w here a person words or acts,judged by a reasonable standard,manifest an intent to agree to a certain matter,that agreement is established,regardless of what may have been the person real but unexpressed state of mind on the subject.citations.plaintiff undisclosed intent is simply inadmissible to contradict the comprehensive and broad language of the settlement agreement citations.brinton bankers pension services,supra,th at,d.here,bergen undisclosed intent to exclude serp benefits from the continuation of benefits provision contained in paragraph of the judgment can not be used to contradict the plain language of that provision.
in addition to the martini declaration,bergen offers other extrinsic evidence.a series of communications between counsel for the parties shows that bergen suddenly became alarmed at the scanty provisions to which the parties had agreed.there were several issues bergen sought to address after the fact,only one of which was the serp benefit.concerned as to the deal that had been struck,bergen attempted to bootstrap itself into a better position by clarifying the contract terms before the court entered judgment.it sent roden a letter detailing the provisions as it wished they had been written and telling roden that if it sought entry of judgment it would be agreeing to the clarified terms.roden rebuffed bergen efforts to unilaterally dictate new terms.
we agree with the trial court that the communications are irrelevant to the determination of the intent of the parties as of the date of acceptance,and the meaning of the agreement as of that date.pazderka caballeros dimas alang,th,d.
application for entry of judgment 
roden filed an application for entry of judgment.in bergen response to the application,it stated there was absolutely nothing left to be decided.it also suggested that any remaining issues could be resolved by additional negotiation or noticed motion.bergen further stated on the other hand,
