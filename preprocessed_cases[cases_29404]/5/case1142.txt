the los angeles county sheriff department purchased licenses to wall data computer software but installed the software onto computers.we are asked to determine whether the sheriff department conduct constituted copyright infringement.the wrinkle in this otherwise smooth question is that,although the software was installed onto computers,the computers were configured such that the total number of workstations able to access the installed software did not exceed the total number of licenses the sheriff department purchased.we have jurisdiction under and hold that such copying constitutes copyright infringement despite the sheriff department configuration.we therefore affirm the district court.
facts and procedural history 
wall data incorporated develops,markets,and sells a line of copyrighted computer terminal emulation software products including rumba office and rumba mainframe.both rumba products allow personal computers that use one operating system to access data stored on computers that use a different operating system.rumba office is the more expensive and more powerful computer program.
between december and february,the,the los angeles county sheriff department and the county of los angeles collectively,sheriff department,purchased both of wall data rumba software products through an approved vendor.in december,the sheriff department purchased eight units of wall data rumba office program.each of the eight units contained a rumba office compact disc and a volume license booklet.each volume license booklet granted the sheriff department licenses to rumba office.in total,the sheriff department paid for rumba office licenses,at a reduced price of per license 
between november and february,the sheriff department purchased licenses to the rumba mainframe program.in all,the sheriff department purchased licenses to rumba office and licenses to rumba mainframe,for a total of licenses.
at first,the sheriff department installed rumba office manually,one computer at a time,onto approximately computers in the sheriff department new detention twin towers correctional facility twin towers.the sheriff department soon realized that this process was too time consuming and would delay opening the twin towers.in addition,it was not clear where those employees who would need to use rumba programs would be assigned to work.to speed up the process of installation and to ensure that employees would be able to use the rumba software regardless of where they were assigned,the sheriff department decided to install a baseline of software applications onto the hard drives of the remaining computers in its new detention facility.this was done by simultaneously copying the entire contents of a single master hard drive containing the baseline of software applications onto the hard drives of other computers.this method is known as hard disk imaging,and saved the sheriff department from having to install the software manually onto each computer.
by the time the sheriff department finished hard disk imaging in,rumba office was loaded onto computers in the twin towers,far in excess of the rumba licenses the sheriff department had purchased.although rumba office was installed onto nearly all of the computers in the twin towers,the sheriff department configured those computers using a security system such that the number of users who could access rumba office was limited.the sheriff department claims that,at all times,the number of those who could access the software was limited to the number of licenses it had 
shortly thereafter,wall data discovered that the number of computers in the twin towers that had rumba office installed exceeded the number of licenses held by the sheriff department.as a result,wall data claimed that the sheriff department violated the terms of its licenses because the sheriff department was licensed,at most,to install rumba software onto only computers.
the parties tried unsuccessfully to settle the dispute.after settlement efforts failed,the sheriff department removed rumba office from the computers in the twin towers for which it did not have a license.the sheriff department installed the less expensive rumba mainframe program onto many computers to replace the copies of rumba office that were removed.
on january,wall data filed suit against the sheriff department.although wall data raised several claims in its complaint,the only claim that went to trial and the only claim at issue here was copyright infringement.wall data alleged that the sheriff department rumba office onto computers in the twin towers and violated the terms of wall data license license and volume license booklets.
in response,the sheriff department contended that it had not violated the terms of wall data licenses and that it was entitled to the following affirmative defenses a fair use defense under and an essential step defense under a.as described above,the sheriff department argued that,even though it had installed rumba office onto workstations,it had configured the software so that the software could only be accessed by workstations at a time.the sheriff department argued that this constituted a fair use under because the number of useable copies of the software did not exceed the number of licenses held by the sheriff department.the sheriff department also argued that the copying was an essential step under a l,because the hard drive imaging process was a necessary step of installation.based on these arguments and affirmative defenses,both parties moved for summary judgment.
the district court made its initial ruling on the parties summary judgment motions on may,and concluded that neither party was entitled to summary judgment.on may,both sides filed numerous motions in limine.the district court ruled on these motions on june,it excluded evidence offered by the sheriff department on its fair use defense,and other evidence that the district court ruled irrelevant,time consuming,or confusing to the jury.on the same day,the district court reconsidered its earlier ruling on summary judgment,and granted wall data motion for summary judgment on the basis that the sheriff department was not entitled to a fair use defense.
following these rulings on the parties motions in limine,a jury trial took place.the only issues remaining for trial were whether the sheriff department had infringed on wall data copyright and whether any defense barred wall data copyright infringement claim.at the end of trial,the jury returned a general verdict finding the sheriff department liable for copyright infringement and awarding wall data in damages.subsequently,wall data filed a motion under requesting over million in attorneys fees and nearly in costs.the district court granted wall data in attorneys fees and approximately in costs.after the district court entered final judgment against the sheriff department,the sheriff department timely appealed.
the sheriff department now challenges the district court order granting summary judgment against its fair use defense the district court evidentiary rulings on motions in limine including those affecting its fair use defense and essential step defense the district court jury instructions regarding,inter alia,the sheriff department essential step defense and the district court order granting wall data costs and attorneys fees.
ii.analysis 
the copyright act defines a computer program as a set of statements or instructions to be used directly or indirectly in a computer in order to bring about a certain result.we have long held that a computer program is copyrightable as a tangible medium of expression.apple computer,formula int l,cir.
as the owner of a copyright,wall data has exclusive rights in its copyrighted work.see.exemptions,compulsory licenses,and defenses found in the copyright act narrow wall data rights as a copyright owner.see id.at.here,the sheriff department claims that two defenses found in the copyright act apply the fair use defense and the essential step defense.as discussed below,we hold that neither of these defenses save the sheriff department from liability to wall data for copyright infringement,and we affirm the district court in full.
a.the sheriff department is not entitled to a fair use defense 
for more than a century,courts have excused certain otherwise infringing uses of copyrighted works under the fair use doctrine.see folsom marsh,cas.horace ball,the law of copyright and literary property.the copyright act codified the fair use defense and identified six examples of fair uses criticism,comment,news reporting,teaching including multiple copies for classroom use,scholarship,or research.the fair use defense buttresses the basic goal of copyright law to put copyrighted works to their most beneficial use so that the public good fully coincides with the claims of individuals.the federalist,at madison new american library ed see also sony of am.universal city studios,d w e must take care to guard against two extremes equally prejudicial the one,that men of ability,who have employed their time for the service of the community,may not be deprived of their just merits,and the reward of their ingenuity and labour the other,that the world may not be deprived of improvements,nor the progress of the arts be retarded.quoting sayre moore,east b,eng,b mattel,walking mountain,cir at its core,the act seeks to promote the progress of science and art by protecting artistic and scientific works while encouraging the development and evolution of new works.seuss,penguin books usa,cir holding that fair use permits courts to avoid rigid application of the copyright statute when,on occasion,it would stifle the very creativity which that law is designed to foster citing iowa state.research,am.broad,cir.
in this case,the district court granted summary judgment against the sheriff department on its fair use defense.we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.see smith jackson,cir.we also review de novo the district court finding of fair use under the copyright act,a mixed question of law and fact.see mattel,at.
the four fair use factors 
to determine whether the sheriff department use was fair,we must balance four factors.see id.at.these factors are the purpose and character of the use,including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes the nature of the copyrighted work the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole and the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.see seuss,at.
not all of the four factors must favor the sheriff department.see sega enters.accolade,cir.as we balance these factors,we bear in mind that fair use is appropriate where a reasonable copyright owner would have consented to the use,where the custom or public policy at the time would have defined the use as reasonable.subcomm.on patents,trademarks copyrights of the comm.on the judiciary,study,fair use of copyrighted works latman comm.print.
balancing of the four fair use factors 
the sheriff department claims that it is entitled to a fair use defense,because it has done nothing more than apply technology to make the broadest authorized use of its licenses.we are mindful that fair use is a tool for adapting copyright law to brisk technological advances and for tempering the application of copyright law.nonetheless,in the four fair use factors on appeal,in light of the purposes of copyright,campbell music,d,we conclude that the sheriff department is not entitled to the fair use defense.see los angeles news serv.cbs,as amended,cir as fair use is a mixed question of fact and law,so long as the record is sufficient to evaluate each of the statutory factors,we may reweigh on appeal the inferences to be drawn from that record.quoting harper row,nation,d.
first fair use factor purpose and character of the allegedly infringing use 
we first consider the nature of the work whether the new work is transformative or simply supplants the original work,and whether the work is commercial in nature.see campbell,at.
of primary concern is whether the sheriff department use was transformative the more transformative the new work,the less will be the significance of the other factors.id.a use is considered transformative only where a defendant changes a plaintiff copyrighted work or uses the plaintiff copyrighted work in a different context such that the plaintiff work is transformed into a new creation.see,id.at.the sheriff department created exact copies of rumba software.it then put those copies to the identical purpose as the original software.such a use can not be considered transformative.see kelly arriba soft,cir finding that reproducing music cds in computer format is not a transformative use because the resulting use of the copyrighted work was the same as the original use,entertainment.in cases where use is for the same intrinsic purpose as the copyright holder such use seriously weakens a claimed fair use.worldwide church of god philadelphia church of god,cir quoting weissmann freeman,cir.
next,the sheriff department use of hard drive imaging to copy rumba office did not promote the advancement of knowledge and the that copyright intends to secure.c opyright law ultimately serves the purpose of enriching the general public through access to creative works,fogerty fantasy,d.but the sheriff department did not provide the marketplace with new creative works,nor was there any advancement of public knowledge in this case.triad.southeastern express,cir.thus,allowing such a fair use would not further the ultimate goals of copyright law.
finally,the sheriff department use was commercial in nature.the sheriff department alleges that its use was commercially insignificant because not all of the copies of wall data computer software were actually used,and because the sheriff department is a government agency that does not compete with wall data.we disagree.as we explained in worldwide church of god,repeated and exploitative copying of copyrighted works,even if the copies are not offered for sale,may constitute a commercial use.at.a commercial use is demonstrated by a showing that repeated and exploitative unauthorized copies of copyrighted works were made to save the expense of purchasing authorized copies.a m records,napster,cir see also worldwide church of god,at concluding that a user is commercial where the infringer profited from its infringement because it gained an advantage or benefit from its distribution and use of the plaintiff product without having to account to the copyright holder.
the terms of wall data rumba license clearly restricted the sheriff department use to a single designated computer and prohibited the sheriff department from using the software in any other multiple computer or multiple user arrangement.despite this condition,the sheriff department loaded an entire suite of software,including rumba office,onto nearly all of the computers in the twin towers.by using hard drive imaging,the sheriff department saved and eliminated possible errors associated with separately installing the individual software packages onto each computer in the twin tower facility.hard drive imaging also ensured that those users who needed to use rumba would be able to access the software at whatever computer they were assigned to work.such flexibility could only have been achieved by purchasing licenses for each of the computers on which the software was loaded,or by negotiating with wall data for a less restrictive license.accordingly,we conclude that the purpose and character of the sheriff department use was commercial,because the copies were made to save the expense of purchasing authorized copies,napster,at,or at least the expense of purchasing a more flexible license.thus,the district court did not err when it decided that the sheriff department use was not for a legitimate,essentially purpose,and that the commercial aspect of the sheriff department use was not of minimal significance.sega,at 
the sheriff department installation of the rumba office software onto nearly all of its computers in the twin towers was not transformative,did not promote an advancement of the arts,and was commercial in nature.the first factor therefore weighs against a finding of fair use.
second fair use factor nature of the copyrighted work 
in analyzing the second fair use factor,we look at the nature of the copyrighted work,creative works being closer to the core of intended copyright protection than informational and functional works.seuss,at quoting campbell,at.our sister circuits have also considered,under this factor,whether the copyrighted work represents substantial investment of time and labor in anticipation of a financial return.mca,wilson,cir.although the rumba software products are not purely creative works,copyright law nonetheless protects computer software.see sega,at t he amendments to the copyright act unambiguously extended copyright protection to computer programs.in addition,wall data presented undisputed evidence that rumba software products were developed over several years,and required a dollar investment on wall data part.we therefore conclude that the nature of the copyrighted work weighs against a finding of fair use.
third fair use factor amount and substantiality of the portion used 
next,we consider whether the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyright work as a whole,is reasonable in relation to the purpose of copying,seuss,at.the sheriff department copied rumba office in its entirety to ensure that all of the computers in the twin towers had identical copies of the software.and although entire verbatim reproductions are justifiable where the purpose of the work differs from the original,mattel,at,the sheriff department put its copies to the exact purpose for which the original software licenses were purchased.consequently,the sheriff department verbatim copying of the entire copyrighted work also weighs against a finding of fair use.see worldwide church of god,at while wholesale copying does not preclude fair use per se,copying an entire work militates against a finding of fair use.internal quotation marks omitted.
fourth fair use factor effect of the use upon the potential market 
in addressing the final fair use factor,we focus on the normal market for the copyrighted work and whether the allegedly infringing use threatens the potential market for,or value of,a copyrighted work.see harper row,at.noting that the fourth fair use factor is concerned with use that supplants any part of the normal market for a copyrighted work quoting,sess.we have said 
t his inquiry attempts to strike a balance between the benefit the public will derive if the use is permitted and the personal gain the copyright owner will receive if the use is denied.the less adverse effect that an alleged infringing use has on the copyright owner expectation of gain,the less public benefit need be shown to justify the use.
the sheriff department contends that its copying was solely an attempt to use efficiently its licensed copies of the rumba software products,and accordingly,there was no negative impact on wall data market.it points to its own statements that it would not have purchased additional copies of the license had it known that its configuration went beyond its license.we are not persuaded.the sheriff department bought a few licenses and found a way to install the program onto all of its computers without paying the fee required for each installation.the sheriff department could have bargained for the flexibility it desired,but it did not.whenever a user puts copyrighted software to uses beyond the uses it bargained for,it affects the legitimate market for the product.thus,although hard drive imaging might be an efficient and effective way to install computer software,we conclude that unrestricted and widespread conduct of the sort engaged in by the defendant would nonetheless lead to of the software.campbell,at.quoting melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright a,at.
equally important,ghost copies of the software lay dormant and were unuseable only until a sheriff department network administrator decided to activate rumba office on that computer.the sheriff department thus created its own system where it granted users permission to use the software and,in essence,asked wall data to trust that it was not using rumba in excess of its authorization under the license.we recognize that computer licensing is generally an honor system,in that there is little to stop a person with physical possession of software from installing it on multiple computers.but in this case,the sheriff department system made tracking infringement almost impossible,because wall data could not independently verify which of the computers had been used to access rumba and which ones had had to trust the sheriff department that its system was not allowing.in fact,after wall data brought the of rumba to the sheriff department attention,a sheriff department employee admitted,in an email,that he was not sure how to tell which computers had accessed rumba this system therefore made copyright infringement easier because no physical installation was necessary and made detection of more difficult.
in recognition of the ease with which software can be,courts have been cautious to extend protection to methods that would make copyright infringement of software any easier 
software fundamentally differs from more traditional forms of medium,such as print or phonographic materials,in that software can be both,more readily and easily copied on a mass scale in an extraordinarily short amount of time and relatively inexpensively.one of the primary advantages of software,its ability to record,concentrate and convey information with unprecedented ease and speed,makes it extraordinarily vulnerable to illegal copying and piracy.thus,it is important to acknowledge these special characteristics of the software industry and provide enhanced copyright protection for its inventors and developers.
adobe,stargate software,d.we believe that widespread use of hard drive imaging in excess of one licenses could seriously impact the market for wall data product.see campbell,at.citations omitted.therefore,we conclude that the fourth factor also weighs against a finding of fair use.
in considering the four fair use purpose and character of the work,the nature of the use,the amount and substantiality of the portion used,and the effect on the plaintiffs militate in favor of the sheriff department fair use defense.we therefore hold that the sheriff department is not entitled to a fair use defense,and we affirm the district court order granting summary judgment on the sheriff department fair use defense.
b.the district court evidentiary rulings were not erroneous 
we review a district court evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion.see columbia pictures television,krypton broad.of birmingham,cir.prejudice must be shown to warrant a reversal.see id.as explained below,the district court did not abuse its discretion when it ruled against the sheriff department on the admissibility of certain evidentiary matters.
exclusion of irrelevant evidence 
the district court did not abuse its discretion when it ruled against the sheriff department on the admissibility of the following evidence excerpts from wall data report to the securities and exchange commission sec the sheriff department master vendor agreements and evidence regarding wall data communications with other customers and its instructions to its sales personnel describing rumba software licenses.we agree with the district court that the evidence offered by the sheriff department was irrelevant,would have consumed an unreasonable amount of time,would have caused jury confusion,or would have unduly prejudiced wall data.see.in any event,we find that any error in excluding the evidence was harmless.
first,the district court did not err when it excluded from evidence an excerpt from wall data report to the sec.the relevant excerpt consisted of a general statement that wall data licenses may be unenforceable.such licenses were clearly enforceable in california and washington,the relevant jurisdictions in these actions.see,lozano v.at t wireless,d,mortenson timberline software.the report was irrelevant because it did not deal specifically with the action at hand.therefore,the district court decision to exclude such evidence was not an abuse of discretion.
next,the district court did not abuse its discretion when it excluded evidence of master vendor agreements governing the sheriff department purchase of software.the sheriff department ordered rumba software products through one of the sheriff department resellers,an approved los angeles county vendor,who in turn,ordered the products from a wall data distributor.the master vendor agreements governed the relationship between the sheriff department and the reseller,not the relationship between the sheriff department and wall data.because wall data was not a party to the master vendor agreements,the district court ruled that the sheriff department could only introduce such documents for purposes of estoppel if the sheriff department could prove that wall data had knowledge of them.the sheriff department conceded that it had no evidence that wall data knew of the agreements.because wall data had no knowledge of the agreements,we agree with the district court that the master vendor agreements were not binding on wall data and were therefore irrelevant to the proceeding.we thus conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the master vendor agreements.
the district court properly excluded evidence related to wall data communications with other customers and existence of another wall data software product,cyberprise.we agree with the district court that wall data communication with other customers regarding licenses for the products they purchased was irrelevant to the case at hand.the court also acted properly when it excluded all evidence related to cyberprise.unlike rumba,which was designed to be installed on physical workstations,cyberprise was accessed through the internet.cyberprise was also licensed under a concurrent user licensing system,which made the physical location of the user irrelevant because there were clear difference between the two products,information about cyberprise would distract the jury from the relevant issues in this case.accordingly,the district court did not err in excluding evidence relating to cyberprise.
finally,the district court decision to exclude wall data instructions to sales personnel describing rumba software licenses was not reversible error.the licenses clearly state that reliance should not be placed on representations made by wall data employees.in addition,even though the district court granted a motion in limine excluding this evidence,the sheriff department nonetheless introduced testimony regarding conversations between its employees and wall data employees.the sheriff department did not point to any evidence that they were prevented from offering because of the district court ruling.the sheriff department has not shown any prejudice based on the district court ruling on the motion in limine,and therefore any error was harmless.
the district court did not abuse its discretion when it found that the above evidence would confuse or mislead the jury.accordingly,the district court evidentiary rulings on these points are affirmed.
admission of the sheriff department internal memorandum 
before trial,the district court ruled that internal sheriff department communications concerning settlement negotiations between wall data and the sheriff department would be excluded.the district court later allowed wall data to introduce an internal memorandum dated march,prepared by a sheriff department employee related to the dispute.in the memorandum,a sheriff department employee admitted that he did not know how to tell which computers rumba is used on and on which ones it has never been used.the sheriff department objected on the basis that the memorandum was prepared in aid of settlement discussions.the district court overruled the sheriff department objection and allowed wall data to introduce the document.
on appeal,the sheriff department claims that admission of the document constitutes reversible error because the memorandum was prepared in aid of settlement discussions.not so.the district court properly determined that the parties settlement discussions did not crystallize until march,almost a week after this memorandum was written.this memorandum merely recounted a meeting between sheriff department employees and wall data to discuss possible of the rumba licenses.because the memorandum did not contain evidence furnishing or offering or promising to furnish valuable consideration in compromising or attempting to compromise a claim which was disputed as to either validity or amount,and because the memorandum was written before settlement discussions began,admission of the memorandum by the district court did not constitute reversible error.
c.the district court jury instructions were not erroneous 
we review de novo whether a jury instruction misstates the law.see white ford motor,cir.we review a district court formulation of civil jury instructions for an abuse of discretion.see monroe city of phoenix,cir.an error in instructing the jury in a civil case does not require reversal if that error is harmless.see id.at.the district court concluded that many of the parties proposed jury instructions were slanted or argumentative one way or the other and were not appropriate or were confusing to the jury.for this reason,the district court fashioned jury instructions for the parties.as discussed below,the district court jury instructions fairly and adequately covered the issues presented,correctly stated the law,and were not misleading.see duran city of maywood,cir.
jury instructions related to the essential step defense under were not erroneous 
the sheriff department requested that the district court instruct the jury on the difference between a licensee and an owner for purposes of a essential step defense.we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it declined to do so.
the essential step defense attempts to strike a balance between the interests of software users and software developers.see.this section permits the owner of a copy of a copyrighted computer program to make or authorize the making of another copy of the program,if the copy is created as an essential step in the utilization of the computer program in connection with the computer,and is used in no other manner.id.the essential step defense also ensures that a software user does not infringe when the user copies the software from the computer permanent storage the hard drive,for example onto its active memory the random access memory,for example.section also allows the owner to make a copy of the computer program if the copy is for archival purposes only and all archival copies are destroyed in the event that continued possession of the computer program should cease to be rightful.id.
section,by its own terms,applies only to the owner of a copy of the computer program.emphasis added.in the leading case on ownership under,we considered an agreement in which mai,the owner of a software copyright,transferred copies of the copyrighted software to peak under an agreement that imposed severe restrictions on peak rights with respect to those copies.see mai.peak computer,cir.we held that peak was a licensee and not an owner of the copies of the software for purposes of and consequently did not enjoy the rights conferred on owners under that statute.see id.at.thus,under mai,if a software developer retains ownership of every copy of software,and merely licenses the use of those copies,does not apply.
here,we conclude that the sheriff department received licenses to the rumba software.generally,if the copyright owner makes it clear that she or he is granting only a license to the copy of software and imposes significant restrictions on the purchaser ability to redistribute or transfer that copy,the purchaser is considered a licensee,not an owner,of the software.in this case,as in mai,the licensing agreement imposed severe restrictions on the sheriff department rights with respect to the software.such restrictions would not be imposed on a party who owned the software.the sheriff department use of and rights to the rumba software produ
