the trial court erred in refusing to award litigation costs to a litigant the vons companies,that prevailed on two causes of action assigned to it by the original plaintiff mock ranch,in a settlement of mock complaint against vons.the trial court did not err,however,in denying vons motion for attorney fees under civil code section,because the warranty on which vons claims were based contained no attorney fee provision.
factual and procedural background 
vons and lyle parks,were parties to a construction contract executed in july.lyle parks was the contractor responsible for constructing improvements a shopping center on certain real property owned by vons.in the construction contract,lyle parks warranted the work against defects,agreeing that if,within one year after completion of the contract,any of the work or materials were found to be defective,lyle parks would repair or replace the defective work or materials and all resulting damage.the construction contract contained an attorney fee clause stating that 
if either party files a suit against the other which is in any way connected with this contract,including without limitation any suit based on an alleged tort,the unsuccessful party shall pay to the prevailing party a reasonable sum for attorneys fees,which shall be deemed to have accrued on the commencement of such action and shall be enforceable whether or not such action is prosecuted to judgment.
when the work was completed,lyle parks issued a separate warranty dated october,guaranteeing that the work which had been furnished and installed at the project had been done in accordance with the architect specifications and that the work as installed would fulfill the requirements of the warranty.the warranty stated that lyle parks agreed to repair or replace any or all of its work that might prove defective in workmanship or material within a period of one year and that if it failed to do so,the owner was authorized to have the defects repaired at lyle parks expense.the october,warranty contained no attorney fee clause.
in may,vons sold the shopping center to mock ranch.pursuant to the sale agreement,vons assigned to mock all of its right,title and interest in the general contractor warranty dated october.vons did not assign the construction contract to mock.in that part of the sale agreement that listed what contracts were the subject of the assignment,the sale agreement recited none.
in may,mock sued vons and lyle parks.as to vons,mock lawsuit alleged causes of action for fraud,concealment,negligent misrepresentation,breach of contract,rescission and unfair competition.mock claimed that vons failed to disclose water leaks and water penetration failed to disclose the refusal by tenants of the property to return estoppel certificates provided false and misleading financial statements for operation of the property failing to disclose actual amounts of common area maintenance fees billed back to the tenants and unilaterally recorded use restrictions that were contrary to the sale agreement.
as to lyle parks,mock alleged causes of action for negligence and breach of warranty,asserting that lyle parks workmanship resulted in water leaks and water penetrations causing structural damage,mold and other damage to the property.mock prayer for relief sought attorney fees,including on its two causes of action against lyle parks.lyle parks answer to mock complaint also included a prayer for attorney fees 
on august,a month or so before trial,vons filed a for indemnity against lyle parks.in that,vons sought indemnification i f any judgment should be rendered in favor of mock herein and against vons as a result of mock alleged damages lyle parks answered and then filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the,pointing out that mock claims against vons were based on fraud,and contending vons could not be indemnified for its own willful misconduct and sole negligence.
on september,a few days before trial began,all of mock claims against vons were settled.the terms of the settlement were not disclosed to the court or to lyle parks,but mock and vons notified the court that,as part of the settlement agreement,mock causes of action against lyle parks for negligence and breach of warranty were assigned to vons.on october,mock filed an application to substitute vons in place of mock as plaintiff on the negligence and breach of warranty causes of action,stating that the application was based on mock assignment to vons of all of mock interest in these pending claims and causes of action against lyle parks.the trial court granted mock application by written order,approved as to form by counsel for lyle parks,filed the same day.
on october,trial began on the negligence and breach of warranty claims against lyle parks,with vons seeking over million in damages.to avoid confusion,the parties agreed to the court suggestion to denominate the case vons versus lyle parks in front of the jury.before opening arguments,lyle parks moved to strike vons for indemnification as moot.the trial court granted the motion,observing s ince it has been settled,there is no potential for the finding of liability as between vons and mock.it renders,frankly,a nullity the for indemnification,and accordingly,the motion will be granted.after a recess,counsel for vons asked that the motion to strike vons be granted with leave to amend,and the court told the parties to brief that issue.
after four days of trial,the jury began deliberations.after the case was given to the jury,vons offered authorities in support of the proposition that the court could grant a motion to strike a pleading its for indemnification with leave to amend.because the jury had by then reached a verdict,the court said that it would take the verdict,and then to the extent that one side or the other feels that they need to bring on some motions,whether it for leave to amend the or to oppose such a motion,you can do that in the context of briefing.counsel for both sides agreed to that procedure,but vons never filed a motion to amend the.
the jury found in favor of vons and against lyle parks on the claims for breach of express warranty and negligence and awarded vons damages of.judgment on the jury verdict was entered on march.
the memorandum of costs.
on march,vons filed a memorandum of costs,seeking costs of of which was for deposition costs.lyle parks moved to strike or tax costs,pointing out that vons was the prevailing party only as to mock two claims against lyle parks vons was not the prevailing party in its defense against mock claims and mock was not the prevailing party as to its claims against vons,all of which had been settled,and vons was not the prevailing party on its against lyle parks which had been stricken.consequently,lyle parks argued,vons could only recover costs associated with its prosecution in place of mock of mock two causes of action against lyle parks.thus,for example,costs for depositions taken by mock of vons agents and employees did not relate to mock construction defect claims against lyle parks depositions taken by vons in its defense of mock claims were outside the scope of any claims mock had against lyle parks and no costs incurred by vons prior to stepping into mock shoes could be considered reasonably necessary to mock prosecution against lyle parks.lyle parks also identified filing fees that were completely unrelated to mock action against lyle parks filing fees for vons answer to mock complaint,vons for indemnity,and vons notice of settlement with mock,allegedly inexplicable or indecipherable deposition costs,other highly questionable and not reasonable costs,and allegedly unreasonable and unnecessary travel costs.lyle parks requested the court either to strike vons memorandum of costs in its entirety,or to disallow of the being sought.
vons opposed lyle parks motion to tax costs,asserting it was entitled to recover mock costs as its assignee,and was also entitled to recover its own costs in full through the cost memorandum at issue here or through an amended.as to the latter claim,vons reasoned that it would not have been forced to defend against allegations that it concealed defects at the property if the property had no defects,and lyle parks was and remains obligated to indemnify vons against any and all claims arising in connection with the construction contract according to vons,the trial court did not rule on whether its was stricken with or without leave to amend,and vons may therefore recover its costs.any other result would give lyle parks an unwarranted windfall in that amount of costs claimed here among other things in spite of its duty to hold vons harmless for them.
vons also argued that all the deposition costs it claimed were necessary and reasonable,because e ach deponent gave testimony relating to the ownership,water intrusion,damage and repairs at the pertinent to lyle parks negligence and the resulting damages.a declaration from vons counsel described the various depositions,attached hundreds of pages of deposition transcripts,and reviewed and described invoices for transcripts and reporting services and travel for depositions.vons also submitted a declaration from mock counsel stating that,in his judgment,in deposition expenses incurred by mock was reasonably necessary to the prosecution of the claims against lyle parks,and identifying of transcript expenses that would not have been incurred if mock had pursued claims only against lyle parks.vons indicated it would submit an amended memorandum of costs which includes all reasonable costs incurred by mock,but vons did not do so.vons also responded to lyle parks assertions that certain costs were inexplicable,that others were questionable and unreasonable,and that travel costs were unnecessary.
lyle parks reply countered that vons claim for costs was based on the assignment to vons of mock rights pursuant to a settlement,but vons refused to provide the settlement agreement,so its entire claim for costs was based on inadmissible hearsay and lacked foundation.lyle parks also argued that the only costs that could possibly be awarded were those reasonably necessary for the prosecution of the claims on which vons prevailed mock claims against lyle parks.lyle parks addressed those costs it contended could not be considered either reasonably necessary or reasonable in amount.
at the hearing on may,the trial court stated that vons cost memorandum was not in the court file,and therefore,that the court was not prepared to hear argument today.the court indicated that vons could lodge the memorandum,and then i take the matter under submission and issue a ruling down the road.vons refiled its memorandum of costs later that day.
a week later,the trial court issued its order granting lyle parks motion to strike and tax costs.the court observed that the memorandum of costs does not specify which of the costs listed therein are attributable to the only action as to which vons as substitute plaintiff trial of mock action against lyle parks.the court continued 
tellingly,vons opposition to the motion to tax costs argues that all costs incurred by vons in this litigation are recoverable,including costs incurred in vons prosecution of its dismissed and costs incurred by vons in defending itself against mock claim before it was settled.moreover,vons also seeks to recover mock costs,despite the fact that mock settled prior to trial.but other than to argue that vons was not summarily deprived of its right to recover litigation costs,vons provides no persuasive authority for its creative arguments here.
the court also stated that there was no factual support for the claim that vons is mock assignee.the court observed that it is not unheard of for a settling party to waive its right to collect costs,and the issue becomes more complicated because the trial court is entitled to consider whether the costs incurred were as a result of the actions or tactics of one party as opposed to another,citing nelson anderson th,d.the court concluded that,based upon vons cursory memorandum of costs,this court is unable to determine which party incurred what costs as the result of which other party actions.
vons motion for attorney fees.
on the same day it filed its cost memorandum march,vons also filed a motion for attorney fees in the amount of,asserting that the fees were authorized by the contract at issue in this case and that vons was the prevailing party.its support for the motion consisted of a declaration from its counsel,suzanne rischman.rischman identified the attorneys from her firm who worked on the case,the hourly rates and number of hours spent,all of which totaled.she also stated she had spoken with counsel for mock,and was informed and believe d that the attorneys fees and costs for mock in this matter totals.
lyle parks opposed vons motion for attorney fees,pointing out that vons itself as opposed to vons as assignee of mock claims against lyle parks was not the prevailing party as to any of the litigation,and any fees to which vons could possibly be entitled are limited solely to those incurred in mock prosecution against lyle.because there was never any contract between mock and lyle,there was no attorney fee provision upon which to award fees.lyle parks also pointed out that vons claim for over million in fees incurred by mock was supported only by the declaration of vons counsel,which was inadmissible hearsay,and vons made no attempt to distinguish fees earned on the only issue for which vons obtained a favorable result.
in reply to lyle parks opposition,vons insisted it was entitled to its own attorney fees,because the construction contract between lyle park and vons required lyle parks to compensate vons for all of its liabilities and expenses flowing from lyle parks negligence,and t his litigation flows substantially from lyle parks negligence as with its cost memorandum,vons claimed that its fees must be awarded in full or at least vons must be permitted to pursue them through an amended as earlier requested.further,vons claimed it was entitled to attorney fees incurred by mock as its assignee,up to and through the date mock and vons settled,as n othing in the warranty assignment from vons to mock,or from mock back to vons,worked to separate the warranty from the companion right to attorneys fees for its enforcement.vons supported its reply with time records and declarations about the reasonableness of the rates charged,and revised its request downward,seeking attorney fees of for its own fees,and in fees incurred by mock.vons included a declaration from mock counsel stating that mock total attorney fees were,and,based on his review of time records,of mock attorney fees or would not have been incurred if we had only pursued claims against lyle parks in this action.
the trial court denied vons motion for attorney fees,observing vons did not assign the construction contract to mock,but only assigned a warranty that did not contain an attorney fee provision.so,when vons stepped into mock shoes and sued lyle on mock two causes of action that prevailed to the tune of about,there was no attorney fees provision for vons then to rely on lyle.
vons filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
vons challenges the trial court orders denying costs and attorney fees.we conclude that the trial court was required by statute to award to vons those costs that were reasonably necessary to the prosecution of mock claims against lyle parks,and there was no error in the trial court order denying attorney fees.
the trial court erred in granting lyle parks motion to strike vons memorandum of costs.
on appeal,vons no longer claims it is entitled to all of its own costs,as it contended in the trial court.instead,it argues the trial court should have awarded the full requested,because vons had understated the amount to which it was entitled for the prosecution of the mock complaint alone.vons complains that the court did not hear oral argument on costs,and if vons had known the court,that vons was only entitled to costs attributable to the trial of mock action against lyle could have explained that the amount of costs necessarily incurred in mock prosecution of the complaint as against parks were both provided in the record and unrefuted by parks.thus,vons reasons,its opposi
