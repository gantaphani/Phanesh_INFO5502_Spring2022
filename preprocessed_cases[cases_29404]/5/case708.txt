this is quite a case.soon after archie robinson was shot by a city of harvey police officer who said he acted in because robinson was pointing a gun at him,rumors began to circulate that the officer story was a lie.the truth,according to the rumors,was that robinson was unarmed and that a gun,alleged to be his and found at the scene,was planted by police to cover up an unjustified shooting.whether the rumors were true or not was the subject of two civil jury trials and,inferentially at least,one criminal trial,with the bottom line being that robinson was framed.so what we have here is a rather explosive case.but we must put its interesting questions off to the side and perhaps they will stay there for the time being,because the primary issue we must first address is a yawner appellate jurisdiction.nevertheless,to put the dispute in context,we briefly recount a few of the facts there are many more facts about which we will say nothing that emerged from the lengthy litigation that grew out of robinson shooting.
juries and judges often hear two sides of the same story.and so it is here.we start with the version advanced by the city of harvey.
manuel escalante,a city of harvey police officer,was working with a gang and narcotics unit on september.two other officers,white and williams,were with him.after arriving near the intersection of and vail streets in harvey,the officers separated,and a moment or two later escalante saw two men robinson and anthony reynolds running through a pathway between two buildings in the area of a fence.escalante says he engaged reynolds in a scuffle and that robinson,who had been ordered to stop running,failed to do so and instead joined the scuffle by jumping on top of him.robinson,after being pushed away,started to scale the fence and,while doing so,pulled out a handgun and pointed it at escalante face.escalante ordered robinson to drop the gun but he did comply.escalante then fired one shot,in,which struck robinson in the back buttocks area.order was restored a short time after robinson was hit.
according to robinson,escalante claim is a pack of lies.robinson says he and reynolds were talking when they saw someone running towards them.they tried to flee.when they got to the fence,with escalante in pursuit,reynolds went over and robinson got near the top.at that moment,escalante shot him.robinson said he did have a gun,never had any physical contact with escalante,and no warning preceded the shot.
so,who is to be believed major cracks in escalante version of the event soon appeared.williams,one of the officers with escalante,told another officer jelenewski that the robinson shooting was bogus.he said he never saw robinson with a gun,saw none on the ground soon after the shooting,and did hear escalante tell robinson to drop the gun.
and then there the gun.the night before the shooting,escalante,williams,jelenewski,and another officer,edison torres,participated in a raid in which a police report indicated that five guns were seized,though only four were accounted for at the police station and only three were eventually logged into evidence.what happened to the guns that were not accounted for williams said that he saw torres approach escalante inside the secured area of the robinson shooting and that torres later showed him that there was a gun on the ground.torres denied showing williams the gun,though the city answers to interrogatories identify him as the person who found it.finally,the gun recovered at the scene was a cheap model with a broken grip handle.it carried no usable fingerprints.it was the perfect candidate,according to harvey own police chief robinson says this occurred in a moment of uncommon candor to be used as a drop gun or a throwaway gun.
robinson was eventually charged with carrying a gun without the requisite paperwork.the prosecution introduced a gun into evidence but offered no witnesses to testify about its recovery,and robinson was acquitted after a bench trial.he then sued escalante and the city of harvey,invoking illinois common law and to allege malicious prosecution by escalante and a violation of his constitutional right to not be the victim of excessive force.
a jury found for robinson on the malicious prosecution claim but rejected his excessive force claim.robinson moved for a new trial,pointing out that the jury malicious prosecution verdict required concluding that there was no probable cause to believe he had a gun,making it impossible to also find that escalante use of deadly force was reasonable under the circumstances.the district court agreed that the verdicts were fatally inconsistent,and on february,a new trial was ordered.the new jury found for robinson on both counts,and he was awarded in compensatory and punitive damages.he later petitioned for attorneys fees under.when a new district court judge assigned to the case awarded approximately in fees,robinson moved for reconsideration,and on october,the judge reversed his decision and awarded some.harvey now appeals both the district court grant of a new trial and the fee award.
it goes without saying that a timely notice of appeal is essential to appellate jurisdiction,barrow falck,cir.a party is generally required to file a notice of appeal with the district court within days after the order appealed from is entered,see fed.a a,although that time may be extended to a limited degree if a party moves for more time within days after the original time period has situation not presented here.see fed.a.harvey filed its appeal on november,escalante has settled his part of the case,clearly giving us jurisdiction to consider the fee award.but as we shall see,we do not have jurisdiction to review the february,trial order.
because the february order granting the new trial was not appealable as a final order within the meaning of,juneau square first.bank of milwaukee,cir,harvey appeal on that issue is really an appeal of the july,judgment entered following the second trial.absent a valid extension,harvey therefore had until august,to file a timely notice of deadline two years before the november filing we now consider.
the city maintains that its time for appeal was validly extended under federal rule of appellate procedure frap rule a a,which enumerates six categories of motions that when filed extend the appeal deadline until their resolution.harvey first directs us to rule a a iii,which describes what the second circuit has called a rule order,mendes junior int l banco do brasil,cir,a term we will use here.as explained by rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure the civil rules 
when a timely motion for attorney fees is made under rule d,the court may act before a notice of appeal has been filed and has become effective to order that the motion have the same effect under federal rule of appellate procedure a as a timely motion under rule.
the city argues that a december,minute order granting harvey motion to extend the time for appeal was a proper rule order that,in accordance with frap rule a,delayed the running of the time for appeal of the new trial order until robinson fee motion was finally resolved on october.
but there are several flaws in this argument.first,the plain language of rule c only authorizes the court to make a rule order w hen a timely motion for attorney fees is made.at the time of the december order,robinson had not yet made his fee motion he did not do so until august,meaning that the district court lacked the authority to enter the order insofar as it dealt with extending the time to appeal in the first place.mendes,at.
second,the december rule order was entered long after the august deadline.harvey suggests that this is not a problem because the district court local rule b extends to days the rule d b default rule providing a time period after judgment is entered to file a fee petition.but that argument ignores both that local rule c expressly provides that t he filing of a fee motion shall not stop the running of the time for appeal of any judgment on which the motion is founded,and that civil rule c makes clear that the time for appeal can not be extended in anticipation of a fee petition.more
