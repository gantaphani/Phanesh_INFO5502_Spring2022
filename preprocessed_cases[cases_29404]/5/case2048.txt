erickson appeal 
erickson contends the trial court erred to the extent it awarded attorney fees incurred in its defense against the noncontractual claims of erickson direct action during the first phase of trial.asserting those bifurcated noncontractual claims were tried separately and independently from the contractual claims of the assigned,erickson contends an award of contractual attorney fees under section attributable to trying the direct action was beyond the court authority.erickson concludes should be limited to a attorney fee award,a sum characterized by erickson as the amount of fees incurred after excluding fees attributable to the trial of tort claims and elsewhere mischaracterized by erickson as the amount of fees incurred while the tort and contract claims were jointly litigated.further,erickson contends the document by which he claimed the assignment of ylr specifically relieved erickson from facing attorney fee obligations if he did not succeed at trial.however,erickson contentions are without merit.
amount of fee award in december judgment was proper 
motion for attorney fees and defense costs was based on the grounds that brehm and ylr against for express contractual indemnity and breach of contract based upon written subcontract agreements those subcontract agreements contained attorney fee clauses that were made reciprocal as a matter of law under section the assignee were the assignees of the causes of action against,and they expressly assumed liability for an attorney fee award if they did not prevail against on the judgment was entered favoring against the assignee on the was the prevailing party within the meaning of section and in defending itself,incurred attorney fees and costs of more than.
in granting motion for attorney fees,the trial court stated under the december judgment,was the prevailing party and thus entitled to attorney fees based on the subcontracts assigned to erickson by brehm and ylr code civ,subd.a each subcontract contained an attorney fee clause that provided the prevailing party would be awarded attorney fees in any action on the subcontract although erickson was not a party to those subcontracts,he was obligated on the subcontractual attorney fee provisions as the assignee of brehm and ylr and although the language of the two assignments differed slightly,each assigned the rights and obligations of the subcontract attorney fee provisions.
in concluding was entitled to recover attorney fees and costs in the amount of from the assignee,the trial court stated after the assigned for indemnity were bifurcated,the direct action proceeded because the subcontracts at issue under the authorized recovery of attorney fees,the question was whether was entitled to fees for its defense against both the and erickson direct action the issues in the defense against the direct action were identical to the issues in defending the before trial,the court had ruled the subcontracts indemnity provisions required that erickson demonstrate negligence in order to trigger the indemnity obligations heppler peters th,d heppler the direct action for negligence against added to erickson complaint after the settlement did not significantly alter defense of the action from perspective if erickson had not added that direct action and had instead proceeded only on the assigned,the trial would have included testimony about negligence without the procedural bifurcation,the court could not have apportioned attorney fees incurred in defense of the direct action from those incurred only in defending against the attorney lucas declaration acknowledged that attorney fees incurred only in defense of the direct action had been deducted and even assuming that other attorney fees were incurred in defending against the direct action,additional apportionment was not required because any such fees were incurred for representation on issues common to the claims in erickson direct causes action and the claims in the assigned reynolds metals alperson cal d,reynolds.
in attacking the amount of attorney fees awarded to,erickson contends the trial court should have determined the direct action was not a contract action,was not joined with contractual claims,and did not require factual findings identical to those on the contractual claims.however,the court properly awarded attorney fees on issues common to erickson complaint and the assigned.apportionment of a fee award between fees incurred on a contract cause of action and those incurred on other causes of action is within the trial court discretion abdallah united savings bank th,d abdallah accord,san dieguito partnership san dieguito river valley regional.authority th,d san dieguito a trial court exercise of discretion is abused only when its ruling exceeds the bounds of reason,all of the circumstances before it being considered.where a cause of action based on the contract providing for attorney fees is joined with other causes of action beyond the contract,the prevailing party may recover attorney fees under section only as they relate to the contract action.reynolds,supra,cal d at,cited in abdallah,at,d see mckenzie d.the only reasonable interpretation of section is that it reciprocates the allowance of attorney fees only when such fees are incurred to enforce the provisions of the contract.however,a ttorney fees need not be apportioned when incurred for representation on an issue common to both a cause of action in which fees are proper and one in which they are not allowed.abdallah,at,d,citing reynolds,at,accord,san dieguito,at,d.a litigant may not increase his recovery of attorney fees by joining a cause of action in which attorney fees are not recoverable to one in which an award is proper.reynolds,at.conversely,plaintiff joinder of causes of action should not dilute its right to attorney fees.reynolds,at.considering the common issues raised under erickson direct action and the assigned,the court did not abuse its discretion by awarding attorney fees incurred in litigating the direct action in the first phase of trial.reynolds,at,san dieguito,at,d abdallah,at,d.
