juvenile inmates at the south dakota state training school at plankinton sued as a class to improve conditions at the facility.the inmate class claimed that actions of the school deprived them of their constitutional rights under both the first and fourteenth amendments to the constitution and that the procedures used violated the individuals with disabilities education act.at issue,among other things,were the restraint methods used by the institution employees,the lengthy confinements to which inmates were subjected,the provision or lack thereof of mental health services,the training of staff,the arbitrary method of discipline and punishment,the presence of male staff members in the female shower area,the monitoring of telephone calls and visits,and the lack of special education courses for inmates who need additional educational assistance.
the parties notified the court that they were conducting settlement negotiations and later presented a settlement agreement for approval.christina bloomberg,slip op.at.after conducting a fairness hearing pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure e,the court approved the settlement agreement and dismissed the action without prejudice pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a,retaining jurisdiction for the purpose of enforcing the settlement agreement.id.at.although the court explicitly determined that the agreement was fair,reasonable,and adequate,it incorporated none of the specific terms and conditions agreed upon by the parties in its opinion and order.id.
the class then sought an award of attorney fees and expenses,and the district court granted this request.the court held that the prison litigation reform act plra did not limit the amount of attorney fees the class could receive and that the class was entitled to a fully compensatory fee and expense award because the settlement agreement had a positive impact on conditions at the facility,making the class a prevailing party.the class was awarded in attorney fees and in costs and expenses,after the district court made appropriate reductions in the fee award the secretary of the south dakota department of corrections and the superintendent of the state training school appeal the district court award of fees and costs and expenses.for the reasons stated below,we reverse.
discussion 
prevailing party status 
w e review de novo the legal question of whether a litigant is a prevailing party.jenkins missouri,cir.section b of title of the united states code allows the court to award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.in this case,the issue of whether or not the inmate class is a prevailing party entitled to receive fees centers around a recent supreme court decision,buckhannon board care home,west virginia department of health and human resources,d.in buckhannon,the court held that the catalyst theory of prevailing party status is no longer valid.under the catalyst theory,a party prevails if the lawsuit brought forth voluntary change by the defendant.at.the catalyst theory is inappropriate for the award of attorney fees because i t allows an award where there is no judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties.id.at.the court determined that a legal change,rather than a voluntary change,in the relationship of the parties is required.id.a defendant voluntary change in conduct,although perhaps accomplishing what the plaintiff sought to achieve by the lawsuit,lacks the necessary judicial imprimatur on the change.id.
the supreme court specified that a judgment on the merits or a settlement agreement enforced through a consent decree is sufficient to meet this standard.id.at.in the present case,the debate is over the status of the settlement agreement and the court role in enforcing it.the court in buckhannon stated that p rivate settlements do not entail the judicial approval and oversight involved in consent decrees.id.at.if the agreement between the inmate class and the institution is a private settlement,then it is clear from buckhannon that the inmate class is not a prevailing party entitled to attorney fees under.
we begin with an analysis of the district court actions by way of ratification of the settlement agreement.rule e of the federal rules of civil procedure states that a class action shall not be dismissed or compromised without the approval of the court.e.in approving a class settlement,the district court must consider whether it is fair,reasonable,and adequate.van horn trickey,cir quoting grunin int l house of pancakes,cir.the district court review of the settlement agreement in this case essentially determined whether it was fair,reasonable,and adequate and was merely an exercise in compliance with rule e.this review fails to impose the necessary imprimatur on the agreement.
a class action settlement,like an agreement resolving any other legal claim,is a private contract negotiated between the parties.nevertheless,rule e requires the court to intrude on that private consensual agreement to ensure that the agreement is not the product of fraud or collusion and that,taken as a whole,it is fair,adequate,and reasonable to all concerned.
moore federal practice ed emphasis added.although rule e requires the district court to approve the class action agreement,it does not require the court to establish the terms of the agreement.therefore,the district court approval of the settlement agreement does not,by itself,create a consent decree,and the inmate class did not become a prevailing party under buckhannon by this action of the trial court.
the appellants concede that the settlement agreement in this case is something more than a private settlement agreement because the district court retained jurisdiction to enforce it.however,the district court enforcement jurisdiction alone is not enough to establish a judicial imprimatur on the settlement contract.the district court indicated that,although the settlement agreement was not a formal consent decree,to read buckhannon to require one particular form for resolving a dispute in order to become a prevailing party is to read the opinion too narrowly.christina bloomberg,d.the court went on to say that the settlement agreement served essentially the same purpose as a formal consent decree since it changed the legal relationship between the parties by requiring the appellants to make specific improvements to the training school and by allowing the appellees to enforce the agreement in court.id.at we disagree with this conclusion.
buckhannon,as indicated,makes it clear that a party prevails only if it receives either an enforceable judgment on the merits or a consent decree buckhannon,at.a private settlement agreement is not enough while a judge has the authority to enforce the terms of a consent decree,noncompliance with a consent decree is enforceable by citation for contempt of court.local,int l ass of firefighters city of cleveland,d this court has held that consent decrees are distinguishable from private settlements by the means of enforcement.c onsent decrees are enforceable through the supervising court exercise of its contempt powers,and private settlements are enforceable only through a new action for breach of contract.hazen ex rel.legear reagen,cir citing benjamin jacobson,cir.we are convinced that the court dismissal order of december,would not support a citation for contempt.as earlier noted,no specifically enumerated contract terms were incorporated into the court order.we think that either party,if aggrieved,could institute a breach of contract action and,perhaps,in the district court assuming,without deciding,the continuation of federal court jurisdiction for such a case.a voluntary dismissal without prejudice under rule a as here renders the proceedings a nullity and leaves the parties as if the action had never been brought.moore federal practice b ed.so,it is possible that the class could seek reinstatement of the dismissed action under the district court retained enforcement jurisdiction.but,the availability of either of these potential remedies fails to support the conclusion that the settlement agreement serves essentially as a consent decree.see g kokkonen guardian life,d.
prison litigation reform act 
abuse of discretion governs review of fee awards,however,questions of law are reviewed de novo.lane united states dep t of,cir citing jenkins missouri,cir.since our examination of the applicability of the plra is a question of law,we hold that the provisions of the act apply in this case.this statute,codified in part at d,places limits on the amount of attorney fees that a court may award a plaintiff prisoner.the provision at issue states the following 
i n any action brought by a prisoner who is confined to any jail,prison,or other correctional facility,in which attorney fees are authorized under section of this title,such fees shall not be awarded,except to the extent that the fee was directly and reasonably incurred in proving an actual violation of the plaintiff rights protected by a statute pursuant to which a fee may be awarded under section of this title.
d a emphasis added.
the district court held that the state training school did not fall within the definition of a jail,prison,or other correctional facility even though the juvenile inmate class members fall within the definition of prisoner in this provision.christina,d at.in reaching this determination,the court found that the definition of institution found in,a section that applies to section and the plra,was the appropriate definition to consider.id.section defines an institution to include a jail,prison,or other correctional facility and a facility for juveniles adjudicated delinquent or in need of supervision.b ii,iv iii.the district court reasoned that congress must have intended section to apply only to adult facilities because section explicitly refers to juvenile facilities and section does not.christina,d at.we disagree.the statutory construction used by the district court fails to take into account the plain language of the statute.although congress did not define the phrase jail,prison,or other correctional facility the plain meaning of the phrase undoubtedly encompasses juvenile detention facilities.alexander boyd,cir.
section g of title of the united states code,another provision of the plra,explicitly defines a prison as a facility that incarcerates or detains juveniles or adults.under this definition of a prison,the provision found in d would clearly encompass the state training school.in alexander,a case with facts similar to the present case,the fourth circuit determined that the definition of jail,prison,or other correctional facility covered the juvenile facility at issue in that case.at.the court stated that since g and d were enacted at the same time as part of the plra,the definitions of prison are the same,based on the cardinal rule of statutory construction that statutes which are originally part of the same act should be construed together.id.therefore,jail,prison,or other correctional facility in d encompasses juvenile facilities since g defines prisons to include juvenile facilities.id.at.
the district court rejected this reasoning because the sections of the plra were codified in various sections of the united states code.the problem with the panel opinion in alexander is its failure to take into account the structure of the plra.this structure makes it unsafe to assume that a term defined in one section of the plra necessarily has the same definition in another.christina,d at.we find this reasoning unpersuasive,and we agree with the fourth circuit that juvenile facilities are covered by the provisions of the plra.
because we have concluded that the juvenile inmate class is not entitled to attorney fees,we need not address whether the class was entitled to a fully compensatory award or whether the district court erred in not reducing the costs and expenses awarded for duplicative travel by class counsel.
ii.conclusion 
we reverse the district court award of attorney fees and costs and expenses,and we remand for entry of judgment consistent with this opinion.
i concur that the state training school qualifies as a correctional facility under the prison litigation reform act.however,i dissent from that portion of the majority opinion which holds the plaintiff class is not a prevailing party.district court approval of a settlement agreement and dismissal with explicit retention of jurisdiction for the purpose of enforcing the agreement serve as the functional equivalent of a consent decree.accordingly,i would hold the plaintiff class to be a prevailing party under the standard set forth buckhannon bd.care home,west virginia dep t of health human,d.this conclusion is based,in part,on an underlying determination that the district court enjoys explicitly retained enforcement jurisdiction under the standard set forth in kokkonen guardian life ins.of,d,and that this jurisdiction enables the district court to issue enforcement orders regarding the settlement agreement.see gilbert monsanto,cir affirming a district court ability to expressly retain jurisdiction and order the enforcement of a settlement agreement.
the majority reaches the opposite conclusion for two reasons.first,the majority adopts a reading of buckhannon that emphasizes the court use of the term consent decree and minimizes reliance on the court generally stated concerns of judicial approval,oversight,and enforcement jurisdiction.second,the majority fails to acknowledge that kokkonen expressly sanctioned the use of district court orders as vehicles to enforce settlement agreements in cases where the district courts explicitly retain jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreements.i address these issues in turn.
in buckhannon,the court rejected the catalyst theory of prevailing party status and held that for there to be a prevailing party,there must be a material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties.buckhannon,at.citing texas teachers ass garland indep.sch,d.the court further stated that this material alteration of the legal relationship must carry a judicial imprimatur or judicial sanction.id.at.we think,however,the catalyst theory falls on the other side of the line from these examples.it allows an award where there is no judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties.
as examples of the type of action that would convey the necessary judicial imprimatur or sanction,the court referred to settlement agreements enforced through consent decrees and judgments on the merits.id.at.as examples of the type of actions that would not convey the necessary imprimatur,the court referred to victories such as surviving a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction or for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted or receiving an interlocutory ruling that reverses a dismissal for failure to state a claim.id.at.citing hewitt helms,d and hanrahan hampton,d per curiam.the court rejected the argument that prevailing party status could exist where the successful result was obtained through a private settlement agreement.id.at and.
the facts of buckhannon provide the clearest example of the absence of a judicial imprimatur.in buckhannon,legislative action provided the plaintiff its desired relief and mooted the underlying legal claims.buckhannon,at.accordingly,the court faced a simple dismissal based on mootness following wholly relief.the court did not face a purely private settlement agreement,a settlement agreement with retained enforcement jurisdiction,or a consent decree.
the court in buckhannon did not limit the availability of prevailing party status to only those cases resolved through a consent decree or final judgment on the merits.id.at.rather,the court set forth criteria to guide the analysis of whether there is a judicially sanctioned,material change in the legal relationship of the parties.id.as noted above,one of these issues is on an interlocutory order or survival following a motion to dismiss are insufficient.the court also emphasized judicial approval,judicial oversight,and enforcement jurisdiction.id.at.in distinguishing a judicially sanctioned change from a change that is reflected merely in a private settlement agreement,the court stated 
private settlements do not entail
