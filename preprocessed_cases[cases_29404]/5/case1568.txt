the question presented by this case is whether one cocounsel may sue another for breach of fiduciary duty on the theory that the latter malpractice in handling their mutual client case reduced or eliminated the fees the former expected to realize from the case.there is a split of authority on this question.pollack lytle d.pollack recognized such a fiduciary duty,but joseph saunders,weissburg aronson th,d saunders rejected it as potentially inconsistent with counsel overriding duty to the client.like the court of appeal in the present case,we agree with saunders that it would be contrary to public policy to countenance actions based on the theory that cocounsel have a fiduciary duty to protect one another prospective interests in a contingency fee.
factual and procedural background 
in michael and robert stephens hired attorney daniel beck to represent them in a lawsuit against general motors,to recover for serious injuries the stephenses sustained when the pickup truck they were riding in rolled over and burst into flames.with the stephenses consent,beck associated texas attorney mcbee into the case,because mcbee had experience prosecuting what were known as gas tank cases against general motors.again with agreement of the clients,mcbee and beck associated attorney ronald wecht and his law firm,walkup,melodia,kelly escheverria collectively wecht,as local trial counsel.by separate written agreements,it was agreed that mcbee would advance all costs,and beck contingent fee would be split percent for mcbee and percent for beck.wecht was to receive percent of the contingent fee,to be shared pro rata from the shares of mcbee and beck.
despite attempts at pretrial settlement,no settlement was reached,and the case proceeded to jury trial in april.during the course of the trial,general motors offered to settle the case for million.on the night before closing arguments,the stephenses met with wecht and mcbee and told them they wanted to settle the case.mcbee was to contact general motors and discuss settlement,but never did so.in late june of,the jury returned a defense verdict.
in the months leading up to trial,the relationship between beck and the other attorneys,particularly mcbee,eroded.mcbee accused beck of undermining settlement negotiations,and beck accused mcbee of alienating him from his clients.by the time of trial beck was an observer,not a participant.
after trial,the stephenses brought a legal malpractice action against mcbee and wecht for failing to carry out their settlement instructions.in addition,they claimed that wecht was vicariously liable for mcbee misconduct based upon joint venture principles.the stephenses brought no action against beck.mcbee settled with the stephenses for a confidential sum.as a condition of settlement,beck was paid out of this sum,in exchange for a release of his claims against mcbee.thereafter,wecht admitted that mcbee was negligent in his handling of the stephenses case.although wecht denied that a joint venture existed,his malpractice insurance carrier,american equity insurance company american equity,paid million to settle the stephenses claims against wecht.
in december,beck filed a complaint against wecht for breach of fiduciary duty to recover the fee he would have received had mcbee and wecht followed the stephenses instructions and settled the case against general motors for million.in july,wecht filed a for indemnity,breach of fiduciary duty,comparative fault and breach of contract.thereafter,american equity intervened and sued beck in subrogation,seeking contribution from beck toward the settlement amount it paid on wecht behalf.each party successfully moved for summary judgment of the other claims.both parties timely appealed from the orders granting summary judgment,and the court of appeal consolidated the appeals for oral argument and decision.
in beck appeal case no,the court of appeal affirmed the trial court entry of summary judgment in favor of wecht.in american equity appeal case no,the court of appeal affirmed the trial court entry of judgment in favor of beck.we granted beck petition for review american equity did not petition for review.
ii.discussion 
as was mentioned,there is a split of authority with regard to the question whether one cocounsel may sue another for breach of fiduciary duty on the theory that the latter malpractice in handling their mutual client case reduced or eliminated the fees the former expected to realize from the case.pollack,supra,d,recognized such a fiduciary duty,while saunders,supra,th,d,rejected it as potentially inconsistent with counsel overriding duty to the client.
pollack recognizing fiduciary duty among cocounsel 
in pollack,supra,d,pollack sued lytle for breach of fiduciary duty,fraud,breach of contract,legal malpractice,and declaratory relief arising out of their joint representation of a client in a medical malpractice action.according to the allegations of the complaint,pollack filed the medical malpractice action,but,because of a malpractice crisis,found it extremely difficult to secure a neurosurgeon to testify on the client behalf.lytle initiated discussions with pollack in which he made the following false representations that he was a close personal friend of a neurosurgeon who would be willing to testify on behalf of the client,but who would only do so if lytle served as trial counsel that he was employed by a law firm specializing in medical malpractice cases and that he was experienced in the preparation and trial of such cases.on the basis of these false representations,pollack associated lytle as trial counsel and agreed that lytle would receive of pollack percent contingency fee.lytle thereafter falsely represented to pollack that in his deposition the neurosurgeon had testified that violations of standard professional practice by the treating physician and the hospital were the proximate cause of the client quadriplegia,whereas,in fact,the issue of proximate cause had not even been addressed in the neurosurgeon testimony.on the basis of this misrepresentation,among many others,pollack advised the client to reject a settlement offer.the jury returned a verdict in favor of the malpractice defendants,and lytle then induced the client to file a legal malpractice action against pollack.pollack,at.
the court of appeal concluded,over a strongly worded dissent,that lytle relationship to pollack as associate counsel was governed by agency principles,and that lytle had breached his fiduciary duty to pollack,entitling pollack to indemnification.pollack,supra,d at.although it acknowledged the growing body of law which holds,as a matter of public policy,that a successor attorney owes no duty to his predecessor citations id.at,the majority found the policy rationale of those cases inapplicable to cases involving associate or concurrent counsel.the roles of successor and associate attorneys are decidedly different.in the fulfillment of his duty of undivided loyalty to the client,a successor attorney must view the client situation as of the moment when he is engaged.hence public policy requires that he not be subjected to any possible conflict of interest which may deter him from determining the best interests of the client by the possibility that he may be held liable for his acts by his predecessor.citation.in contrast,an associate attorney acting as the agent of the principal attorney replaces no one,but acts at the behest of his principal.admittedly,he remains bound to act in the best interests of the client,but this creates no unavoidable conflict.should he find that the principal attorney actions to date pose a potential danger to the client best interests,the is dutybound to make the fullest disclosure of these material facts to the principal attorney.since the principal attorney and the associate attorney each owes the same duty of loyalty to the client,the disclosure of information which reveals a potential danger to the client interests will normally prompt the principal attorney to act in protection of those interests.however,should the principal attorney choose to ignore the client interests,the remains free to terminate the agency
