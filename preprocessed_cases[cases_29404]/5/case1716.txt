in the underlying action,real parties in interest sought to recover civil penalties from petitioner home depot,home depot under the labor code private attorneys general act of paga,et the trial court overruled home depot demurrer to the first amended complaint,which contains a claim under paga based on home depot alleged failure to provide seating to its employees pursuant to section and wage order,tit.home depot challenges this ruling by petition for writ of mandate or other relief.we conclude that the complaint states a claim under paga,and thus deny the petition on its merits.
relevant factual procedural background 
on september,real parties in interest devon harris and lawrence winston filed their first amended complaint,which asserts a single claim under paga on behalf of themselves and former and current employees of home depot.the complaint alleges that home depot operates stores across the nation that sell home improvement products and hardware,including more than stores in california.according to the complaint,although the cashier and counter areas within the california stores contain ample space for seats for employees,home depot has not provided such seats,in contravention of section and wage order of the california industrial welfare commission iwc.real parties in interest sought civil penalties under paga,as specified in section,subdivision f,as well as reasonable attorney fees and costs,subd.g.
home depot demurred to the first amended complaint,asserting that section,subdivision f,provides no remedies for the alleged violations of section and wage order.after the trial court overruled the demurrer,home depot filed its petition for writ of mandate,prohibition,or other appropriate relief.we issued our order to show cause and temporary stay on july.

home depot contends that the trial court erred in overruling its demurrer.as explained below,we disagree.

statutory background 
we begin by examining the applicable statutes and wage order.under the labor code,the labor and workforce development agency lwda and its constituent departments and divisions are authorized to collect civil penalties for specified labor law violations by employers.caliber bodyworks,superior court th.to enhance the enforcement of the labor laws,the legislature enacted paga in.ibid.in so doing,the legislature stated adequate financing of essential labor law enforcement functions is necessary to achieve maximum compliance with state labor laws staffing levels for state labor laws enforcement agencies have,in general,declined over the last decade it is therefore in the public interest to provide that civil penalties for violations of the labor code may also be assessed and collected by aggrieved employees acting as private attorneys general stats,ch.
the central provision of paga is section.subdivision a of the statute permits aggrieved employees to recover civil penalties that previously could be collected only by lwda.dunlap superior court th.in addition,to address violations for which no such penalty had been established,subdivision f of the statute created a default penalty and a private right of action for aggrieved employees.caliber bodyworks,superior court,supra,th at.section exempts violations of certain labor code provisions from its scope,including provisions requiring employers to post specified notices,subds.f,m.in general the civil penalties recovered by aggrieved employees are distributed percent to the lwda for enforcement of labor laws and education of employers and employees about their rights and responsibilities under the labor code and percent to the aggrieved employees,subd.i.caliber bodyworks,superior court,at,fn.
our focus is on subdivision f of section,which provides in pertinent part for all provisions of this code except those for which a civil penalty is specifically provided,there is established a civil penalty for a violation of these provisions,as follows if,at the time of the alleged violation,the person employs one or more employees,the civil penalty is one hundred dollars for each aggrieved employee per pay period for the initial violation and two hundred dollars for each aggrieved employee per pay period for each subsequent violation.
the key issues concern whether the default remedy provided in section,subdivision f,encompasses violations of section and wage order,insofar as they require employers to supply adequate seating to workers.section is an element of the statutory framework related to the iwc,which issued the wage order.in,the legislature created the iwc,which was authorized to regulate the wages,hours,and working conditions of various classes of workers to protect their health and welfare.industrial welfare com.superior court cal d.to this end,the iwc promulgated wage orders,which prescribe minimum requirements with respect to wages,hours,and working conditions for workers in a number of industries and occupations.industrial welfare com.superior court,at.although the legislature defunded the iwc in,its orders remain in effect.murphy kenneth cole productions,cal th,fn.
the legislature has established remedies for wage order violations,including criminal penalties.in,the legislature enacted sections and,which provide,respectively,that certain violations are unlawful and are subject to criminal penalties.stats,ch.for purposes of our inquiry,the current versions of these statutes are materially similar to the provisions.section provides the maximum hours of work and the standard conditions of labor fixed by the commission shall be the maximum hours of work and the standard conditions of labor for employees.the employment of any employee for longer hours than those fixed by the order or under conditions of labor prohibited by the order is unlawful.subdivision a of section states that it is a misdemeanor for employers and their agents to require employees to work for longer hours than those fixed,or under conditions of labor prohibited by an order of the commission.
wage order,which is applicable to the mercantile industry,contains provisions regulating working hours,minimum wages,and other matters,including seating,tit.section of the wage order states a all working employees shall be provided with suitable seats when the nature of the work reasonably permits the use of seats.b when employees are not engaged in the active duties of their employment and the nature of the work requires standing,an adequate number of suitable seats shall be placed in reasonable proximity to the work area and employees shall be permitted to use such seats when it does not interfere with the performance of their duties.
on november,while home depot petition was pending before us,division five of this district held that the default remedy stated in section,subdivision f,encompasses violations of section based on the seating requirement in wage order.bright cents only stores th bright.we agree with this conclusion.subdivision f of section establishes civil penalties for violations of all provisions of the labor code except those for which a civil penalty is specifically provided.as we elaborate below,section meets this description an employer failure to provide seating under wage order is unlawful under section,but no civil penalty for such conduct is specifically provided in section or elsewhere.accordingly,violations of this type are subject to the default remedy stated in section,subdivision f.
home depot maintains that the default remedy is inapplicable to the alleged seating requirement violations for two principal reasons.home depot first argues that the alleged violations,if they occurred,did not contravene section in addition,home depot argues that the alleged violations fall outside the scope of the default remedy because wage order provides a civil penalty for them.for the reasons explained below,we reject these contentions.
the alleged violations contravene section 
home depot contends that an employer failure to comply with the seating requirement in wage order is not unlawful under section because the seating requirement is expressed in than.the crux of home depot argument is that because the wage order mandates that employees shall be provided suitable seating,rather that expressly prohibiting failure to provide such seating,the failure to provide suitable seating is not unlawful under section.as have other courts,we reject this argument.
the argument central flaw is that it demotes mandatory labor conditions in wage orders to simple recommendations or advice when the conditions are stated in affirmative terms.aside from the seating requirement,wage order contains mandates of this type concerning uniforms,changing rooms,and work area temperatures.indeed,the wage order ordinarily expresses labor conditions in affirmative language,although it contains some notable exceptions,including a prohibition barring employers from directing employees to share beds in lodging employees shall not be required to share a bed,tit,b.
under home depot proposed interpretation of section,no labor condition expressed in affirmative terms operates as a prohibition only conditions stated in prohibitory example,the bar conduct,even though the conditions using affirmative language may concern matters of greater or equivalent significance.as explained in bright,this interpretation is not in keeping with the remedial purpose of section,as it renders the affirmative mandates mere suggestions.bright,supra,th at see also kilby cvs,cab.lexis,to interpret the wage orders as not prohibiting,and therefore allowing,any work condition unless the provision is phrased in the negative,using the word not,would be contrary to common sense.indeed,our supreme court has long recognized that the term shall,by its common meaning,can be used to express mandates prohibitory of any action conflicting with them.oakland paving hilton cal.
the term prohibited,as used in section,can not be examined in isolation,but must be interpreted in context,with an eye to the statutory scheme as a whole.lungren deukmejian cal d.furthermore,section must be interpreted in a manner that promotes the goals of the labor code.industrial welfare com.superior court,supra,cal d at.here,the phrase conditions of labor prohibited by the order,as found in section,is properly viewed in the context of section,subdivision a,which was enacted at the same time as section and contains the same phrase.due to the similarity in language,the legislature evident purpose in enacting section,subdivision a,was to create a remedy for the labor condition violations established as unlawful in section 
in our view,the phrase conditions of labor prohibited by the order,as found in sections and,manifests the legislature intent to limit liability to clear violations of iwc labor conditions,rather than to impose liability only when the labor conditions are expressed in prohibitory terms.generally,c ivil as well as criminal statutes must be sufficiently clear as to give a fair warning of the conduct prohibited,and they must provide a standard or guide against which conduct can be uniformly judged by courts and administrative agencies.morrison state board of education cal d.here,the legislature use of the phrase conditions of labor prohibited by the order is traceable to the fact that the iwc wage orders often set only minimum labor standards.industrial welfare com.superior court,supra,cal d at.when the standards are minima,employers may properly adopt practices that exceed them.see id.at noting that historically,employers complied with iwc workplace safety standards by meeting more rigorous standards set under occupational safety and health act,et.to avert inferences that such practices might subject employers to liability,the legislature appears to have adopted the phrase conditions of labor prohibited by the order,thereby establishing that liability attaches only for conduct below the minimal standards.
home depot proposed interpretation of the phrase conditions of labor prohibited must be rejected,as the limit it imposes on the remedies stated in section,subdivision a would frustrate the operation of the statutory scheme.in authorizing the iwc to establish standard labor conditions,the legislature did not oblige the iwc to give special attention to conditions framed in prohibitory terms.see specifying iwc procedures for issuing wage orders.accordingly,under home depot proposal,the remedies available under section,subdivision a,would be tied to a happenstance,namely,whether the iwc statement of a standard labor condition contains prohibitory language.the legislature can not have intended such an arbitrary result.county of orange bezaire th,as between two alternative interpretations of language,courts prefer the interpretation which is the more natural and logical.
home depot suggests that the legislature,in enacting section,effectively directed the iwc to express a labor condition in prohibitory terms if the iwc intended its violation to be unlawful.this contention fails,as it places an untenable construction on sections and,subdivision a.when the legislature enacted the provisions in,the sole mechanism it created for the enforcement of the iwc standard labor conditions was the imposition of criminal penalties,as established in section,subdivision a.see stats,ch.accordingly,on home depot proposed interpretation,the legislature authorized the iwc to propound standard labor conditions that could not be enforced,namely,those stated in affirmative terms.
home depot also maintains that the seating requirement in wage order can not function as a prohibition because it imposes an affirmative standard of reasonable conduct.however,for purposes of imposing liability,a statute can achieve the requisite clarity regarding the conduct prohibited morrison state board of education,supra,cal d at even when the statute obliges people to adhere to a reasonable standard of conduct.as our supreme court has stated the law is replete with instances in which a person must,at his peril,govern his conduct by such nonmathematical standards as reasonable,prudent,necessary and proper,substantial,and the like.indeed,a wide spectrum of human activities is regulated by such terms.people daniels cal d.
