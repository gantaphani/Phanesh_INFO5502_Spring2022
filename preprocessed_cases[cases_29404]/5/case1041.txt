this case arises out of the failed prosecution of mark capener for health care fraud in violation of,mail fraud in violation of and making false statements in violation of.during the period relevant to this case,capener was an otorhinolaryngologist in nevada.the charges against him involved billing for surgeries that were allegedly either unnecessary,never performed or exaggerated for billing purposes upcoded.after an extended investigation and a lengthy trial,the district court dismissed many of the counts against capener on the ground that they were insufficiently supported by the evidence and the jury acquitted capener of the remaining counts.
following the trial,capener moved for an award of fees to cover his defense costs under the hyde amendment,note,which allows an award of fees to a defendant when the prosecution acted in a manner that was vexatious,frivolous,or in bad faith id.the district court partially granted capener motion,awarding fees to cover the costs of defending against certain counts associated with one of the theories advanced by the government on the ground that this theory was frivolous.
both parties appeal the district court decision.the government argues that the district court erred by granting fees after considering the government case than viewing the case alleged faults in the context of the case as a whole.the government also argues that,even viewed piecemeal,no part of government prosecution meets the hyde amendment standards for an award of fees.capener,arguing that the district court should have granted fees on the entire case.capener also argues that the district court should have granted him discovery regarding his hyde amendment claim.for the reasons stated below,the district court is reversed and capener application for fees is denied in its entirety.
background 
investigation and proceedings 
the investigation into capener medical practice began after insurance company referred him to the nevada attorney general,who,in turn,referred him to federal authorities.had contacted the attorney general office after investigation of capener insurance claims appeared to reveal a pattern of excessive procedures and suspicious claims.in the course of the investigation,the government consulted john dooley.dooley reviewed some patient records and computed tomography ct scans and indicated to the government that he believed that capener had billed for unnecessary and unperformed surgeries dooley also suggested that the government consult dale rice.rice reviewed capener patient files,pathology reports and ct scans and concluded that many of the surgeries that capener billed for were either unnecessary or were not performed.
capener was indicted in july.the grand jury charged him with counts of health care fraud in violation of,counts of mail fraud in violation of and one count of making false statements in violation of.the indictment alleged that the challenged procedures had not been performed,were unnecessary or were upcoded to increase the billing rate.
during the investigative phase,rice indicated to the government that part of his conclusions were supported by the fact that no bone fragments had been reported in pathology samples taken from some of capener patients.pathology samples consist of tissue taken from a patient after surgery.these samples are examined by a pathologist who then prepares a report.the bulk of the pathology reports that rice reviewed had been prepared by george mardini.of the set of reports that rice reviewed,some did not explicitly note the presence of bone fragments in the pathology sample while others specifically mentioned bone fragments.rice concluded that,where bone fragments were present in a pathology sample,mardini explicitly listed them in his report.the absence of any indication of fragments in the report therefore seemed to rice to indicate that there were no fragments in the sample.
rice theorized that,because some of the surgeries that capener claimed to have performed would require breaking bones,bone fragments should have been present in the pathology samples.where it appeared that they were not present,rice reasoned that the surgery must not have been performed.rice never indicated to the prosecutors that he needed further information or clarification regarding the presence or absence of bone fragments in these pathology reports.
prior to trial,the government produced an expert witness disclosure concerning rice expected testimony.this disclosure described rice conclusion that capener had billed for unnecessary and unperformed surgeries.it also indicated that rice would base his testimony on ct scans and his own experience and judgment.however,the disclosure did not indicate that rice would be basing any of his conclusions on the belief that bone fragments were absent from the pathology samples.that said,the prosecution had disclosed the fact that the absence of bone fragments was a central part of their theory in discussions with capener prior counsel at an earlier stage of the case.
in fact,most,if not all of the pathology samples in question did contain bone fragments.mardini simply had not specifically mentioned this fact in some of the reports.mardini and another doctor called by the defense,steven skoumal,explained at trial that bone fragments fall under the more general category of sinosal mucosa.skoumal testified that there was nothing wrong with the fact that mardini had not specifically mentioned bone fragments in the pathology samples.the government interviewed mardini during its investigation but did not discover that the pathology samples actually did contain bone fragments 
also,as part of the pretrial proceedings,capener moved for a subpoena to examine the medical records of the patients mentioned in the indictment.the government opposed his initial motion for subpoenas on the grounds that the proposed subpoenas were procedurally defective under fed,overly broad and with protections for patient privacy in the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa.
the district court quashed the subpoenas,generally agreeing with the reasons put forth by the government.later,the defense came forward with a more narrowly drawn request for subpoenas in compliance with hippa.the government filed no objection to most of the new,more narrowly drawn subpoenas.a magistrate judge issued subpoenas pursuant to the defense second request.the material produced in response to these subpoenas indicated that many of the patients capener had operated on had a history of sinus problems,tending to show that they might have appeared to need surgery.
in its,the government called rice.rice testified that,in his expert opinion,capener had billed for unnecessary or unperformed surgeries.the major bases for his opinion were that capener records indicated implausibly short times for the claimed surgeries,some of the ct scans indicated that certain nasal bone structures were intact,which rice felt would not have been intact if the claimed surgery had been performed,ct scans indicated that some patients did not have frontal sinuses,as that term is medically defined,making it impossible for capener to have performed frontal sinus surgery on them as he claimed and under rice interpretation of the pathology reports,no bone fragments were found in some pathology samples.of the seventeen health care fraud counts that would ultimately reach the jury,eleven did not rely at all on the bone fragments theory.with respect to the six counts where rice did rely on the bone fragments theory,rice also based his conclusion on one or more other theories as additional justifications.
the government called six significant doctors other than rice to substantiate the charges against capener.these other witnesses,however,collectively testified regarding far fewer patients than rice.bud west,david mathis,timothy dyches,anthony zamboni and michael kaplan offered opinions regarding one patient each.in each case,they indicated that they did not believe that capener had performed the claimed surgery.david bolick testified that one patient pathology sample lacked a type of tissue that it normally would have had if the claimed surgery had been performed and that he did not receive a pathology sample for another patient even though he normally would have.all told,these doctors testified about a total of seven patients while rice testified regarding at least seventeen patients in addition to these doctors,several of capener employees testified that they felt he used fraudulent billing practices.however,the government presented only one witness who had actually observed any that witness claimed to have watched only a couple of them.
in response to the government contention that there were no bone fragments in some of the relevant pathology samples,the defense called mardini,the pathologist who had processed the samples.mardini testified that there had been bone fragments in most,if not all of the pathology samples he examined.another defense pathologist,skoumal,explained that bone fragments need not be separately listed on a pathology report as they can fall under the general category of sinonasal mucosa and mardini had testified that,when he referred to sinonasal mucosa,he was including bone fragments.in addition,the defense presented pathology slides from patients treated by capener.on these slides,the bone fragments were plainly visible.
the defense also addressed other elements of the government case.in response to the contention that some of capener surgeries had been unnecessary,the defense presented testimony indicating that aggressive surgical intervention of the sort espoused by capener was an accepted treatment philosophy and that ct scans of the type relied on by rice did not always indicate whether a patient suffered from sinus symptoms.further,capener put on testimony supporting his use of the relevant billing codes.the defense also presented a video showing capener rapidly performing a surgery that the prosecution had indicated should take a long period of time.
in its rebuttal case,the prosecution again called rice.rice disputed the accuracy of the billing codes that capener had used in charging insurance companies.rice also suggested that the presence of bone fragments did not indicate that capener had performed exactly the kind of surgeries he had claimed.
following the close of the evidence,the defense moved to dismiss all the charges against capener.the district court dismissed all health care fraud and mail fraud counts alleging that capener had performed unnecessary surgery,but sent to the jury the remaining counts which alleged health care and mail fraud for unperformed surgeries and perhaps the record is not entirely clear on this false statement.after a single day deliberation,the jury acquitted capener on all remaining counts.
proceedings 
following the verdict,capener moved for an award of fees under the hyde amendment.he argued that the prosecution entire case was vexatious,frivolous and in bad faith.the government responded that its conduct did not entitle capener to fees.in particular,the government argued that its bone fragments theory was based on an understandable mistake given that mardini had sometimes separately listed the presence of bone fragments,suggesting that when he did not do so,bone fragments were not present,and that the bone fragments theory was only one of the government arguments at trial.
the district court held a hearing on the fee motion at which the judge made several pertinent remarks.for one,the district court denied capener request for documents from the prosecution,finding that capener had not raised sufficient suspicion to justify an order to produce documents.regarding the fee request,the district court stated at the start of the hearing that 
so far,subject to your arguments,i not convinced that the government moves in bad faith f rom the court own review of the proceedings,there was every reason to have suspicion and,of course,ultimately to obtain a finding of probable cause that criminal conduct had been engaged in so you got an uphill battle 
the court later said that it certainly is very possible that if this had been a civil lawsuit to recover fraud that the government could well have prevailed the court also stated that it could not fault the government for bringing this case.further,the district court stated,i am going to considering awarding maybe a quarter of the attorneys fees t hat initial view is based on some very brief statements in the briefs here.it will have to be based on a more careful review of the affidavits with regard to the extent of the injury to the defendant at the close of the hearing,the district court indicated that i not presently,as i sit here,inclined to exceed,roughly,a quarter,or a third of the overall fees.so i do that with review and we award something accordingly,for the reasons i stated here.
after the hearing,the district court produced a written order making findings of fact and law.the district court found that capener was entitled to partial relief under the hyde amendment.specifically,the district court held that the government pursued frivolous claims as to the counts based on the government first theory the lack of bone in the pathology reports the district court reasoned that the government either consciously decided to proffer a theory it knew was false,or it failed to conduct any investigation to confirm whether rice contentions regarding lack of bone fragments was accurate.the district court also noted that the government had not indicated that rice would testify regarding the bone fragments theory in its expert disclosure.nonetheless,the district court found that the government had not acted in bad faith,noting that there was no evidence that rice lied on the stand and that there was not sufficient evidence that the government consciously acted with ill will.
additionally,the district court found that the government had not acted vexatiously with regard to its opposition to capener subpoenas for the medical records of his surgical patients or in its decision to follow leads provided by allegedly disgruntled informants.the district court concluded that there was no ill will in either case and that some of the counts had been worthy of being submitted to a jury.finally,the district court found that capener counsel has not demonstrated that the court should depart from the standard rate.accordingly,the district court granted capener counsel in fees and costs.

discussion 
the government appeal 
on appeal,the government argues that the district court erred by considering the alleged flaws in the prosecution case piecemeal rather than asking whether the as a the hyde amendment standards for an award of fees.capener responds that the district court did view the alleged shortcomings of the prosecution in the context of the case as a whole and that,even if it had not,it would not have been error to focus only on the allegedly flawed portions of the government case.in fact,the district court conducted a piecemeal analysis of the government case.whether this approach was proper or not is something we need not decide because even if a piecemeal approach is permissible,the district court conclusion that a portion of the government case was frivolous was clearly erroneous.
the hyde amendment provides that 
t he court,in any criminal case other than a case in which the defendant is represented by assigned counsel paid for by the public may award to a prevailing party,other than the united states,a reasonable attorney fee and other litigation expenses,where the court finds that the position of the united states was vexatious,frivolous,or in bad faith,unless the court finds that special circumstances make such an award unjust.such awards shall be granted pursuant to the procedures and limitations but not the burden of proof provided under section of title,united states code.
note emphasis added 
thus,under the hyde amendment,a victorious defendant may be able to recover legal fees upon showing that the position of the united states was either vexatious,frivolous or in bad faith.u.note.however,the burden is on the defendant in the underlying case.manchester farming,at.on the other hand,t he elements are disjunctive thus,the defendant need only prove one of the three elements to recover.id.regardless of the element a prevailing defendant advances,the hyde amendment is targeted at prosecutorial misconduct,not prosecutorial mistake.united states braunstein,cir quoting united states gilbert,cir.indeed,mere faulty judgment is not vexatious,frivolous,or in bad faith.united states tucor,cir.
as noted above,although the district court did not find that the government had acted vexatiously or in bad faith,it did find that the bone fragments theory was frivolous.frivolousness is defined objectively.a frivolous case is one that is groundless a case is frivolous when the government position was foreclosed by binding precedent or so obviously wrong as to be frivolous.manchester farming,at internal quotation marks omitted.in support of the district court frivolousness finding,capener primarily contends that the prosecutors should have done a more thorough investigation and uncovered the fact that the pathology samples actually did contain bone fragments.as it happened,the government did interview the pathologist,mardini,but did not discover that the samples contained bone fragments.this was a regrettable clear failure by the prosecution to do its homework.the district court finding that it was misconduct of the sort that could justify a fee award,however,goes too far.
it is true that,under limited circumstances,a failure by the government to thoroughly investigate a case can constitute frivolousness.see braunstein,at.however,a failure to sufficiently investigate generally can rise to the level of frivolousness only when the government had some affirmative reason to know that further investigation was needed.for example,the braunstein court found that the prosecutors acted frivolously when they had substantial information affirmatively calling their theory into question and pointing the way to further evidence but failed to investigate further.id.in our case,by contrast,there is no evidence that the government had any affirmative reason to believe that its bone fragments theory was wrong.
indeed,the government argues that it relied on rice expert opinion and therefore did not act frivolously with respect to the bone fragments theory.because rice never indicated any need for further investigation,the government contends,their failure to confirm that the pathology samples did not contain bone fragments does not justify a finding of frivolousness.
where the government ceases investigation in reliance on the opinion of an expert and that expert has not indicated a need for any further investigation,the government generally has not acted frivolously.cases from several areas of law indicate that this kind of reliance usually does not fall below minimum professional standards.see,hendricks calderon,cir considering a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel dubois dep t of agriculture,cir considering a denial of sanctions.though there do not appear to be any hyde amendment cases on point,the cases cited above still suggest that such reliance is generally not obviously wrong,as required for a finding of frivolousness.to be sure,hendricks and dubois do not apply particularly demanding tests of attorney competence.they are,however,still relevant to the case at hand.the hyde amendment does not require targets prosecutorial misconduct,not prosecutorial mistake.braunstein,at.m ere faulty judgment is not vexatious,frivolous,or in bad faith.tucor,at.reliance on an expert may well be faulty judgment in a given instance,but it generally will not constitute misconduct of the sort sanctioned by the hyde amendment,absent some affirmative reason for the government to know such reliance is misplaced.
capener responds first that,as a factual matter,the government was not actually relying on rice expertise but had instead misled or to the contents of the pathology samples.second,capener contends that,even if the government had relied on rice,that reliance would not automatically prevent liability under the hyde amendment.as to his first contention,capener argues that rice depended on the prosecutors for information to such a degree that he was relying on them rather than the other way around.this issue centers on what the prosecutors told rice regarding mardini pathology reports.rice affidavit indicates that the prosecutors told him that mardini had verified the content of his reports.
this hardly diminishes the prosecutors reliance on rice expertise.the fact that the prosecutors told rice that mardini verified his reports could mean one of two things either that the prosecutor told rice that the reports were truthful or that the prosecutors told rice how to interpret the reports.in order for rice to have made his error in reliance on the prosecutors,they would had to have told him how to interpret the reports.rice error was one of that the fact that a pathology report did not specifically mention bone fragments meant that no bone fragments were actually present.there is no reason to think that the prosecutors told rice how to interpret the pathology reports or that he would have listened to them even if they had.the interpretation of a pathology report is a technical matter not a legal one.accordingly,there is no basis for claiming that the prosecutors were not acting in reliance on rice when they halted their investigation of the bone fragments theory.
moreover,even if there are circumstances under which a prosecutor reliance on an expert would not shield the government from liability under the hyde amendment,this case does not present such a situation.there is nothing else about the facts surrounding the prosecutors reliance on rice that suggests that this reliance was frivolous.rice was an expert in his field and did not indicate that he needed any additional information regarding the absence of bone fragments in the pathology samples.though the government apparently failed to ask the pathologist,mardini,about the bone fragments issue,there was no specific indication that it was necessary to do so.moreover,some of mardini pathology reports specifically indicated the presence of bone fragments,making it reasonable to infer,as rice and the government apparently did,that where a report did not specifically indicate bone fragments,that sample did not contain bone fragments 
the strongest point for capener on the issue of whether the prosecutors were frivolous with respect to the bone fragments theory is the fact that the district court finding on this point is entitled to deference.the district court wrote that 
e ither the government consciously decided to proffer a theory it knew was false,or it failed to conduct any investigation or inquiry to confirm whether rice contentions regarding lack of bone fragments was in fact accurate.in addition,the government failed to produce to capener expert disclosures from rice,who discussed the lack of bone as a basis for his opinion.taken together,these facts indicate the government had reason to believe their theory was without support.
this finding,however,is clearly erroneous.the record simply does not substantiate the assertion that the government knew or had reason to believe that its lack of bone fragments theory was false.the district court cites only one fact in support of this the government expert witness disclosure did not specifically indicate that rice would base some of his testimony on the absence of bone fragments in the pathology sample.
the government,however,told capener prior attorney about this basis for rice opinions at an earlier stage of the case.though the failure to include this inf
