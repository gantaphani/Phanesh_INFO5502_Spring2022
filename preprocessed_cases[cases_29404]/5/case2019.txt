we conclude the trial court denial of attorney fees against constitutes abuse of discretion.we reject contention that drake and walton are not successful parties within the meaning of section since after voters disapproved of the city action,dropped the matter and the court was never required to consider the merits of its challenge to the adequacy of the referendum petition.drake and walton achieved their objective by thwarting attempt to preclude or delay the referendum vote and the court denial of its petition for writ of mandate was the last word on the matter.further,drake and walton opposition to petition resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest and conferred a significant benefit on the city voters.

factual and procedural background 
in august the city approved general and specific plan amendments that changed the land use for a parcel from residential to commercial,to permit the development of a second store in the city.had entered into an agreement to purchase the property from brookfield,and brookfield requested the land use change from the city.
the following month,drake and walton,residents of the city,submitted to susie vasquez,the city clerk,a referendum petition with signatures challenging the city action and seeking to put the matter to a vote vasquez delivered the petition to the san diego county registrar of voters for signature verification.
in october filed a petition for peremptory writ of mandate against the city,vasquez and sally mcpherson,the san diego county registrar of voters named drake,walton and brookfield as real parties in interest.also filed a motion for an order directing the issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate,which brookfield joined.sought invalidation of the referendum petition on grounds it violated the elections code by not including the full text of the city various documents implementing the land use change,subd.b,and because,as noted in a report by vasquez,signatures were obtained by persons not registered to vote or qualified to register to vote in the city,subd.c.also argued that in approving the land use change the city was acting as a redevelopment agency,and a ctions taken by a local r edevelopment a gency are administrative in character and thus not subject to referendum.
the city did not oppose the petition or motion.rather,the city and vasquez filed a document titled a response,in which they sought the court guidance on the proper verification of petition signatures.the city submitted evidence the san diego county registrar of voters does not follow elections code section,subdivision c,but rather follows the procedures for verification of petitions provided on june,by john,chief of the elections division of the office of the secretary of state.information stated that signatures are to be counted if otherwise valid when the circulator is not registered in the city in which the petition was circulated.circulators not in compliance with section,subdivision c are to be referred to the city clerk office.the city and vasquez response stated,b ecause of the conflicting criteria for determining the validity of signatures collected by circulators who are neither registered nor eligible to register to vote in the city,the city seeks the c ourt determination of the procedure to be followed.
drake and walton opposed petition and motion.they argued,among other things,that according to case law a challenge to a referendum is a disruption of the electoral process the court should not permit absent a compelling showing the substantive provisions of the referendum are invalid,a criterion not met.
the court issued a tentative ruling denying motion on the grounds as stated in drake and walton opposition and supplemental opposition thereto specifically,that it is usually more appropriate to review constitutional and other challenges to ballot propositions or initiative measures after an election rather than to disrupt the electoral process by preventing the exercise of the people franchise,in the absence of some clear showing of invalidity.citing debottari city council of the city of norco d.debottari brosnahan eu cal d.further,the court declined to issue an advisory opinion as the city requested.after a hearing,the court confirmed its tentative ruling.it entered judgment denying motion and dismissing its petition without prejudice.
on march,the referendum,designated as proposition g,went before the city voters.the city action was defeated,with approximately percent of the electorate objecting to the proposed store.and brookfield brought no challenge to the referendum.
drake and walton moved for attorney fees from,brookfield and the city under section,arguing their opposition to petition resulted in the enforcement of important rights affecting the public interest and conferred a significant benefit on the general public or a large class of persons.they sought in fees based on a lodestar multiplier method.the matter was heard by another judge,who denied the motion on the ground the judge who denied petition for lack of ripeness did not make any substantive rulings on this case,and it would be a stretch to then conclude that something that was not adjudicated leads to a significant benefit.
discussion 
an important exception to the american rule that litigants are to bear their own attorney fees is found in section graham daimlerchrysler cal th,d,graham,which codifies the private attorney general doctrine the california supreme court adopted in serrano priest cal d.hull rossi th,d.section provides in part upon motion,a court may award attorneys fees to a successful party against one or more opposing parties in any action which has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest if a a significant benefit,whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary,has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons,b the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement are such as to make the award appropriate,and c such fees should not in the interest of justice be paid out of the recovery,if any.
t he private attorney general doctrine rests upon the recognition that privately initiated lawsuits are often essential to the effectuation of the fundamental public policies embodied in constitutional or statutory provisions,and that,without some mechanism authorizing the award of attorney fees,private actions to enforce such important public policies will as a practical matter frequently be infeasible.thus,the fundamental objective of the doctrine is to encourage suits enforcing important public policies by providing substantial attorney fees to successful litigants in such cases.graham,supra,cal th at,d.
