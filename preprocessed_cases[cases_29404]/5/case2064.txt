the trial court awarded in attorney fees through trial and for fees on appeal for a total of.the trial court also awarded costs of through trial and on appeal.in december,the landlords paid to satisfy the judgment,including damages plus interest and attorney fees and costs plus interest.since percent of the final judgment amount of was greater than the award of attorney fees plus interest,thc retained the contingency fee.

in february,thc moved for summary judgment,or in the alternative summary adjudication as to all causes of action in the complaint.in april,the trial court denied summary judgment,finding that there were triable issues of fact as to the amount of fees due under the contract.the court also denied summary adjudication as to the first,third,fourth and fifth causes of action on the same basis.however,the court granted summary adjudication as to the second cause of action,finding there were no triable issues of fact as to fraud and misrepresentation.in a subsequent order,the court again granted summary adjudication as to the second cause of action noting it was undisputed that thc is a nonprofit,corporation the court then found there was no requirement that corporations must register with the state bar as professional law corporations.no fraud or misrepresentation therefore exists as a matter of law.
