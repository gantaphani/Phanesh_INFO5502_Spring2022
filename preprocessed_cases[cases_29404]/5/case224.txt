steven goldman appeals from the district court order denying his application for attorneys fees.on appeal,goldman argues that the record does not support the district court conclusions that goldman engaged in misconduct with respect to the fees and expenses in the case and that goldman failed to represent his client adequately with respect to the proceedings in the district court.goldman also argues that judge korman bias against him influenced the district court disposition of the fee application and merits reversal.we disagree,and hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying goldman fee application and that the record does not support goldman claim of bias.
background 
because this case is instructive with respect to the nature of the conduct that may merit the denial of an attorney application for fees,we provide a more detailed background here than we would otherwise normally provide.
this case arises from goldman representation of zuhua chen and her infant son,david fan,in a medical malpractice action against the defendants.in november,chen gave birth to david,via emergency caesarian section,at gestation,secondary to breech presentation.during his birth,david suffered respiratory depression and severe brain damage.after his birth,david experienced additional devastating medical problems,including the liver disease extrahepatic biliary atresia,necrotizing enterocolitis,and secondary microcephaly.neither party in this appeal disputes that david will require extensive and medical treatment throughout the remainder of his life.
in january,chen,individually and as the guardian of david,executed a medical malpractice retainer with goldman.in march,goldman filed in new york state court a medical malpractice complaint against the defendants,which was later removed to the district court.in july,goldman and the defendants reached a settlement agreement whereby the defendants would pay a settlement in the amount of million.thereafter,goldman filed in the district court a proposed stipulation of settlement and infant compromise order.the proposed infant compromise order directed the distribution of the million as follows in fees and expenses to goldman to chen for her loss of services claim and to be paid to chen as trustee for david in a special needs trust.
in his accompanying affidavit,goldman indicated that,pursuant to his retainer with chen,he was entitled to a fee of and to expenses of.although goldman provided a general list of services rendered on this matter,including the o btaining of all medical reports,he did not provide any documentation detailing his request for fees.additionally,with the exception of medical records from the hospital where chen delivered david,goldman failed to provide any documentation of david medical condition,an assessment of liability,a projection of expenses for david future medical care,or an expert report upon which the district court could rely in assessing the reasonableness of the settlement.
in september,the district court issued an order appointing steven north as special master to provide the court with his recommendation on the application to approve the infant compromise in this case.in the order,the court acknowledged its fiduciary duty to protect the interest of the infant and noted that although so much is at stake for the infant,the information provided by plaintiff counsel is totally unhelpful.
after he was appointed,north sent goldman a letter requesting various items and information from goldman,including a d etailed summary of all legal work performed.north also requested that goldman explain how he had calculated his fee in the case and provide a detailed explanation of the disbursements for expenses.goldman responded and provided some of the items requested by north.goldman explained that he had not yet obtained records from david physician or records related to a liver transplant david received shortly after his birth,and that he had not obtained any expert reports or memoranda.with respect to his fee calculation,goldman explained that,after deducting the cost of his expenses in the case,he had calculated the fee based on the sliding scale prescribed by the office of court administration in the appellate division.with respect to the explanation of disbursements or expenses,goldman stated that they were pretty much self explanatory.
in october,north sent goldman another letter requesting the information that goldman had not yet sent in response to north previous one.goldman responded,and,with respect to his fee calculation,stated,i simply made the assumption that the sliding scale retainer was well recognized.he then calculated his fee to be,noting t he retainer we used in was a mistake we have now filed an amended retainer statement with the judicial conference.in the letter,apparently in response to queries made by north,goldman stated that he had not yet obtained a life care plan detailing the future medical treatment david would require for the rest of his life.
in december,north issued his special master report,which concluded that it was impossible to fairly determine whether the settlement sum of and the allocation of it is reasonable under these circumstances or whether the requested legal fee is justified.north noted that,d espite ample opportunity having been extended to goldman to explain in reasonable detail the basis for the proposed settlement and the justification for the requested legal fee the materials presented were woefully inadequate in that,among other things,the submission did not include fundamental documentation that had been requested and was necessary to properly evaluate the matter.
with respect to the fee request,north noted that goldman initial fee request of exceeded the amount permitted under of the new york judiciary law,and hypothesized that goldman had initially improperly computed two separate legal fees each starting at of the recovery first for the mother cause of action and then again,beginning at for the child cause of action.north noted that,w hen pushed to provide the justification for the enhanced fee,goldman simply provided a calculation that computes the proper statutory fee and never proffered an explanation for having sought an inflated fee in the first place.in a footnote,north stated that goldman initial retainer in the case provided for a sliding scale legal fee in excess of the statutory maximum and additionally contained an agreement of doubtful propriety that the client would consent to a fee if the case goes to trial.north also noted that,in his affirmation in support of his fee,goldman had asserted that his services rendered including obtaining all medical reports.however,north pointed out that t here were no medical reports obtained.further,north noted that goldman claimed disbursements were either unheard of,unjustified or unsupported,overtime clerical expert damages interpreting services medical records.
with respect to the reasonableness of the settlement,north stated that he had retained a medical expert to review the medical records that goldman had provided for the purpose of assessing the liability issues.according to north,that expert had informed him that the records obtained by goldman were incomplete and insufficient to base a reasonable assessment upon.north opined that,i t is unheard of to submit infant compromise papers,particularly in a case with the severity of the alleged damages here and not present any contemporary medical report and rehabilitative evaluation of the child present status and future needs.
north also opined that goldman had failed to offer sufficient information to justify his suggestion that a portion of the recovery be placed in a supplemental needs trust,noting that w ithout knowing with some reasonable medical clarity what the child future needs are,it is not possible to assess the advisability of a supplemental needs trust.finally,north noted that goldman had failed to respond to many of north requests for information,including failing to provide detailed explanations and documentation of disbursements and expenses.
thereafter,in december,the district court issued an order directing goldman to show cause why he should not be removed as counsel for chen.in the order,the court noted that t he inability of the special master to adequately assess the merits of the settlement is attributed directly to the failure of goldman to obtain or provide material necessary for such an assessment.
later in december,goldman responded to the district court order via letter,with which he provided documentation related to david ongoing medical care.with respect to the medical records from the nyu downtown hospital,goldman stated that he had not initially obtained all of the records because both sides believed the case would be settled.however,goldman explained that he would obtain the records and provide them to the court.goldman also indicated that he would provide the court with a detailed analysis of his legal services and expenses.thereafter,goldman sent the court a letter detailing his work in the case.that letter,however,did not provide a breakdown of expenses or fees in the case.
in february,the district court issued an order informing the parties that it had decided to retain its own medical expert to review the relevant medical records in the case.the court directed the defendants to provide it with the relevant medical records,and noted that it had never had a case in which the presentation of an infant compromise has been so poorly presented by plaintiff counsel.in march,the district court appointed a guardian ad litem for david.the court explained that it had done so for two reasons.the first is the lack of sophistication of the natural guardian of the infant and the second is the wholly inadequate assistance of counsel in preparation of the infant compromise order.according to the court,in addition to retaining the medical expert,it had also consulted with others to assess the child needs and to assist in a considered judgment on the use of a structured settlement and a special needs trust.the court noted that,with respect to the structured settlement and special needs trust,goldman had in conversations demonstrated a profound ignorance of the circumstances that make such a vehicle necessary.further,the court stated that goldman had not undertaken the kind of assessment necessary to fully and completely evaluate the financial needs of the child over his life.the court concluded that north devastating assessment of goldman application for approval of the compromise and fees raise d serious questions relating to the manner in which goldman calculated his fee and the honesty of his claims for disbursements.the court appointed ronald schwartz,the in this appeal,as guardian ad litem.in april,after receiving various materials from its retained medical expert and from schwartz,the district court approved the stipulated settlement and directed that a qualified settlement fund be established.
in june,goldman,through counsel,filed an affirmation in support of his application for attorney fees.in support of that motion,goldman provided a breakdown of hours he claimed to have expended on chen case.however,the breakdown offered no explanation or documentation for the expenses he had allegedly incurred in working on the case and which he had requested in the application for fees.in september,the district court appointed schwartz to represent david interests on the fee application.in the order,the court noted that b ecause i question both goldman entitlement to counsel fees and the amount of the fees he seeks,it is apparent that his interest and the interest of david fan are in conflict.moreover,since goldman is no longer a member of the bar,he could not appear in this proceeding in any event.
in december,the district court conducted a hearing on goldman application for fees.during that hearing,the court asked goldman to explain how he had calculated his initial request for in fees,and the special master noted that goldman had never explained the error he had alleged was the basis for the incorrect calculation.goldman told the court that the initial fee request was the product of a typographical error in the first retainer agreement with chen.north suggested that goldman had arrived at the initial figure of by taking a separate percent from the mother net amount of.north also refuted goldman explanation for the error,noting that,even applying the formula set forth in the initial retainer agreement,it does not come out to.north told the court that he had computed the fee based on the calculation set forth in the initial retainer,and it come s out even though it wrong,in the amount of.during the hearing,judge korman referred to goldman fee application and compromise order as totally incompetent and noted that he had seen lawyers who are small time practitioners who settle slip and fall cases put together an infant compromise that is ten times or times better than this i have no confidence that somebody who prepares legal documents like this when his own fee is involved,much less dealing with other clients,has achieved the best result that could have been obtained in the case.
in february,the district court issued an oral decision denying goldman application for fees in its entirety.in july,the district court issued a written order memorializing its denial of goldman fee application.in the order,the court noted that goldman had never given a credible explanation for the overcharge,and the absence of an explanation led the court to conclude that the overcharge was deliberate.the court considered and rejected goldman explanation that the initial fee request was the product of a typographical error in the retainer agreement,noting that,even under the calculation in the retainer,the fee would still have been.in conclusion,the court stated that it was not convinced that goldman had earned the fees he requested 
over the last years i have overseen a fair number of infant compromise cases,ranging from trip and fall cases to those involving serious brain damage with settlements reaching into the millions of dollars.the lawyers in those cases earned their fees by the settlements they achieved and by work that goldman failed to provide.i am not going to allow him to be compensated in the same way as attorneys who do their job.moreover,assuming that my conclusion regarding the deliberate fabrication of goldman initial application for fees and disbursements is not sustained,the utter carelessness in the calculation nevertheless warrants additional sanction.
the district court denied goldman fee application in its entirety and granted his request for costs only to the extent that goldman could substantiate the disbursements he claimed in the application.
this appeal followed.
