following a jury trial,eileen crowley prevailed on civil rights claims against bean.several weeks after this court affirmed the judgment,crowley applied to the district court for attorneys fees.the district court denied the application,finding it to be untimely,and held that crowley had complied neither with its own order nor with maine local rule.we affirm the district court denial of attorneys fees.
background 
in june,crowley asserted several civil rights claims against her employer,bean.on june,after a jury trial,the district court awarded judgment to crowley.
on june,bean filed a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law or,if denied,a motion for a new trial.on october,before any ruling on bean motion had issued,crowley filed a document titled request for clarification on filing of attorneys fees application.in that submission,crowley asked for clarification on when the court would like plaintiff to file her application for attorneys fees as the prevailing party in this matter.that day,the district court entered an order stating it is hereby ordered the attorneys fees application be filed with this court within days of the disposition of any appeal.
on november,the district court denied bean motion for a new trial and amended its judgment in favor of crowley.bean appealed,and on september,this court affirmed the judgment below.crowley bean,cir.the mandate was issued on october,it was received by the district court on november,and was filed in the electronic docket on november.
on january,crowley filed her petition for attorneys fees in district court pursuant to local rule.that rule provides the time frame for filing such petitions 
an application for attorneys fees in those cases in which fees have been contracted for or in any case in which no notice of appeal has been filed shall be filed within days of the expiration of the time for filing a timely appeal.
an application for fees in all other cases shall be filed within days of the filing of the appellate mandate providing for final disposition of any appeal.
a claim for fees filed before the final disposition of any appeal shall have no effect and a new application must be filed within the prescribed time as described herein.
on january,bean filed a motion to strike crowley petition as untimely,which the district court granted.crowley then filed a motion for reconsideration,which was denied.thereafter,she appealed from the order granting the motion to strike 
ii.argument 
here,crowley advances two related arguments local rule should be construed to permit the filing of her application for attorneys fees,and even if her application was untimely under the rule,the district court nonetheless should have considered it.
although we typically review the interpretation of a federal procedural rule de novo,blake pellegrino,cir,we accord a special degree of and beyond the traditional standards of decisionmaking and appellate oversight to a court interpretation of its own local rules.in re jarvis,cir.moreover,we have held that the application of a district court local rule is reviewed for abuse of discretion.nepsk,houlton,cir citing cmm cable rep,ocean coast,cir see also air line pilots ass precision valley aviation,cir applying broad latitude in administering local rules while a district court may forgive a party violation of a local rule,united states,cir,we review deferentially its refusal to do so.nepsk,at.
whether crowley petition for fees was untimely 
crowley contends that the district court misinterpreted local rule,and that her petition for attorneys fees in fact was timely filed.we begin with the text of the rule.
as the parties now seem to agree,the first paragraph of local rule does not apply to crowley fee application,as this is not a case in which fees were contracted for or in which no notice of appeal was filed rather,the timeliness is governed by the second paragraph,which states,an application for fees in all other cases shall be filed within days of the filing of the appellate mandate providing for final disposition of any appeal.
the crux of the dispute lies in the words final disposition of any appeal.bean contends,consistent with the district court opinion,that this phrase refers to an appeal to this court.crowley filed her petition for fees ten weeks after this court issued its appellate mandate and eight weeks after the mandate had been filed in district court.under this interpretation of rule,her petition was indisputably untimely.
crowley,however,reads the phrase any appeal more broadly to include certiorari petitions to the supreme court.specifically,she contends that a prevailing plaintiff is required to file her petition for attorneys fees within thirty days after the expiration date of the opposing party right to appeal.the period should not begin,she says,until there has been express waiver of further review on certiorari denial of certiorari passage of the deadline to seek certiorari or the supreme court decision,whichever is latest.here,bean had ninety days from the filing of the court of appeals mandate to file for certiorari with the supreme court.after that time passed with no certiorari filing,crowley argues,she had an additional thirty days in which to submit her petition.
a plain reading of,however,indicates that the district court reasonably interpreted any appeal to refer solely to an appeal to this court.first,the rule makes no explicit reference to certiorari,only to appeals.the supreme court no longer adjudicates appeals in cases such as this.see,stat.june,repealing,thereby eliminating nearly all of the supreme court mandatory appellate jurisdiction.
second,the rule reference to appellate mandate providing for final disposition of any appeal reasonably refers to action by this court,not the supreme court.the supreme court generally does not issue appellate mandates.if it denies a petition for certiorari,it does not issue a mandate rather,the clerk prepares,signs,and enters an order to that effect.see.if the court instead grants plenary review,a formal mandate does not issue unless specifically directed instead,the clerk of the supreme court will send the clerk of the lower court a copy of the opinion or order of the supreme court and a certified copy of the judgment.accordingly,the local rule reference to filing of the appellate mandate can reasonably be construed as pertaining only to action of this court.
it is true that in other contexts,the term final disposition has been interpreted to refer to action taken by the supreme court or to additional appeals.see,clay united states,d holding that for the purpose of starting the clock on limitation period,a judgment of conviction becomes final when the time expires for filing a petition for certiorari contesting the appellate court affirmation of the conviction adams sec.and exchange comm n,holding that period for filing for fees pursuant to equal access to justice act does not run until the period in which an appeal can be brought has expired.these decisions are specific to legal contexts unrelated to those in the case at bar,however.see,clay.at the relevant context is postconviction relief,a context in which finality has a,clear meaning.there is no uniformity of interpretation as to the term final disposition and similar phrases other cases use these terms to refer to judgments of the district court,a reading that plainly is inapplicable here.see,roell withrow,d cunningham hamilton county,ohio,d swint chambers county comm n,d.reading the rule as a whole,we conclude that the district court interpretation was not erroneous,and that crowley application for attorneys fees was untimely.
crowley points to the detailed information contained in her fee petition and maintains that it is improper for the opposing party to have access to it before the litigation is complete.the likelihood of the supreme court granting certiorari on any given case is exceedingly slim,however.the risk of confidential information being shared with an opposing party who might somehow use it to its advantage in litigation before the supreme court is minimal,and does not change the result in this case.further,if such a thr
