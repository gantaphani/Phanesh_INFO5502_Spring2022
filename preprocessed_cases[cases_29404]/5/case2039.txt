introduction 
plaintiff abf capital appeals from a judgment entered after the trial court sustained without leave to amend the demurrer of defendant robert berglass.defendant appeals from an order denying his motion for an award of reasonable attorney fees.
plaintiff contends the trial court abused its discretion in denying its motion for a new trial and in sustaining without leave to amend defendant demurrer.defendant contends the trial court erred in applying new york law to his motion for an award of reasonable attorney fees.we reject plaintiff contentions and that of defendant as well.we consequently affirm both the judgment and the order.
we derive the pertinent facts from the complaint,filed on december,and from the assumption agreement incorporated in the complaint.plaintiff incorporated in delaware but has its principal place of business in new york.defendant currently resides in california.on december,defendant obtained six units of interest in regent energy partners,a new york limited partnership in the business of acquiring oil and gas property in texas and louisiana and the drilling,development and operation of oil and gas wells on such property.
on december,the partnership contracts for certain oil and gas subleases became effective.each of those subleases required the partnership to pay plaintiff a minimum annual royalty as the subleases defined that term.the partnership could defer payment,however,if it delivered to plaintiff agreements by which each limited partner assumed liabilities.defendant executed such an agreement on december.
sections and of the assumption agreement require defendant to assume personal liability for his pro rata share of the partnership deferred minimum annual royalties under the subleases.in accord with section,the partnership must pay plaintiff percent of the sums otherwise to be distributed to defendant as a limited partner in order to reduce his deferred obligation.
section of the agreement requires the partnership to maintain books and records delineating all liabilities the partner assumes under the agreement.the partnership must provide the partner with a statement of liabilities whenever the amount for which the partner is liable changes.
section of the agreement requires the partner to pay attorney fees that the partnership or the sublessor incur in enforcing the agreement with the result that there is an adjudication of the partner breach.section states that the agreement is governed by and construed under the laws of the state of new york.
plaintiff is and always has been the intended third party beneficiary of the assumption agreement.the partnership performed all of its obligations under the agreement.the balance of the sums due under the agreement should have been paid on december.as of january,defendant had breached the agreement,causing plaintiff to suffer in damages plus interest due from the date of default.
discussion 
abf capital appealthe trial court properly denied the motion for new trial 
the court may grant a motion for a new trial when there has been i rregularity in the proceedings of the court,or any order of the court or abuse of discretion by which either party was prevented from having a fair trial,as long as the irregularity materially affect s the substantial rights of the moving party.code civ,subd.the court also may grant a motion when there has been a ccident or surprise materially affecting the substantial rights of a party,which ordinary prudence could not have guarded against,subd.
we will not disturb the trial court determination of a motion for a new trial unless the court has abused its discretion.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.when the court has denied a motion for a new trial,however,we must determine whether the court abused its discretion by examining the entire record and making an independent assessment of whether there were grounds for granting the motion.sherman kinetic concepts,th,d.
plaintiff initially argues that the trial court failure to apply the doctrine of judicial estoppel to prevent defendant from asserting a changed position in his reply to plaintiff opposition to the demurrer prejudiced plaintiff.as plaintiff sees it,this failure entitled it to a new trial.
the courts invoke judicial estoppel to prevent judicial fraud from a litigant deceitful assertion of a position completely inconsistent with one previously asserted,thus compromising the integrity of the administration of justice by creating a risk of conflicting judicial determinations.furia helm th,d thomas gordon th,d,review den.the inconsistent position generally must be factual in nature.tuchscher development enterprises,san diego unified port dist.th,d.
as a general rule,the court should apply the doctrine only when the party stating an inconsistent position succeeded in inducing a court to adopt the earlier position or to accept it as true.if the party did not succeed,then a later inconsistent position poses little risk of inconsistent judicial determinations and consequently introduces little threat to judicial integrity.tuchscher development enterprises,san diego unified port,supra,th at,d.
to the extent that defendant may have asserted inconsistent positions in support of his demurrer,they were inconsistent legal positions asserted in the same action.the trial court had ample opportunity to examine both positions closely,taking into consideration the opposing party objection and both parties argument,which was extensive,and to determine whether defendant had been deceitful in asserting the latter position or,as appears to be the case here,merely had been ignorant when asserting the former position.thomas gordon,supra,th at,d.it consequently was unnecessary to invoke judicial estoppel.
the questions remain whether defendant change in position misled plaintiff to its prejudice pinkham mcdonough mcfarland elrod cal,whether the court acted in a manner that deprived plaintiff of a fair hearing gay torrance cal,lowe massachusetts mut.life ins.d,or whether defendant raised a new issue that did not appear in his demurrer,thus subjecting plaintiff to unfair surprise blankman parsons.if so,the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion for a new trial.
plaintiff has not demonstrated that any of these grounds exist.defendant change in position did not mislead plaintiff,who had an opportunity to,and did,object to it and attempt to refute it in extensive oral argument at the hearing on the demurrer.inasmuch as the court gave plaintiff a full opportunity to argue against the change in position,it did nothing to deprive plaintiff of a fair hearing.finally,the issue was whether the complaint was.that is the same issue raised in defendant demurrer.his reply simply took an alternative approach to the issue to that taken in the demurrer,apparently after he belatedly discovered the applicable law.in short,the trial court properly denied the motion for a new trial.
the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion in sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend 
a demurrer challenges the sufficiency of the complaint by raising questions of law.blank kirwan cal d,rodas spiegel th,d.where the complaint discloses on its face that the statute of limitations has run on the causes of action stated in the complaint,it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.guardian north bay,superior court th,d,review den.
when considering a demurrer,the trial court must accept as true all material facts pleaded in the complaint and those arising by reasonable implication.moore conliffe cal th,d,montclair parkowners city of montclair th,d.the trial court may consider as well matters of which it may take judicial notice.code civ,subd.a city of atascadero merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,th,d.on appeal,we exercise our independent judgment to determine whether the complaint states a cause of action as a matter of law and apply the abuse of discretion standard to the trial court denial of leave to amend.montclair parkowners,supra,at,d hernandez city of pomona th,d.
in asserting error in sustaining the demurrer,plaintiff argues that the trial court applied new york law impro
