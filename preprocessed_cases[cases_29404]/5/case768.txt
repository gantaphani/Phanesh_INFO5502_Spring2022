in this appeal.luke medical center rush challenges the amount of attorney fees and prejudgment interest awarded to the plaintiff,susan shott,after she prevailed on a disability discrimination claim against rush.the district court awarded plaintiff roughly of the amount of attorney fees she sought and awarded all the prejudgment interest she requested.rush argues that the attorney fees award should be reduced i because shott pursued an unreasonable strategy in the first trial that led to that verdict being set aside and ii because shott rejected a substantial settlement offer early in the litigation.rush also maintains that no prejudgment interest should be awarded.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
susan shott,who holds a in statistics,began work at rush in june.in,she was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis,though she did not inform rush of her medical condition until.in january,harvey preisler,head of the rush cancer institute,named shott as the director of the biostatistics unit of the institute.
shott alleges that troubles with preisler began on march,when she informed him that she was an orthodox jew and advised him that she would not be able to work on passover.shott alleges that following her request preisler became hostile toward her and began greatly increasing her work load by requiring her to do excessive computer work and refusing to hire an assistant for her.further,she claimed that preisler began scheduling meetings that conflicted with her religious observances.
on may,some three months after the trouble began,shott first informed preisler,via a letter from her physician,that she had rheumatoid arthritis.this letter did not specifically request an accommodation for arthritis,but it did note that shott generally tries to work from to to avoid having to sit in rush hour traffic for an extended period of time,which aggravated her arthritis.
between may and july,shott and preisler did not discuss her disability,but they did exchange correspondence about shott requests not to work on jewish holidays.also during this period,shott filed a charge of religious and disability discrimination against preisler with the chicago commission on human relations.
on july,shott gave preisler a letter in which,for the first time,she informed him that because he had not hired an assistant for her,she was having to do a large amount of data entry on the computer,which greatly aggravated her arthritis.on july,preisler assured shott that he would hire an assistant,but it appears he never did so.over the next few months,shott and preisler exchanged a series of hostile letters related to shott need for accommodation of her disability and her religious observances.
on november,shott filed this lawsuit against rush.in her third amended complaint,shott alleged i disability discrimination by failure to reasonably accommodate her disability in violation of the americans with disabilities act ada,et ii retaliation in violation of the ada iii religious discrimination in violation of title vii of the civil right act of,et and iv retaliation in violation of title vii.
in january,at the district court urging,the parties began settlement negotiations.in march,while shott still worked at the cancer institute,rush made a settlement offer,whereby shott would be transferred to a new position in the department of neurosurgery with no change in salary for the current academic year.the settlement offer did not include payment for damages,attorney fees,or costs,and it required shott to sign a letter that,among other things,stated that she retracted all allegations in her complaint.shott refused the offer.
on july,rush transferred shott from her position in the cancer institute and placed her in the previously offered position in the department of neurosurgery at a pay cut of roughly.after the transfer,shott added the retaliation claims to her complaint.
the case went to trial,and the jury found for rush on the claim and on both retaliation claims.the jury,however,held for shott on the claim,awarding her in compensatory damages and in punitive damages.the district judge,however,on rush motion,set aside this verdict and ordered a new trial.
according to the district court order,a new trial was warranted because the verdict on the ada claim was against the weight of the evidence and because the plaintiff had presented her case to the jury in an unreasonable manner that likely confused the jury and prejudiced rush.specifically,the district court was concerned that the jury may have found rush liable on the disability claim based on certain events that occurred before shott ever requested an accommodation.
at the second trial,which was limited to the disability discrimination claim,the jury again returned a verdict for the plaintiff this time awarding her only in compensatory damages and no punitive damages.
following the second trial,shott filed a petition for attorney fees under,in the amount of.rush opposed the petition on several grounds,claiming that shott was entitled to only of the amount sought.the district court found that based on the degree of success shott achieved in the litigation the award should be reduced by to.shott later filed petitions for further attorney fees incurred and for prejudgment interest,which were granted,making the final award for attorney fees,for prejudgment interest,and in costs for a total of.
ii.analysis 
the parties do not dispute that shott is a prevailing party in this litigation and therefore is entitled to a reasonable attorney fee under the ada.we note that rush does not challenge the district court determination that shott unsuccessful claims ada retaliation,title vii discrimination,and title vii retaliation were related to her successful claim or that,because they were related,shott could receive at least partial attorney fees for the work done on these unsuccessful claims.see hensley eckerhart,d holding that courts may award compensation for time spent pursuing unsuccessful claims that related to the successful claims.
rush does,however,challenge the reasonableness of the fees awarded on three fronts,arguing i that shott should not receive attorney fees for the first trial because she engaged in an unreasonable trial strategy that caused the verdict to be set aside ii that the attorney fee award should be reduced based on shott rejection of a substantial settlement offer very early in the litigation and iii that shott should not receive prejudgment interest.
award of attorney fees for first trial 
we review a district court refusal to reduce an award of attorney fees for abuse of discretion.jaffee redmond,cir.it is true,of course,that a prevailing party under the ada is entitled to an award of fees for all time reasonably expended in pursuit of the ultimate result achieved.id.at quoting hensley,at.therefore,when two trials are required to achieve the ultimate result,a plaintiff should be compensated for both trials,so long as the time spent at both was reasonably expended.rush argues,however,that when a plaintiff unreasonable arguments at the first trial force the parties to participate in a second proceeding,the plaintiff should not be allowed compensation for both proceedings.
to establish this principle,rush relies heavily on our second decision in jaffee redmond,cir hereinafter jaffee ii.the jaffee case involved two trials and two appeals.in the appeal from the first trial,jaffee redmond,cir hereinafter jaffee i,we held that the district court had erroneously ruled,at the plaintiff urging,that there was no federal privilege.id.at.the plaintiff appealed to the supreme court,which affirmed our decision and resolved a circuit split by recognizing a federal evidentiary privilege for communications.jaffee redmond,d.the case was remanded for a new trial,and at the second trial,plaintiff again prevailed.see jaffee ii,at.on plaintiff motion for attorney fees the district court held that given the split in authority,it was reasonable for the plaintiff to argue against the privilege in the first trial however,the court awarded no fees for the second trial,reasoning that if the plaintiff had not argued incorrectly at the first trial there would have been no need for the second.see id.the plaintiff appealed,and in jaffee ii,we reversed the district court,noting that w hile an unreasonable argument that necessitates further proceedings may justify denying compensation for those proceedings,the district court in this case found that jaffee acted reasonably in arguing against the privilege a fee award is not automatically precluded because the second trial was necessitated by a reasonable but unsuccessful argument.id.at.
other circuits have also observed that so long as a plaintiff actions are not responsible for the need for a second trial,the plaintiff may be compensated for time spent on both proceedings.see city of providence,cir gierlinger gleason,cir.
gierlinger,a case against a new york state police officer,involved three trials.the first trial ended in a jury verdict for the plaintiff,but the second circuit reversed and remanded that case for a new trial because it was not possible to determine from the jury instructions whether the jury found the defendant liable on the theory of respondeat superior,which is not available in a claim.gierlinger police,cir.the second trial,for reasons discussed below,ended in a mistrial.and the third trial ended with a verdict for the plaintiff.in its ruling on attorney fees following the third trial,the district court denied the plaintiff attorney fees for the first two trials,reasoning that the plaintiff bore significant responsibility for the errors that voided those trials.
the second circuit reversed,awarding plaintiff attorney fees for all the trials.gierlinger,at.a close analysis of the second circuit reasoning,however,suggests that had the plaintiff been responsible for the errors that voided the first two trials,compensation for attorney fees for those trials would not have been appropriate.for instance,in its ruling as to the award of fees for the first trial,the second circuit,focusing on the reasonableness of the plaintiff actions in that trial,noted that 
if the plaintiff had proposed erroneous jury instructions,or if she had opposed correct instructions there would be a strong basis for denying her fees for some,if not all,of the hours her attorney expended on the first trial.but the record shows just the opposite when the court asked whether the plaintiff objected to the addition of a specific instruction that there could be no liability on a respondeat superior theory,her attorney answered in the negative 
gierlinger,at.similar reasoning is evident in the court ruling that the plaintiff could receive fees for the second trial.the district court had ruled that the plaintiff should not receive attorney fees for the second trial because the plaintiff had caused the mistrial when she,along with her attorney,gave an interview about the case to a reporter.in reversing this ruling,the second circuit found that the record belies the district court rationale that plaintiff attorney bore significant responsibility for the mistrial.id.at.rather,the second circuit noted that the district court in granting the mistrial had specifically stated on the record that the publicity in and of itself would justify declaring a mistrial,but other problems,not attributable to the plaintiff,did warrant a mistrial.id.quoting the district judge at the second trial.
therefore,the second circuit reasoned that the plaintiff could receive attorney fees for both the first and second trial because the plaintiff had not been responsible for the errors that voided those trials.id.at.the first circuit has agreed with the second circuit,finding that when a plaintiff prevails at a second trial,he or she may receive attorney fees for both trials so long as the mistake that made the second trial necessary is not attributable to the plaintiff,at.
in the case at bar,the district court,in its ruling on attorney fees,held that shott was not responsible for the errors of the first trial and therefore could receive attorney fees for that trial.in that ruling on attorney fees,the district court stated that it had granted a new trial because the verdict was against the weight of the evidence,not because of any errors committed by the plaintiff.we find that the record does not support this ruling.
first,and most importantly,the district court,in its order granting a new trial,stated that shott pursued an unreasonable strategy that prejudiced rush such that the verdict had to be set aside 
while the court believes that there is some evidence in the record that could support the jury verdict on the disability claim,it concludes that rush was prejudiced by the way this case was tried and is entitled to a new trial.plaintiff strategy was to throw at the jury approximately months of alleged misconduct by preisler and leave it to the jury to sort out his motivation.under some circumstances this would be a reasonable strategy,but in this case,because shott brought her need for an accommodation to preisler attention so late in the sequence of events,there is substantial likelihood that the jury considered against rush on the disability claim conduct that preceded any attempt at the good faith interactive process the law requires.
at.from this statement,it appears that the district court actually was unsure that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence there is some evidence in the record that could support the jury verdict,but was sure that rush was prejudiced by shott presentation of her presentation that the district court found unreasonable.so,in contrast to the situation we faced in jaffee we held that the district court erred because it refused to award attorney fees for the first trial even though it had found the plaintiff strategy at that trial to be reasonable,see jaffee ii,at the district court awarded attorney fees even though it had found the plaintiff strategy at the first trial to be unreasonable.
second,shott opposed jury instructions that may well have alleviated the errors of the first trial.in the first trial,the district court was concerned that the jury would hold rush responsible for failing to accommodate shott disability based on events that occurred before shott ever requested an accommodation.rush had requested an instruction jury instruction that addressed this concern 
for purposes of shott disability claims,you are directed to focus on events that occurred after may,the date she first requested an accommodation for her disability.
in its attorney fee ruling,in finding that shott had not been responsible for the failure to instruct the jury on this point,the district court laid blame upon itself for not adequately guid ing the jury consideration of the temporally overlapping discrimination claims in light of the requirement that defendant duty to accommodate did not arise until plaintiff brought her need for an accommodation to the defendant attention.at.in its new trial order,however,the district court stated that its failure to instruct the jury properly was in fact the result of shott arguments against such instruction 
the court rejected instruction based on plaintiff argument that her disability was obvious to everyone prior to the day on which preisler was advised of shott disability.but reviewing all the evidence,it is clear that while her disability may have been obvious,her need for an accommodation was not obvious.
at.again,the reasons given by the district court for granting a new trial in the attorney fee ruling do not follow the reasons given in its new trial order.furthermore,we note that this situation,where a plaintiff unreasonably opposed a proper jury instruction that might have cured the errors of the trial,is almost identical to the situation that the second circuit opined would present a strong basis for denying her fees for some,if not all,of the hours her attorney expended on the first trial.gierlinger,at.
shott acknowledges that she opposed jury instruction,specifically the focus on language,but she maintains that she did agree that the court could instruct the jury that may,was the first date that she requested an accommodation for her disabilit
