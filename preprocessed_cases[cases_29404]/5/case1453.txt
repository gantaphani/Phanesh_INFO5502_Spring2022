in due course,masias filed a claim for attorneys fees under the act.subsequently,on march,the special master issued a decision on interim attorneys fees and costs,awarding masias in attorneys fees and in costs for the merits phase of the litigation,amounts that the special master determined were not reasonably in dispute.masias sec y of health human,wl,at,interim decision.this resulted in an interim award of attorneys fees and costs in the total amount of,with judgment being entered accordingly.id.at.the special master deferred until his final decision resolution of the remaining fees and costs issues in the case.id.at.most important among these was the hourly rate for work performed by masias attorney,robert moxley.id

background 
the vaccine act authorizes special masters to issue decisions with respect to whether compensation is to be provided under the vaccine program and the amount of such compensation.d a.when,as here,compensation is awarded under the act for a injury or death,the petitioner is entitled to receive reasonable attorneys fees and other costs.e.in addition,unlike most statutes,even if the petitioner is not awarded compensation under the act,reasonable attorneys fees and other costs may be awarded if the special master or the court determines that the petition was brought in good faith and that there was a reasonable basis for the claim.see id because masias was awarded compensation for his vaccine injury,there is no dispute that the special master was required to award attorneys fees and costs in this case.
to determine the attorneys fees due to masias,the special master began with the lodestar approach.we have endorsed the use of the lodestar approach to determine what constitutes reasonable attorneys fees under the vaccine act.avera sec y of health human.under this approach,the court first makes an initial estimate of a reasonable attorneys fee by multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation times a reasonable hourly rate.id.quoting blum stenson.the court can then adjust the fee award upward or downward based on other specific findings.avera,at.
in avera,we held that,in general,attorneys fees under the vaccine act should be determined using the forum rate for the district of columbia in the lodestar calculation,rather than the rate in the geographic area of the petitioner attorney.id.at.however,we adopted an exception to this rule established by the circuit in davis county solid waste management energy recovery special service district united states environmental protection agency.avera,at.according to the davis county exception,also referred to as the davis exception,the court should use the rates of the attorney locality where the bulk of an attorney work is done outside the jurisdiction of the court and where there is a very significant difference in compensation favoring avera,at quoting davis county,at.
to decide if the davis county exception applied in this case,the special master first sought to determine the hourly rate for attorneys in cheyenne,wyoming,where moxley practices.after reviewing several attorney affidavits and statements in various federal and state court decisions with respect to reasonable rates for attorneys in wyoming,the special master found that the local rate for moxley services was per hour for,increasing proportionately through to per hour.fees decision,wl,at,app.tbl.the special master then determined that attorneys with similar experience providing services in the vaccine program in washington,would charge to per hour,and that,within this range,moxley would likely receive per hour if he practiced in washington,id.at.in arriving at this rate,the special master rejected masias argument that the laffey matrix,a matrix of different hourly rates in washington,should apply.fees decision,at,citing laffey nw.airlines,aff in part,rev in part on other grounds,overruled by save our cumberland mountains,hodel,f d we do not intend,by this remand,to diminish the value of the fee schedule compiled by the district court in laffey.although noting that many courts have awarded attorneys fees based on the laffey matrix,the special master found he was not bound to follow the matrix since masias did not establish that moxley provided services similar to attorneys under the laffey matrix,as required by blum.fees decision,wl,at see avera,at in blum,the supreme court explained that a reasonable hourly rate is the prevailing market rate,defined as the rate prevailing in the community for similar services by lawyers of reasonably comparable skill,experience,and reputation.quoting blum,at.
after calculating that there was a percent differential between the rates for similar legal services in cheyenne,wyoming and the appropriate forum,the district of columbia,the special master found this difference to be very significant.fees decision,wl,at.the special master also found that there was no evidence that moxley performed any work on the case within the district of columbia.id.at.having found the two requirements of the davis county exception met,the special master awarded masias attorneys fees for moxley services at the cheyenne,wyoming rate of to per hour.id.at.
since the interim decision had addressed the fees due to masias for time spent by moxley on the merits phase of the case,using rates identical to those deemed to be reasonable rates in the fees decision,the only fees to which masias still could be entitled were for moxley work seeking attorneys fees.id.at.noting that the rates he had found applicable were approximately percent of the rates requested by masias,the special master calculated the fees due by reducing the total amount of the request by percent to arrive at the amount of id.at.
a petitioner can request review of a special master decision by the court of federal claims under e.as noted above,masias request for review was denied and the opinion of the special master affirmed.masias then appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a and f.
discussion 
under the vaccine act,we review a decision of the special master under the same standard as the court of federal claims and determine if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.e b,markovich sec y of health human.each standard applies to a different aspect of the judgment.munn sec y of dep t of health human.we review fact findings by the special master under the arbitrary and capricious standard.id.arbitrary and capricious is a highly deferential standard of review.hines sec y of dep t of health human.if the special master has considered the relevant evidence of record,drawn plausible inferences and articulated a rational basis for the decision,reversible error will be extremely difficult to demonstrate.id.we review discretionary rulings under the abuse of discretion standard.munn,at.n ot in accordance with law refers to the application of the wrong legal standard the application of the law is reviewed de novo.see markovich,at.
masias presents several arguments on appeal.first,he contends that the federal circuit erred in avera when it adopted the davis county exception to the forum rule and that the laffey matrix should have been applied in this case.
masias argues that the adoption of the davis county exception in avera was motivated to prevent windfalls to petitioners,and that this reasoning was undermined by richlin security service chertoff,which was decided after avera.in richlin,the supreme court held that reimbursement for paralegal time to a prevailing party under the equal access to justice act should be made at prevailing market rates,not at the reasonable cost to the attorney.id.at.
we do not view richlin as having undermined avera adoption of the davis county exception.the supreme court adoption of market rates for paralegal fees is not contrary to avera.as seen,in avera we determined that one market rate,the forum rate,should generally apply for attorneys fees but that,in certain circumstances,another market rate,the locality rate,should apply.thus,avera remains binding precedent until it is overturned by the supreme court or by this court en banc.barclay united states,sacco dep t of justice,mcallister sec y of health human,the panel could,of course,recommend to the full court that it take this case en banc to reconsider avera,see federal circuit rule a henderson shinseki,rev,wl,but we decline to do so.avera is thorough,and has not been undermined.
masias does not dispute that moxley performed the entirety of his work outside the district of columbia,and that the district of columbia rates deemed applicable by the special master are significantly higher than the cheyenne,wyoming rates the special master determined applicable.following avera and davis county,we hold that the special master did not err in not applying a laffey matrix rate and in awarding attorneys fees at the lower cheyenne rate 
masias second argument on appeal is an alternative to his contention that the special master should have applied the laffey matrix.as his alternative argument,masias urges that the special master erred in determining that to per hour was the appropriate rate for moxley legal services.in making this argument,he appears to advance two contentions.his first contention is that,in determining the hourly rate component of attorneys fees awards in vaccine act cases,special masters should employ a federal specialty rate.his second contention is that the special master erred in determining that,in this case,to was the appropriate hourly rate for moxley legal services in cheyenne,wyoming.
first,masias argues that the proper locality rate for vaccine act practice is the hourly rate attorneys in the locality charge for complex,federal litigation.therefore,he contends,his attorneys fees should be compensated at a federal specialty rate.according to masias,defining the market for attorney services based solely on geography is overly simplistic because the financial demands of vaccine act practice exceed those of a local legal practice.masias points to the laffey matrix as an indication that attorneys fees in washington,federal courts for complex litigation in were in the range of to per hour.he asserts that in cheyenne,wyoming,the rate for comparable complex federal litigation was to per hour.
masias directs us to affidavits from attorneys who have participated in vaccine act litigation and argues that those affidavits support the proposition that vaccine program practice is complex.in support of the locality rates he proposes,he also relies on an affidavit by attorney donald schultz,who practices commercial,construction,and energy litigation in cheyenne.masias claims that his proposed federal specialty rate is also validated by the federal government locality pay percentage for federal employees in wyoming in further support of his argument for a federal specialty rate,masias relies on two affidavits by economist michael kavanaugh an august,affidavit originally filed in avera,and a february,affidavit that focuses on identifying what kavanaugh perceives as errors in avera and the davis county exception 
we reject masias argument for a federal specialty rate as an attempt to circumvent avera application of the davis county exception.further,we recognize,as we did in avera and as the special master did in the fees decision,that in blum the supreme court explained that a reasonable hourly rate for the service of a lawyer is the prevailing market rate,defined as the rate prevailing in the community for similar services by lawyers of reasonably comparable skill,experience,and reputation.blum,at.
in the fees decision,the special master determined that masias failed to establish that moxley provided similar services to attorneys receiving laffey matrix rates.in reaching that determination,he found that the attorney affidavits provided by masias in support of his claim that vaccine program litigation is complex were conclusory and that the affiants were far from disinterested observers.fees decision,wl,at,he also found that kavanaugh february,affidavit was largely misdirected in the sense that kavanaugh disagrees with the federal circuit decision in avera.id.at.finally,as discussed below,he determined that schultz rates were not a valid basis for comparison.
the special master reasoned that,as compared to the litigation in laffey,masias case was less complex,did not present any novel issues of law,and did not require appellate review on the merits.the special master noted that in vaccine act litigation,evidence need not be presented under the federal rules of evidence and that attorneys need only present their case to a trained special master,not a jury.id.at.
our review of the special master factual findings is limited to a determination of whether the special master abused his discretion.we agree with the government that the special master considered the relevant evidence,drew plausible inferences,and articulated a rational basis for his finding that,under blum,masias did not establish that the services moxley provided were similar services to those provided by the attorneys in laffey.having failed to establish this,masias effectively failed to establish that he deserved compensation for attorneys fees at rates awarded in complex federal litigation.
as noted,masias second contention is that the special master erred in determining the appropriate hourly rate for moxley legal services in cheyenne,wyoming.under e,the special master was required to award reasonable attorneys fees,and therefore the hourly rate he employed also had to be reasonable.see saxton ex rel.saxton sec y of dep t of health human.the special master determined that a reasonable local rate for moxley services was per hour for,thereafter increasing proportionately through.on that basis,the special master determined that per hour was the appropriate rate for moxley legal services.
in arriving at that rate,the special master analyzed attorney affidavits presented by masias and statements of reasonable rates for attorneys in cheyenne from various federal and state legal decisions.with regard to the former,the special master was particularly influenced by a affidavit by moxley in which he stated that he has charged his clients in cheyenne per hour since,increasing to per hour in september of,which moxley noted was a very high hourly rate for the cheyenne market.fees decision,wl,at.the special master also noted that moxley has not been awarded more than per hour for either his or other work.id.at.masias also presented the affidavits of other attorneys practicing in cheyenne,wyoming.as noted,among these affidavits was that of donald schultz.schultz stated that he had personal knowledge of hourly billing rates in the range of to per hour being charged currently to,and paid regularly by,private clients of cheyenne,wyoming and jackson,wyoming litigation attorneys who have experience akin to moxley and who are billing for their services in complex litigation matters pending in the district of wyoming.the special master was not persuaded by the schultz affidavit because,in his view,masias did not establish that the rates set forth by schultz were a valid basis for comparison,given schultz experience in a large,national firm with multiple offices,whereas moxley practices in a small firm with a single location.fees decision,wl,at.
as is evident from the fees decision,the special master performed a detailed and careful analysis of the relevant affidavits,including the affidavit submitted by moxley,and he thoroughly reviewed fee rates previously awarded to practitioners in similar localities.we can not say his decision to give little weight to the several affidavits was arbitrary,capricious,or an abuse of discretion.
masias disputes the special master reliance on statements of reasonable rates for attorneys in cheyenne,wyoming from various legal decisions,arguing that hourly rates do not define a market among the decisions considered by the special master,fees decision,wl,at,were several arising out of cases in the vaccine program where hourly rates increased from in when masias claim was filed to in.see hart sec y of health human,wl,at,per hour to moxley and his partner for work done in gallagher sec y of dep t of health human,wl at,tbl.nn.may,per hour to moxley for work done in the early barnes sec y of health human,wl,at,per hour to moxley for work done in walker sec y of dep t of health human,wl,at,per hour to moxley for work done in the early estabrook sec y of dep t of health human,wl,at,per hour to moxley for work done in.the special master also considered the fact that we upheld a special master award of per hour to moxley in avera.see avera,at.in addition,the special master noted that an order amending the judgment in avera awarded petitioners an additional in attorneys fees,which,according to moxley calculations,represented an award of per hour.fees decision,wl,at citing avera sec y of health human,june,order amending judgment.
although acknowledging that decisions outside the vaccine program can not consider circumstances relating to the program,the special master found value in decisions by wyoming courts in other legal contexts,including employment discrimination,class action litigation,and contracts,due to the judicial officials knowledge about the local legal community.fees decision,wl,at,app.tbl.according to the special master,courts in wyoming have awarded attorneys fees ranging from per hour in to,in one case,per hour in.id.at.in his determination,the special master emphasized the decision of the wyoming supreme court in morrison.fees decision,wl,at.in morrison,the court affirmed the trial court decision limiting attorneys to an hourly rate of in a case challenging an arbitration pursuant to a stock purchase agreement,as this represented a reasonable rate in casper,wyoming.morrison clay.
we see no error in the special master reliance on determinations relating to attorneys fees in prior vaccine act cases and in other types of cases in wyoming.see saxton,at,stating that it was in the special master discretion to reduce the number of hours in fee request by percent where analysis,including a survey of every fee award made since the beginning of the vaccine program,revealed petitioners attorneys,on average,requested reimbursement for roughly twice as many hours as other firms handling multiple vaccine cases.indeed,it was entirely reasonable for the special master to look to relevant prior decisions addressing hourly rates for legal services in wyoming in order to determine the relevant local rate for cheyenne,wyoming.
in sum,because the special master considered the relevant evidence,drew plausible inferences,and articulated a rational basis for his decision,his determination that a reasonable locality rate for moxley services was per hour was not arbitrary,capricious,or an abuse of discretion 
masias third argument on appeal is that the vaccine act violates the appointments clause of the constitution because it authorizes special masters to issue decisions without affording an opportunity for de novo review by court of federal claims judges masias argues that because the court of federal claims does not review all special masters decisions de novo,special masters are given the power to render final decisions on behalf of the united states without requiring the permission of other executive officers.thus,he urges,they serve as principal,not inferior,officers of the united states within the meaning of the appointments clause.masias argues that this is unconstitutional because special masters are not subject to the appointment process for principal officers of the united states set forth in the appointments clause,which mandates appointment by the president with the advice and consent of the senate for such officers.pet r br.reply br.
the appointments clause of article ii of the constitution reads as follows 
the president shall nominate,and by and with the advice and consent of the senate,shall appoint ambassadors,other public ministers and consuls,judges of the supreme court,and all other officers of the united states,whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for,and which shall be established by law but the congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers,as they think proper,in the president alone,in the courts of law,or in the heads of departments.
const.art.ii,cl.
the question we must decide is whether special masters qualify as inferior officers within the meaning of the appointments clause,for if they do,the provisions of the vaccine act authorizing them to issue decisions on compensation,d a,and providing for review of those decisions by the court of federal claims,e b,are not unconstitutional.in edmond united states,the supreme court described inferior officers under article ii,section of the constitution as those whose work is directed and supervised at some level by others,namely,principal officers,who were appointed by presidential nomination with the advice and consent of the senate.at.the court stated that the mere fact that an officer is charged with exercising significant authority on behalf of the united states does not necessarily render the officer a principal officer.id.at the exercise of significant authority pursuant to the laws of the united states marks,not the line between principal and inferior officer for appointments clause purposes,but rather,the line between officer and nonofficer.citing freytag commissioner,and buckley valeo.
in edmond,judges of the coast guard court of criminal appeals were found to be inferior officers for two reasons.first,the court pointed to the supervision over their work exercised by the general counsel of the department of transportation in his capacity as judge advocate general of the coast guard,in which he was found to exercise administrative oversight.at the court also pointed to the ability of the court of appeals for the armed forces to reverse the judges decisions.at.in that regard,the court acknowledged that the scope of review exercised by the court of appeals for the armed forces over the coast guard court of criminal appeals was limited,but stated that the limitation upon review did not render the judges principal officers.id.at.
special masters,like the judges of the coast guard court of criminal appeals in edmond,are directed and supervised by principal officers who have undergone a nomination and confirmation process special masters are appointed by the judges of the court of federal claims,c,who,in turn,are appointed by the president by and with the advice and consent of the senate,a.at the same time,the special masters are administratively supervised by the judges of the c
