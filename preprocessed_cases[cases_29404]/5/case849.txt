hussein is a man of indian descent who is a native of the island of fiji,where he was raised as a muslim.he moved to the united states in.trans states,which is based in louis,missouri,hired hussein as a pilot on february.on september,when commercial air travel was suspended as a consequence of the terrorist attacks on september,hussein returned a trans states plane to the louis airport.he then rented a room at a nearby howard johnson hotel.
at some time between september and september,captain daniel reed,trans states vice president of flight operations,received what he said was an anonymous phone call regarding hussein.according to reed testimony in this case,the caller reported that a pilot in a trans states uniform had been in a bar at the howard johnson hotel making comments about the attacks of september,and that a bartender had asked him to leave.reed said that he asked how the caller knew the person was a trans states pilot,and the caller replied that he had read the pilot identification tag and then gave his last name as hussein.reed remembered the caller saying that a trans world airlines pilot had followed hussein out of the bar,at which time hussein took off some of his uniform pieces and went into another bar at the hotel.
reed testified that he asked his flight managers about hussein,and they confirmed that trans states employed a pilot named mohammed hussein.reed said he asked a manager on his staff to verify that hussein was in louis at the time of the reported incident.he recalled that within an hour,he received a report that hussein should have been in the louis area,and that he was a probationary employee.reed stated that he then decided to dismiss hussein and directed one of the flight managers to carry out the termination.
michael swoboda,then a flight manager at trans states,informed hussein of his termination on september.swoboda testified that when reed returned from taking the anonymous telephone call,he asked for information about mohammed hussein.swoboda recalled telling reed that hussein was a first officer based in louis,and that he was probably a probationary employee.swoboda testified that reed then directed swoboda to terminate hussein employment.another flight manager,rodney aman,overheard reed speaking on the telephone when he received the anonymous call about hussein.paraphrasing the conversation,aman remembered reed saying,it does matter,and it does matter,he was in a bar in uniform,during the course of the call.
it was later revealed that the anonymous caller was a pilot employed by trans world airlines named emmet conrecode.conrecode was staying at the howard johnson hotel in louis on september.he testified in this case that while he was in a bar at the hotel eating dinner,he observed a man walk into the bar wearing a pilot uniform.according to conrecode,the man drank a beer at the bar,and when a television showed a replay of an aircraft hitting one of the world trade center towers,the man raised his beer as in a salute and took a swig.the man eventually left the bar,and another pilot told conrecode that he told the man to get out of the bar in uniform.conrecode said the man later returned with epaulets removed from his uniform,and that during this second visit to the bar,the man announced that he was going to fly an airplane the next day.conrecode testified that he later inquired about the man identity at the front desk of the hotel,and the desk manager identified him as a trans states pilot named hussein.
conrecode testified that he could not sleep that night,and he decided to contact the federal bureau of investigation early in the morning of september.he left a message,and the fbi interviewed conrecode later that day.conrecode stated that he also contacted the airport police when he realized that the man he observed in the bar could gain access to an aircraft if flight operations resumed in the morning.he described to the duty officer the behavior of a pilot in uniform drinking in a bar and reporting that he was going to be flying the next day and that he was acting in a strange manner.conrecode further testified that he called trans states airlines on september and spoke with a manager who left a meeting to take the telephone call.conrecode recalled that he told the trans states manager that hussein had been drinking in a bar in uniform,and that he seemed to be intimidating passengers by that action.conrecode may have mentioned what he perceived as hussein support for the september terrorists.conrecode said he was not sure whether he identified himself to the trans states manager.
conrecode report to law enforcement prompted an investigation by the fbi.according to the reports of an fbi agent and airport police officer who interviewed hussein on september,hussein admitted that he was wearing an epauletted white shirt and blue pants while drinking alcoholic beverages and eating dinner in a bar at the howard johnson hotel.the officer and agent,respectively,reported that hussein acknowledged on september,that his attire in the bar did identify him as a pilot and was indicative of a member of a flight crew.def.app.at.hussein testified in a deposition in that he was not wearing his uniform with epaulets on the shirt in the bar at howard johnson,but he did not recall whether he had worn his uniform shirt and slacks in the bar.pls.app.at.hussein averred in a declaration that he never made any statement or gesture indicating that he approved of the terrorist attacks of september,and that he has always believed those acts were contemptible and horrific.hussein testified that he was smiling while in the bar because he had learned earlier in the day that his wife was pregnant.
at some point after the fbi interviewed conrecode,the fbi agent called reed about hussein.according to a report of reed interview in august with an interviewer from the eeoc,reed said that he decided to terminate hussein since he had received this call from the fbi and since hussein was already suspected of being in a drinking establishment.pls.app.at.reed testified at his deposition in,however,that he received the call from the fbi agent after he made his decision to terminate hussein.
on october,hussein filed an initial questionnaire with the eeoc regarding his discharge,and filed a charge of discrimination in violation of title vii with the eeoc on december.after an investigation,the eeoc determined that trans states violated title vii by terminating hussein on account of his religion,race,or national origin.the parties entered conciliation discussions,but could not reach a settlement,and the eeoc filed this action,in which hussein subsequently intervened as a plaintiff.
trans states moved for summary judgment on all counts.in granting the motion,the district court found that hussein had provided no evidence that trans states fabricated the telephone call from conrecode to reed.the court also found that because of his probationary status,hussein was not entitled to certain disciplinary procedures established by the collective bargaining agreement and employee handbook.the court further concluded that probationary pilots had been treated in the same way as hussein,that hussein provided no evidence that his religion,race,or national origin influenced reed termination decision,and that without more,the timing of hussein termination in relation to the september terrorist attacks could not support a finding that trans states explanation for his termination was a pretext for discrimination.
trans states also moved for attorneys fees pursuant to and k,arguing that plaintiffs frivolously and vexatiously proceeded with this action,and that the eeoc did not satisfy its duty to conciliate in good faith.the court found that although plaintiffs claims were meritless,they were not frivolous or groundless.the court also found that the eeoc conciliated in good faith.accordingly,the court denied trans states motion for attorneys fees.
the eeoc and hussein appeal the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of trans states on the plaintiffs claims under title vii and the missouri human rights act.summary judgment is appropriate if,considering all reasonable inferences from the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,there is no genuine issue as to any material fact,and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.c hitt harsco,cir.we review de novo the district court grant of a motion for summary judgment.
a plaintiff raising claims of employment discrimination may survive a motion for summary judgment either by proof of direct evidence of discrimination,or by creating the requisite inference of unlawful discrimination through the framework described in mcdonnell douglas green,d.see griffith city of des moines,cir finley empiregas,cir applying title vii framework to claims under missouri human rights act.there is no evidence that reed or others at trans state made statements evidencing hostility to persons of the islamic faith or persons of hussein race,religion,or national origin.the eeoc and hussein rely on circumstantial evidence,including the timing of the termination,inferences to be drawn from hussein name,reed explanations for the termination,and an alleged deviation from progressive discipline procedures outlined in an employee handbook,to support their contention that trans states acted with an unlawful motive.this circumstantial evidence is not the sort of strong evidence showing a specific link between the alleged discriminatory animus and the challenged decision that would support a finding of illegal discrimination under the direct evidence approach.see griffith,at internal quotation omitted.we therefore consider the claims under the mcdonnell douglas framework.
because the record was fully developed on motions for summary judgment,we may turn to the ultimate question of discrimination vel non.see riser target,cir johnson ready mixed concrete,cir.trans states articulated a legitimate,explanation for terminating hussein,namely,that on the evening of september,hussein violated company policy by entering a hotel bar while in uniform.see kiel select artificials,cir en banc violating company policies is a legitimate reason for termination.whether hussein actually violated the company policy by appearing in the bar in uniform is not dispositive.the relevant question is whether the plaintiffs can show that trans states was motivated by discriminatory animus,rather than solely by its belief that hussein violated company policy.see scroggins of,cir.the plaintiffs have the burden to show that the company legitimate explanation was a pretext for illegal discrimination.griffith,at.
in support of their contention that the evidence shows unlawful discrimination based on race,religion,and national origin,the plaintiffs contend that reed must have assumed that a pilot named mohammed hussein was muslim and arab.hussein says a fact finder would have to ignore common sense to conclude that reed made no connection between the name mohammed hussein and being muslim and arab.hussein br.at.similarly,the eeoc says t hat a person would not connect the name mohammed hussein with being muslim and arab defies belief.eeoc br.at.
it is undisputed,however,that hussein is not arab.he is of indian descent.eeoc br.at.plaintiffs argument,therefore,is that it would defy belief and ignore common sense for a jury to conclude that reed may accurately have declined to assume that a person with hussein name must be of arabic descent.the contention that a jury necessarily would infer that reed engaged in inaccurate stereotyping is not attractive.and assuming arguendo that a might have an actionable claim under title vii based on race or national origin if his objective appearance to others was as an arab,bennun rutgers state,cir,there is no evidence that reed ever observed hussein.app.at.the asserted inference that a person named mohammed hussein would follow the islamic faith is at least consistent with the facts of this case,although we think it is generally understood that most persons are named at birth by their parents,but develop their religious beliefs over a lifetime.as reed testified,there jewish names that are christians and there muslim names that are arabic names that are muslim.pls.app.at.there is no evidence that reed was informed of hussein race,religion,or national origin,or that he commented about them.reed testified that he never thought about hussein religion,and the inference that he assumed it and then considered it in making the employment determination is rather tenuous.
but assuming for the sake of argument that a reasonable jury could find that reed inferred that hussein was muslim or arab at the time of the employment decision,we turn to the plaintiffs attack on the airline legitimate for the termination.their principal contention is that reed he dismissed hussein based on an anonymous telephone call,without any investigation of the claims of inherently incredible.they argue that a jury reasonably could conclude that hussein was terminated in a precipitous manner for the alleged infraction only because the incident occurred shortly after the september attacks and reed believed that the muslim.they seek to bolster this theory with contentions that trans states varied from company policies and procedures calling for progressive discipline,and that other probationary employees received more lenient treatment under similar circumstances.they also rely on variations in reed explanation for the sequence of events leading to the termination.
we are not persuaded that these arguments based on circumstantial evidence are sufficient to support a finding of intentional discrimination.first,the disciplinary policies and procedures adopted by trans states do not support an inference of discrimination.plaintiffs point to trans states employee handbook,which states that a system of progressive discipline will be used when employees violate company procedures or rules.the handbook does not distinguish between probationary and employees,so plaintiffs contend that the failure to afford hussein an opportunity for progressive discipline suggests that reed was motivated by unlawful considerations.but the collective bargaining agreement between trans states and the airline pilots includes a subsection regarding discipline and discharge,which specifically provides that n othing in this agreement shall be construed as extending the rights of that subsection to a pilot during his probationary period.the rights that are not extended to a probationary pilot include a prohibition on discharge without just cause,a right to present information concerning a potential disciplinary matter,and the right to notice of the facts on which discipline is based.it is undisputed that if the employee handbook and the cba conflict,then the cba controls.to the extent that the employee handbook grants a probationary pilot a right to progressive discipline,it conflicts with the cba,for it would undermine the express provision of the cba that declines to require even just cause or notice before a probationer is discharged.trans states,therefore,did not violate its policies and procedures by terminating hussein,rather than imposing a lesser sanction,and by discharging him without notice and an opportunity to be heard.
second,plaintiffs have not demonstrated that probationary pilots have received more favorable treatment from reed than did hussein.to establish that a employee received more favorable treatment,the evidence must show that the employee dealt with the same supervisor,was subject to the same standards,and engaged in the same conduct without any mitigating or distinguishing circumstances.cherry ritenour sch,cir internal quotation omitted.reed testified that in,he terminated prob
