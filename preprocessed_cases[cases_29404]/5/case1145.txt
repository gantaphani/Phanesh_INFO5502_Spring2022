the alphabet soup world of pension benefits has spawned a dizzying array of acronyms,like erisa,qdro,and qpsa,and a complex web of interrelated statutory provisions.in a case of first impression,our challenge is to cut through the dense language to figure out what congress meant in terms of surviving spouse benefits under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,stat,as amended,et.
in the case before us,two pension funds,the plumbers pipefitters national pension fund national pension fund and the washington state plumbing pipefitting industry pension plan for local union state plan collectively the plans and mary hamilton,the surviving spouse of plan participant michael hamilton,appeal the district court summary judgment and award of attorneys fees to michael children from a previous marriage,david and sarah hamilton the children.after michael death,mary and the children claimed competing rights to survivor benefits.the district court found that the marital dissolution order,which required michael to name the children as beneficiaries under the plans,was a valid qualified domestic relations order qdro under erisa that took precedence over mary right to a qualified preretirement survivor annuity qpsa.
this scenario requires us to address the intersection between a surviving spouse survivor annuity,a qpsa,and a marriage dissolution order,a qdro,that is silent with respect to surviving spouse rights.relying on the plain language of the statute,we hold that the purported assignment of pension rights did not meet the strict requirements of a qdro.even if the dissolution order is liberally construed as a qdro,under the statutory language coupled with a complementary interpretation of the plans,the surviving spouse benefit must be explicitly assigned to a former spouse in a qdro in order to overcome the surviving spouse right to an annuity under erisa.consequently,mary,the surviving spouse,prevails over the children in this debate over statutory construction,plain language,and plan language,and we reverse the judgment of the district court.
background 
the essential facts are not in dispute.michael was a participant in the national pension fund,the state plan and the supplemental plan.the plans are defined benefit pension plans subject to the provisions of erisa.michael and his first wife,linda oppegaard,were divorced in april.a marital dissolution order filed with the state court provided that,with regard to the plans,michael shall name the children of the marriage,david and sarah,as the beneficiaries under the pension in lieu of life insurance which he is presently unable to obtain,which obligation shall terminate when the youngest child reaches years of age.the dissolution order made no reference to surviving spouse rights nor did it delineate which pension rights were at issue,the amounts to be paid or when the payments were to begin.
about two months after the divorce,michael married mary hamilton.soon after they were married,michael named mary as the beneficiary for death benefits payable under the national pension fund and state plan mary only asserts her rights to benefits as a result of her status as the surviving spouse,not as the designated beneficiary.michael died in a car accident in at the age of.at the time of his death,he was still married to mary and both children were under the age of.he was a fully vested participant in the plans,had not yet retired and was not receiving pension benefits.
the plans provide that if a vested participant dies before retirement,benefits will be paid to a surviving spouse or,in the event that such surviving spouse benefits are not payable,a lump sum death benefit will be paid to another beneficiary designated by the plan participant.once mary asserted rights to surviving spouse benefits under the plans,the children asserted competing rights on the ground that the marital dissolution order entitled them to benefits.the national pension fund and the state plan denied the children claims,reasoning that mary was entitled to a surviving spouse benefit under erisa.the supplemental plan took no position on the merits of the claims.
in the course of the inevitable litigation over this clash of rights,the district court granted summary judgment to the children and entered a judgment in their favor in an amount totaling the contributions made to the plans on michael behalf.the district court determined that the plans respective denials of the children claims were arbitrary and capricious because the dissolution decree was a valid qdro under erisa,and the designation of the children as alternate payees in the qdro took precedence over mary right as the surviving spouse.the court also awarded the children attorneys fees,costs,and prejudgment interest pursuant to g.
statutory framework 
congress enacted erisa to ensure the proper administration of employee benefit plans,including pension plans,both during the years of an employee active service and after retirement.see boggs boggs,d.the principal object of erisa is to protect plan participants and beneficiaries.id.at.citing shaw delta air lines,d erisa is a comprehensive statute designed to promote the interests of employees and their beneficiaries in employment benefit plans see also b stating that the policy of erisa is to protect the interest of participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries.to this end,erisa requires pension plans to conform to a myriad of reporting,disclosure,participation,vesting and funding requirements.see.
the retirement equity act of rea,stat,amended erisa in two important ways with respect to surviving spouses.rea first sought to ensure a stream of income to surviving spouses by requiring pension plans to provide automatic surviving spouse benefits.boggs,at.section,as amended by rea,provides that if a vested participant dies before the annuity start date,leaving a surviving spouse to whom he has been married for at least one year,a qualified preretirement survivor annuity qpsa shall be provided to the surviving spouse.a.the qpsa is an annuity for the life of the surviving spouse that must be at least fifty percent of the annuity amount which would have been payable during the joint lives of the participant and spouse.id.at e.provision of the qpsa may be waived by the participant only if the spouse consents in writing to the designation of another beneficiary.id.at c applying these provisions to the case at hand,it is undisputed that mary was michael surviving spouse at the time of his death,and mary never consented to the designation of another beneficiary.
rea also introduced the qdro exception,id.at d,which elevates a plan participant legal obligations,commonly to a former spouse or children of a previous marriage,over the participant express wishes to provide for other individuals as designated beneficiaries.trustees of the directors guild of pension benefits plans tise,cir.the qdro is a subset of domestic relations orders that recognizes the right of an alternate payee to receive all or a portion of the benefits payable with respect to a participant under the plan.d b i i.if a domestic relations order qualifies as a qdro,the designated alternate payee any spouse,former spouse,child,or other dependent of a participant shall be considered a beneficiary under the plan.id.at d j k.each pension plan shall provide for the payment of benefits in accordance with the applicable requirements of any qualified domestic relations order.id.at d a.
in addition,the statute specifically contemplates the assignment of surviving spouse rights,a qpsa to a former spouse in a qdro 
to the extent provided in any qualified domestic relations order 
i the former spouse of a participant shall be treated as a surviving spouse of such participant for purposes of section of this title and any spouse of the participant shall not be treated as a spouse of the participant for such purposes 
id.at d f i emphasis added.in crafting the qdro exception,congress resolved any uncertainty concerning the authority of state courts to adjudicate marital dissolutions and to affect erisa pension plan benefits.see stewart thorpe holding.profit sharing plan,cir.
together,the surviving spouse and qdro provisions are essential to one of rea central purposes,which is to give enhanced protection to the spouse and dependent children in the event of divorce or separation,and in the event of death,the surviving spouse.boggs,at.apart from these detailed provisions,erisa does not confer beneficiary status on nonparticipants by reason of their marital or dependent status.id.
ii.qdro analysis 
without a doubt,the details required in a qdro present a drafting morass for the lawyer.we recognize the concern expressed by courts and commentators that the failure of domestic relations lawyers to navigate the treacherous shoals of erisa may harm potential beneficiaries.metropolitan life ins.wheaton,cir noting that i deally,every domestic relations lawyer should be conversant with erisa,but it is unrealistic to expect all of them to be see also daniel janich,when remarriage muddies the waters,family advocate unfortunately,failure to include a survivorship provision in the qdro often goes undetected until the participant dies or retires,that is,when the survivor benefits irrevocably vest in the current spouse and it is too late to do anything about it.despite these drafting pitfalls,congress required that qdros be specific and clear because it was concerned with reducing the expense to plan providers and protecting them from suits for making improper payments.in re gendreau,cir.the mandated specificity makes sense so that a pension plan is on notice of its exact obligations to a payee other than a plan participant.in practical terms,a well crafted qdro could avoid precisely the clash of claims presented here.
a domestic relations order qualifies as a qdro only if it meets the specificity requirements set forth in d c the order must specify the name and mailing address of the alternate payee and the affected plan participant,the amount or percentage of the participant benefits to be paid or the means by which that amount will be determined,the number of payments or time period to which the order applies,and each plan to which the order applies.in addition,under d d,a qdro must not require the plan to provide any type of benefit not otherwise provided,require the plan to provide increased benefits,or require benefits to be paid to an alternate payee which must be paid to another alternate payee under another qdro 
we require substantial compliance with these requirements,tise,at,and have rejected an unduly narrow reading of these requirements.stewart,at recognizing that such a reading may frustrate congressional purposes by making it unreasonably difficult for domestic relations orders to qualify as qdros quoting hawkins commissioner of internal revenue,cir emphasis added.we have,however,also echoed the tenth circuit concerns that an overly expansive interpretation may render the specificity requirements toothless.stewart,at rejecting the suggestion that erisa specificity requirements may be eliminated altogether in certain cases hawkins,at nowhere has congress implied that its factual requirements are optional.the pivotal question is whether the dissolution order clearly contains the information specified in the statute that a plan administrator would need to make an informed decision.stewart,at internal quotation marks omitted.here,the paucity of relevant information in the dissolution order compels a negative answer.
exhibit a to the decree of dissolution is a list of property to be distributed to the husband.the only mention of the children and the pension is the cryptic reference with respect to each pension plan that the husband shall name the children of the marriage,david and sarah,as the beneficiaries under the pension in lieu of life insurance which he is presently unable to obtain,which obligation shall terminate when the youngest child reaches years of age.
as the plans pointed out in rejecting the children claim,the order requires the husband to designate the children as beneficiaries but does not require any action by the plans,does not assign death benefits to the children,and does not specify when payments begin or the amount,calculation,or form of the payments nor does the order deal with the issue of the surviving spouse annuity.
the required details are not hypothetical hurdles.under the plans,before the children reached maturity,michael or his qualified beneficiary was potentially eligible for a variety of pension benefits,such as a disability pension,an early retirement pension,death benefits and survivor benefits.the dissolution order neither lays out what pension benefits are at issue nor allocates payment of the benefits.
the district court determined that the references in the dissolution order met the requirements for a qdro.on appeal,the plans argue that qdro or no qdro,the statute mandates payment to the surviving spouse.the dissolution order did not,in our view,qualify as a qdro.nonetheless,because of the ambiguity of the plans position on is,whether they actually challenge the district court give the children the benefit of the doubt and proceed with the analysis under the statute.absent a qdro,the children would not even be in a position to parse the statutory provisions.
iii.statutory interplay between qdros and survivor benefits 
the plans and mary argue that under erisa,a qdro can divest a surviving spouse of her right to a qpsa only if the qdro expressly assigns surviving spouse rights to a former spouse.see d f.this is a question of first impression in this circuit.
in interpreting the statutes in question,o ur task is to construe what congress has enacted.we begin,as always,with the language of the statute.navajo nation dep t health human services,cir en banc quoting duncan walker,d.when looking to the plain language of a statute,we do more than view words or subsections in isolation.we derive meaning from context,and this requires reading the relevant statutory provisions as a whole.california ex rel.lockyer,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
under erisa,a qualified preretirement survivor annuity qpsa shall be provided to the surviving spouse,a emphasis added,absent one consent to waiver of the benefit,id.at c.as the supreme court observed in boggs,congressional concern for the economic security of surviving spouses,is evident from the expansive coverage of requirements,which apply to all individual account plans and defined benefit plans,see b,and the requirement of spousal consent,which prevents e ven a plan participant from defeat ing a nonparticipant surviving spouse statutory entitlement to an annuity.boggs,at.
section must be read in conjunction with d f,which provides that t o the extent provided in any qualified domestic relations order,surviving spouse rights may be assigned to a former spouse.the ordinary interpretation of the phrase to the extent provided means that any assignment of surviving spouse rights in a qdro must be explicit,rather than implicit.in other words,any effort to alienate surviving spouse rights in advance must be spelled out in the qdro.the provision also makes clear that surviving spouse rights must be assigned to a former spouse.by statutory fiat,a former spouse can be treated as the surviving spouse in this limited circumstance.but the bottom line is that the survivor spouse annuity is payable only to the individual qualifying as a surviving spouse or former spouse.
the children argue that d f does not exhaustively delineate how a qdro can assign surviving spouse rights,but instead exemplifies one particular scenario where the alternate payee happens to be a former spouse.the children urge that their qdro is not governed by the language of d f.to accept this argument,we would have to assume that while congress intended for there to be multiple ways to assign surviving spouse rights in a,to children as well as to a former legislature decided to reference explicitly only one of those ways in d f the former spouse leave us guessing about the,the children scenario.such an interpretation is not only unlikely given the comprehensive nature of the qdro provision,but it is also at odds with the mandatory language and strict spousal consent provisions of.together these provisions make clear that congress intended to tightly circumscribe exceptions to the mandatory surviving spouse annuity.
although d a requires a pension plan to provide for the payment of benefits in accordance with the applicable requirements of any qdro,this directive does not change our conclusion.section d a can not be read in isolation as the children suggest.a qdro must generally be enforced,it is true.but it may intrude on a surviving spouse preretirement annuity only in the specific manner set forth in d f.giving meaning to the plain language of the statute,we conclude that mary can not be divested of her right to a qpsa under unless the qdro explicitly assigned those rights to a former spouse here,the purported qdro did not do so.
although the supreme court has not addressed the precise issue here,our interpretation follows the logic of boggs.in boggs,the supreme court held that erisa prohibited a nonparticipant spouse from making a testamentary transfer of her interest in undistributed pension plan benefits to her sons.boggs,at.the court explained that erisa silence with respect to the right of a nonparticipant spouse to control pension plan benefits by testamentary transfer provides powerful support for the conclusion that the right does not exist.id.at.the court went on to note that erisa solicitude for the economic security of surviving spouses would be undermined by allowing a predeceasing spouse heirs and legatees to have a community property interest in the survivor annuity.id.at.to be sure,a testamentary transfer is not a qdro.see ablamis roper,cir.in light of the comprehensive nature of the qdro provision,erisa silence as to the ability of a qdro to override a surviving spouse as set forth in d f supports the view that d f is the exclusive override method,not merely illustrative,as urged by the children 
our reading of the statute is also consistent with the interpretation of other circuits.in dorn international of workers,and cir,the fifth circuit concluded that while a qdro entitled a former spouse to a portion of her monthly pension annuity during his lifetime,she was not entitled to a survivor annuity under erisa because the domestic order nowhere designates her as the surviving or qualified spouse for purposes of any survivor benefit.the third circuit explained in samaroo samaroo,cir,that the terms of a divorce decree were insufficient to entitle a participant to a preretirement surviving spouse annuity because the decree was silent on the issue of survivor rights.we acknowledge that these cases did not address a conflict between children of a former marriage and a surviving spouse.like us,however,these circuits have interpreted the statute to require an explicit assignment of surviving spouse rights in a qdro a general designation of an alternate payee as a pension beneficiary does not serve to designate surviving spouse benefits.
it bears noting that our interpretation is consistent with department of labor dol and internal revenue service irs publications that provide guidance in the drafting of qdros the dol has explained 
a qdro may provide for treatment of a former spouse of a participant as the participant spouse with respect to all or a portion of the spousal survivor benefits that must be provided under federal law only a spouse or former spouse of the participant can be treated as a spouse under a qdro.a child or other dependent who is an alternate payee under a qdro can not be treated as the spouse of a participant.
dol,appendix a qualified qdro,in qdros the division of pensions through qualified domestic relations orders,available at dol guide.the irs offers an identical interpretation,namely that the qdro can name only a spouse or former spouse as a beneficiary of spousal survivor rights.irs notice,wl at,pt,e irs notice.both agencies recommend that the following express language designating surviving spouse rights be included in a qdro to effectuate the assignment of those rights to an alternate payee the alternate payee shall be treated as the participant spouse under the plan for purposes of a and of the code.id.at,pt,e dol guide.the agencies also caution that such an alternate payee must be a spouse and not a child or other dependant of the participant.id.
our interpretation does not render the qdro assignment of benefits to the children illusory.if michael had not remarried,or had he and mary been married for less than a year prior to his death,the children would have been entitled to death benefits under the terms of the plans.alternatively,if michael had waived provision of the survivor spouse annuity with mary consent pursuant to c,the children would have been eligible for death benefits.perhaps the most effective way of ensuring the children receipt of benefits in the event of michael death if this,in fact,was the parties intention at the time of divorce would have been to assign surviving spouse rights to michael former spouse in a qdro,and she in turn could have transferred those benefits to the children.
in short,designating children in a qdro as alternate payees under a pension plan can provide a myriad of potential benefits to the children,depending on their ages,the date of the participant disability,retirement,or death,and the participant marital status.but as to a preretirement surviving spouse annuity,erisa does not permit children to be designated as alternate payees in a qdro.only the surviving spouse or a former spouse properly designated is eligible for those benefits.
the children cite a number of cases in which courts have awarded life insurance proceeds to the alternate payee children or former spouse named in a qdro over the competing claims of the participant widow,absent an express designation of surviving spouse rights.see metropolitan life insurance marsh,cir metropolitan life ins.wheaton,cir carland metropolitan life ins,cir.these cases are inapposite because life insurance policies are not subject to surviving spouse provisions,see b t his section shall apply to any defined benefit plan and any individual account plan.the widows in these cases each claimed benefits as a named beneficiary under the life insurance policy,not as a surviving spouse under.thus,the analysis in these cases does not alter our conclusion.
iv.interpretation of the plans 
our interpretation of the effect of erisa requirements for payment of benefits under a qpsa also tracks the plans provisions and the plan administrators interpretations of that language,which are entitled to deference.see nord black decker disability plan,cir holding that a plan administrator determinations are reviewed for an abuse of discretion where a plan gives the administrator discretionary authority to construe the terms of the plan we must uphold the plan administrators decisions to deny the children lump sum death benefits if they are based upon a reasonable interpretation of the plan terms and made in good faith.mcdaniel v.the chevron corporation,cir.of course,because the plans require conformance with erisa,this review collapses,in practical terms,into a de novo review.
here,the plans provisions are clear that,in the event of a participant death,if a surviving spouse is entitled to an annuity then no lump sum death benefits are payable to the designated beneficiary section of the national pension fund provides 
a lump sum death benefit equal to the contributions made by his employers on his behalf shall be paid to his designated beneficiary.however,if a preretirement surviving spouse pension is payable under section,no death benefit will be paid under this section,unless the participant surviving spouse elects to receive it in accordance with section d.in any event,no benefits shall otherwise be payable under this section if a preretirement surviving spouse pension is payable to the spouse of the participant under section.
similarly,and of the state plan provide 
i f a participant is vested and dies before retirement benefits commence and no beneficiary of his is eligible for benefit payments under section the surviving spouse annuity,then his designated beneficiary shall receive a
