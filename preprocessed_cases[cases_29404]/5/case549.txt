this appeal arises out of a successful suit brought by timothy volk,a prison inmate,against the prison warden and eight correctional officers.volk as the prevailing party now seeks our review of the amount of attorney fees awarded to him by the district court.finding no error,we affirm.
facts and proceedings 
the procedural history of this case is lengthy and complex.volk,a texas state prisoner,filed a suit against the prison warden and eight correctional officers at his prison,alleging a violation of his right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.counsel was subsequently appointed for volk,and all parties consented to proceed before a magistrate judge hereafter the district court.volk filed an amended complaint,adding two more defendants and a new allegation that he had been retaliated against for exercising his right to petition the court for redress of his grievances.
the case proceeded to trial,and the jury found that guy meglareno had violated volk constitutional right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment and that donalda fischer had violated volk constitutional right to petition the court for redress of his grievances.although it also found that the constitutional violations had proximately caused volk compensable injuries,the jury awarded volk zero dollars as damages.
the district court entered a judgment notwithstanding the verdict,awarding volk a total of two dollars in nominal damages against meglareno and fischer.the court also granted in part volk motions for declaratory and injunctive relief,ordering that two prison disciplinary cases against volk be declared void and expunged from his record,volk prior custodial status be restored,and particular credits that volk had not received because of his reduction in custodial status be awarded.
volk filed a.e motion for a new trial or to alter or amend the judgment.he sought a new trial on the liability of the defendants,other than meglareno,whom he had charged with cruel and unusual punishment,and his entitlement to compensatory damages.alternatively,volk asked the district court to alter the judgment by finding that all defendants charged with cruel and unusual punishment were liable and by awarding him compensatory damages of at least against all the defendants.the court denied volk rule e motion.
volk also filed a motion seeking attorney fees,costs,and expenses.during the pendency of volk lawsuit,congress had enacted the prison litigation reform act plra which,inter alia,limits the amount of attorney fees recoverable by successful prisoner litigants.the relevant provisions of the plra state 
in any action brought by a prisoner who is confined to any jail,prison,or other correctional facility,in which attorney fees are authorized under section of this title,such fees shall not be awarded,except to the extent that the fee was directly and reasonably incurred in proving an actual violation of the plaintiff rights protected by a statute pursuant to which a fee may be awarded under section of this title and the amount of the fee is proportionately related to the court ordered sic relief for the violation or the fee was directly and reasonably incurred in enforcing the relief ordered for the violation.whenever a monetary judgment is awarded in an action described above,a portion of the judgment not to exceed percent shall be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney fees awarded against the defendant.if the award of attorney fees is not greater than percent of the judgment,the excess shall be paid by the defendant 
the district court determined that an award of attorney fees was appropriate the plra did not apply to the fee calculations the amount of fees and costs requested by volk was reasonable and volk should recover only of the requested attorney fees and legal assistant fees because the litigation was only partially successful.the court then awarded volk in attorney fees and legal assistant fees,and in court costs.
meglareno and fischer appealed,challenging the district court judgment notwithstanding the verdict,award of declaratory and injunctive relief,and award of attorney fees.volk,contesting the denial of his rule e motion and the amount of his attorney fees award.
in an unpublished opinion volk i,we affirmed the judgment in part,vacated it in part,and reversed and remanded the case for further proceedings.in so doing,we determined that the district court did not err in denying meglareno and fischer requested instruction on qualified immunity or in denying volk motion for a new trial on the issue of damages.
we also rejected meglareno and fischer argument and,finding that neither defendant had the power to effect the district court directives,vacated its grant of injunctive and declaratory relief.we did so,however,with the express understanding that the texas department of criminal division will recognize the implications of this court judgment for volk custodial status.
finally,we concluded that the district court erred in not applying the plra,which was enacted during the course of volk lawsuit,to the portion of his attorney fees incurred after the statute effective date.accordingly,we remanded the case for the magistrate judge to determine the award of attorney fees for the work done after the plra effective date in light of restrictions contained in the plra.we stated that the judgment is reversed and remanded in part for determination of the award of attorney fees.
on remand from volk i,the district court ordered volk to file a supplemental brief or advisory regarding the proper calculation of attorney fees in light of our remand order and ordered meglareno and fischer to file a responsive advisory.the court explained that it would apply a plra provision that limited attorney fees to percent of the hourly rate established for counsel in criminal cases but noted that it did not intend to apply a plra provision requiring a prisoner who receives a money judgment to pay up to percent of that judgment toward his attorney fees.the district court order did not mention the provision of the plra that limits the judgment debtor liability for the successful prisoner attorney fees to percent of the monetary judgment.
noting that in volk i we had not ruled on his appellate argument that the halving of his attorney fees was an abuse of discretion,volk advisory to the district court asserted that on remand the court should not start from the position that the fees should be halved.in their response,meglareno and fischer argued that volk was not entitled to any specified costs,any attorney fees,any attorney fees exceeding percent of the damages award,or any legal assistant fees.
the district court declined to reconsider the award of costs to volk or the order reducing the legal fees by half.rather,the court awarded volk of his attorney fees,the district court erroneous calculation of the defendants liability for volk attorney fees and legal assistant fees as limited by the plra provision restricting such liability to percent of the damages award,and in costs.
volk timely filed a.rule e motion for a new trial or,in the alternative,to alter or amend the judgment.he asserted that on remand from volk i the district court erred as a matter of law in applying the fee cap and that,in any event,the cap would allow fees of,not.he also insisted that he was entitled to a supplemental award of for the additional attorney fees that he incurred in the subsequent litigation,which was made necessary by the acts of the judgment debtors,for recovery of his initial attorney fees award from them,and that this supplemental fee award should not be subject to the fee cap.in a supplemental rule e motion,volk contended for the first time that the plra limitation of a defendant responsibility for attorney fees to percent of damages awarded violates the guarantee embedded in the fifth amendment.
the district court upheld the application of the fee cap specified in d and determined that the fee award in excess of was unenforceable against meglareno and fischer.after a ssuming that volk equal protection challenge is an argument which may be raised on a motion for a new trial,the court rejected th
