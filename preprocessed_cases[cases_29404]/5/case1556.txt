in any action brought under the california fair employment and housing act feha,et,government code section subdivision b grants the trial court discretion to award attorney fees to a prevailing party.this statute has been interpreted to mean that in a feha action a trial court should ordinarily award attorney fees to a prevailing plaintiff unless special circumstances would render a fee award unjust.young exxon mobil th,steele jensen instrument th.if,as here,a party brings an action under the feha that is not brought as a limited civil case and recovers an amount that could have been awarded in a limited civil case,does the trial court have discretion under section a to deny that party motion for attorney fees

we have determined that the court of appeal erred in so concluding and that its judgment should therefore be reversed.as we explain,section a,interpreted according to its plain meaning,gives a trial court discretion to deny attorney fees to a plaintiff who prevails on a feha claim but recovers an amount that could have been recovered in a limited civil case.in exercising that discretion,however,the trial court must give due consideration to the policies and objectives of the feha in general and of its attorney fee provision in particular.here,we further conclude that,in light of plaintiff minimal success and grossly inflated attorney fee request,the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying attorney fees.
the appellate record in this case does not include reporters transcripts of trial proceedings.instead,it includes documents filed in the action and a reporter transcript of the hearing on plaintiff motion for attorney fees.in their briefs filed in the court of appeal and in this court,neither party has provided a factual narrative of the dispute underlying the lawsuit,nor did the court of appeal opinion contain such a narrative.to provide a more complete perspective on the issue presented here,the following facts have been gleaned from the appellate record.
in november,defendant city of los angeles city hired plaintiff robert chavez as a police officer in the los angeles police department department.in,while assigned to the department southwest division,plaintiff was accused of stealing payroll checks.after a lengthy investigation,the department determined that plaintiff was not the officer who had stolen the checks.
in february,plaintiff was transferred to the department hollenbeck division.there,plaintiff told his captain that he was under surveillance by the department internal affairs group.concerned that plaintiff appeared to have paranoid beliefs,the captain ordered him to be seen by the department behavioral science services unit.between april and september,plaintiff attended sessions with behavioral science services.meanwhile,in september,plaintiff was transferred to the department street division.
in april,plaintiff filed a lawsuit,no.against the city and one sergeant berglund,alleging claims for defamation,intentional infliction of emotional distress,invasion of privacy,and civil rights violations,all resulting from the stolen checks incident.from december to may,plaintiff made numerous complaints to the department alleging that he was being harassed in retaliation for having filed that lawsuit.in particular,plaintiff complained that department helicopters were hovering above his house,which is located in alhambra,a city outside the department jurisdiction.
on april,in response to a silent alarm,plaintiff and other officers went to a laundromat where they investigated alleged robberies.two days later,the laundromat owner lodged a personnel complaint against those officers as a result,the department began an investigation of plaintiff conduct at the laundromat.on may,plaintiff left work on stress leave,under the care of a psychologist,and did not return to work until march.plaintiff has alleged that on several occasions during this stress leave,department helicopters again hovered over his alhambra residence.
on december,the superior court dismissed plaintiff lawsuit against the city and sergeant berglund arising from the false accusation that plaintiff had stolen payroll checks.on january,plaintiff and his wife presented to the city a claim for damages allegedly resulting from harassment surveillance by department helicopters at their alhambra home.the department air support division investigated these allegations and determined they were unfounded on march,the city denied the claim for damages.
on march,when plaintiff returned to work at the department street division,he was served with a written notice that the department intended to suspend him for five days for neglect of duty during the laundromat incident in april plaintiff resumed patrol duties for three days,but his supervisors then assigned him to various administrative tasks until he could be seen and cleared by a staff psychologist of the department behavioral science services.
on march,plaintiff submitted to california department of fair employment and housing an administrative complaint under the feha alleging unlawful employment discrimination on the basis of race,color,marital status,medical condition,national,and disability,harassment,and retaliation.in the administrative complaint,as act or acts of harm,plaintiff mentioned his suspension,a pattern of incidents at work producing a hostile environment,an internal affairs investigation,and a change of medical leave to personal leave.the department of fair employment and housing gave plaintiff a right to sue notice.see,subd.b.
on march,plaintiff requested a transfer from the department street division.on april,commander harlan ward,one of plaintiff supervisors,approved the transfer request.
in may,plaintiff and his wife filed a lawsuit.county,no.against the city and three of plaintiff supervisors at the street ward and lieutenants krejci and von employment discrimination,harassment,and retaliation in violation of the feha as to plaintiff trespass as to both plaintiff and his wife and loss of consortium as to plaintiff wife.plaintiff later amended the complaint in that action to add causes of action for nuisance and inverse condemnation.two weeks after plaintiff and his wife filed the original complaint in that action,commander ward rescinded the order granting plaintiff request to transfer to another division.
in june,plaintiff submitted another feha administrative complaint,this time alleging that the transfer order was rescinded in retaliation for his may filing of the lawsuit asserting causes of action under the feha against the city and the three individual defendants.at plaintiff request,the department of fair employment and housing immediately gave him a right to sue notice.
in august,plaintiff and his wife filed a complaint in federal district court against the city,the department,and five fictitiously named defendants,asserting a claim for violation of civil rights under sections and of title of the united states code.
in october,plaintiff was transferred from the department street division to its southwest division,where he resumed patrol duties.
in march,plaintiff and his wife asked the federal district court to exercise pendent jurisdiction over their state law feha and nuisance claims.the city did not oppose the request,which the district court granted.on april,plaintiff left work on stress leave again,and as of july he had not returned to work on may,plaintiff state court action was dismissed.
in may,in the federal district court,plaintiff agreed to dismissal of his claim of racial discrimination.in september,the federal district court granted summary judgment for the defendants.plaintiff and his wife appealed to the ninth circuit court of appeals.
in september,the ninth circuit issued a memorandum decision reversing the summary judgment in part and remanding the matter to the federal district court.in its decision,the federal appellate court reached these conclusions plaintiff section civil rights claim failed for lack of evidence that either the city or the department had a custom or policy of making harassing helicopter overflights of officers or citizens the district court properly granted summary judgment on plaintiff feha claim of a hostile work environment because the instances of alleged harassment were not sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of plaintiff employment plaintiff feha claim of retaliation,insofar as it was based on removing him from patrol duty after his stress leave or suspending him for five days after investigation of a citizen complaint,failed because plaintiff did not produce sufficient evidence to show a retaliatory motive for either of those actions and plaintiff and his wife waived the nuisance and invasion of privacy claims by failing to sufficiently argue them.the ninth circuit remanded the matter for the district court to determine whether the temporary rescission of plaintiff transfer constituted an adverse employment action and to resolve material factual issues regarding plaintiff feha discrimination claim based on his reassignment from patrol duty to administrative duty.the ninth circuit decision provided that neither party would recover costs.on remand,the federal district court dismissed plaintiff remaining feha claims without prejudice to refiling them in state court.
in november,plaintiff filed this lawsuit,no.against the city,ward,krejci,and von lutzow,alleging claims under the feha for employment discrimination and harassment on the basis of a perceived mental disability,and unlawful retaliation for submitting the feha administrative complaints and for filing the state and federal actions asserting the feha claims.in october,the superior court conducted a jury trial on plaintiff claims.after plaintiff rested,the trial court granted a motion for nonsuit as to defendant von lutzow.on october,the jury returned special verdicts.regarding plaintiff feha claim of employment discrimination based on a perceived mental disability,the jury found that neither defendant ward nor defendant krejci perceived plaintiff as having a mental disability,and that the actions of defendants ward and krejci did not cause plaintiff any damage,loss,or harm.regarding plaintiff feha retaliation claim,the jury found that plaintiff had engaged in protected activity,that defendant ward rescinded plaintiff transfer,that plaintiff protected activity was a motivating factor in defendant ward decision to rescind the transfer,and that the transfer rescission proximately caused plaintiff in economic damages including loss in overtime and cash detail and in noneconomic damages including mental suffering and emotional distress.
on october,plaintiff filed a motion for costs in the amount of and a separate motion for attorney fees in the amount of.in support of the motion for attorney fees,plaintiff attorney submitted a declaration that included a itemized statement of the services she had performed in prosecuting plaintiff claims against the city.she reported a total of hours for services beginning on january,and continuing through october,including services performed in the prosecution of the previous state and federal lawsuits.
on october,the superior court entered judgment on the jury special verdicts in plaintiff favor against the city and ward in the amount of.on december,plaintiff filed an amended motion for attorney fees,correcting errors in the itemized statement and adding a multiplier to the lodestar calculation,so that the requested fees increased to.defendants the city and ward filed their opposition to plaintiff motion for attorney fees,asserting that plaintiff had overreached and outrageously inflated his fee request and asking that attorney fees be denied altogether or alternatively reduced to.
after a hearing,the superior court denied the motion for attorney fees.in its written order,the court noted that plaintiff case at trial had been overwhelmingly devoted to liability,that none of plaintiff witnesses gave any direct testimony about economic damages,and that plaintiff had offered no rebuttal to the testimony of defendants expert,who put plaintiff economic loss resulting from the temporary rescission of his transfer at just under.according to the court,plaintiff evidence of noneconomic damages was equally sparse,particularly as it related to the temporary rescission of the transfer.after describing the relevant evidence,the superior court concluded the above detail is provided by the court to explain its reasoning in applying its discretion under section a to deny attorney fees as costs under code civ,subd.a.the court is guided in this also by steele jensen,supra,th,wherein the court discretion to deny fees was upheld in a case where the verdict was twice the amount of the instant one.other cases cited by plaintiff during oral argument are inapposite.based on the foregoing,therefore,plaintiff amended motion for attorney fees is denied.
on plaintiff appeal from the order denying attorney fees,the court of appeal reversed.it agreed with plaintiff that in denying the motion for attorney fees the trial court had applied the wrong statutory standard and abused its discretion.the court of appeal faulted the trial court for not referring to the feha in its written ruling and for making no express finding of a special circumstance that justified denying attorney fees to a prevailing feha plaintiff.asserting that section does not apply in actions brought under feha,the court of appeal reasoned that the rationale of section a was to encourage pursuit of minor grievances in courts of limited jurisdiction and that this rationale is inapposite in statutory discrimination or civil rights actions because e ven a modest financial recovery can serve to vindicate a substantial legal right.thus,in the court of appeal view,the feha and section a serve laudable but conflicting public policies.also,denying attorney fees under section a would discourage attorneys from taking meritorious cases.
the court of appeal agreed with plaintiff attorney that,as a practical matter,she could not have filed this action as a limited civil case because,e ven in its final,more streamlined form,it involved two complex causes of action against four defendants and if the action had been brought as a limited civil case,plaintiff could not have deposed all the named defendants,let alone other essential witnesses.the court noted that the city had flatly resisted all settlement discussions and never made a substantive offer and that this had forced plaintiff to engage in extensive discovery and litigate the action for five years through the state and federal trial and appellate courts.without expressing any opinion on the amount of fees that plaintiff should be awarded,the court of appeal remanded the matter to the trial court for proper application of government code section,subdivision b.
we granted defendants petition for review.
this case requires that we determine the proper interaction of two statutory a and government code section subdivision b.we begin with an overview of those provisions.
section a provides costs or any portion of claimed costs shall be as determined by the court in its discretion in a case other than a limited civil case in accordance with section where the prevailing party recovers a judgment that could have been rendered in a limited civil case.in other words,section a applies when a plaintiff has obtained a judgment for money damages in an amount now or less that could have been recovered in a limited civil case,but the plaintiff did not bring the action as a limited civil case and thus did not take advantage of the cost and advantages of limited civil case procedures.in this situation,even though a plaintiff who obtains a money judgment would otherwise be entitled to recover litigation costs as a matter of right,section a gives the trial court discretion to deny,in whole or in part,the plaintiff recovery of litigation costs.
the origins of this provision can be traced to former sections and of the code of civil procedure,as enacted in.under those former code sections,a plaintiff who received a money judgment for or more was entitled to recover costs,but no costs could be recovered by a plaintiff who received a money judgment for a lesser amount.see murphy casey.
effective january,this subject was addressed by subdivision a of former section of the code of civil procedure,which stated that a plaintiff who brought an action for the recovery of money or damages in superior court could not recover costs when the judgment is one which could have been rendered by a municipal or inferior court within the same county or city and county.stats,ch.one court of appeal explained that the purpose of the provision was to force plaintiffs to bring their cases in the inferior courts wherever possible,and to penalize them if they do not do so.shotwell bloom d.
in,the legislature amended former section of the code of civil procedure to provide,in subdivision d,that if the prevailing party recovers a judgment that could have been rendered in a court inferior in jurisdiction in the county or city and county,the court may at its discretion allow or deny costs to such prevailing party,or may allow costs in part in such amount as it deems proper.stats,ch,italics added.this amendment was a legislative effort to relax the strict rule that no costs were recoverable by a plaintiff who selected the wrong court,and to permit the trial judge to allow costs to a plaintiff in a proper case.young general telephone d.
in,the legislature repealed former section of the code of civil procedure and moved the substance of that section subdivision d to newly enacted code of civil procedure section,which as originally enacted read costs or any portion of claimed costs shall be as determined by the court in its discretion in accordance with section where the prevailing party recovers a judgment that could have been rendered in a court of lesser jurisdiction.stats,ch.in,to accommodate the unification of the superior and municipal courts,section a was amended to its current wording costs or any portion of claims costs shall be as determined by the court in its discretion in a case other than a limited civil case in accordance with section where the prevailing party recovers a judgment that could have been rendered in a limited civil case.stats,ch.
the courts of appeal have identified factors that a trial court should ordinarily consider in exercising its discretion under section a,including the amount of damages the plaintiff reasonably and in good faith could have expected to recover and the total amount of costs that the plaintiff incurred.dorman dwlc th,valentino elliott gas,d,greenberg pacific.d.
