porfirio serrano and lourdes serrano appeal orders requiring them to pay the fees charged by coast court reporters coast for copies of deposition transcripts in a pending action and denying their request to relieve them of fees charged for expedited service.coast had agreed to provide the copies to the serranos on the condition that the serranos and coast would be bound by the trial court ruling as to the reasonableness of the fees.the trial court found that the expedited service fees were unconscionable,but concluded that it had no authority to limit the fees charged by coast and ordered the serranos to pay the fees.
we conclude that code of civil procedure section,subdivision c,and the court inherent authority to control its ministerial officers and other persons connected with a judicial proceeding in furtherance of justice,subd.a,authorize the court to require a deposition reporter to provide a copy of a deposition transcript to a party in a pending action for a reasonable fee which,in the absence of an agreement between the interested parties,may be set by the court upon a proper evidentiary showing.we also reject coast arguments of nonappealability,lack of standing,lack of jurisdiction,and mootness.we therefore will reverse the orders with directions.
factual and procedural background 
the serranos filed a complaint seeking damages for personal injuries against stefan merli plastering company,in november.the defendant noticed the depositions of several of the serranos expert witnesses,including robert audell.the audell deposition took place on june,and was reported by a certified shorthand reporter employed by coast.counsel for the serranos requested a certified copy of the transcript.the trial was scheduled to begin on july.
on june,coast informed the serranos counsel that the defendant had requested expedited preparation of the transcript of the audell deposition and asked if the serranos counsel would like an expedited copy.the serranos counsel requested an expedited hard copy and also requested an electronic version of the transcript to be sent by.coast stated that it would send a hard copy and would an ascii version only after receiving by facsimile a copy of the check in payment to coast.coast then billed the serranos counsel for a certified copy of the audell deposition transcript consisting of pages,plus for pages of exhibits,for expedite day,to an ascii version,and for.coast agreed to waive the requirement upon receipt of fax confirmation of check being mailed today.
the serranos counsel protested the charge for expedited service and stated that the defendant should bear the cost of transcription,including any fee for expediting the transcription.coast responded that the expedited service fee was proper,that its normal turnaround on transcripts is ten business days,and that counsel would receive a certified copy of the transcript on an expedited basis only upon payment of the additional fee.
the serranos filed an ex parte application on july,for an order requiring coast to provide a copy of the audell deposition transcript without charging any expedited service fee.an attorney for coast appeared and opposed the application.the trial court scheduled further briefing and a hearing to take place on july.the serranos and coast agreed that the court would determine the validity and reasonableness of the expedited service fee and that the ruling would govern the fees for all other deposition transcripts in this action based on that agreement,coast waived its requirement and delivered copies of the deposition transcripts to the serranos counsel.
coast filed an opposition to the serranos motion.coast owner declared that an expedited original deposition transcript or expedited certified copy increased the workload of the reporter and office production staff,that the fee per page of a certified copy was less than the fee per page of an original transcript,and that the fee to expedite the preparation of either an original transcript or a certified copy was based on a percentage of the fee for the respective transcript.the owner declared that the fee per page of an original deposition transcript depended on the type of deposition,and coast acknowledged that it charged a higher fee per page for the deposition of an expert witness than for the deposition of a nonexpert witness.the owner declared that the fee to expedite the preparation of either an original or a certified copy was percent of the fee for the transcript for delivery the next business day,percent for two business days,percent for three business days,and percent for four business days.
coast owner declared as a result of the certification requirements imposed by california code of civil procedure,the certified copy is more than a mere copy production of a certified copy requires the following individual steps over and above the requirements of the original transcript printing,detailing to ensure accuracy,binding,the creating of an ascii or cd to accompany the certified copy,the creation of a condensed version of the certified copy,copying and detailing of exhibits,binding of exhibits and creating a separate ascii or cd of exhibits if necessary,labeling,invoicing,shipping,and coordinating cod requirements.coast cited urban pacific equities superior court th,d urban pacific for the proposition that certified shorthand reporters who are not acting as official court reporters are free to charge all the market will bear id.at,d.
the trial court stated to the serranos counsel at the hearing on july,i would love to give you relief.i do think i can.so take it up.maybe,you know,one of the divisions up there will feel sympathetic.after further argument,the court stated i given you an offer.the court up there is going to know that,you know,we need help on this.i do think it my place to substitute you substitute.according to what urban said,they can charge what the traffic will bear.
the following exchange occurred at the hearing 
coast counsel your honor,you offered the plaintiff to appeal the order,but my 
the court well,to take a writ.
coast counsel i understand the writ,but my understanding of our discussion on july was that both parties agreed,since we are not a party to the action,that,in this case,you were basically acting as a mediator.
the court well,that 
coast counsel and we both agreed to be bound by whatever you determined,not to have the option to go on and take a writ with the appellate court.
the serranos counsel if i 
coast counsel i would ask that this court order that the funds be paid.
the court that the effect of my order.i ordering them to pay them.
coast counsel and just so the record is clear,your honor,the expedite fee.the basic charge,which they have paid yet,either,is.the total amount due is.
the court i know,the bills are attached to the 
coast counsel yes,they are,your honor.but,normally,since they not a client of coast court reporters,everything would be sent.in this case,coast court reporters granted an absence of that in light of your 
the court that was the agreement,that i would make a ruling.i made the ruling.i ca give you relief,so you better pay it.
the serranos counsel your honor,if i may address this i was the party in the chambers when the discussion was made.i said,yes,we would be bound in each one of the succeeding depositions,because i did not want it to be held up since we do have an upcoming trial.i did not waive our right to seek a writ,nor did i waive the right to appeal.
the court i know.
coast counsel well,we will argue jurisdiction at another point,your honor,but i still would ask that this court order that they pay.and we discuss 
the court okay.and that was the agreement,that it be paid.
the minute order entered on july,stated the motion is denied.there appears to be nothing this court can do.see urban pacific equities superior court th,d.if the court had the power to do so,it would order the second copy of the transcript to be prepared at the normal cost plus any additional charges necessitated by producing the second copy only the original and first copy is expedited.from that point on everything else is merely a copy.as in urban,this court feels the practice employed by the court reporter in this case is unconscionable.however,as in urban this court is without the power to require the court reporter to charge something other than what the traffic will bear.perhaps an appellate court will have a different view.
the serranos filed an ex parte application on july,for an order staying the order to pay for the transcripts pending their application to the court of appeal for extraordinary writ review.the trial court denied the application.counsel for the serranos stated that he would pay the bill without waiving the right of appellate review.counsel for coast stated that he did not agree that the court of appeal had jurisdiction and asked the trial court to order that payment be made by thursday,july,the court stated i will order it paid by thursday.that was the agreement.basically,i was going to hear it,and both sides agreed to be bound by what i said.i heard it.i have said it.pay it thursday.the serranos counsel paid,the full amount charged by coast for certified copies of the audell deposition transcript and other deposition transcripts,including the expedited service fees,on july.
the serranos filed a notice of appeal on august,from the minute order of july denying their motion for relief from the expedited service fees the oral order of july requiring the serranos to pay the bill presented by coast and the oral order of july requiring the serranos to pay the bill by july.
the serranos petitioned the court of appeal for an extraordinary writ on august,seeking to compel the trial court to vacate its denial of the serranos motion for relief from the expedited service fees and exercise its discretion to determine the amount of reasonable fees,and to vacate its orders to pay the bills in full.we summarily denied the petition on september.
the serranos and the defendant entered into a settlement agreement.the court dismissed the action against the defendant with prejudice on september,pursuant to the settlement.the order of dismissal states that the dismissal is without prejudice to the positions of the serranos and coast with regard to the dispute between them and does not deprive the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction to resolve that dispute if the court of appeal determines that the trial court has the jurisdiction to resolve the dispute.
coast moved to dismiss the appeal based on nonappealability,lack of standing,lack of jurisdiction,mootness,and other grounds,and also moved for an award of sanctions against the serranos for filing a frivolous appeal.we denied the motion to dismiss and notified the parties that we would reserve the issues relating to coast request for sanctions.
contentions 
the serranos contend the trial court has the authority to require a certified shorthand reporter acting as a deposition reporter to provide a copy of a deposition transcript to a party in a pending action for a reasonable fee the expedited service fees improperly imposed on the serranos part of the cost of transcription,which must be borne by the party noticing the deposition if the court had no jurisdiction to determine whether the fees were unreasonable,it had no jurisdiction to order the serranos to pay the fees and other fees apart from the expedited service fees also are unreasonable.
coast disputes those contentions and argues that the appealed orders are nonappealable interlocutory orders the serranos are not aggrieved parties,so they have no standing to appeal the serranos and coast agreed to binding resolution of this dispute by the judge acting as an arbitrator,so there is no right of appeal this court can grant no effective relief to the serranos,so the appeal is moot and the trial court had neither personal jurisdiction over coast nor subject matter jurisdiction over the dispute between the serranos and coast,so the denial of the serranos motion was proper 
discussion 
the orders are appealable collateral orders 
the collateral order doctrine holds that an order that finally determines a matter that is distinct and severable from the main issues in the proceeding and that directs the payment of money or performance of some other act is appealable.in re marriage of skelley cal d.this constitutes a necessary exception to the one final judgment rule.such a determination is substantially the same as a final judgment in an independent proceeding.citations.ibid.
at the hearing on july,the court orally ordered the serranos to pay the fees charged by coast for copies of the deposition transcripts.the court stated that the effect of my order.i ordering them to pay them.the court reiterated that order on july,when it denied the serranos ex parte application to stay the order of july and stated in response to the request by coast counsel that the court order payment made by thursday,july,i will order it paid by thursday pay it thursday.
the orders finally determined the issue of the serranos liability for payment to coast for copies of the deposition transcripts the orders did not decide the parties rights with respect to the relief demanded in the serranos complaint against stefan merli plastering company,for damages for personal injuries,and the orders would neither influence nor be influenced by subsequent proceedings in the action with respect to the relief demanded in the complaint.the orders therefore were collateral to the main issues in the proceeding.in re marriage of skelley,supra,cal d at.the orders also directed the payment of money,and thus satisfy all of the requirements for appealable collateral orders.we conclude that the orders are appealable under the collateral order doctrine.
the serranos as aggrieved parties have standing to appeal the orders 
only a party aggrieved by a judgment or order has standing to appeal the judgment or order.any aggrieved party may appeal in the cases prescribed in this title.a party who has an interest recognized by law that is adversely affected by the judgment or order is an aggrieved party.county of alameda carleson cal d,cesar superior court th,d.the interest must be immediate and substantial,and not nominal or remote.county of alameda,supra,at,in re th,d.
the court ordered the serranos to pay the fees charged by coast for copies of the deposition transcripts,including in disputed fees for expedited copies.contrary to coast argument,there is no indication in the record that the orders to pay the fees were directed to the serranos counsel rather than to the serranos as the litigants we conclude that the serranos interest is immediate and substantial and that they have standing to appeal as aggrieved parties.we reject coast additional argument that the serranos did not authorize their attorneys to appeal on their behalf.that argument is based on mere supposition and has no support in the record.
the serranos did not agree to binding arbitration or waive the right of appeal 
coast cites moncharsh heily blase cal th,d,in support of its argument that the serranos and coast agreed to binding resolution of their dispute by the trial court functioning as an arbitrator.moncharsh held that an arbitration award under the contractual arbitration law et is final,binding,and ordinarily is not subject to judicial review.moncharsh,supra,at,d.an arbitration subject to the contractual arbitration law arises solely out of an arbitration agreement,specifically,a written arbitration agreement,between the parties thereto citations.mercury ins.group superior court cal th,d.absent a written arbitration agreement between the serranos and coast,we conclude that the trial court was not acting as an arbitrator under the contractual arbitration law.moreover,there is no indication in the record that the serranos and coast agreed in any manner,orally or in writing,to submit their dispute to arbitration or waived the right of appeal.
contractual arbitration by a private arbitrator under the contractual arbitration law and judicial arbitration by a judge are mutually exclusive.heenan sobati th,d.judicial arbitration is governed by the judicial arbitration law.unlike a contractual arbitration award,a judicial arbitration award is not final and binding,but is subject to trial de novo in the trial court.mercury ins.group superior court,supra,cal th at,d.coast does not argue,and the record does not disclose,that the parties stipulated to judicial arbitration,subd.a former cal.rules of court,rule a,that the serranos filed an election to submit to judicial arbitration,subd.b former cal.rules of court,rule b,or that the court submitted the matter to judicial arbitration.
we construe the agreement by counsel for the serranos and counsel for coast to submit their dispute to the trial court for its decision as an agreement to allow the court to decide in the pending action a matter that was not within the scope of the pleadings and pertained to a third party,coast,that was not named as a party in the action,and that the court decision would govern the serranos liability to coast for fees not only for the audell deposition,but also for other depositions in the action.the trial court comments regarding the agreement quoted ante are consistent with our understanding of the agreement and do not suggest either that the court understood the agreement to be an arbitration agreement or that the court agreed to serve as an arbitrator.
the appeal is not moot 
coast contends the appeal is moot because the serranos settled their action against the defendant,and because the trial court had neither personal jurisdiction over coast nor subject matter jurisdiction over the dispute between the serranos and coast and would have no such jurisdiction on remand.our conclusion that the trial court had both personal jurisdiction and subject matter jurisdiction discussed in section,post disposes of the claim of mootness based on lack of jurisdiction.as for the settlement,the settlement and dismissal of the action between the serranos and the defendant expressly did not prejudice the rights of the serranos as against coast and did not moot this appeal.
the trial court had jurisdiction with respect to this dispute 
personal jurisdiction 
a court acquires personal jurisdiction over a party that makes a general appearance in an action even if no summons is served on that party,subd.a.section lists several acts that constitute an appearance by a defendant,filing an answer,demurrer,motion to strike,motion to transfer,but the list is nonexclusive.hamilton asbestos cal th,d.a party may make a general appearance in an action by various acts which,under all of the circumstances,are deemed to confer jurisdiction of the person.citation.what is determinative is whether defendant takes a part in the particular action which in some manner recognizes the authority of the court to proceed.citation.ibid.
a party whose participation in an action is limited to challenging the court personal jurisdiction does not make a general appearance.other forms of participation,however,such as seeking affirmative relief or opposing a motion on the merits,ordinarily constitute a general appearance.dial fesbinder th,d alioto fish alioto th,d.even a nonparty that is not named in the pleadings makes a general appearance and submits to the court personal jurisdiction by participating in the proceedings in such a manner.people ciancio th,d.
coast never challenged the court personal jurisdiction,but instead agreed that the court would determine the validity and reasonableness of the expedited service fees and opposed on the merits the serranos motion for relief from those fees.coast also requested affirmative relief in the form of an order for payment of the fees charged,and later an order that payment be made by a date certain.we conclude that by participating in the action in this manner,coast made a general appearance in the action and became subject to the court personal jurisdiction for the purpose of resolving its dispute with the serranos over the cost of expedited deposition transcripts.
subject matter jurisdiction 
subject matter jurisdiction refers to the court power to hear and resolve a particular dispute or cause of action.donaldson national marine,cal th,d.the california constitution confers broad subject matter jurisdiction on the superior court.cal,art.vi.the subject matter jurisdiction of the superior court is limited in certain circumstances,however,such as in areas of exclusive federal jurisdiction see witkin,cal.procedure ed.jurisdiction,matters within the exclusive jurisdiction of an administrative agency see,and where jurisdiction is vested in a reviewing court as a result of the filing of a notice of appeal see.none of those circumstances was present here,and coast has identified no other circumstance that would deprive the court of subject matter jurisdiction over the dispute between the serranos and coast.we are aware of no valid reason to find an absence of subject matter jurisdiction,particularly where the dispute involves a right created by a california discovery statute and the court authority to control the conduct of its ministerial officers as discussed below in section and the dispute is typical of those commonly adjudicated in california courts.as we now discuss,the authorities cited by coast do not compel a contrary conclusion.
c.the authorities cited by coast are inapposite 
coast cites summers superior court cal d,summers for the proposition that the trial court had neither personal jurisdiction over coast nor subject matter jurisdiction over the dispute with the serranos.summers involved a fee dispute between the plaintiff in an action and a court reporter.after filing a notice of appeal,the plaintiff filed exceptions to the court reporter charges for preparing an original and two copies of the reporter transcript.the trial court held a hearing on the exceptions,admitted evidence presented by both sides,and denied the exceptions.id.at.summers held that the trial court in the action on appeal had no subject matter jurisdiction to decide the fee dispute between the plaintiff and the court reporter after the transcript had been filed.id.at.
summers stated the williams case williams superior court cal d,correctly points out that the trial court in the case on appeal has power to determine whether the appellant has complied with all necessary legal requirements to secure a transcript and,if so,to see to it that the reporter complies with the law and prepares and files the transcript.but the court has no jurisdiction in the case on appeal to pass on disputes between the reporter and the appellant over fees.as was said in the williams case,supra,at page,if after the delivery of the transcript a dispute should arise between the appellant and the reporter as to the amount the reporter is legally entitled to receive,his recourse would be,as outlined in the gjurich case gjurich fieg cal,an action in the ordinary course of law to collect the same,which necessarily would involve a determination of the question of the validity of the agreement theretofore entered into between the parties.summers,supra,cal d at,italics added.
thus,summers,supra,cal d,held that the trial court had no subject matter jurisdiction over the fee dispute between the appellant and the court reporter but it was not because all disputes between parties to an action and certified shorthand reporters who are not parties to the action are beyond the court subject matter jurisdiction,as coast appears to argue.rather,summers held only that although the court retained jurisdiction to ensure the preparation and filing of a transcript for the appeal,the court had no jurisdiction to decide a fee dispute between the appellant and the court reporter after the filing of an appeal and after the transcript had been filed.summers is not on point because at the time of the hearing on the serranos motion for relief from the expedited service fees,no notice of appeal had been filed,so the court was not divested of subject matter jurisdiction by the filing of a notice of appeal.moreover,unlike the situation in summers,where the transcript had already been delivered at the time the fee dispute arose,the dispute here arose before the transcript was delivered,and coast refused to deliver the transcript until after the serranos had agreed to submit the fee dispute to the trial court for resolution 
coast cites pennoyer neff.and allen superior court cal d,for the proposition that the trial court had no personal jurisdiction over coast because no summons was served on coast.service of a summons is not the only way to establish personal jurisdiction.rather,for purposes of personal jurisdiction,a general appearance by a party is equivalent to personal service of summons on such party,subd.a,as we have explained.
coast cites orange county water dist.city of colton d.city of colton for the proposition that the scope of the trial court jurisdiction is defined by the pleadings and that a judgment beyond the scope of the pleadings is invalid.after a second amended judgment was entered establishing the parties prescriptive rights to water usage,the plaintiff in city of colton moved to modify the judgment to adjudicate other water rights relating to nonparties.id.at.the plaintiff relied on a provision in the judgment reserving jurisdiction to adjudicate certain other matters.id.at.city of colton stated in making this proviso,the court does not purport to reserve,and indeed it could not reserve unto itself in this action,the right to adjudicate new and rights by any of the parties hereto which were nonexistent in that party at the time of pleading and trial of the issues,nor could it adjudicate rights of any nature between these litigants and overlying land owners not parties to the action.id.at.
city of colton stated that the issues that the plaintiff sought to adjudicate in the motion to modify the judgment were beyond the scope of the issues before the court at the time of trial.city of colton,supra,d at.it stated,a judgment outside the issues is not a mere irregularity it is extrajudicial and invalid.baar smith cal.ibid.city of colton held that the court had no jurisdiction to grant the requested relief and affirmed the order denying the motion we hold that in this action and at the time appellant made this particular motion the trial court was without jurisdiction to grant it and therefore properly made its order denying the motion.id.at.city of colton is not on point because it involved the attempted modification of a judgment on issues that were not within the scope of issues litigated before the entry of judgment,and because there is no indication that the nonparties affected by the requested modification in that case participated in the proceedings so as to establish both personal jurisdiction and a basis to conclude that any variance between the pleadings and the proof was immaterial.see franz board of medical quality assurance cal d,baar smith,supra,cal.at.
the trial court has the authority to require a deposition reporter to provide a copy of a transcript to a party for a reasonable fee 
we now turn to the question whether a trial court has the authority to require a deposition reporter to provide a copy of a transcript to a party in a pending action for a reasonable fee and,if a dispute exists as to the amount of such reasonable fee,to resolve it in the proceeding in which the dispute arose.
rules of statutory construction 
statutory construction is a question of law that we review de novo.barner leeds cal th,d.our task in construing a statute is to ascertain the legislative intent so as to effectuate the purpose of law.hassan mercy american river hospital cal th,d.the statutory language ordinarily is the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.ibid.we give the words of the statute their ordinary and usual meaning and construe them in the context of the statute as a whole and the entire scheme of law of which it is a part.state farm mut.auto.ins.garamendi cal th,d.if the language is clear and a literal construction would not result in absurd consequences that the legislature did not intend,the plain meaning governs.coalition of concerned communities,city of los angeles cal th,d.if the language is ambiguous,we may consider a variety of extrinsic aids,including the purpose of the statute,legislative history,and public policy.ibid.
statutory framework 
a deposition must be conducted under the supervision of a deposition officer who is authorized to administer an oath.the deposition testimony must be recorded stenographically,unless the parties agree or the court orders otherwise,subd.d.if the testimony is recorded stenographically,it must be recorded by a certified shorthand reporter.bus.in practice,the deposition officer and certified shorthand reporter ordinarily are,but need not necessarily be,the same person see,subd.b weil et,cal.practice guide civ.procedure before trial the rutter group.that common practice was followed here.
section states that the recorded testimony must be transcribed,unless the parties agree otherwise,subd.a.section states further,t he party noticing the deposition shall bear the cost of that transcription,unless the court,on motion and for good cause shown,orders that the cost be borne or shared by another party,subd.b.any other party or the deponent may obtain a copy of the transcript at the expense of that party or deponent,subd.c.if any party requests an original or a copy of the deposition transcript and the transcript will be available to that party before the original or a copy would be available to any other party,the deposition reporter must notify the other parties attending the deposition of the request and,if requested,must make a copy of the transcript available to all parties at the same time,subd.d.
the deposition reporter must notify all parties attending the deposition and the deponent when the original transcript of each session of the deposition is available for reading,correcting,and signing by the deponent,unless the parties agree that the reading,correcting,and signing will be waived or will take place at another time,subd.a.the deponent then has days to change the form or substance of an answer,unless the parties attending the deposition and the deponent agree to another time period,subd.b.the deponent may either approve the transcript by signing it,refuse to approve the transcript by not signing it,or indicate his or her approval or disapproval in a letter to the deposition reporter,subds.b,c.the court may shorten the period for good cause,subd.d.
section,subdivision b states services and products offered or provided by the deposition officer or the entity providing the services of the deposition officer to any party or to any party attorney or third party who is financing all or part of the action shall be offered to all parties or their attorneys attending the deposition.no service or product may be offered or provided by the deposition officer or by the entity providing the services of the deposition officer to any party or any party attorney or third party who is financing all or part of the action unless the service or product is offered or provided to all parties or their attorneys attending the deposition.all services and products offered or provided shall be made available at the same time to all parties or their attorneys.
section states a notwithstanding subdivision b of section,unless the court issues an order to the contrary,a copy of the transcript of the deposition testimony made by,or at the direction of,any party,or an audio or video recording of the deposition testimony,if still in the possession of the deposition officer,shall be made available by the deposition officer to any person requesting a copy,on payment of a reasonable charge set by the deposition officer.
b if a copy is requested from the deposition officer,the deposition officer shall mail a notice to all parties attending the deposition and to the deponent at the deponent last known address advising them of all of the following 
the copy is being sought.
the name of the person requesting the copy.
the right to seek a protective order under section.
c if a protective order is not served on the deposition officer within days of the mailing of the notice,the deposition officer shall make the copy available to the person requesting the copy.
d this section shall apply only to recorded testimony taken at depositions occurring on or after january.italics added.
section,subdivision a states that every court shall have the power t o control in furtherance of justice,the conduct of its ministerial officers,and of all other persons in any manner connected with a judicial proceeding before it,in every matter pertaining thereto.section,subdivision a confirms some of the court inherent powers,derived from the judiciary constitutional role as a separate branch of government cal,art.vi.walker superior court cal d.we have often recognized the inherent powers of the court to insure the orderly administration of justice.citations.id.at.a deposition officer is a ministerial officer of the court within the meaning of section,subdivision a.burns superior court cal.burns explained that a deposition officer performs the role previously performed by a commissioner,or examiner,in courts of equity.id.at.section,subdivision a confirms the court inherent authority in a pending action not only to compel ministerial officers to perform their express statutory duties,but also to control the conduct of ministerial officers in pending actions in order to protect the administration of justice.
c.the court in a pending action has the authority to require a deposition reporter to provide a copy of a transcript to a party for a reasonable fee 
section,subdivision c quoted in fn,ante states that any party other than the party noticing the deposition,or the deponent,may obtain a copy of the transcript at that party or deponent own expense.the statute thus ensures that a party can obtain a copy of a transcript of a deposition taken in the pending action,provided that such party pays the expense ibid.of the copy.if the deposition reporter refuses to provide copy of a transcript to a party in a pending action,the trial court obviously should be able to enforce this statutory right by ordering the deposition reporter to provide a copy of the transcript to the party on condition of the party payment of the expense of the copy.code of civ,subd.a.
coast argues that while a trial court may order a deposition reporter to deliver a copy of a deposition transcript to a party and that the party must pay for it,the court has no authority to reduce or regulate the amount of the fee charged by the reporter.thus,coast argues that a court ordering a deposition reporter to provide a copy of a transcript to a party pursuant to section,subdivision c must order that party to pay the fee charged by the deposition reporter regardless of the amount of the fee.we firmly reject that argument.as we now explain,if a deposition reporter either refuses to provide a copy of a deposition transcript to a party in a pending action,for whatever reason,or imposes unacceptable conditions upon such delivery,and the court must intervene,we conclude that the expense that the court may require the party to pay for the transcript must be reasonable 
the party noticing the deposition can select the deposition reporter based on cost and other considerations,and can bargain for lower rates.the party,on the other hand,has no control over the selection of the deposition reporter and is in no position to bargain for lower rates.this arrangement provides no meaningful protection to the party against excessive rates.indeed,price competition may encourage a deposition officer to charge the noticing party less than the actual cost of transcription and other services provided to the noticing party and to shift some of that cost onto the parties.see,saunders superior court th,d.
depositions play an important role in litigation and trial preparation,and deposition testimony may be offered as evidence in pretrial proceedings and,in some circumstances,at trial.in light of the importance of deposition testimony in a pending action and the party lack of bargaining power,a trial court must be cautious not to lend assistance to overreaching by the deposition reporter.for a deposition reporter to refuse to provide a copy of a transcript to a party in a pending action unless the party agrees to pay an unreasonable fee would be grossly unfair.moreover,for a deposition reporter,as an officer of the court,to engage in such conduct would be an abuse of the reporter authority.for a trial court to condone such conduct by conditioning the party right to receive a copy of a transcript on payment of an unreasonable fee would undermine rather than promote the administration of justice and could very well result in a denial of due process to the party victimized by the reporter conduct.it therefore follows that the only monetary condition that the court may properly place upon the party right to receive a copy of the deposition transcript would be payment of a reasonable fee.
this conclusion finds support in the fact that section,subdivision a expressly requires that the fee charged by a deposition officer to any person requesting a copy of the transcript be reasonable.although the legislative history suggests that section,subdivision a was intended to apply only to nonparties see com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended may,assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended july,it would be anomalous indeed for the legislature to require a deposition officer to provide a copy of a deposition transcript to a nonparty for a reasonable fee while denying the same protection for a litigating party.accordingly,we construe section,subdivision c as a grant of authority to the trial court to order a deposition officer to provide a copy of a transcript to a party in a pending action upon payment of a reasonable fee.
urban pacific,supra,th,d,the case cited by the trial court,is not on point,and its dictum is unpersuasive.urban pacific held that a deponent attorney could not use a business records deposition subpoena to compel a certified shorthand reporter to make a deposition transcript in a pending action available for copying,in lieu of paying the reporter what the court characterized as an unconscionable fee for a copy.id.at,d.urban pacific reasoned that the transcript was not a business record within the meaning of former section,subdivision d,at,d.the court stated further,although the fees charged by reporters are fixed by statute,there is no statute regulating the fees charged by private reporting firms,and deposition reporters are free to charge all the market will bear.fn.omitted.id.at,d.
urban pacific,supra,th,d,was decided before the effective date of former section,which later became section cal.law revision com,west civ.proc.supp.foll.urban pacific noted that former section would soon become effective,quoted the statute,and stated in dictum unless miller company the certified shorthand reporter concedes that its charges are not reasonable,we do not see how this new statute would affect the problem faced by ihnen the deponent seeking a copy,particularly since the new statute appears to be for the benefit of nonparties,not parties.compare former,subd.p.urban pacific,supra,at,fn,d.we find the suggestion in urban pacific that the trial court has no authority to limit to a reasonable amount the amount that a party is required to pay to obtain a copy of a transcript in a pending action unpersuasive for the reasons we have stated.
the amount that the court requires a party to pay to obtain a copy of a transcript in a pending action pursuant to section,subdivision c must be a reasonable amount for that service,regardless of any other services that the deposition reporter may have provided for which the party requesting a copy is not responsible.the cost of transcription must be borne by the party noticing the deposition,unless the court on motion and for good cause orders otherwise,subd.b,so a reasonable fee for a copy of the transcript would not include any amount that compensates the deposition reporter for the cost to expedite the transcription.this does not preclude a deposition reporter from charging a reasonable fee for expediting the making,certification,and delivery of a copy.although the reporter ordinarily sets the fee in the first instance,the reasonableness of the expense,subd.c that a court may require a party to pay to obtain a copy of the transcript in a pending action is a question within
