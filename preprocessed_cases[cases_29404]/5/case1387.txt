in the most recent chapter of this extremely protracted litigation,the district court,invoking of the civil rights act of act,stat,codified as an amendment to d,ordered the navy to pay prejudgment interest on backpay and attorneys fees for periods before november,to a class of women who successfully established that the navy discriminated against them in employment on the basis of sex.trout england,july,see also trout dalton,trout dalton,july.the navy appeals on the ground that can not be applied retroactively to periods predating november,when became effective,citing brown sec y of the army,cert.denied,d,as dispositive.appellees would distinguish brown on the ground that the navy liability was not finally determined until after became effective.because the holding in brown rested on considerations of sovereign immunity as enhanced by the rule of against the sovereign,it is dispositive,and accordingly we reverse the award of prejudgment interest to the trout class for periods before november.
in,when congress enacted,the trout class action was almost twenty years old.the litigation began in when navy computer analyst yvonne trout and other female employees of the navy computer operations center sued the navy for sex discrimination in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,et.the district court consolidated the complaints and certified a class of civilian women employees who worked for the navy computer operations center at any time between june,and june.in,after a lengthy trial involving witnesses,more than pages of exhibits,and extensive regression analyses demonstrating sex discrimination in the navy hiring,promotion,evaluation,and assignment of women,the district court found the navy liable for violating title vii,trout hidalgo,and granted relief to the trout class in the form of backpay.trout hidalgo,wl.following appeals by the navy,trout lehman,vacated and remanded,lehman trout,d,the district court reinstated its finding of discrimination in on remand.trout lehman.
on august,the district court made an interim award of attorneys fees and costs to the trout class,in the amounts of and,respectively.trout lehman.the navy appealed the order to pay the interim attorneys fees on grounds of sovereign immunity.trout garrett.this court,on december,denied the navy petition for mandamus and dismissed the appeal because the navy conceded,and the court agreed,that k waives the united states immunity from claims,whether final or interim,for attorneys fees as an element of costs.
while the award of interim attorneys fees was pending appeal,the district court,on october,ordered backpay relief for the trout class dating back to,with individual hearings to be held before a special master to determine each claimant entitlement.trout webb.after denying the navy motion for reconsideration,trout ball,the district court referred the claims to a special master with instructions to determine which statistical methodology was most appropriate for determining backpay.id.at.by memoranda and orders of march,and december,the special master accepted the statistical analysis for calculating backpay provided by the trout class,and identified the members of the class entitled to relief.trout garrett,wl trout garrett,wl.
six days after became effective,the district court,on november,issued an order that identified the class members entitled to backpay,accepted the special master findings that the trout class regression analysis should be used to determine the amount of backpay,and awarded an interim backpay award of for the period from june through april.trout garrett.following this court dismissal of the navy appeal of interim backpay for lack of jurisdiction,trout sec y of the navy,per curiam,the district court ruled,on november,that the trout class was entitled to additional backpay because of the navy indefatigable and inappropriate delay tactics spanning twenty years of litigation,and expanded the backpay award to cover to the present,then november.trout.
by stipulation of january,the parties agreed that the trout class was entitled to additional backpay in the amount of for the period from june,through december.in a settlement agreement of september,the parties agreed the eligible trout class members were entitled to backpay through december,and attorneys fees through may,the trout class reserved the right to seek interest on backpay and attorneys fees under.the district court approved the settlement agreement on november.regarding the reservation in the settlement agreement for interest,the navy advised the district court that the government position was that was not retroactive,and consequently,interest did not begin to run on backpay and attorneys fees until november.by stipulation of may,the navy agreed to pay interest on backpay and attorneys fees awards beginning on november,again preserving the trout class right to seek interest for periods prior to november.
after this court issued its decision in brown,holding that did not apply to a period before its effective date,the district court awarded the trout class prejudgment interest back to.trout dalton,trout dalton,july.the district court,adopting the trout class argument,interpreted brown to bar interest only where the merits of the litigation had been completed before became effective,and concluded that b ecause the instant case was very much alive and being actively litigated on november,brown is not dispositive and the trout class members are entitled to prejudgment interest.while acknowledging that the liability phase had ended on april,the district court focused on the fact that the award phase was ongoing when became effective.the court entered a final judgment for the trout class on july,ordering the navy to pay prejudgment interest,based on the prime rate,on backpay in the amount of,and interest on attorneys fees in the amount of.trout england,july.
section provides title vii plaintiffs in suits against the federal government with the same interest to compensate for delay in payment as is available in cases against nonpublic parties.d.whether permits prejudgment interest for periods prior november,when it became effective,is a question of law that the court reviews de novo.herbert academy of sciences,cuddy carmen.however,this appeal turns on the proper interpretation of brown,which,absent en banc review,binds the court on the question of law.see lashawn barry.we turn,then,to an examination of the analysis in brown.
statutes waiving the sovereign immunity of the united states are subject to the rule of strict construction.library of congress shaw,d ruckelshaus sierra club,d.as such,waivers of sovereign immunity are to be read no more broadly than their terms require.brown,at.further,as the court had previously observed,any doubts about the scope of a waiver are to be resolved in favor of the narrower governmental liability.nichols pierce,see also shaw,at.at ruckelshaus.these principles of sovereign immunity understandably take on an added gloss of strictness when applied to claims of interest against the united states because the historical rule bars recovery of interest against the government unless the award of interest was affirmatively and separately contemplated by congress.shaw,at.at,see also brown,at thompson kennickell.
in brown,the court held that the rule of strict construction,enhanced by the rule,applies whether the court is examining a statute substantive scope or its temporal reach.at.the court rationale was twofold.first,absent express direction from congress that a statute is retroactive,to hold that a statute waives sovereign immunity from an element of damages not contemplated by congress or applies to a period of time not envisioned by congress,risks imposing upon the public fisc an unanticipated and potentially excessive liability.brown,at see also shaw,at.at nichols,at.second,the strict construction rule provides an important backdrop against which congress acts when it waives sovereign immunity.having indicated that this court would take the legislature strictly at its word when it specifies whether and to what extent it waives sovereign immunity,the court in brown
