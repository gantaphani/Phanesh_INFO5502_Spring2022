factual background 
this case was close and hotly contested both as to liability and as to punitive damages.the jury reached a verdict,presumably resolving those disputed questions in favor of the plaintiff.the questions presented arise on appeal of the district court resolution of harsco corporation motion for judgment as a matter of law.in light of the jury verdict,we must construe the evidence and inferences most favorably to the nonmoving party,and may not weigh the evidence,pass on the credibility of the witnesses,or substitute our conclusions for that of the jury.harolds stores,dillard dep t stores,cir.we summarize the facts and the evidence at trial in light of that standard.
renner was employed as a final inspector at harsco corporation from september,until august.there was evidence presented by renner that in august or september,renner once tolerable work environment dramatically changed.at least one made oinking and barking noises at her while she ordered lunch,stated that she so fat you would have to lift up her gut to f k her,and repeatedly stepped on her shoes.renner said she attempted to avoid the work areas of those perpetrating the harassment,but to no avail the perpetrators began frequenting her work area to continue their behavior.
there was evidence that the nature of the harassment also extended to comments about renner to carey world,her.renner testified that world was subjected to several comments because of his association with renner,and she testified that she overheard one say that world was late coming to work because he had been home f king renner.alvin bailey,another,informed world that he thought renner was a bitch and that he did not like her because he did not approve of women in the workplace.
on approximately december,renner complained to the office manager,deb jabbs,that she was the subject of this harassment.she informed jabbs of these incidents,and subsequently met with jabbs and the plant manager,robert shirey.renner testified that harsco corporation never apprised her of the results of its investigation.renner therefore decided to speak with her direct supervisor,jeff bagshaw,about the harassment.notwithstanding bagshaw assurance that the perpetrator was told not to enter her work area and that the harassment was taken care of,the same type of harassment continued within one week after renner complaint.
renner testified that,within a few months after her complaint,the perpetrator would walk into her work area by walking directly by bagshaw.yet bagshaw would walk away without intervening.world testimony further revealed bagshaw negligible response to renner complaints.bagshaw met with world to discuss the alleged harassment,but bagshaw never asked world for the perpetrators names,did not ask about additional harassment that world knew about or heard about,and did not ask when the harassment occurred.the conversation only lasted about three or four minutes.after this interaction,bagshaw convened a meeting of harsco corporation employees to convey that he would not tolerate sexual harassment in the workplace.but the comments continued,and only three weeks had passed before world again informed bagshaw that the comments were happening which he responded that he would take care of it.
with little response from harsco corporation,the comments continued into the next year.at least one called renner a fat f king c nt,and two stood in the front and back of her car after work so she was unable to leave.there was testimony that the effect of the harassment was debilitating renner stopped going to the lunch truck,stopped going to the bathroom during break time,and experienced psychological distress.
between december,the time of the first complaint,and march,renner spoke with bagshaw about the harassment on one occasion though she testified that management knew from other sources that the harassment was ongoing.in march,the nature of the harassment expanded.renner spit tobacco on her car a few times per week at first,and then almost every day until approximately may,when renner again complained to bagshaw.bagshaw told her that he would convene an employee meeting to address the situation,which he testified he did,but renner later went to jabbs office because no one informed her about an investigation.there was testimony that renner asked jabbs to provide her with a written version of the verbal complaint that renner lodged with bagshaw.jabbs told renner that she was too busy.at that point jabbs was sitting at her desk,unwrapping picture frames.
renner met with jabbs again on may or of.shirey was also present at this meeting,in which renner complained about the spitting incidents and other harassment.renner testified that shirey and jabbs made her feel stupid for going to the company again they did not tell her anything they had done to investigate the complaint,did not ask for witnesses,and it was like shirey sat out there with his arms folded and said,well,what do you want me to do about it as to bailey presence in renner work area,there was also testimony that shirey indicated that bailey was allowed to be in any area that he wanted to be in.
none of the people renner complained to visited her work environment to investigate ongoing harassment or prevent further harassment.the harassment continued even after this meeting.a called renner a mother f ker and would bark,grin,and moan at her.renner reported this incident to bagshaw.the harassment still continued.bailey,who was still frequenting her work area to perpetrate more harassment,intimidated renner by walking beside her while she walked to her car after work.on or about may,a blocked her from going to the bathroom by standing in front of the bathroom door.
renner went on a vacation during the first week of june.she was subjected to more harassment upon her return.a stated that he could still do renner if she just pulled down her pants.renner also testified that another told her that if renner got laid,then renner would have a better attitude and not be as picky with the tanks.and he said that when i was bent over the tanks,i was just in the right position for him,renner testified.the grunting,barking,and moaning persisted during this time.
on approximately july,renner met with harsco corporation human resources director,robert bomlitz.prior to the meeting,renner was never seriously interviewed by anyone within the company,and was not aware of any investigation or disciplinary action taken by the company.after the meeting,the harassment continued in full force until the plant shut down for maintenance toward the end of july.the harassment commenced again the day after the plant,with bailey blowing kisses at renner while she was walking to the bathroom.
renner again met with jabbs,bagshaw,and shirey on july,at which time they informed renner that they would conduct an investigation and would interview the people she had mentioned as having pertinent information about her harassment.
renner suffered a death in the family on august,so she left work until august.when she returned,a yelled liar,liar at her and made crying noises,and another made meow noises at her.at this point,shirey visited renner work area and informed her that she could walk around the outside of the building to use the rest room in the office so she could avoid the people harassing her yet renner testified that this was not a viable option due to the work pace she was required to keep.
renner testified that she quit her job after making repeated attempts to elicit harsco corporation assistance to stop the harassment.renner subsequently filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of utah.during the trial,the results of which are recounted above,renner admitted that she had not read harsco corporation materials,even though she signed a document stating that she had,and that she has signed statements in the past without verifying that they were true.harsco corporation attempted to follow up on this admission at trial by introducing evidence that renner signed a form falsely stating that the proceeds from this suit were exempt from her bankruptcy proceeding.the district court excluded that evidence.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,the defendant harsco challenges two of the district court rulings the denial of harsco motion for judgment as a matter of law and the ruling excluding evidence of renner alleged fraud.the plaintiff renner challenges the district court order granting harsco corporation motion for judgment as a matter of law as to the punitive damages award.we will address these three rulings in turn,followed by a discussion of renner request for appellate attorney fees.
harsco corporation motion for judgment as a matter of law 
this court reviews de novo a district court denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law,applying the same standard as the district court.baty willamette,cir,abrogated on other grounds by passenger morgan,d.we may find error in the district court ruling only if the evidence points but one way and is susceptible to no reasonable inferences supporting the party opposing the motion.vining enterprise fin.group,cir.we construe the evidence and inferences most favorably to the nonmoving party,and will refuse to weigh the evidence,pass on the credibility of the witnesses,or substitute our conclusions for those of the jury.harolds stores,at.however,we must enter judgment as a matter of law in favor of the moving party if there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis with respect to a claim or defense under the controlling law.baty,at.accordingly,the key issue is whether there was a legally sufficient basis for the jury to subject harsco corporation to liability under title vii,even after viewing the facts in the light most favorable to renner.
title vii prohibits an employer from discriminat ing against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual sex.a.this statutory provision prohibits subjecting an employee to a hostile work environment.meritor sav.bank,fsb vinson,d dick phone directories,cir.to establish that a sexually hostile work environment existed,a plaintiff must prove the following elements she is a member of a protected group she was subject to unwelcome harassment the harassment was based on sex and due to the harassment severity or pervasiveness,the harassment altered a term,condition,or privilege of the plaintiff employment and created an abusive working environment.dick,at alteration in original.
but even if a plaintiff satisfies these elements,the plaintiff must identify one of three alternative bases for holding his or her employer liable under title vii.the basis alleged here is that the employer was negligent or reckless.under this theory,renner was required to prove a fifth element of her claim that harsco corporation had actual or constructive knowledge of the hostile work environment but did not adequately respond to notice of the harassment.adler stores,cir.here,the first and second elements are not in dispute,so we focus our discussion on the third,fourth,and fifth elements.
as to the third the harassment must be because of the plaintiff critical issue in determining whether harassment is because of sex is whether members of one sex are subjected to a disadvantage to which the other sex is not.dick,at citing oncale sundowner offshore,d.renner could have proved this element through at least two evidentiary routes first,the inference is easy to draw if the harasser and the harassed employee are of opposite sexes,at least when the conduct at issue involves explicit or implicit proposals of sexual activity and second,a plaintiff may prove that the harasser treats men and women differently in the workplace.id.at.it is important to remember,however,that title vii is not a general civility code for the american workplace.oncale,at.the harassment must be because of the plaintiff sex.a.
the district court properly eschewed a mechanical approach to analyzing the evidence in favor of a totality of the circumstances test,and found that renner submitted sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the discrimination was because of her sex.see penry fed.home loan bank of topeka,cir stating that the existence of harassment is to be considered in light of the record as a whole.harsco corporation challenges this finding by claiming that the basis for the harassment was renner strict quality control standards it further avers that other male inspectors were similarly criticized.but harsco corporation fails to recognize both that renner overheard some of these comments and that these comments were about renner alleged sexual performances with other inspectors.harsco corporation further contends that the animal noises,baby noises,and liar,liar comment were.
in essence,harsco corporation asks us to circumvent the proper totality of the circumstances test by conveniently stripping facts of their context,which we have affirmed to be the touchstone of our analysis.the jury heard about several comments and actions that only renner was subjected to.harsco corporation has not demonstrated that no reasonable inference from the facts presented could support renner claim.
we now turn to the fourth severity or pervasiveness requirement.title vii prohibition of harassment on the basis of sex forbids only behavior so objectively offensive as to alter the conditions of the victim employment.oncale,at.put otherwise,conduct that is not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or beyond title vii purview.id.thus,the supreme court made clear that juries ought not find prohibited harassment merely based on ordinary socializing,such as intersexual flirtation.id.instead,the jury is to judge the objective severity of the harassment from the perspective of a reasonable person in the plaintiff position,considering all the circumstances.id.see also harris forklift systems,d stating that if the victim does not subjectively perceive the environment to be abusive,then the conduct has not altered the conditions of the victim employment,and there is no title vii violation.factors to consider include the frequency of the conduct its severity whether it is physically threatening or humiliating,or a mere offensive utterance and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee work performance.harris,at.
the defendant analyzes this element by citing cases denying title vii relief even though the plaintiffs were purportedly subjected to egregious behavior.see,penry fed.home loan bank of topeka,cir shepherd comptroller of pub.accounts,cir quinn green tree credit,cir.but harsco corporation attempt at reasoning by analogy fails because its mechanical comparison of a few strategically selected facts is precisely the type of analysis this court has rejected.moreover,examination of these cases reveals that harsco corporation has oversimplified their findings.penry involved isolated incidents over a four year period,most of which did not occur because of the plaintiffs sex the harasser and harassed in shepherd engaged in friendly discussion on almost a daily basis and had a friendly relationship both inside and outside of work except for the few intervening incidents,and there was no evidence that the alleged conduct would have unreasonably interfered with a reasonable person work environment and the court in quinn struck all but two of the
