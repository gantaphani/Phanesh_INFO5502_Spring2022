nearly eight years ago deja vu first challenged chapter of the metropolitan government of nashville and davidson county,tennessee metro code of laws on first and fourteenth amendment grounds.that challenge has generated a lengthy and convoluted history that includes an earlier visit to this court in deja vu i,so that deja vu provides a particularly appropriate label for this second appeal,which concerns the district court award of attorneys fees and expenses pursuant to we affirm.
enacted on august,chapter required both sexually oriented businesses to obtain operating licenses and performers in such businesses to obtain permits.deja vu sought to enjoin its enforcement shortly after enactment.in their initial motion for injunctive relief,the original deja vu plaintiffs argued that chapter was unconstitutional because it did not provide prompt judicial review.on december,the district court agreed and entered a preliminary injunction.but almost a year later that injunction was dissolved in response to metro amendments to chapter.deja vu appealed.
two weeks later,on december,deja vu filed in the district court a second motion for a preliminary injunction that asserted its previously preserved constitutional claims.metro responded in two ways first by assuring the court that certain provisions would be severed and that others would be subject to a limiting construction,and then by notifying the court that amendments to the ordinance had been enacted.even so,deja vu motion was granted on october,with metro being enjoined from enforcing chapter in its entirety.some ten weeks later the preliminary injunction was made permanent.although metro appealed that order,it also enacted further amendments to the ordinance to address the constitutional infirmities identified by the district court.metro then appealed again when the district court denied its.b motion to dissolve the injunction based on the new amendments.
in deja vu i we addressed all of the substantive issues preserved for appeal by both deja vu and metro.we concluded that the injunction against enforcement of chapter should remain in effect because that chapter judicial review provisions were constitutionally inadequate and that the statutory definition of sexually oriented was unconstitutionally broad but readily severable.rehearing and rehearing en banc were denied on february,and the supreme court denied certiorari on may,d.
deja vu has filed section motions for attorneys fees on four separate occasions during the pendency of the action.its first effort was an interim motion for fees based on its claimed prevailing party status as to the initial motion for preliminary injunction.that motion was eventually deemed a final application for fees after the district court entered the permanent injunction,and deja vu followed that entry with a second application based on its success on the second motion for injunctive relief.after we decided deja vu i,deja vu filed a third motion for fees associated with the appeal.and after the supreme court denied certiorari,deja vu filed its fourth and final motion.
deja vu first three motions were considered together by the magistrate judge,who recommended that the motions be granted but did not recommend a specific award amount.that recommendation was approved by the district court on december,as was the parties stipulation that the magistrate judge findings,if upheld,called for an award of.later the magistrate judge recommended that the fourth motion for in fees also be granted and that deja vu motion for costs and expenses to which metro had failed to respond be granted in the amount of.those recommendations were approved by the district court on september.metro now appeals the combined award of.
approval of the fee award 
when a case is brought under of section,as this one has been,section provides that the court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party,other than the united states,a reasonable attorney fee as part of the costs.although may allow has a permissive ring to it,the supreme court has read it as mandatory where the plaintiff prevails and special circumstances are absent see,indep.fed of flight attendants zipes,d.as to the determination of prevailing party status,granzeier middleton,cir most citations omitted has reconfirmed this circuit standards 
to be a prevailing party,a party must succeed on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing suit.in farrar hobby,d,the court explained that a plaintiff prevails when actual relief on the merits of his claim materially alters the legal relationship between the parties in a way that directly benefits the plaintiffs.the supreme court has rejected a central issue test which would require a party to succeed on the main issue of the litigation to be considered prevailing.rather,a party who partially prevails is entitled to an award of attorney fees commensurate to the party success.
in its current appeal metro raises essentially three objections to the fee awards.first,it argues that the supreme court decision in city of littleton gifts,d,which was decided after the fees were awarded,has stripped deja vu of its status as a prevailing party.second,it contends that even if deja vu is still properly considered a prevailing party,gifts introduces special circumstances that render an award of fees unjust.third,it advances the fallback position that even if deja vu is properly viewed as a prevailing party and even if no special circumstances exist,the specific amounts awarded by the district court were excessive and should be modified downward.for the reasons discussed here,we find none of those arguments persuasive.
prevailing party status 
it is beyond dispute that as of the dates that the attorneys fees awards were entered,deja vu was a prevailing party under the standards for such awards.after all,the net result of the litigation was the entry of a permanent injunction barring enforcement of chapter.that certainly qualifies as an enforceable judgment on the merits that materially alters the legal relationship between the parties by modifying the defendant behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiffs farrar,at.
metro understandably raises no serious objection along those lines.instead it argues that the intervening decision in gifts has changed the legal landscape so that deja vu can no longer be considered a prevailing party.specifically,metro contends that the only justifiable basis for a conclusion that deja vu was the prevailing party in the litigation is its success on its first motion for injunctive relief because its success on the second motion was de minimis.and because metro views gifts as eviscerating the basis for deja vu success on the first injunction,it concludes that deja vu is left without a predicate for prevailing party status.
on that score metro position misunderstands the effect that new decisions have on appeals such as this one.harper virginia department of taxation,d requires that new supreme court rulings must be given full retroactive effect in all cases still open on direct review.as metro would have it,the pendency of this appeal renders the entire controversy between it and deja vu on direct review,so that any new rule announced in gifts would be applicable to our disposition here because of harper.
but because harper is limited to cases still open on direct review,it is important to understand just what is meant by that language.in that respect the supreme court has long recognized a distinction between cases on direct review and those involving collateral attack on a final judgment see,bradley sch.bd.of the city of richmond,d.as to the latter category,judgments become final when the availability of appeal has been exhausted and lapsed,and the time to petition for certiorari has passed id.at.under that standard the december entry of a permanent injunction against the enforcement of chapter certainly qualified as a final judgment it was affirmed by this court,and the supreme court then denied certiorari.
so harper does not apply as to the injunctive relief that deja vu obtained against metro.instead t
