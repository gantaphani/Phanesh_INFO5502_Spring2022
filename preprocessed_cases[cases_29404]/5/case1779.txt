plaintiffs george drummond,rebecca drummond,and jesse marion brought this action against their former attorney,michael desmarais,and others,alleging that desmarais maliciously prosecuted two previous suits against plaintiffs,one seeking to recover fees claimed under a contract to provide legal services to plaintiffs in connection with the estate of their deceased father,and the other alleging that plaintiffs had maliciously sued desmarais when they objected to a petition seeking to pay his fees out of their father estate.defendants moved to strike the complaint under the statute,code of civil procedure section,arguing that plaintiffs would be unable to show that either of the predicate lawsuits was filed without probable cause or was terminated favorably on the merits.the trial court granted the motion and entered a judgment of dismissal.plaintiffs appeal,charging the trial court with innumerable errors.we conclude that since demarais suit for fees has been finally resolved in his favor,plaintiffs claims predicated on that action must fail.we also conclude that while the evidence before the trial court would amply sustain findings that desmarais acted maliciously and without probable cause in suing his clients for malicious prosecution based on their objections to his fees,his voluntary dismissal of that suit after reversal of the underlying judgment on appeal was not a termination on the merits in plaintiffs favor,such as would be required to sustain their malicious prosecution claim.
accordingly,we will affirm.
background 
prior proceedings 
this is the fifth major appellate chapter in a cluster of related suits and disputes.because plaintiffs counsel has once again failed to supply an adequate statement of the operative facts,we will once again extract the relevant background primarily from our prior opinions.
plaintiffs father,george marion drummond decedent,died on august,leaving an estate worth several million dollars.estate of drummond,nonpub.opn,wl drummond i see estate of drummond,wl nonpub.opn.drummond ii estate of drummond th,d drummond iii drummond temmerman,desmarais phillips,nonpub.opn,wl drummond iv.his widow,ok yon choe,whom he had married a few weeks before his death,petitioned to admit into probate a purported will by which he ostensibly bequeathed his entire estate to her.ibid.after initially consulting attorney james rodriguez,plaintiffs engaged defendant michael desmarais to oppose the petition and thereby preserve their claims to shares of the estate by intestate succession.the agreement entitled desmarais to a contingency fee up to percent of the net amount recovered.
eventually the probate court granted judgment on the pleadings against the widow petition to admit the proffered instrument to probate.while her appeal from that order was pending,the parties reached a settlement.drummond i,supra.in november the court approved a first distribution of estate assets including over to desmarais as fees.on march,the administrator filed a petition seeking a further distribution including about in fees to desmarais.on march,jesse marion appeared at the hearing on this petition and requested a continuance on the ground,among others,that she had major issues with attorney fees and tax es.plaintiffs engaged their present attorney,michael morrissey,and filed notice of objection on april,followed by further declarations and objections on june and june.
in these filings plaintiffs complained,as summarized in drummond ii,supra,and,that desmarais,the administrator,and counsel for the administrator had attempted to defraud the in the hopes of personal gain,that the administrator and his lawyer had filed a fraudulent tax return,that they had overcharged the estate,that the extraordinary fees claimed by the administrator attorney were excessive,that children consent to the contingency fee agreement was obtained by duress and undue influence,that the contingency fee agreement was unconscionable and unenforceable,that desmarais had entered into an illegal arrangement with rodriguez,that desmarais had concocted a scheme to have his fee calculated against the gross amount allocated to children contrary to the provisions of the fee agreement,and that desmarais had abandoned his clients and withdrawn from the case.they asserted that desmarais expected to receive million while children had only received a combined total of.
desmarais and the administrator moved for summary judgment on the objections.the probate court granted that motion and entered judgment on august.plaintiffs appealed on october.they then filed a civil action against demarais,his firm,and rodriguez,reasserting the claims lodged as objections in the probate matter.
on february,desmarais filed,in propria persona,a complaint for compensatory and punitive prosecution of civil action.in it he alleged that george drummond and jesse marion,together with attorney morrissey,had,o n march,june,and june,instituted a civil action against desmarais claiming damages in the sum of as the proximate result of a fee agreement between desmarais and the defendants that was unconscionable and was procured by desmarais fraud,breach of fiduciary duty and professional negligence and abandonment of representation.the action was entitled estate of george marion,george drummond,jesse marion and rebecca drummond,contestants temmerman,desmarais phillips,llp,michael desmarais and james rodriguez,richard lambie and john willoughby,defendants.nowhere in the complaint did desmarais disclose that he had invented this title,which had never been borne by any pleading,or that the only relevant events on the dates set forth concerned objections by estate claimants to a proposed distribution of estate assets.he went on to allege that summary judgment had been granted on august,in favor of all defendants in action number,including plaintiff herein,without mentioning that the resulting judgment was then on appeal.he alleged that the action was brought without probable cause in that the contestants did not honestly and reasonably believe that there were grounds for the action because they had obtained a judgment recovering of the decedent estate at the expense of his surviving spouse due to the services rendered by plaintiff over a three year period of time following multiple law and motion and evidentiary hearings,two settlement conferences supervised by retired california supreme court justice edward panelli and the entry of multiple judgments in their favor,including the november,judgment by honorable thomas hansen that approved plaintiff fee agreement with defendants.he alleged that they acted maliciously in that their motive and purpose was to wrong plaintiff by denying him the attorney fees to which he was entitled pursuant to their fee agreement with him and the november,judgment approving that fee agreement by,among other things,falsely claiming that the fee agreement was unconscionable and was procured by plaintiff fraud,breach of fiduciary duty,and professional negligence and abandonment of his representation.finally,he alleged that the defendants acted in conscious and deliberate disregard of his rights,entitling him to punitive damages.
on june,the trial court sustained plaintiffs demurrer to desmarais complaint on the ground that an appeal was pending from the underlying judgment.the court granted leave to amend,but stayed the order during the pendency of the appeal from the judgment in the underlying action,court of appeal case number,drummond i,supra.this court issued its decision in that appeal on march,reversing the grant of summary judgment on plaintiffs objections to the second distribution of estate assets,and holding,among other things,that desmarais had lacked standing to bring such a motion because he was not a party to the proceeding.drummond i,supra.our remittitur issued on june.
some days after we issued that decision,desmarais made himself a party to the probate proceeding by filing a petition there for the fees he claimed were due.at the same time he moved to consolidate the new petition with plaintiffs civil action against him,for the manifest purpose of bringing the latter before the same court that was presiding over the estate.morrissey objected to both filings,in response to which desmarais asserted a right to judgment on the pleadings because plaintiffs had failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a defense to the petition.under rather remarkable circumstances described more fully in drummond ii,supra,and,the trial court apparently granted this request in any event it entered a judgment on july,requiring plaintiffs to pay some to desmarais.plaintiffs appealed.
meanwhile,apparently relying on the appellate judgment in drummond i,supra,plaintiffs moved to dismiss desmarais malicious prosecution complaint.the trial court denied that motion on july.on september of that year,with the children second appeal drummond ii,supra,now pending,the court denied a second motion to dismiss.on june,we issued our decision in that matter,reversing the judgment on desmarais fee petition and directing the probate court to take no further action on it because the petition violated the compulsory rule.
according to a declaration signed some months later,desmarais voluntarily dismissed his malicious prosecution action without prejudice on july.the dismissal does not appear in the record.
proceedings below 
plaintiffs apparently filed the complaint in this action in or around late july it sets forth two distinct claims under a single count for malicious prosecution first,that desmarais,aided by his insurer,filed his complaint for malicious prosecution without probable cause and without any reasonable belief that it could ever be successful and second,that all defendants caused the fee petition to be filed against plaintiffs in the probate matter,also without probable cause,alleg ing falsely that the plaintiffs each had a contract requiring them to pay defendant desmarais over,that the plaintiffs had converted monies from defendant desmarais,and that the plaintiffs had received money that was supposed to go to defendant desmarais 
all defendants demurred to the complaint and moved to strike it under section.the gist of the motion to strike was that plaintiffs could not show that either of the predicate probate fee petition or desmarais own malicious prosecution been terminated on the merits in plaintiffs favor.defendants also appeared to argue that plaintiffs could not show that desmarais filed the actions without probable cause.plaintiffs asserted in opposition that no reasonable attorney,and thus no attorney acting for reasons other than malice,could have filed the malicious prosecution complaint desmarais filed.they further contended that a jury should decide whether the voluntary dismissal of the malicious prosecution action was a termination on the merits morrissey,who also represented plaintiffs in this matter,filed a declaration the gist of which was that none of the defendants could have acted in good faith,or without malice,in pursuing the two predicate matters.deborah drummond,the spouse of one of the plaintiffs,filed a declaration detailing conduct by desmarais which we describe more fully below in connection with his argument concerning the element of malice.see pt.iiia,post.
the trial court granted the special motion to strike and entered a judgment of dismissal.this appeal seasonably followed.
subsequent proceedings 
while this matter was pending,the claims asserted in plaintiffs civil action and desmarais were tried to a jury.the jury found by special verdict that desmarais had breached his fiduciary duties to plaintiffs,but not that plaintiffs suffered legal harm as a consequence.it also apparently found that desmarais had not charged an excessive fee under the contract and that,assuming the contract did not provide for the calculation of his fee before deducting estate taxes,plaintiffs were not harmed by that calculation because the resulting tax benefits redounded to their advantage.we have now affirmed that judgment in drummond iv,supra.
discussion 
introduction 
the question before us is whether the trial court properly dismissed both of plaintiffs claims in response to defendants special motion to strike under section.such a motion triggers a inquiry.first,the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity.the moving defendant burden is to demonstrate that the act or acts of which the plaintiff complains were taken in furtherance of the defendant right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue,as defined in the statute,subd.b.if the court finds such a showing has been made,it then determines whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.under section,subdivision b,the trial court in making these determinations considers the pleadings,and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based.equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,d.
the gist of plaintiffs claims is that defendants wrongfully pursued litigation.litigation is activity protected by the speech and petition clauses.see jarrow formulas,lamarche cal th,d,and cases there cited jarrow.the claims therefore fall squarely within the reach of section.plaintiffs do not appear to contend otherwise.they therefore necessarily predicate their claim of error on the premise that,contrary to the trial court view,they have demonstrated a probability that they would prevail on their claims.
a plaintiff establishes the requisite probability of success by stat ing and substantiat ing a legally sufficient claim.jarrow,supra,cal th at,d,quoting rosenthal great western fin.securities cal th,d.the court below found that plaintiffs stated a legally sufficient claim in that their complaint is legally sufficient to establish the elements of malicious prosecution.the pivotal question is therefore whether plaintiffs adequately substantiated that claim.that question in turn requires a determination whether the complaint is supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.jarrow,supra,cal th at,d,quoting wilson parker,covert chidester cal th,d,wilson.in deciding the question of potential merit,the trial court considers the pleadings and evidentiary submissions of both the plaintiff and the defendant citation though the court does not weigh the credibility or comparative probative strength of competing evidence,it should grant the motion if,as a matter of law,the defendant evidence supporting the motion defeats the plaintiff attempt to establish evidentiary support for the claim.jarrow,supra,cal th at,fn,d,quoting wilson,supra,cal th at,d.
in addressing this question the trial court properly focused on the elements of plaintiffs malicious prosecution cause of action,which are a the institution of an action at the direction of the defendant b without probable cause and c with malice,d termination of the initial action favorably to the plaintiff,and e resulting damage.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.torts,see.the court found that in view of the history of the underlying dispute,plaintiffs would be unable to establish that either of the underlying suits was pursued without probable cause,or was finally determined in plaintiffs favor.the court found that such findings were precluded with respect to both actions by the ultimate success of desmarais claim for fees,which the court described as the core dispute in all this litigation.while we disagree with that conclusion as respects the claim predicated on desmarais own malicious prosecution claim,we affirm as to both claims because plaintiffs can not establish a favorable termination on the merits as to either.
ii.probate petition 
we first address the sufficiency of the facts presented by plaintiffs to sustain their claim that desmarais committed the tort of malicious prosecution by pursuing his petition for fees in the probate court.to sustain a malicious prosecution claim,the prior action must have terminated in favor of the present plaintiff.witkin,summary of cal.law,supra,torts.however,it is not enough that the present plaintiff former defendant prevailed in the action.sierra club foundation graham th,d pattiz minye th,d.the termination must reflect on the merits,and be such that it tended to indicate the former defendant innocence of or lack of responsibility for the alleged misconduct.witkin,summary of cal.law,supra,torts,see.a disposition on technical or procedural grounds does not reflect on the merits for purposes of this requirement.lackner lacroix cal d.
we may assume for present purposes that desmarais probate petition terminated in plaintiffs favor with drummond ii,supra,and,where we set aside the lower court order favoring desmarais and directed that court to take no further action in that matter.but as we later observed in drummond iii,supra,th at page,d,that disposition was only an interim victory on the ground that desmarais had attempted to pursue his claims in the wrong forum because he was required,under the compulsory rule,to bring those claims in the court where plaintiffs claims against him were already pending.although we have found no case explicitly so holding,we see no reason to doubt that a termination based upon violation of the compulsory rule is a technical disposition rather than one on the merits.see hudis crawford th,d dismissal for lack of standing.this renders it flatly impossible for plaintiffs to establish a favorable termination on the merits.
indeed counsel for plaintiffs seems to backhandedly concede the point,writing,admittedly,the law has probably evolved to such an extent that ordinarily maintaining a suit in the wrong court will not serve as an independent basis for the tort of malicious prosecution.inexplicably,however,he goes on to assert that plaintiffs have established a claim for the malicious institution of a petition in the probate court the ensuing discussion fails to substantiate this assertion.first plaintiffs say that the fee claim was maintained in the probate court for improper purposes to get a ruling from a friendly judge,to avoid a jury trial,to run up the fees the drummonds would have to pay in connection with the administration of the estate,to prolong the administration of the estate,and to increase the fees of the administrator,who,they observe,was and is a client of desmarais.
all of this might establish the element of malice see pt,post,but it does not establish the separate requirement of a favorable termination on the merits.it might also establish the ulterior,extrinsic motive required to establish the distinct tort of abuse of process.see witkin,summary of cal.law,supra,torts.but plaintiffs make no attempt to defend the complaint on the basis that it pleads,or could be amended to plead,such a claim.see oprian goldrich,kest associates d,fn.an action for abuse of process is established only where the process is abused or misused for a purpose other than that for which it is designed.bidna rosen th,d simply filing or maintaining a lawsuit for an improper purpose is not abuse of process.
the trial court did not err by granting the special motion to strike as to the cause of action for malicious prosecution based upon desmarais probate petition for fees.
iii.malicious prosecution 
we turn to the question whether plaintiffs showed a probability of prevailing on their claim that desmarais committed malicious prosecution by charging them with malicious prosecution based upon their lodging of objections to the probate petition seeking his fees.defendants contend that plaintiffs can establish none of the three elements of liability,malice,lack of probable cause,or a favorable termination on the merits.
the term malice,which appears throughout the law of torts,almost always refers to a reprehensible mental state.its particular meaning,however,varies from one context to the next.as an element of the tort of malicious prosecution,malice at its core refers to an improper motive for bringing the prior action.see sheldon appel albert oliker cal d,referring to the defendant motivation and the subjective intent or purpose with which the defendant acted in initiating the prior action.as an element of liability it reflects the core function of the tort,which is to secure compensation for harm inflicted by misusing the judicial system,using it for something other than to enforce legitimate rights and secure remedies to which the claimant may tenably claim an entitlement.thus the cases speak of malice as being present when a suit is actuated by hostility or ill will,or for some purpose other than to secure relief.see sycamore ridge apartments,llc naumann th,d albertson raboff cal d,richter neilson d.it is also said that a plaintiff acts with malice when he asserts a claim with knowledge of its falsity,because one who seeks to establish such a claim can only be motivated by an improper purpose.albertson raboff,supra,cal d at.a lack of probable cause will therefore support an inference of malice.soukup law offices of herbert hafif cal th,d,paulus bob lynch ford,th,d lack of probable cause not sufficient by itself.
because malice concerns the former plaintiff actual mental state,it necessarily presents a question of fact.sheldon appel albert oliker,supra,cal d at.here there is ample evidence that desmarais filed his suit with the requisite mental state.as will appear in the following section,a trier of fact could readily find that that desmarais acted without probable cause when he sued his former clients in tort,threatening them with punitive damages,merely for objecting to his fees.there is ample ground for an inference that in so acting he was motivated by hostility,ill will,spite,vindictiveness,and a desire to intimidate,rather than out of any genuine hope,or indeed intention,that plaintiffs would actually be found liable for malicious prosecution.in addition to numerous objective circumstances supporting such an inference,something approaching direct evidence is found in the declaration of deborah drummond,who attested,i n november of following one of the hearings where my husband and were unable to get any money from the estate because of desmarais blocking of any distributions to us,he began taunting us by following me and my and making comments like,hey ok,lend me some money ok,come on lend me some money and laughing and snickering at an order of examination in,desmarais and william gustafson said,in front of my children,that they were going to take our home.they asked to see title to cars that we had when they knew that the money in the estate was more than four or five times desmarais claim.desmarais and gustafson also took actions such as demanding that we provide them with our minor children addresses.paragraph numbers omitted.
we have no doubt that a jury could infer malice from such evidence.
probable cause 
probable cause exists when a cause of action is,objectively speaking,legally tenable.citations.videotape plus,lyons th,d.the claim need not be meritorious in fact,but only arguably tenable.paiva nichols th,d paiva,italics in original.the presence or absence of probable cause is viewed under an objective standard applied to the facts upon which the defendant acted in prosecuting the prior case.citation.the test is whether any reasonable attorney would have thought the claim to be tenable.citation,at,d see id.at,d not so completely lacking in apparent merit that no reasonable attorney would have thought the claim tenable.thus a litigant will lack probable cause for his action either if he relies upon facts which he has no reasonable cause to believe to be true,or if he seeks recovery upon a legal theory which is untenable under the facts known to him.sangster paetkau th,d.
if there is a dispute concerning the facts or beliefs on which the former plaintiff acted,that question must be resolved by a trier of fact.videotape plus,lyons,supra,th at,d probable cause is a question of law unless the former plaintiff knowledge and belief are disputed.it is a question of law for the court,however,whether the facts found support a tenable claim.paiva,supra,th at,d.
the question here is whether the evidence of record would support a finding that when desmarais instituted or maintained his malicious prosecution suit,he either relie d upon facts which he ha d no reasonable cause to believe to be true,or was pursuing a theory that was untenable under the facts known to him.sangster paetkau,supra,th at,d.we think a jury could easily conclude that,whatever desmarais might reasonably hope to prove about the other elements of his claim,he had no reasonable cause to believe that he could show his clients had acted with malice in objecting to his fees.
it will be recalled that malice for these purposes requires some reprehensible motivation for the suit,such as personal hatred or an improper objective.we see no competent suggestion of any such motivation anywhere in this record.desmarais complaint charged plaintiffs with malice in only the most conclusory,boilerplate terms,stating that they acted maliciously in bringing the action against plaintiff in that their motive and purpose was to wrong plaintiff by denying him attorney fees to which he was entitled pursuant to their fee agreement with him and the november,judgment approving that fee agreement by,among other things,falsely claiming that the fee agreement was unconscionable and was procured by plaintiffs sic fraud,breach of fiduciary duty and professional negligence and abandonment of his representation.stripped of legal conclusions this allegation states only that plaintiffs brought their action to deny desmarais fees to which they claimed he was not entitled.doubtless this was indeed the purpose of their probate objections,but there is nothing improper about it.later the complaint sets out a lengthier boilerplate allegation of malice in connection with the plea for punitive damages,but the malice required in that context is a different kind than concerns us here,and none of the boilerplate language there comes any closer to suggesting a genuine factual basis to suppose that plaintiffs brought their suit for any reason other than to enforce rights they believed they had.
a factfinder could thus find that desmarais did not believe his clients had acted with malice when they objected to his fees.that finding would support,indeed,it would virtually dictate a finding that he himself lacked probable cause to sue them for malicious prosecution based on that conduct.
defendants attempt to raise a categorical bar to such findings based upon the proposition that the ultimate defeat of plaintiffs claims against desmarais conclusively established probable cause for his malicious prosecution action.they state,since appellants have failed to prove that their objections were terminated in their favor and were asserted with probable cause,they have failed to meet their burden to prove that the desmarais drummond malicious prosecution action lacked probable cause this is a non sequitur.desmarais complaint was brought without probable cause unless he reasonably believed that he could make a tenable case for each of the elements necessary to prevail.a man does not plead a tenable claim for battery merely because he believes that someone touched his body.he must also believe that the touching was harmful or offensive,and intentional.likewise desmarais did not plead a tenable malicious prosecution claim merely because he believed,if he did,that plaintiffs lacked probable cause to object to his fees.he had to also believe that they lodged those objections maliciously.the mere fact that he ultimately defeated their objections will not categorically sustain such a belief,or defeat an inference that it was lacking.
indeed,events long after his complaint was filed and dismissed can have no logical bearing on the question of probable cause,because the essence of that element is the tenability of desmarais claims based upon his knowledge and belief at the time he filed them.as we have already noted see pt.ii,ante,the ultimate disposition of plaintiffs objections precludes plaintiffs maintenance of a malicious prosecution suit arising out of them.but it does so by precluding a finding of a termination on the merits in their favor.it can have no bearing on the tenability of desmarais claim for malicious prosecution.see soukup law offices of herbert hafif,supra,cal th,d,fn.omitted diaries procured after suit filed could not have provided former plaintiffs with probable cause for filing the action and naming current plaintiff as a defendant in it.
defendants seem to argue that their ultimate success on the original dispute establishes that plaintiffs lacked probable cause to object to desmarais fees,and that from the lack of probable cause,malice may be inferred.but the first premise is wrong,and the inference defendants would draw from it is unsound.the mere fact that a party loses a lawsuit does not establish that he lacked probable cause to bring it.
indeed the grounds on which desmarais defended and ultimately defeated plaintiffs we have just had occasion to review in connection with drummond iv,supra,indicate that plaintiffs objections were tenable.their ultimate failure appears to have been accomplished through arguments having little bearing on their apparent merit.thus one of the claims of breach was that desmarais calculated his fees against the estate in violation of contract language providing for calculation against the net amount recovered.id.a major defense to this claim,and one the jury may well have sustained in preference to desmarais other chief argument on the subject,was that,assuming the contract was breached in this respect,any harm to plaintiffs was offset by tax benefits directly resulting from the breach.ibid.this concession of a breach of the contract,however hypothetical or contingent it may have been,makes it all but impossible to conclude that plaintiffs objections lacked colorable merit.and while the jury apparently did not find sufficient fraud in the inducement,or other misconduct,to vitiate the fee contract,neither did it find desmarais to have been innocent of wrongdoing.on the contrary,it expressly found that he had breached his fiduciary duties to,again,that plaintiffs suffered no harm as a result.ibid.such a verdict falls far short of establishing that the rejected claims were brought without probable cause,or that desmarais believed they were when he filed and maintained his suit.
favorable termination on the merits 
although plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence to establish the elements of malice and lack of probable cause,the same can not be said of the element of a favorable termination on the merits.as we have already noted,that element requires that the termination of the prior action reflect on the merits and tend to indicate the former defendant innocence of or lack of responsibility for the alleged misconduct.witkin,summary of cal.law,supra,torts,see.thus,a voluntary dismissal on technical grounds,such as lack of jurisdiction,laches,the statute of limitations or prematurity,does not constitute a favorable termination because it does not reflect on the substantive merits of the underlying claim.citations.robbins blecher th,d.
desmarais filed a declaration asserting that he dismissed the action for financial reasons.a factfinder would be entitled to find that declaration unworthy of belief for a large number of reasons,including that he was representing himself and thus appeared to be incurring no attorney fees he waited three and a half years to dismiss the action,during which time he went to some effort to defend it against repeated motions to dismiss he voluntarily dismissed it days after this court denied rehearing in drummond ii,supra,and,which effectively sounded a death knell for his complaint his declaration was exceptionally vague about what exactly constituted his supposed motivating discovery,and when it was made and the declaration appeared to have been adapted from an unpublished opinion of this court,which it copied verbatim in substantial part,although the quoted language was a mere description or summary of the evidence in that case 
the nebulousness and implausibility of the claimed financial motive for dismissal distinguishes this case from contemporary services staff pro,th,d,on which desmarais primarily relies.the other case he cites on t
