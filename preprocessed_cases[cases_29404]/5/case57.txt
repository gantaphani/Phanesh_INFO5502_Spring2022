this appeal requires us to consider the circumstances under which a litigant who obtains significant relief through a settlement,rather than a verdict or a formal consent decree,may achieve prevailing party status and,thus,become eligible for an award of attorneys fees under a typical federal statute.the appeal also requires us to consider when,short of the entry of a final judgment,prevailing party status may attach.
these questions and the other questions before us arise in the following setting.after the parties reached a negotiated settlement resolving the substance of a complicated class action,the district court awarded the plaintiffs attorneys fees and expenses totaling over of a million dollars.the defendants appeal,asseverating that the district court improperly characterized the plaintiffs as prevailing parties acted prematurely in arriving at that conclusion and to add insult to injury,set the amount of the award too generously.we conclude that the district court appropriately characterized the plaintiffs as prevailing parties,that the relief obtained was sufficiently final to justify a fee award,and that the court acted within the purview of its discretion in fixing the amount.consequently,we affirm.
background 
on may,the named individuals with acquired brain injuries who qualify for care services under the medicaid program and two organizations devoted to their cause the brain injury association of massachusetts and the stavros center for independent living filed suit to compel the officials of the commonwealth of massachusetts collectively,the commonwealth to comply with title ii of the americans with disabilities act ada,section of the rehabilitation act,a,and the reasonable promptness provision of the medicaid program as set forth in the social security act,a,a a,by offering services and programs for individuals with acquired brain injuries in integrated community settings.the commonwealth filed an answering motion,which triggered a spate of motion practice.
on july,the plaintiffs moved for class certification.they then served an array of discovery requests.the commonwealth to stay discovery pending a decision on class certification.the district court granted a stay.
on september,the court certified a class.shortly thereafter,the parties began settlement negotiations in earnest and agreed to suspend discovery while negotiations proceeded.the talks proved fruitful and,on may,the parties executed a settlement agreement the agreement that they described as final and comprehensive.
in terms,the agreement required the commonwealth,over a period of years,to expand community services residential and for individuals with acquired brain injuries.to this end,the commonwealth is charged with developing several new projects and programs.the commonwealth responsibilities are,however,subject to its ability to secure both funding from the state legislature and necessary approvals from the federal government.with respect to these matters,the agreement impresses an obligation on the commonwealth to use best efforts.if the commonwealth is unable to obtain funding or approvals and the agreement stalls,either side may move to vacate the settlement so that the plaintiffs can litigate the case.
the agreement contemplates that the case will remain open for a period of years while the commonwealth performs thereunder it authorizes dismissal of the action only after the commonwealth has completed certain specified obligations and is found to be in substantial compliance with the agreement terms.the agreement further provides that the district court shall retain jurisdiction to hear and adjudicate noncompliance motions.
because the district court had certified a class,the agreement required judicial approval.see.e.the parties jointly moved for this approval and,after a preliminary fairness hearing,the district court allowed the approval process to move forward.the court acknowledged,at the commonwealth urging,that the agreement memorialized a settlement and was not tendered as a consent decree.
after the class members were notified of the proposed settlement,see.e,the district court held a final fairness hearing.the court again noted that the agreement does not constitute a consent decree but is a settlement agreement of this disputed case.the plaintiffs suggested that the court approve the agreement by entering it as a court order,but the commonwealth objected.the court expressed its willingness to indicate,either orally or through a written order,its finding that the agreement represented a fair and appropriate resolution of the matter.it then asked the parties to submit a draft of a proposed order for approval of the agreement.
on july,each side submitted a proposed order.the parties disagreed as to whether the court needed explicitly to retain jurisdiction as a means of facilitating subsequent enforcement of the agreement.in an effort to achieve a meeting of the minds,the district court suggested the following language 
t he court approves the comprehensive settlement agreement.this case will not be closed and judgment will not enter pending compliance with the terms of the settlement agreement.
this suggestion did not please anyone.the plaintiffs feared that,without language explicitly retaining enforcement jurisdiction,the court authority might be questioned in the event that further compliance proceedings become necessary.for its part,the commonwealth expressed concern that the court words might be transformed into the functional equivalent of a consent decree.the commonwealth noted that,in the course of settlement negotiations,it had consistently maintained its unwillingness to resolve the case by means of a document that could be functionally a consent decree.
faced with this impasse,the district court took the matter under advisement.on september,the court,acting without further input from the parties,entered a final approval order.the order states in pertinent part 
t he court finds that the comprehensive settlement agreement is fair,reasonable,and adequate.therefore,the court approves the comprehensive settlement agreement,noting that the parties agree that this agreement does not constitute a consent decree,and that the court will retain jurisdiction over the case.the court orders that this case not be closed and that judgment not enter pending compliance with the terms of the comprehensive settlement agreement.
the entry of the approval order set the stage for the developments leading to this appeal.the plaintiffs,claiming to be prevailing parties,moved for an award of attorneys fees including costs in the amount of the commonwealth disputed the prevailing party characterization,the timing of the motion for fees,and the reasonableness of the requested award.the district court found that the plaintiffs were prevailing parties,that fees were presently allowable,and that the amount sought was eminently fair.accordingly,it awarded the plaintiffs the full amount sought.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
the commonwealth prosecutes this appeal on three fronts.first it asserts that the plaintiffs are not prevailing parties and that,therefore,they are not entitled to a fee award.second,it questions the timing of the plaintiffs quest for fees.its fallback position is that,even if we find its first two points unconvincing,the district court nevertheless committed an abuse of discretion in determining the size of the award.we consider these assertions sequentially.
prevailing party status.
we review a determination of prevailing party status de novo.aronov napolitano,cir en banc smith fitchburg pub,cir.statutes represent a departure from the historic american rule,which dictates that parties to a case normally will bear their own counsel fees and costs.see alyeska pipeline serv.wilderness soc y.when,as in this case,the application of such a statute cuts through the government traditional sovereign immunity,it must be construed strictly in favor of the government.aronov,at citing ardestani ins.
the text of the ada provision reads in its entirety 
in any action or administrative proceeding commenced pursuant to this chapter,the court or agency,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party,other than the united states,a reasonable attorney fee,including litigation expenses,and costs,and the united states shall be liable for the foregoing the same as a private individual.
when used in a federal statute,the term prevailing party is a legal term of art.buckhannon bd.care home.dep t of health human.the concepts that shape the term apply broadly to the entire universe of federal statutes see smith,at doe boston pub,cir.
to qualify as a prevailing party,a litigant must show that a material alteration of the parties legal relationship has taken place as a result of the litigation.state teachers ass garland indep.sch.in addition,a party must demonstrate that the alteration possesses a judicial imprimatur.buckhannon,at emphasis in original.we need only discuss the second of these requirements here,as the commonwealth asserts that the plaintiffs have failed to satisfy the judicial imprimatur requirement.
the buckhannon court identified only two situations in which this judicial imprimatur requirement would necessarily be satisfied where the plaintiff received a judgment on the merits or where she obtained a consent decree.id.the justices left open the question of whether and if so,under what circumstances a settlement that is not embodied in a formal consent decree may serve as the gateway to prevailing party status.the case at hand requires us to ponder this question.
we do not write on a pristine page our recent en banc opinion in aronov provides guidance.there,we indicated that an order short of a formal consent decree might be sufficient for this purpose.at.we emphasized,however,that this inquiry must focus on substance,not form.it follows that it is the function of the order that carries the most weight in determining whether it may serve as the linchpin for prevailing party status.see id.explaining that it is the reality,not the nomenclature which is at issue see also id.at collecting cases from other circuits reaching the same conclusion.thus,rather than look exclusively at the label attached to a particular order,an inquiring court must consider whether the order contains the sort of judicial involvement and actions inherent in a court ordered consent decree.id.at.
the commonwealth argues that aronov directs us to ignore the agreement itself and look exclusively at the approval order when mulling whether the order contains elements inherent in a conventional consent decree.that is too crabbed a reading of aronov.indeed,such a myopic approach would be at odds with aronov instruction that w hether an order contains a sufficient judicial imprimatur can only be determined by determining the content of the order against the entire context before the court.id.at emphasis supplied smyth ex rel.smyth rivero,cir examining whether agreement and dismissal order were,in combination,equivalent to a consent decree.we thus construe the approval order in light of both the content of the agreement itself and its entire context.
our inquiry looks to three factors.the first factor is whether the change in the legal relationship between the parties was.aronov,at quoting buckhannon,at.the second factor is whether there was judicial approval of the relief the merits of the case.id.the third factor is whether there exists continuing judicial oversight and ability to enforce the obligations imposed on the parties.id.we start with a determination of whether the change in legal relationship is.
the agreement itself specifically provides that,in the absence of court approval,the agreement shall be null and void and of no force and effect.hence,it is the approval order that makes the provisions of the agreement binding on the parties and gives bite to their reciprocal obligations.in other words,this is a situation in which the court order triggers the change in the relationship between the parties,not one in which the court merely recognizes what the government has voluntarily agreed to do and only requir es the government to follow through.id.at alterations in original quoting smith,at.given this reality,we find that the court involvement is sufficient to satisfy the first prong of the inquiry.
the second prong of the inquiry requires us to determine whether there has been judicial approval of the relief the merits of the case.id.at.under the civil rules,a court must approve a settlement in a class action and is directed to do so only if it finds the terms of the settlement fair,reasonable,and adequate.e see ass of chain drug stores new engl.carpenters health benefits fund,cir.this is strikingly similar to a court role in entering a consent role that requires a court to ensure that the terms of the proposed decree are fair and not unlawful.smyth,at.
this background informs the meaning of the phrase appraisal of the merits in the prevailing party context.on the facts here,the district court,while evaluating the fairness of the settlement under rule e,engaged in a sufficient appraisal of the merits for purposes of the imprimatur requirement.
in the process of approving the agreement,the court complied fully with the requirements of rule e.it held multiple hearings during which it displayed its familiarity with the terms of the agreement.at the hearing held on july,the court expressed its satisfaction that the interests of the plaintiff class had been adequately considered.the court extended engagement with the substance of the agreement easily distinguishes this case from the virtually nonexistent review conducted in aronov,f d at,where the district court merely entered an electronic docket entry granting the agreed motion to remand.for these reasons,we conclude that a sufficient appraisal of the merits occurred.
this leaves the third prong of the inquiry,in which we ask whether there exists an obligation to comply and the provision of judicial oversight to enforce that obligation.id.at citing smyth,at see petersen gibson,cir holding that a settlement short of a consent decree may qualify as a basis for prevailing party status if the order provided that the court would retain jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the settlement.
in the approval order,the district court expressly retained jurisdiction over the case.this fits tongue and groove with the terms of the agreement,which makes pellucid the parties shared desire that the court retain jurisdiction to hear and adjudicate noncompliance motions on a basis.finally,the approval order instructs that the case not be closed and that judgment not enter pending compliance with the terms of the agreement.these features distinguish the case at hand from the swath of cases in which a district court merely recognizes the fact of a settlement and dismisses the underlying action.see,smith,at see also buckhannon,at noting that federal jurisdiction to enforce private settlements within the structure of the original case is lacking unless the terms of the settlement are incorporated in the order of dismissal.
here,moreover,the terms of the agreement explain in some detail the parameters of the district court enforcement authority.if the parties are unable to resolve compliance issues on their own,the plaintiffs may ask the court to determine that the commonwealth is not living up to its obligations under the agreement.the court is authorized to grant equitable relief but not to use the contempt powers in order to achieve compliance.if the commonwealth fails to abide by such an order,the agreement allows the court to use any appropriate equitable or remedial power then available to it.the broad enforcement authority bestowed upon the district court separates the agreement from the of private settlements,resort to an independent action for breach of contract.see,aronov,at christina ex rel.jennifer bloomberg,cir.
one other facet of the agreement attests to the district court ongoing role.the agreement is subject to modification only upon mutual written assent of the parties and with the court concurrence.the need for court approval of revisions in the terms of the agreement closely resembles the process for amending a conventional consent decree.see aronov,at discussing process for modifying consent decrees see also.b.taken together,the approval order and the agreement itself envision an ongoing role for the district court in the dispute.that role includes ongoing judicial oversight.the approval order,therefore,satisfies the third prong of the inquiry.
we summarize succinctly.consideration of the three pertinent factors leads inexorably to the conclusion that the agreement,though structured as a settlement rather than as a formal consent decree,bears a sufficient judicial imprimatur to qualify the plaintiffs as prevailing parties.that qualification,in turn,renders them eligible for an award of attorneys fees 
the commonwealth maintains that any fee award is premature because i the success that the plaintiffs achieved was embodied in the agreement and not in any court order and ii in all events,the order entered by the district approval not constitute a final judgment.the first of these arguments which implicitly acknowledges that the plaintiffs have obtained some relief on the merits is easily dispatched.as we already have explained,the plaintiffs success hinges on the combined effect of the agreement and the approval order.see supra part ii a.in view of that fact,it would be plainly attribute the relief obtained to the agreement alone.
the plaintiffs second argument has a certain superficial allure.after all,merely winning a battle in an ongoing case will not normally suffice to animate a federal statute.see sole wyner,denying fees to plaintiff who was granted preliminary injunction but was denied a permanent one hewitt helms,finding no prevailing party status when t he most that movant obtained was an interlocutory ruling that his complaint should not have been dismissed for failure to state a constitutional claim hanrahan hampton,denying fees to plaintiffs who successfully secured vacation of a judgment against them,yielding a new trial.
this does not mean,however,that a fee award always must await full litigation of a case and the entry of a final judgment.the supreme court has made it transparently clear that an award under a federal statute may sometimes be appropriate prior to the entry of a final judgment.state teachers ass n,u.at.such an award is proper,pendente lite,where a party has established his entitlement to some relief on the merits of his claims.id.at quoting hanrahan,at.thus,prevailing party status is not restricted to a party who has secured a favorable final judgment.larouche kezer,cir.
the question,then,is whether the plaintiffs,at this stage,can be said to have succeeded on significant claims affording them some of the desired relief.like the lower court,we think that they have.
the court has indicated that civil rights plaintiffs who obtain enforceable relief by means of a consent decree or settlement may be entitled to attorneys fees.maher gagne.the fact that a party prevailed through a settlement rather than through litigation does not weaken her claim to fees.id.so long as there is a judicial imprimatur on the relief obtained,fees may follow 
to be sure,this leaves open a question as to whether the settlement is sufficiently final to bear the weight of a fee award.put another way,does it mark the achievement of a significant measure of relief on the plaintiffs claims here too the focus on function over form that we embraced in aronov informs our understanding of whether the timing is appropriate for a fee award.viewed in that perspective,the question demands an affirmative answer.see,richardson miller,cir implicitly recognizing that a settlement that was functionally similar to a consent decree could serve as the basis for an award of fees.
this litigation has reached a significant plateau.in the agreement,the parties characterize the settlement as final and comprehensive.moreover,the agreement,embellished by the approval order,affords meaningful relief to the plaintiff class and bears the requisite hallmarks of judicial approbation and oversight.see supra part ii a.thus,this case is unlike wyner,hewitt,or hanrahan,in which the achieved only some fleeting success at a time when the litigation had yet to run its course.this case,while not yet closed,is not currently being litigated it has been settled and,therefore,the litigation,as a practical matter,has drawn to a close.
the commonwealth notes that there exists the possibility that litigation could be resumed if,say,it is unable to secure funding and,thus,to follow through on the commitments embodied in the agreement.but this sort of latent uncertainty exists in virtually every case even a final judgment can be appealed,see fed,or reopened in certain circumstances,see.b.such a bare possibility does not,in and of itself,inject a sufficient level of uncertainty to make a fee award premature.see generally.state teachers ass n,at explaining that,at minimum,a prevailing party must be able to point to a resolution of the dispute which changes the legal relationship between itself and the defendant and that an insignificant technical victory would not suffice.
reasonableness.
as a fallback,the commonwealth challenges the size of the fee award.for this purpose,we treat case law under the fees act,u,and other federal fees clarifying statutes,as persuasive authority.see me.sch.admin.dist.v,cir new hampshire adams,cir.
b ecause determination of the extent of a reasonable fee necessarily involves a series of judgment calls,an appellate court is far more likely to defer to the trial court in reviewing fee computations than in many other situations.lipsett blanco,cir.consequently,appellate review is for abuse of discretion.burke mcdonald,cir gay officers action league puerto rico,cir.within this rubric,a material error of law always constitutes an abuse of discretion,cir.but apart from issues of law,we will set aside a fee award only if it clearly appears that the trial court ignored a factor deserving significant weight,relied upon an improper factor,or evaluated all the proper factors and no improper ones,but made a serious mistake in weighing them.gay officers action league,at.
when fashioning a fee award,the district court ordinarily starts by constructing what has come to be known as the lodestar.see perdue kenny ex rel.winn.in general,the lodestar is the product of the number of hours appropriately worked times a reasonable hourly rate or rates.hensley eckerhart,gay officers action league,at.the party seeking the award has the burden of producing materials that support the request.hensley,at.these materials should include counsel contemporaneous time and billing records,suitably detailed,and information anent the law firm standard billing rates.gay officers action league,at.the putative payor may submit countervailing evidence.see,foley city of lowell,cir.the court,usually after hearing arguments,will then calculate the time counsel spent on the case,subtract duplicative,unproductive,or excessive hours,and appl y prevailing rates in the community taking into account the qualifications,experience,and specialized competence of the attorneys involved.gay officers action league,at.
in the instant case,the plaintiffs moved for an award of fees including expenses in the amount of.this figure included in fees and in expenses.billing rates ranged from.to.depending on the skill and experience of the lawyer rendering a particular service.travel time,where separately delineated in the motion for fees,was invoiced at a flat rate of.
the plaintiffs buttressed their motion with an array of supporting documents.in mounting its opposition to the dollar amount of the request,the commonwealth relied mainly on argumentation,not evidence although it did point to other,more modest awards that had been made in unrelated cases.after hearing protracted arguments,the district court awarded the plaintiffs exactly what they requested.
on appeal,the commonwealth contests the reasonableness of this award on three grounds i that it compensates the plaintiffs for unnecessary work ii that the rates used in formulating the award are inordinately high and iii that many of the costs and expense items claimed are not recoverable as part of a award.we address ea
