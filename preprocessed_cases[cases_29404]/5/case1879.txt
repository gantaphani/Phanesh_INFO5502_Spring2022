mitchell land and improvement mitchell,brought an unlawful detainer action code civ,et,against its lessee,ristorante ferrantelli,ferrantelli,based on alleged violations of a lease provision requiring the premises only be used for lawful purposes.mitchell contended ferrantelli had erected an outdoor tent and fire pit in a patio dining area without proper permits.mitchell later voluntarily dismissed its action after ferrantelli filed a motion for summary judgment.mitchell appeals from the trial court subsequent order awarding ferrantelli its attorney fees contending civil code section,subdivision b which prohibits an award of attorney fees when an action on a contract has been voluntarily dismissed,precludes such an award.we agree that because this unlawful detainer is one based upon an alleged breach of contract,section,subdivision b,applies and the attorney fees award was improper.accordingly,we modify the order to strike the award of attorney fees.
the essential procedural facts are not in dispute.in may,mitchell served ferrantelli with a day notice to cure covenants or quit.the notice stated ferrantelli had breached paragraph of the lease,which required it to only use the premises in a lawful manner.specifically,mitchell claimed ferrantelli had unlawfully erected a tent like covering over an open fire pit in an outdoor seating area.mitchell directed ferrantelli to remove the tent and fire pit or vacate the premises and elected to declare a forfeiture of the lease if the breach of the lease covenant was not cured within days.in august,mitchell filed this unlawful detainer action seeking to eject ferrantelli from the premises.in august,mitchell voluntarily dismissed the action.
a month earlier,on july,ferrantelli filed a motion for summary judgment.in ferrantelli separate statement of material facts,its owner explained he acquired the restaurant in,assuming the original lease.in,he expanded the restaurant adding an outdoor seating area.he applied for and obtained all necessary permits from the city and the coastal commission for the project,and all applications were signed off on by the original lessor.the approved plans included one fire pit,but approval was obtained for separate gas outlets.when ferrantelli constructed a second fire pit in the outdoor seating area in,and then placed a large tent structure over it,its owner believed the original permits allowed the additions.in,ferrantelli owner entered into a new lease with the prior property owner.the lease,with option terms,runs to the year.
mitchell acquired the property in and became ferrantelli lessor.mitchell property manager told ferrantelli owner several times he wanted to get the restaurant off the premises.in,mitchell manager filed complaints with the city and fire department about the second fire pit and tent lacking proper permits.in may,the city code enforcement officer notified ferrantelli the structures were not covered by the original permits,and advised ferrantelli to obtain permits which are routinely granted to bring the structures into compliance with the code.mitchell refused to consent to the application,instead giving ferrantelli notice to cure the breach or quit the premises.ferrantelli removed the tent structure immediately,but its owner conceded that on two occasions once in august and once in december,to meet contractual obligations to customers,he put the tent up for a day or two.mitchell was aware that at the direction of the fire department,ferrantelli had ceased using the second fire pit in june.mitchell filed this unlawful detainer action in august.in october,ferrantelli capped the gas line to the second fire pit and turned it into a planter.
on the day its opposition to the summary judgment motion was due,mitchell voluntarily dismissed the unlawful detainer action without prejudice.after mitchell dismissal was entered,ferrantelli filed a motion seeking to be declared the prevailing party under code of civil procedure section.it also sought its attorney fees of pursuant to paragraph of the lease,which provides that in an action or proceeding involving the p remises whether founded in tort,contract,or equity,the prevailing party would be entitled to its reasonable attorney fees,whether or not the action was pursued to judgment.the provision defines prevailing party as the party who substantially obtains or defeats the relief sought,as the case may be,whether by compromise,settlement,judgment,or the abandonment by the other p arty of its claims or defense.
although it did not dispute ferrantelli was the prevailing party for purposes of its costs under code of civil procedure section,mitchell opposed any award of attorney fees contending an award was prohibited by section,subdivision b.the trial court concluded section did not apply because an unlawful detainer action is not an action on a contract it is a basis for relief created by statute.it awarded ferrantelli in costs and in attorney fees.
discussion 
the parties positions are straight forward.mitchell contends the attorney fees award was improper because section,subdivision b,prohibits an award of attorney fees when an action on a contract has been voluntarily dismissed,and this unlawful detainer action based on ferrantelli alleged breach of lease covenants was an action on a contract.ferrantelli counters that an unlawful detainer action is never an action on a contract because it is a statutory proceeding and is governed solely by the provisions of the statute creating it.citation.fifth broadway partnership kimny,d.fifth broadway partnership.because we are faced with an issue concerning the legal basis for an award of attorney fees,we conduct a de novo review.honey baked hams,dickens th,d honey baked hams,disapproved on other grounds in santisas goodin cal th,fn,d,santisas.
for context,we summarize the general legal authority for awarding attorney fees as litigation costs.under code of civil procedure section,subdivision b,a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding,unless otherwise provided by statute.p revailing party includes a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered.code civ,subd.a.because mitchell voluntarily dismissed its action in ferrantelli favor,ferrantelli was generally entitled to its costs.santisas,supra,cal th at,d.
under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,the costs allowable under code of civil procedure section include attorney fees only when the party entitled to costs has a legal basis,independent of the cost statutes and grounded in an agreement,statute,or other law,upon which to claim recovery of attorney fees.santisas,supra,cal th at,d.in this case,ferrantelli claims attorney fees as allowable costs pursuant to paragraph of the lease,which provides that in an action or proceeding involving the p remises whether founded in tort,contract,or equity,the prevailing party would be entitled to its reasonable attorney fees,whether or not the action was pursued to judgment.the contract attorney fees provision is sufficiently broadly worded to apply to causes of action sounding in tort or contract.see santisas,supra,cal th at,d.
furthermore,under the broadly worded definition of prevailing party in the lease,the party who substantially obtains or defeats the relief sought,as the case may be,whether by compromise,settlement,judgment,or the abandonment by the other p arty of its claims or defense italics added,or applying the commonly understood meaning of the term prevailing party,ferrantelli was no doubt the prevailing party in this litigation as contemplated by the lease.as santisas noted in this regard,plaintiffs objective in bringing this litigation was to obtain the relief requested in the complaint.the objective of the defendants in this litigation was to prevent plaintiffs from obtaining that relief.because the litigation terminated in voluntary dismissal with prejudice,plaintiffs did not obtain by judgment any of the relief they requested,nor does it appear that plaintiffs obtained this relief by another means,such as a settlement.therefore,plaintiffs failed in their litigation objective and the defendants succ
