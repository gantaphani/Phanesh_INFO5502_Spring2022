decedent reportedly died on october.
on november,respondent filed a petition for probate of decedent will and for letters testamentary.
on december,the probate court appointed respondent as the personal representative of the estate.
on april,objector filed a petition to determine distribution rights under section et.in his petition,he claims he is the only child of decedent and that he is entitled to succeed to decedent entire estate under the laws of intestate succession.he alleges his mother had a relationship with decedent,resulting in objector birth in may,and that a court in a paternity proceeding found decedent to be his father and imposed child support obligations.he also alleges decedent either did not believe objector was his child or had forgotten that he was his child,rendering objector an omitted child under section objector petition prays for an order directing the personal representative to distribute the entire estate to him.
on june,respondent filed an answer in his capacity as executor of the estate stating his opposition to objector petition.none of the other beneficiaries have appeared in this matter.
on july,respondent filed a petition for an order approving an interim payment of his attorney fees and expenses.the petition relies,in part,on section,subdivision b,which provides that the personal representative may file papers and otherwise participate in the proceeding as a party to assist the court.a declaration prepared by respondent attorney states that in fees and costs had been incurred to date in relation to the will contest filed by objector.
on september,objector filed a response and objection to respondent petition for attorney fees and expenses.in his response,objector asserted that respondent should not receive payment from the estate for the services performed by his attorney because respondent is also a beneficiary and therefore is not an impartial personal representative.
on october,the probate court filed its order granting respondent petition for an interim payment of attorney fees and expenses.this appeal followed.
discussion 
objector has standing to appeal 
because objector right to inherit his father estate as an omitted heir under section has yet to be established in the underlying proceeding,we requested supplemental briefing from the parties on the issue of whether he has standing to challenge the order in question.we received briefs from both parties.
the issue of whether a party has standing to appeal is a question of law.ibm personal pension plan city and county of san francisco th,d.standing to appeal is jurisdictional and therefore can not be waived.citation.marsh mountain zephyr,th,d.thus,if a party has no standing to appeal,this court has no jurisdiction to consider the appeal.
code of civil procedure section states,any party aggrieved may appeal in the cases prescribed in this title,appeals in civil actions.this rule applies to appeals from probate court orders.see,estate of goulet cal th,d,estate of colton cal,crook contreras th,d.the supreme court has held one is considered aggrieved whose rights or interests are injuriously affected by the judgment or order.citations.appellant interest must be immediate,pecuniary,and substantial and not nominal or a remote consequence of the judgment or order.citation.county of alameda carleson cal d,accord,united investors life ins.waddell reed,th,d.
the controlling principle of law as to the standing of disinherited heirs to appeal an order of the probate court is stated in estate of thor d,it is well settled that,in view of the admitted fact that since the surviving but disinherited husband occupied the position of a stranger to the estate of his deceased wife,he had no standing in court in the matter either of the settlement of the account of the executor of the will of decedent,or of the manner in which distribution of her estate should be ordered.citations.it follows that,having no right to be heard in the matter before the probate court,the surviving husband likewise had no right of appeal from any order that might be made in the premises.see also estate of king d,fn.omitted appellant claims that she is a person interested in decedent estate,for she states that she is an heir of the estate.this assertion is a mere allegation of a conclusion of law and is contrary to the facts which appear in the record.decedent second codicil expressly provided that decedent was not making any provision for appellant therefore she is obviously not a devisee under decedent will and not interested as such in his estate.she is not entitled to maintain this appeal individually.and see rousseau cal.app d.same.
in his supplemental brief,objector asserts that he has standing to appeal because,assuming he prevails in the underlying action,the award of attorney fees places him at a financial disadvantage by diminishing the estate.he also notes that under section he was properly served with notice of respondent petition and,by implication,was authorized to oppose it in the probate court.we are satisfied with his arguments and conclude he does have standing to appeal from the order he contests.

standard of review 
because objector raises an issue involving statutory interpretation,this appeal presents a question of law that we review de novo.people ex rel.lockyer shamrock foods cal th,d.
heirship proceedings 
section is part of a statutory scheme creating a procedure for a court to ascertain who is entitled to distribution rights from a decedent estate section et,details the procedures by which interested persons and personal representatives may seek to establish who is entitled to a distribution from an estate by filing a petition.any interested person may appear and oppose such a petition and file a written statement of that person interest in the estate,subd.a.section provides a the court shall consider as evidence in the proceeding any statement made in a petition filed under section and any statement of interest filed under section.the court shall not hear or consider a petition filed after the time prescribed in section.b the personal representative may file papers and otherwise participate in the proceeding as a party to assist the court.italics added.section,subdivision a expressly provides that in ruling on such a petition,the court shall make an order that determines the persons entitled to distribution of the decedent estate and specifies their shares.when an order for final distribution becomes final,it is conclusive as to the rights of all interested persons,subd.b.
c.the plain meaning of section does not support objector claim 
under principles of statutory construction,we first look to the plain meaning of the statutory provisions.ordinarily,the words of the statute provide the most reliable indication of legislative intent.citation.however,if the terms of the statute provide no definitive answer,then courts may resort to extrinsic sources,including the objects to be achieved.citation.when the statutory language is ambiguous,the court may examine the context in which the language appears,adopting the construction that best harmonizes the statute internally and with related statutes.citations.both the legislative history of the statute and the wider historical circumstances of its enactment may be considered in ascertaining the legislative intent.citation.citation.county of santa clara perry cal th,d.
objector contends the plain and common sense meaning of the words participate in the proceeding as a party to assist the court precludes respondent,in his capacity as the personal representative,from acting as a litigation adversary.emphasizing that respondent is a beneficiary as well as the executor of decedent estate,objector further claims section,subdivision b,prohibits respondent from assuming the entire defense of an heirship petition at the estate expense.he asserts that under this provision an executor is entitled to participate as a neutral party only,and is not permitted to advance his or her own interests.
objector also reads the phrase to assist the court as a limitation on the scope of the personal representative participation,noting that all litigants can claim they assist the court by presenting evidence and argument and,therefore,had the legislature intended to allow a personal representative to participate to the same extent as any other party it would have been unnecessary to include the phrase to assist the court in the statute.he further surmises the legislature intended that the personal representative would participate in rare occasions only,as beneficiaries already have incentive to litigate their own claims.finally,he asserts that had the legislature intended to allow personal representatives to defend heirship petitions,it would have stated so explicitly,noting it has done so in section,a statute that gives the personal representative the power to commence and maintain actions for the benefit of the estate as well as the power to defend actions brought against the decedent,the personal representative,or the estate.
contrary to objector position,we see nothing in the plain language of this statute to support the conclusion that it does not allow an executor to assume the entire defense of an heirship petition when there are numerous beneficiaries with a direct financial stake in the matter.had the legislature desired to limit the class of personal representatives subject to section,subdivision b,to those having no interest in the estate as a beneficiary,or to limit the section application to cases in which there are no other beneficiaries or heirs available to defend a petition,such intent could have been stated explicitly.
in our view,the phrase to assist the court means exactly that.in an early case holding that commissioners appointed to serve on commissions formed by statute did not usurp judicial authority where their reports did not become a part of the public record unless approved by a constitutional number of judges,the supreme court observed that courts frequently receive assistance,including assistance from adversarial interested parties the legislature has provided for the appointment and compensation of these commissioners they are given no power except to assist the court,under such rules and regulations as it may adopt,in the performance of its duties.the great burden of the work of this court is that which is necessarily done in sifting the causes to ascertain from the mass of matter brought here in each case the truth and the law bearing upon it,preparatory to the processes of adjudication and judgment.to say that the court can not be assisted in this preliminary work by men sworn to fidelity,learned in the law,unconnected with and unbiased in the causes,is to deny us unbiased assistance in the very direction in which we are bound to receive it,and do receive it,in every cause that comes before us,from counsel not equally free or likely to give us unprejudiced opinions and statements and to deny us such assistance as courts of every grade have been accustomed,time out of mind,to receive,without objection,in this country and in england.it is no more unconstitutional for this court to receive such assistance from commissioners designated by itself,or from amici curiae,than to accept similar assistance from the statements of fact and arguments of the counsel in the cause.people hayne cal,italics added,original italics omitted.
in other contexts,various persons are authorized to assist a court in arriving at a decision,such as subordinate judicial officers acting as referees code civ,subd.b,psychological evaluators who assist the court in determining a dependent minor placement see,and probation officers who provide courts with presentencing reports.additionally,amici curiae frequently provide supplemental briefing to appellate courts.see cal.rules of court,rules c,f.while these friends of the court may not have a direct stake in the cases that they brief,they often have a vested interest in the outcome and often advance adversarial positions.thus,assistance does not ordinarily mandate neutrality.simply put,there is no basis for concluding that personal representatives who are also beneficiaries are incapable of providing assistance to the court.we also note section,subdivision b,allows personal representatives to appear as a party.parties to litigation are almost always adversarial.clearly,had the legislature sought to limit the personal representative role to that of an unbiased,neutral advisor there would be no need to also designate the representative as a party of record.
we also are not persuaded that the words to assist the court are surplusage unless interpreted as a limitation on the scope of a personal representative participation in an heirship proceeding.that same phrase has been interpreted in other statutory provisions as a means of clarifying that it is the court that must make the ultimate decision on a particular issue,not the person who is supplying the assistance the purpose of the legislation providing for court assistants in the capacity of investigators of domestic relations cases to assist the court in the transaction of the judicial business of said court citation is obviously what the language used implies,to assist the court and not to replace it.the legislature would have no power to substitute an investigator for a judge.fewel fewel cal d,discussing code of civ,former.
we also note that while respondent is both the personal representative and the largest single beneficiary of the will,percent of the estate is divided amongst the other beneficiaries,many of whom reside in germany it would thus appear that respondent defense of the heirship petition inures primarily to the benefit of the other beneficiaries who have not appeared in this action and who,if objector ultimately prevails,will not receive any share of the estate.it has also been recognized that an executor is entitled to advocate in the trial court for an interpretation of the will that preserves and implements the testator intent,even when a contrary interpretation is asserted by a beneficiary.baker manock jensen superior court th,d.in the present case,the decedent will arguably evidences a specific intent to exclude any unnamed heirs,including objector,from receiving any portion of the estate.thus,respondent participation does not appear to be entirely 
finally,we disagree with objector assertion that section,subdivision b can not be read to allow a personal representative to litigate without restriction in an heirship proceeding because section explicitly grants representatives the power to commence and maintain actions for the benefit of the estate and to defend actions and proceedings against the decedent,the personal representative,or the estate.citing the cannon of statutory interpretation that the expression of one thing is the exclusion of another,he claims the omission of a similarly explicit description of powers in section,subdivision b,evidences a legislative intent to deprive personal representatives of such powers in heirship proceedings.in our view,the designation of the personal representative as a party in section,subdivision b,necessarily implies the right to advocate either for or against an heirship petition.
executor duty of impartiality 
objector contends an executor duty of impartiality supports a construction of section,subdivision b,that would preclude respondent from assuming the entire defense of the heirship petition.it is true that as the executor of decedent estate,respondent represents all the heirs and can not favor one claimant over another.estate of torrance d.again,however,when an heirship petition is presented,an executor is authorized to file papers and otherwise participate in the proceeding as a party to assist the court,subd.b,italics added.this statute gives respondent standing to take a position regarding the merits of a petition 
objector cites to several cases predating the enactment of the precursor to section,subdivision b,for the proposition that an executor can not litigate conflicting claims of heirs or legatees at the estate expense,such as estate of kessler cal d,in which the supreme court stated that in an heirship proceeding the beneficiaries must then protect their own rights,and it is not the duty of the executor or administrator to litigate the claims of one against the other.as these cases were issued prior to the enactment of the statute,they are not persuasive authority while we agree executors are generally required to act impartially and to avoid conflicts of interest,we conclude that,under the circumstances of this case,respondent is authorized under this statue to fully participate as a party in this heirship proceeding 
legislative history 
while we do not perceive any ambiguity in the statutory language,we accept objector invitation to examine the legislative history of section,subdivision b objector claims this history shows that the legislature intended to limit the personal representative role in heirship proceedings to cases in which there are no known heirs or legatees at all,primarily in estates administered by the public administrator for relatively impecunious decedents with unknown heirs.although some references to such situations can be found in this legislative history,the provision does not appear to have been enacted solely for these circumstances.
in,the legislature added the following language to former section upon prior order of the court,the administrator or executor may file objections to the petition,and participate in the proceedings as a party in order to assist the court in its determination.stats,ch.prior to the amendment,the prevailing view was that the personal representative generally had no standing to participate in heirship determination proceedings.assem.com.on judiciary,bill digest prepared for may,hearing reg.sess.on assem.bill.without such participation,the courts were frequently left to make heirship determinations with only a presentation of the facts.this situation caused the los angeles county probate court to urge the amendment of previous section to permit the personal representative to participate in such proceedings.an excerpt from an analysis prepared by the assembly judiciary committee describes the concern the proponents indicate that,within the los angeles probate court system,and elsewhere,commercial heir hunters file petitions in which the personal representative of the estate can not participate.the proponents assert that often heirship is determined by weak evidence that goes unchallenged.ibid.
the legislature appears to have contemplated that the personal representative might take on an adversarial role in heirship proceedings.the above assembly judiciary committee analysis goes on to state that the proposed amendment would permit public or private administrators or executors to object to such petitions and to participate as a party in proceedings to determine heirship.assem.com.on judiciary,bill digest prepared for may,hearing reg.sess.on assem.bill.the legislative history thus supports our conclusion that section,subdivision b,does not limit the personal representative role to that of a neutral,disinterested participant.
we further note that concerns such as those raised by objector in this appeal appear to have been fully considered by the legislature.for example,one of the questions raised during deliberations prior to the enactment of the amendment was under this bill,if a personal representative is improperly motivated,could the personal representative use estate funds to finance proceedings for his or her own benefit another question was if the role of a personal representative in heirship proceedings becomes an adversary role,would this result in more costs to the estate and further depletion of estate funds assem.com.on judiciary,bill digest prepared for may,hearing reg.sess.on assem.bill.these concerns were ultimately addressed by adding the requirement that the personal representative obtain an order of the court before being allowed to participate in heirship proceedings as originally introduced,assembly bill did not contain this requirement.see also letter dated,from david eagleson then presiding judge of los angeles probate court,later associate justice on the california supreme court to brown there will be no opportunity for churning the estate for additional fees because the right of the administrator or executor to participate is conditioned upon obtaining a prior order of court and if the court determines it needs no assistance,the order would not be forthcoming.
we agree with objector that the amendment appears to have been intended,at least in part,to ameliorate situations in which decedents died intestate and the public administrator was appointed to probate these estates.see letter dated,in enrolled governor materials from attorney general evelle younger to governor jerry brown noting that presentation s of facts by a claimant to a decedent estate often occur in cases in which the public administrator is appointed to probate estates.yet,a report on the bill submitted to the governor by his legal affairs department suggested this bill would allow the estate administrator or executor public or private to participate as a party and thereby assist the court in making its determination of heirship.the goal is to establish a more effective means of detecting false heirs.emphasis added see also letter from state bar of california,harold bradford,legislative representative,dated,stating the participation of the administrator or executor in the proceedings to determine heirship will assist the court in making the proper findings.that the legislation is not specifically confined to such cases,however,suggests to us that the legislature did not intend to limit the application of the amendment to cases involving public administrators.rather,the stated goal of the legislation was to establish a more effective means of detecting false heirs,regardless of whether the executor was public or private.enrolled bill from legal affairs secretary.there is,in short,insufficient evidence in the legislative history to support objector claim th
