in this appeal,we are asked to decide whether the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of new york littlefield,was both acting within its statutory authority and properly exercising its discretion when,relying on its equitable powers,it entered a nunc pro tunc order in december that retroactively closed the bankruptcy estate of aquatic development group,adg as of december.the effect of the bankruptcy court order was to relieve adg of its obligation to pay certain statutory fees that had been billed by appellant carolyn schwartz,the united states trustee for the northern district of new york trustee,prior to the effective date of the nunc pro tunc order.in the trustee appeal from the bankruptcy court order,the united states district court for the northern district of new york scullin,concluded that the bankruptcy court had acted within its statutory authority and had not abused its discretion in granting the nunc pro tunc relief requested by adg.
for the reasons set forth below,we find that the bankruptcy court did abuse its discretion in granting nunc pro tunc relief here.in light of this conclusion,we decline to reach the issue of whether congress has divested bankruptcy courts of the equitable authority to enter nunc pro tunc orders retroactively relieving debtors of their obligations to pay statutory bankruptcy trustee fees.accordingly,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
proceedings in bankruptcy court 
in september,adg and several of its affiliates filed voluntary petitions in the bankruptcy court for relief under chapter of the federal bankruptcy code.the bankruptcy court subsequently consolidated these cases and,in february,confirmed a reorganization plan.the confirmed reorganization plan provided,in relevant part,that the bankruptcy court would retain jurisdiction until there was substantial consummation of the plan,and the order confirming the plan stated that substantial confirmation would be achieved only when all payments to the holders of general unsecured claims under the plan had been made.the confirmation order also directed adg,in conformity with a,to pay all fees then owed to the trustee within ten days and,from that point forward,to pay all fees due to the trustee on a timely basis.
while this case was pending in the bankruptcy court,the trustee submitted quarterly bills to adg,pursuant to a.section a was amended on january,days after the confirmation hearing on adg reorganization plan,but almost three weeks before the bankruptcy court entered its final order confirming adg reorganization plan.prior to this amendment,the statute required debtors to pay quarterly fees to the trustee until a plan was confirmed or the case was converted or dismissed.a emphasis added.the current version of the statute no longer contains the underscored text quoted above and thus requires debtors to pay fees to the united states trustee for each quarter until the case is converted or dismissed.a.
in september,congress enacted an additional statutory provision to clarify the meaning and effect of the january amendment.the clarifying legislation provided that,notwithstanding any other provision of law,the fees under a shall accrue and be payable from and after january,in all cases including,without limitation,any cases pending as of that date,regardless of confirmation status of their plans,d,stat.
in february,the trustee mailed pro forma notices to all debtors in pending bankruptcy adg to inform them of the statutory change the previous month.the notices stated,in relevant part effective january,all cases with confirmed reorganization plans which are pending before the bankruptcy court will be required to make quarterly fee payments based on disbursements until the case is converted to another chapter of the code,dismissed by the court,or closed by court order.in june,the trustee sent adg a bill for for fees due since the inception of the case.two months later,adg paid the bill.in a cover letter accompanying this payment,adg attorney wrote i understand there will be some additional fees.thereafter,the trustee sent adg a bill every quarter,but adg made only two more fee payments,the last of which was in november.
on august,in accordance with the confirmed reorganization plan,the required cash payments were made and preferred stock was issued directly to adg secured creditors and to its bankruptcy counsel on behalf of its unsecured creditors.in early december,adg completed the financing on which its reorganization plan was contingent.at that point,its plan had been substantially consummated.adg continued to receive bills from the trustee in.as directed by the instructions printed on each bill,adg consulted with counsel to determine whether the quarterly fees should be paid.counsel advised adg that it was out of bankruptcy,and,based on this advice and the fact that there was no by the trustee as to the status of the reorganization plan or its implementation,adg believed that all matters pertaining to its bankruptcy had been concluded.accordingly,adg did not pay the trustee bills.
in or about june,after reviewing her records,the trustee discovered that adg bankruptcy estate apparently was still open and that none of the quarterly bills that she had sent to adg had been paid since november.after making three written inquiries to adg counsel regarding the status of adg reorganization plan,the trustee in september moved in the bankruptcy court for an order compelling adg to pay approximately in overdue fees and for a status report regarding the consummation of adg reorganization plan.in response,adg moved for an order nunc pro tunc closing the case as of december,on the ground that the reorganization plan had been substantially consummated as of that date,thereby relieving adg of its obligation to pay any subsequent quarterly trustee fees.
in a,unpublished memorandum decision and order dated december,the bankruptcy court entered a nunc pro tunc order granting the relief requested by adg.in its decision granting this relief,the bankruptcy court evaluated adg motion under the framework of our decision in cushman wakefield of connecticut,keren limited partnership in re keren limited partnership,cir per curiam.in particular,the bankruptcy court quoted from in re keren statement that n unc pro tunc approval should only be granted in narrow situations and requires that i if the application had been timely,the court would have authorized the relief,and ii the delay in seeking the relief requested resulted from extraordinary circumstances.id.at.the bankruptcy court concluded that both of these requirements had been satisfied.first,the bankruptcy court found that it could have entered a final decree if it had been asked to do so in december,even though an adversary proceeding was pending at that time.the bankruptcy court rejected the trustee argument that,because the reorganization plan and confirmation order defined substantial confirmation as requiring payments to the holders of general unsecured claims,the fact that those cash payments were not completed until january meant that the requirements of the plan were not satisfied until that time.in rejecting this contention,the bankruptcy court noted that,in august,adg had transferred stock intended for the unsecured creditors to its counsel,who,the court concluded,had been acting as the agent of the unsecured creditors therefore,the bankruptcy court concluded,the stock transfer to adg counsel had satisfied the payment requirement.
second,the bankruptcy court,relying on the text and advisory committee notes to federal rule of bankruptcy procedure concluded that it would have closed adg bankruptcy case in december if it had been asked to do so,since by that time the confirmation order had become final because the refinancing had been completed the deposits had been paid,the stocks and cash had been transferred to the agents of the creditors,the payments had commenced,and adg had assumed management of the business.
furthermore,the bankruptcy court concluded that adg failure to seek a final decree in december was due to extraordinary circumstances,which included the prolonged nature of this plan and the timing of the amendment of the consequences of that change and the failure of the parties to adequately monitor the progress of this case.in particular,the bankruptcy court determined that payment of the fee to the trustee would not have been equitable and would not have serve d the code underlying purposes of providing deserving debtors a free start,especially since the continued accumulation of fees had not been possible under the version of in effect at the time the reorganization plan had been filed.moreover,the bankruptcy court found that adg failure to respond to the bills it had received from the trustee was excusable because the trustee had not contact ed the debtor for payment of the fees.
ii.proceedings in the district court 
the trustee timely appealed the bankruptcy court order.in its appeal to the district court,the trustee argued that the bankruptcy court had abused its discretion in granting adg application for nunc pro tunc relief,because i the clear language of required the payment of quarterly trustee fees in all pending cases and thus the bankruptcy court lacked the statutory authority to grant the equitable relief sought by adg and ii even if the bankruptcy court had the authority to grant the equitable relief requested by adg,the bankruptcy court erred in concluding that adg had met the requirements for nunc pro tunc relief.in an unpublished,memorandum decision and order dated july,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court order.
first,the district court rejected the trustee argument that divested the bankruptcy court of its equitable authority to grant the nunc pro tunc relief requested by adg.in particular,the district court relied on in re rhead,where the bankruptcy court concluded that the debtor had not sufficiently alleged the extraordinary circumstances required for nunc pro tunc relief but did not explicitly find that it lacked the authority to grant such equitable relief.moreover,the district court also relied on the language in section a of the bankruptcy code,a,which provides that a bankruptcy court may issue any order,process,or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of the code,in concluding that the bankruptcy court had the authority to grant the equitable relief requested by adg.
second,the district court concluded that the bankruptcy court had not abused its discretion in concluding that adg had satisfied the requirements for nunc pro tunc relief.in particular,the district court agreed with the reasons provided by the bankruptcy court in support of the latter conclusions that i it could and would have granted a request for a final decree had adg made one in december,and ii adg had successfully shown that extraordinary circumstances existed to justify nunc pro tunc relief.final judgment was entered shortly after the issuance of the district court decision,and this timely appeal followed.
discussion 
in this appeal,the trustee offers the same alternative bases to set aside the district court judgment as previously put forth by her when she asked the district court to set aside the bankruptcy court order,i that divested the the bankruptcy court of authority to grant the equitable relief sought by adg and ii even if the bankruptcy court had the authority to grant such relief,adg has not met the requirements for nunc pro tunc relief.for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in concluding that adg was entitled to nunc pro tunc relief.consequently,we need do whether congress amendment of strips bankruptcy courts of their equitable authority to grant nunc pro tunc relief where doing so would allow debtors to avoid paying quarterly trustee fees that the debtors would otherwise be required to pay.
as noted above,our decision in in re keren provides a yardstick against which we may measure whether a bankruptcy court should have granted nunc pro tunc relief.there,we articulated a test for determining the narrow circumstances under which such relief should be granted i if the application for relief had been timely made,the bankruptcy court would have granted the relief requested and ii the delay in seeking relief resulted from extraordinary circumstances.at.moreover,w e review a bankruptcy court decision regarding such approval for abuse of discretion,id.at,which we have defined as i a decision rest ing on an error of law such as application of the wrong legal principle or a clearly erroneous factual finding,or ii a decision that,though not necessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly erroneous factual finding,can not be located within the range of permissible decisions,zervos verizon,cir.
turning to the first prong of the in re keren test,we agree with the district court that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the latter could and would have granted a request to close the bankruptcy case had adg made such a request in december.notwithstanding the adversary proceeding that was pending and the fact that adg unsecured creditors had not received from the bankruptcy estate all the payments that the estate was required to make under the reorganization plan as of december,the bankruptcy court could have ordered dismissal and closure at that time.as both the bankruptcy court and the district court correctly noted,we have permitted a bankruptcy court to retain jurisdiction over an adversary proceeding after it has dismissed the bankruptcy case.see porges gruntal,in re porges,cir.moreover,even though the confirmation order defined substantial consummation as occurring when all payments to be made to the holders of general unsecured claims have been made,the bankruptcy court concluded that this requirement had been satisfied when,in august,adg issued stock to its counsel,who was acting as the agent for adg unsecured creditors.again,we agree with the district court that the bankruptcy court interpretation of the term payments in its confirmation order was not an abuse of discretion.see casse key bank ass in re casse,cir the bankruptcy court is in the best position to interpret its own orders.internal quotation marks omitted 
turning to the second prong of in re keren,we part company with the district court and conclude that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in concluding that adg failure to seek an order closing the bankruptcy case in december resulted from extraordinary circumstances.as discussed above,the bankruptcy court identified three circumstances that it characterized as being both extraordinary and the cause of adg delay in seeking to have the case closed i the unusual length of time required to consummate the reorganization plan ii the timing of the effective date of the amendment to and the financial consequences of the amendment and iii the parties failure to monitor the progress of the case.we address each of these circumstances seriatim.
first,the unusual length of time required to consummate the reorganization plan due to the fact that adg was not scheduled to begin redeeming stock from its unsecured creditors until may well have been extraordinary,but there is no evidence in the record that the time required to consummate the plan caused adg to delay its request to close the bankruptcy case.indeed,as noted above,the bankruptcy court would have been acting well within its discretion if had closed the case in december.
second,both the timing of the amendment to a and its attendant financial consequences may also have been extraordinarily they had the potential to add unforeseen thousands of dollars of quarterly trustee fees to the transaction costs of adg reorganization the amendment and the financial consequences flowing from it can in no way be characterized as a cause of adg delay in moving to close the case.indeed,the unique provisions of the reorganization plan,coupled with the amendment to a,should have stirred adg to act diligently in seeking closure.
finally,we turn to the parties failure to monitor the closure of the case.granting nunc pro tunc relief on thi
