iii.discussion 
defendants assert the chapter plan confirmation order precludes plaintiff from challenging the cost and attorney fee awards issued by the trial court.the res judicata effect of the chapter plan confirmation order is primarily a question of law.in re summerville bankr th cir,in re brawders bankr th cir,see state farm general insurance company workers compensation appeals board th,fn.noble draper th.we disagree with defendants position.
chapter allows an individual with regular income to adjust his or her debts under a repayment plan.et.see in re nolan cir,in re estus cir,fn.under chapter,debt repayment is funded primarily through the debtor income.see a in re michael cir,in re clark.the debtor makes regular payments to the trustee,who then distributes funds to creditors.see a in re michael,supra,at in re howell,see generally,a chapter primer for non chapter bankruptcy attorneys cal.a confirmed plan is subject to modification by the debtor or a creditor under specified circumstances.a.and as will be noted,res judicata principles do not prevent the bankruptcy court from modifying the confirmed plan.in re taylor,in re frost.
the preclusive effect of a confirmed plan is defined in section a.section a states,the provisions of a confirmed plan bind the debtor and each creditor,whether or not the claim of such creditor is provided for by the plan,and whether or not such creditor has objected to,has accepted,or has rejected the plan.because we are applying a federal statute,section a,we follow rules of statutory construction enunciated by the united states supreme court.in kaiser aluminum chemical bonjorno,the united states supreme court held the starting point for interpretation of a statute is the language of the statute itself.absent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary,that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.see ransom fia card services,our interpretation of the bankruptcy code starts where all such inquiries must begin with the language of the statute itself.when a statute is unambiguous,its language can not be expanded or contracted by the statements of individual legislators or committees during the course of the legislative process.west virginia.hospitals,casey,accord huff dekalb county cir.
in cases which require construction of statutory language,the united states supreme court has noted,t the statutory language controls its construction.ford motor credit cenance,fn.see griffin oceanic contractors,there is,of course,no more persuasive evidence of the purpose of a statute than the words by which the l egislature undertook to give expression to its wishes.further,in interpreting a statute,the supreme court has emphasized the importance of avoiding absurd results united states turkette,an odd result public citizen department of justice,or unreasonable results whenever possible.american tobacco patterson.moreover,the united states supreme court has noted,judicial perception that a particular result would be unreasonable may enter into the construction of ambiguous provisions,but can not justify disregard of what congress has plainly and intentionally provided.commissioner asphalt products,see ninety three firearms cir.in griffin oceanic contractors,supra,at,the supreme court stated nevertheless,in rare cases the literal application of a statute will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters,and those intentions must be controlling citations.see ron pair enterprises,in such cases,the intention of the drafters,rather than the strict language,controls.
under section a,a confirmed plan is binding on both the debtor and his or her creditors.the binding effect extends to all questions pertaining to the plan that were or could have been raised.in re enewally cir,in re demarco.as the court of appeals for the ninth circuit explained in enewally,o nce a bankruptcy plan is confirmed,it is binding on all parties and all questions that could have been raised pertaining to the plan are entitled to res judicata effect.citation.in re enewally,supra,at see in re mansaray ruffin cir.
however,the res judicata effect of a confirmed chapter plan is limited.see in re enewally,supra,at in re seidler cir,in re summerville,supra,at in re brawders,supra,at.as the united states district court for the western district of virginia has explained generally,section a does provide a res judicata effect to the terms of a confirmed plan.citation.this effect,however,is premised on the notion that the bankruptcy court has addressed in the confirmed plan and order only those issues that are properly within the scope of the confirmation hearing.in re linkous,affd.in re linkous cir.thus,the federal courts have held in specified circumstances that a confirmed chapter plan has limited preclusive effect.among the specified circumstances are cases where there were issues that were or could not have been resolved in the confirmation process.see in re seidler,supra,at mortgage lien in re summerville,supra,at validity of note and deed of trust in re brawders,supra,at county tax lien in re beard,federal tax lien in re minick,minick mortgage.
for example,a confirmed plan has no preclusive effect as to issues that must be brought by an adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court.see in re enewally,supra,at a chapter plan confirmed while an adversary proceeding was pending would not have res judicata effect on the adversary proceeding.in re summerville,supra,at quoting enewally in re beard,supra,at if an issue must be raised through an adversary proceeding it is not part of the confirmation process and,unless it is actually litigated,confirmation will not have a preclusive effect.a confirmed plan is not binding as to the amount of a creditor claim when the claims bar date has not passed.in re grogan,see minick,supra,at.and a confirmed plan is not res judicata if to so conclude would result in a due process denial.in re linkous,supra,at see in re summerville,supra,at in re brawders,supra,at.
moreover,federal decisional authority explains that section a does not say or mean the precise amount of each creditor claim is binding where it has not been determined.see in re seidler,supra,at in re summerville,supra,at in re tucker,in re grogan,supra,at elliott itt,elliott minick,supra,at the plan is only binding as to treatment,not claim
