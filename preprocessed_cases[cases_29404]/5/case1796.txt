in this case,we are called upon to reiterate that while divorced parents have the same right to pursue happiness as all other citizens,they can not do so by abrogating their obligation to support their families.and they certainly can not do so by voluntarily deferring salary,living extravagantly off their sizeable assets,and pleading poverty at the support hearing.
rachael berger appeals from the judgment in this action dissolving her marriage to marc berger.she contends the court erred in denying her spousal support awarding her only in monthly child support for the couple two daughters and denying her request for an award of attorney fees.rachael points out that during the couple marriage,they enjoyed a high standard of living based upon marc earnings in the financial industry.just before they separated,marc chose to leave that profession and devote his labor to the start up of a business offering financed landscaping to developers of new homes.in the three years prior to trial,marc agreed to defer most,and then virtually all,of his income from the is apparently in dire financial continuing to live a wealthy lifestyle.by his own admission,marc expenses exceed per month.
in essence,rachael makes two arguments regarding support.first,she asserts the court abused its discretion in refusing to impute income to marc,based upon his ability to resume earning income at the levels he had before voluntarily departing the world of finance.we are not convinced the evidence in this case was strong enough to compel such a conclusion.but her second argument is compelling.rachael contends marc voluntary decision to continue dedicating his efforts and services to the company under an agreement by which it distributes almost none of his income to him,but instead accrues it on the company decision which is made possible by marc ability to tap into his other substantial assets for his own support in the not be viewed as a justification for reducing his obligation to pay support.she maintains the trial court should have either treated marc as though he were receiving the income to which he is entitled on a current basis,or as special circumstance which warrants a departure from the guideline amount of child support.
we agree with this second argument.while it would be improper to impute to marc the income he had formerly earned in the finance industry in the absence of evidence demonstrating he could still earn such an income if he were to return to that industry today,there is evidence of his present earning capacity outside that industry.it is provided by marc agreement with his present employer,and is unaffected by his voluntary agreement to defer those earnings.in essence,marc company is providing the proof of his ability to earn in the form of the salary it is accruing for him.the fact he is choosing to plow that salary back into the company can not be spun into a basis for ignoring those earnings.
in effect,marc is simply choosing to invest his salary each month back into the company,while supporting his own lifestyle with other assets.for purposes of calculating support,that decision is indistinguishable from one in which marc actually did receive the salary,utilized it for his living expenses,and then used his other assets to invest in the company.for purposes of calculating support,it can not make a difference whether mark is paying his bills from his salary and leaving his savings untouched,or paying them from his savings and banking his salary.
because the court erred in failing to recognize that marc income should be measured by the earnings he has chosen to give back to his at least to characterize his decision to do so as a special circumstance which warrants a departure from the guideline support reverse its rulings on the issues of child support and spousal support,and remand the case for further proceedings on those issues.
with respect to the issue of attorney fees,we note that the court own ruling stated that it would reserve jurisdiction to make a fee award if appropriate in the event marc received some or all of the income he agreed to defer.in light of our determination that marc must be treated as though he is receiving that income,we conclude the fee issue must be reconsidered as well.
marc and rachael were married in,and separated in november of.they have two daughters,born in and.after the birth of the second daughter,rachael became a mother.marc petitioned for divorce in december of.
the parties obtained a judgment terminating their marital status in october of.pending resolution of the remaining issues in dispute,marc was ordered to pay rachael per month in spousal support,and in child support for both daughters.the family residence was sold in,and the proceeds,totaling in excess of million,were divided between the parties.
in,prior to the parties separation,marc voluntarily left his employment as a partner at pricewaterhousecoopers,where he had earned as much as per year,to devote his efforts to the job of president and chief executive officer of a landscape business,in which he also owned an equity interest.the concept behind,which had commenced operations on a limited basis earlier in,was that it would offer landscaping,on a financed basis,to developers of new homes,who could,in turn,offer that landscaping as one of the options available to the ultimate home purchasers.
marc devised the business plan for,which was initially capitalized with million in cash contributed by other marc was credited with an additional in sweat equity for his efforts in establishing the business.was able to pay marc a salary of approximately in,in and in.however,apparently those salaries had been funded by the initial capitalization of,and subsequent capital infusions to,the company,rather than from any profits.in fact,from its inception,has never generated a profit.in,marc and other principals guaranteed certain loans to the company,and marc himself loaned it.
because of financial difficulties experienced by,marc and the other officers entered into a series of amendments to their respective employment agreements call ing for salary reductions and deferment of income.ultimately,in october of,marc filed an order to show cause for modification of his temporary support obligation,alleging that due to his salary deferral at,he could no longer afford to pay temporary support at the levels set by the court.
in february of,the parties stipulated to a suspension of marc temporary support obligation beginning in december of,without prejudice to the court reinstating that support obligation,retroactively,at the time of trial.the parties also stipulated that the daughters would reside primarily with rachael,but would spend wednesdays and alternate weekends with marc.
the trial commenced in april of.in connection with that trial,marc reported on his income and expense declaration that his income varies,and his personal expenses were per month.however,that expense number included for divorce legal accounting,which is presumably temporary,and a payment for the mortgage on a l ot held for construction of primary residence.
rachael,who has only a high school education,reported that she was employed as a administrator for a financial firm,and was working hours per week for per hour.she reported household expenses of per month,including approximately in expenses pertaining exclusively to the daughters such as children clothing,child care,lessons.
marc testified at trial that had been paying him an income of per month since some time in amount calculated to cover his obligation to fund health and dental insurance for himself,rachael and their daughters.marc acknowledged that theoretically,was accruing liability to him for the period in which he had not been paid any significant salary,but that he expected any such liability would ultimately be converted to some type of equity ownership in the company,rather than a cash payment,to preserve whatever capital the company might have.as marc explained it,equity capital is hard to find for a business like this and you not going to be paying investor is going to want you to pay out new capital for salaries.marc agreed that his total deferred as the difference between the compensation his employment contract had specified he was entitled to receive,and the compensation he had actually as high as by the time trial commenced.
marc also acknowledged he had no expectation as to when the company will be paying him a salary greater than per month,however,despite his lack of significant current income,marc stated he had approximately in cash at the time trial commenced,left over from the division of the parties community assets.he also acknowledged that he had taken out a million loan in early,for the purchase of a lot in laguna beach and the construction of a home thereon.by the time trial began,the lot had already been purchased,and marc intended to use the balance of his loan for the anticipated construction of his primary residence 
marc explained that in the absence of any significant cash salary coming to him from,he was meeting current expenses by utilizing his cash assets.he stated that he was choosing to stay with,despite its inability to pay his current salary,because of the loan guarantees he had made,and his belief that if failed,those loan obligations would force him into bankruptcy.
the trial occupied four days,stretched over six months.by the last time marc testified,in september of,he was claiming to have only in liquid assets,down from the he had testified to at the beginning of trial marc also estimated he had equity of in his laguna beach lot.
although the trial ended in october of,the court did not issue its final statement of decision until april of.in that statement of decision,the court noted that f or the last two years,marc has worked hours per week and has received very little by way of monetary compensation rachael has said,enough is enough she bellows that refrain made popular by the country kenny rogers,you got to know when to hold em and know when to fold em.she says it is time to fold em and return to the work that commanded the level of compensation that established the marital standard of living this marriage achieved.the appeal of this perspective is easy to embrace.children are our first priority.a parent dreams ambitions should ride shotgun to the needs of their children.the question then is how long should the court sanction marc grip on the business at some point,it does become prudent to move on,doing what is necessary not to leave behind a mess.it appears that time may have arrived.italics and underscoring omitted.
the court concluded,however,that there was insufficient evidence demonstrating marc had any current opportunity to earn the level of salary he once had while working in finance.it thus declined to impute that salary to him for the calculation of support and fees.it also declined to order him to pursue other opportunities.instead,the court merely required marc to report on a quarterly basis the financial circumstances of,and any job searches undertaken.
the court also concluded marc derives no income from the business known as other than the monthly amount necessary to pay the insurance needs of the family,while at the same time finding that he had accrued somewhere around in deferred income.the court expressly reserved jurisdiction over that deferred salary,plus any loans or monies of any kind or description which marc may receive in the future from,both as to characterization and as a source for support and fees.
the court then imputed income of to marc,based upon a theoretical return of percent on assets for marc,those assets included both the in cash the court estimated he had remaining in deposit accounts,plus the marc had estimated as his equity in the laguna beach lot.after combining that imputed income with the in monthly salary marc was receiving from,the court calculated that marc should pay a combined total of in monthly support for his two daughters,and no spousal support.
the court also declined to order marc to pay any portion of rachael fees.the court noted that both parties attorney fees seemed reasonable,and explained that both parties have a comparable amount of cash and a comparable level of income.the court reasoned that d uring the pendency of this action,the support paid resulted in each party having equal access to legal counsel and n either party owes any considerable sums to their representative.it consequently determined that each party shall bear their own fees and costs without contribution from the other party.however,should marc receive some or all of the deferred income as described above,the court reserves its jurisdiction to make a fee award if appropriate.
rachael first argues the court erred in failing to impute income to marc at a rate equivalent to what he had earned in,when he was still employed by pricewaterhousecoopers.we begin with the proposition that a support order is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.in re marriage of cheriton th,d.thus,we consider only whether the court factual determinations are supported by substantial evidence and whether the court acted reasonably in exercising its discretion.in re marriage of de guigne th,d.as explained in in re marriage of schlafly th,d,w e do not substitute our own judgment for that of the trial court,but determine only if any judge reasonably could have made such an order.
with that in mind we conclude rachael argument is not persuasive.as marc points out,and the trial court specifically reasoned in its decision,income can not be imputed based upon a party earning capacity absent proof of both ability and opportunity to earn the income on a basis.as this court recently explained in in re marriage of bardzik th,d,the burden of proof for imputation of income can not be met by evidence establishing merely that a spouse continues to possesses the skills and qualifications which had made it possible to earn certain salary in the where it was undisputed that the spouse had voluntarily left that prior position.
in bardzik,the wife had voluntarily chosen to retire early from her job as a deputy sheriff,at the age of.however,the fact she was still quite young,with a proven track record of past earning capacity which she had voluntarily relinquished,was simply insufficient to demonstrate she would actually have the opportunity to earn at that prior level on a assuming she would not,to demonstrate the level at which she might be able to earn.
this case is similar.although it is undisputed that marc voluntarily abandoned his prior employment with pricewaterhousecoopers in,and that he had earned a very substantial salary while in that employ,rachael points to absolutely no evidence suggesting,let alone demonstrating beyond dispute,that he could have resumed that work in,at his prior salary,even had he wished to do so.it is possible,certainly,that marc particular skills and experience would make it likely that he could earn similar sums in the future,but that probability must be evidenced,not merely suspected.
there was no such evidence here.moreover,in re marriage of mosley th,d,which rachael cites in her reply brief,is of no assistance to her.in mosley,the wife had a law degree from a prestigious school,where she had served as editor of the law review,and had worked for a very prestigious law firm prior to choosing to devote her efforts to raising the couple children.as of the time the parties divorced,she had not practiced law in nearly a decade.
the court nonetheless concluded it was proper to impute income to her based upon her earning capacity.but the court did not decide it was proper to impute earnings based upon the mere fact the wife had once earned an income.instead,what the court found to be sufficient was expert opinion evidence addressing the specific issue of her capacity to earn income in the future as the court noted,paul provided a vocational evaluation summary demonstrating that dawn had a substantial earning capacity.he also provided the testimony of the vocational expert who had prepared the summary,and who had interviewed dawn as part of the evaluation process.the vocational expert testified that dawn,as an attorney,had an approximate earning capacity of per year to start,although it might take her about weeks to find a position.he also testified that dawn could earn to per hour as a paralegal.in re marriage of mosley,supra,th at,d.that type of evidence,demonstrating an analysis of the spouse qualifications,as well as the opportunities currently available in the job market,is a far cry from evidence merely establishing that the spouse had once earned a certain salary,and thus presumably could is the only evidence rachael presented to the trial court here,in her effort to demonstrate marc theoretical earning capacity in the world of finance.
because there was no evidence demonstrating that marc would even have employment available to him if he decided to return to the type of work he had done prior to,let alone what that employment would likely pay,we can not say the court erred in refusing to impute income to him based upon that theoretical employment.
we next consider whether it was error to reject the conclusion marc at least his present earning established by the salary he was contractually entitled to receive from,but has agreed to defer as part of the effort to maintain the capital of that company.
at first blush,we can certainly understand the decision reached by the trial court.marc is apparently a highly successful man who has poured his much of his a dream business,and now finds himself in stormy seas.the business has never turned a profit,and while marc is receiving essentially no income on a current basis,he is also in some danger of losing everything if forced to walk away.we will assume,as the trial court did,that marc is acting in good faith,and is doing what he thinks is best in very difficult circumstances.
nonetheless,we conclude the court abused its discretion in deciding those circumstances warranted an order which essentially granted marc a holiday from any significant responsibility to support his family at the present time.family code section sets forth certain principles to be adhered to in implementing the uniform guidelines for establishing child support.they include that a parent first and principal obligation is to support his or her minor children according to the parent circumstances and station in life,that b oth parents are mutually responsible for the support of their children,and that e ach parent should pay for the support of the children according to his or her ability,subds.a,b,d.
with those principles in mind,it is clear to us the court erred by failing to interpret marc current voluntary employment situation as demonstrating either actual earnings equivalent to the salary he has elected to defer or special circumstances warranting a departure from guideline amounts,in an amount which would elevate marc support payments to the amount he would have been ordered to pay if he were actually receiving his salary.
we begin with the proposition that marc has entered into an employment agreement with,by which his services as president and chief executive officer were assessed to be worth compensation of approximately per year,maybe more.there is no evidence that anybody ever concluded marc services were no longer worth that,the only evidence suggests merely that the company lacked sufficient capital to make it prudent to continue distributing marc salary on current basis.
thereafter,as the trial court found,marc entered into a series of amendments to his employment contract,by which he voluntarily agreed to decrease his salary below the amounts originally called for in the contract,and then ultimately to defer his receipt of that salary.as a result of those amendments,the court found that marc company had actually accrued some in salary liability to him by the time of trial.
according to his own testimony,marc agreed to those reductions and deferrals because he had determined it was in his own financial best interest to do so.marc explained that he believed a further depletion in the company capital,caused by the continued outlay of salaries to him and the other officers,would harm ability to raise further capital in the future,and thus imperil its viability.as a of at least percent,although marc was vague about specifics,explaining that his ownership interest had evolved over time,as well as a guarantor of substantial loans to the company,marc believed that he stood to lose substantial assets if the company did not outcome which he also believed was likely to occur if he departed.
marc had thus concluded it was in his own financial interest to remain with the company on that salary deferred basis.based upon that calculation,then,what marc did was bargain away his right to receive his salary on a current basis.he made a deal with that he would defer most of his salary.certainly,could not have forced him to stay in its employ if it was no longer pay him the salary called for in his contract.in the absence of marc agreement,either the company would have been forced to continue paying him,until it actually did run out of capital,or he would have long since chosen to work a salary.
by agreeing to defer his salary to preserve his company capital,marc is,in effect,investing in the company.he agreeing to take no income now,with the expectation that if the company fortunes later improve,he will be compensated with additional equity.and he is funding that choice by relying upon his other assets to support his living expenses.but marc could have just as easily chosen to retain his after all,he needs to support his instead utilize his other assets to fund monthly capital investments into his company.except for obvious tax benefits associated with foregoing income,it amounts to essentially the same thing marc has chosen to increase his investment in every month,while depleting his other assets in a corresponding amount.
but of course,there is one other obvious benefit to this option by agreeing to defer his salary as a means of shoring up the company capital,rather than collecting that salary and utilizing his other assets to shore up the company capital,marc is able to claim only minimal current earnings,and thus minimal ability to pay current support.the money he saves in support payments can then be dedicated to either shoring up the company,or to meeting marc own rather significant living expenses.
we conclude marc can not unilaterally,and voluntarily,arrange his business affairs in such a way as to effectively preclude his children from sharing in the benefits of his current standard of living.in re marriage of labass munsee th,d,is instructive in this regard.as that case explains a parent does not have the right to divest himself of his earning ability at the expense of minor children.citation.thus,when a parent voluntarily chooses not to maximize his income,the court must retain discretion to impute income if it does not,one parent by a unilateral decision could eliminate his or her own responsibility to contribute to the support of the child ren,causing the entire burden of supporting the child ren to fall upon the employed parent.citation.id.at,d.
in this case,we need impute nothing.marc has an established salary level for his current services at.he has simply chosen to,in the words of labass munsee,divest himself of those earnings for reasons unrelated to his family or their needs.having made that choice,marc must bear its of them.just as he has continued to meet his other expenses during his period of voluntary salary deferral,mark must likewise continue meeting his support obligations.that additional factor is simply another aspect of the financial calculation marc must engage in to determine how long he wishes to remain with.
further,the fact that marc may have felt himself under some financial pressure because of his prior investments in and loans he guaranteed on its behalf to continue supporting the company with his salary,does not alter the voluntary nature of his decision.nobody forced marc into this situation.just as nobody forced him to spend nearly a million dollars on unimproved property in laguna beach.in essence,what marc has done is simply weigh the potentially detrimental impact that his leaving the company might have on his financial interests,against the benefit of collecting his salary.based upon that ca
