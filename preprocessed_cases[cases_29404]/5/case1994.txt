the city and county of san francisco and the people,by and through the city attorney for the city and county of san francisco collectively,city,filed a complaint against thomas ballard.city alleged,among other things,that the brick and building owned by ballard the building was a public nuisance because its partial sprinkler system was not in compliance with the fire prevention statutes for structures health,et city asserted that the building was a and must have an automatic fire sprinkler system throughout the structure full sprinklers or complete sprinkler system.ballard filed a for declaratory relief and also claimed city had violated his state and federal civil rights.
prior to trial,the court sustained without leave to amend city demurrer to ballard claims of state and federal civil rights violations.city claims and ballard for declaratory relief proceeded to a court trial.after listening to all of the evidence,the trial court ruled that laches barred city claims.the court further found that,even if the lawsuit were not barred by the equitable defense of laches,the building is not an existing,and therefore does not have to maintain full sprinklers.further,the court found the statute of limitations barred city claims and that a partial sprinkler system complied with the law.
following the trial,ballard requested attorney fees as the prevailing party pursuant to section,subdivision c.he also requested sanctions for discovery abuse.the trial court awarded ballard attorney fees and imposed sanctions against city for failing to provide two documents and for failing to disclose the existence of these documents in ballard request for admissions.
city appealed the judgment and the court rulings on attorney fees and discovery sanctions.ballard appealed the dismissal of his counterclaim for state and federal civil rights violations.we consolidated these appeals.
we reject ballard challenges to the dismissal of his civil rights claims.with regard to city appeal,we hold that the lower court erred in applying laches against city because its enforcement action involves a public safety issue.we still affirm the ruling against city,however,on the basis that the building does not qualify as a and is therefore not subject to the fire prevention requirements for structures.we reverse the trial court award of attorney fees under section,subdivision c,because we hold that this statute only applies to receivership proceedings,which did not occur in the present case.finally,we conclude the trial court acted within its discretion when imposing sanctions against city for discovery abuse.we therefore reverse the award of attorney fees and affirm the judgment in all other respects.
background 
in,ballard purchased the building located at hyde street it is an brick and building type construction,which was constructed in approximately.on hyde street,there are three places of entry to the first floor of the building.above the hyde street floor,are floors two through seven.directly below the hyde street floor is the mezzanine floor below the mezzanine floor is a partial basement.all of the floors except the basement have apartments.the basement has two doors with street access onto washington street.
the measurement of the building from the first floor hyde street level to the highest occupied floor the seventh or penthouse floor is approximately feet.the measurement from the mezzanine level to the penthouse floor exceeds feet.the height of the building from the top of the basement floor to the penthouse floor is approximately feet.
in,the legislature created in sections through requirements for fire prevention in new and existing structures and for enforcement,inspections,and penalties for violations.section defines structures as follows a existing structure means a structure,the construction of which is commenced or completed prior to july.b structure means every building of any type of construction or occupancy having floors used for human occupancy located more than feet above the lowest floor level having building access,except buildings used as hospitals 
the state fire marshal adopted regulations,which were originally found at title california administrative code,section through section,and relocated in the with essentially the same language to the california building standards code,section et.these regulations apply to buildings as defined by section.california building standards code section,subdivision a a defines building access by stating that it shall mean an exterior door opening conforming to four listed elements,including suitable and available for fire department use.see also former,tit.this regulation at section,subdivision a b also provides that,if the elevation of the exterior door opening is more than two feet above the adjacent ground level,then the measurement to the highest floor used for human occupancy shall be taken from the floor surface of the story or basement immediately below rule.
the note to california building standards code section explains it is the intent of this section that,in determining the level from which the highest occupied floor is to be measured,the enforcement agency should exercise reasonable judgment,including consideration of overall accessibility to the building by fire department personnel and vehicular equipment.when a building is situated on sloping terrain and there is building access on more than one level,the enforcing agency may select the level which provides the most logical and adequate fire department access.
in,chapter of the national fire protection association standard nfpa standard specified the requirements for the spacing,location,and position of sprinklers.section delineated the basic principles for providing proper protection,which included sprinklers installed throughout the premises,including basements,lofts and all of the locations herein specified.section stated that when a partial sprinkler system has been installed,the requirements of this standard shall be used insofar as they are applicable.the authority having jurisdiction shall be consulted in each case.
section authorizes the state fire marshal to prepare and adopt building standards relating to fire and panic safety in structures and to establish minimum standards for the prevention of fire and for the protection of life and property against fire and panic in structures.section,subdivision a directs that b uilding standards and other regulations of the state fire marshal applicable to existing structures shall provide to the greatest feasible extent for the safety of occupants of the structure and persons involved in fire suppression activities.all existing structures shall be conformed to the requirements contained in such building standards and such other regulations on or before april.
section provides that the local fire department may annually inspect all structures for compliance with building standards and other regulations.if the local fire department elects not to conduct an inspection,the state fire marshal shall conduct the inspection.section requires the owner of any privately owned structure to certify annually that the appropriate local fire enforcing agency has been requested to conduct an inspection of the building to determine its conformance with all applicable structure fire safety standards.the certification shall be submitted by letter to the state fire marshal.
after the effective date of the foregoing legislation,city classified the building as an existing,which the owner of the building at that time did not challenge.the city agents suggested in that the owner of the building apply for a certificate of occupancy,which the owner did.the application described the building as being wood beam construction and with eight floors of occupancy.city issued the then owner of the building a certificate of final completion and occupancy.
as a result of the classification of the building as an existing,city required the owner of the building in to install further sprinkler systems,particularly on the penthouse or seventh floor.city inspected and approved all of the work and certified that the building was in full conformity with all applicable requirements.the permit application was filed in early,but the final approvals did not occur until early.city granted approval with this admonition a pproval is not intended to signify that the building is in compliance with all applicable state and local health and safety regulations.city reserves the right to enforce all health and safety laws applicable to the building now in effect or as may be enacted or amended in the future.
after the work was completed,the building contained a partial sprinkler system in its halls,basement,machine and storage areas,trash chute,and certain of its mezzanine units.specifically,the owner installed six sprinklers off a penthouse hallway to protect a secondary exit path for a unit that did not otherwise have a secondary exit.the owner also installed one sprinkler to protect the alcove at the washington street access point.the building therefore had sprinklers to protect the common areas and of its units.the building also had a fire warning and remote alarm system.
since,the physical characteristics of the building have remained the same.the edition of npfa standard specified the spacing,location,and position of sprinklers in chapter.section set forth the basic requirements.section provided the following the basic requirements for spacing,location,and position of sprinklers are specified in this chapter and are based on the following principles a sprinklers installed throughout the premises,the provision regarding partial sprinkler systems in section remained the same as the one set forth in.
in,chief joseph medina and captain charles farrell,both from the city fire department,interpreted the applicable versions of nfpa standard as mandating complete sprinklers in existing buildings.building standards code section provides that the provisions of sections through shall apply to every existing building.building standards code section states that every existing building of type construction shall be provided with an approved automatic sprinkler system conforming to.
consequently,after ballard purchased the building in,city fire department demanded full is,sprinklers in every unit and room.ballard responded by requesting that the building be characterized as not a structure.the parties engaged in extended discussions and exchanges about whether the building was a from about may to march.the annual inspections continued through.from approximately june until the summer of,no inspections of the building as a occurred,although those annual inspections were required by law for all buildings.
the version of npfa standard added a section on the level of protection provided by the sprinkler system.chapter concerned general information.section provided,a building,where protected by an automatic sprinkler system installation,shall be provided with sprinklers in all areas.following this provision is the following in italics exception where specific sections of this standard permit the omission of sprinklers.section stated the following when partial sprinkler systems are installed,the requirements of this standard shall be used insofar as they are applicable.the authority having jurisdiction shall be consulted in each case.chapter still concerned installation requirements,and section set forth the basic requirements.section reads as follows the requirements for spacing,location,and position of sprinklers are based on the following principles a sprinklers installed throughout the premises,there was no provision regarding partial sprinkler systems in chapter.
city filed a complaint against ballard for injunctive and other relief on september,subsequently,it filed a first amended complaint on march.city alleged a claim for public nuisance for violating section of the state housing law et,a claim for public nuisance for violating the san francisco building code,and a claim for public nuisance for violating civil code sections and.it alleged in its fourth cause of action on behalf of the people of the state of california an action for unfair business practices.
city alleged in its first amended complaint that the building was a and it did not have a complete sprinkler system,in violation of the regulations.in addition,it alleged that the building did not have sealed vertical shafts to prevent the spread of fire and smoke,and did not have appropriate fire escapes.besides requesting an injunction,city requested the court to appoint a receiver to manage the property and to abate the violations.city asked for an award of attorney fees pursuant to section,subdivision d,and civil code section.
on april,ballard filed a for declaratory relief and for alleged violations of his state and federal civil rights.on june,the trial court sustained without leave to amend city demurrer to the civil rights cause of action.ballard appeals from this ruling.
city action and ballard declaratory relief claims proceeded to a court trial in early september.the court found that city claims were barred by laches and the statute of limitations.it also found that the building was not a and therefore not subject to the complete sprinkler system requirement.finally,it determined that a partial sprinkler system complied with the regulations.subsequently,ballard moved for attorney fees pursuant to section,subdivision c,and sanctions for discovery abuse,which the trial court granted.city appeals from the judgment and from the rulings.
we consolidated the appeals of city and ballard.we granted city request for judicial notice of various codes and ordinances and took under submission its request for judicial notice of rent board bulletins and demographic research studies.we take judicial notice of rent board bulletins but,as explained further in part,post,the demographic research studies are irrelevant because we conclude that the building is not a.
discussion 
city appeal 
the lower court found that city claims were barred by the equitable doctrine of laches.in addition,in response to ballard for declaratory relief,the trial court ruled that the building was not a and therefore it did not need to comply with the statutes.city challenges both of these rulings 
applying laches to a public entity 
city argues that the equitable doctrine of laches can not be used to bar government enforcement of important regulations.see,wilson los angeles county metropolitan transportation authority cal th,d,kajima.although we review a court application of laches under a deferential standard of review,the question of whether laches can be used against a public agency is a question of law,and we are not bound by evidence on the question presented below or by the lower court interpretation.id.at,d.
as city acknowledges,courts have in particular situations applied the doctrine of laches against a public entity,city and county of san francisco pacello d.people department of housing community dev.d.department of housing.when the government is a party,invocation of either laches or estoppel rests upon the belief that government should be held to a standard of rectangular rectitude in dealing with its citizens.department of housing,supra,at.decisions involving estoppel or laches against government feature judicial attempts at a synthesis between conflicting claims of private injustice and public interest.ibid.it has long been held that the doctrine of estoppel or the doctrine of laches may apply to a government body if a grave injustice would be done if estoppel were not applied,and it did not appear that use of the doctrine would defeat any strong public policy or result in the indirect enforcement of an illegal contract.county of san diego county cal.water.cal d.
the court in department of housing considered whether to apply the defense of laches against a government entity.department of housing,supra,d at.it first examined the test used when applying equitable estoppel against a public entity,which is as follows the government may be bound by an equitable estoppel in the same manner as a private party when the elements requisite to such an estoppel against a private party are present and,in the considered view of a court of equity,the injustice which would result from a failure to uphold an estoppel is of sufficient dimension to justify any effect upon public interest or policy which would result from the raising of an estoppel.id.at,citing city of long beach mansell cal d.
the court in department of housing used the foregoing equitable estoppel test when deciding whether to apply the defense of laches.department of housing,supra,d at.in department of housing,the private party had received a mobile home park construction permit and the state agency had not made a written determination whether the proposal had significant environmental impact as required under the environmental quality act.id.at.the court of appeal held that laches barred the rescission of the permit where the applicant had waited four months to determine if an environmental inquiry would be required and had expended after having received the permit.id.at.
the court in department of housing explained the basis for applying laches in the situation before it here the state,represented by one agency,received written legal advice describing its environmental responsibilities the applicant citizen received a permit on the assumption that the agency had met its responsibilities on the strength of that assumption he commenced his project,incurring substantial expenses and losses over a period of months only then did the state,acting through another agent,seek judicial action to annul what it had once granted the citizen losses are largely irrecoverable the project is one which conformed with local land use regulations at its inception,hence not recognizable as a gross despoliation of the environment.the state failure to commence its suit before the citizen incurred heavy loss created an injustice which outweighs any adverse effect of the state failure to make timely environmental inquiries.we sustain the defense of laches.department of housing,supra,d at.
city maintains that department of housing is inapplicable because the situation in that case,unlike the present situation,did not involve a public nuisance.our supreme court has clarified that equitable remedies such as estoppel and laches can not apply when their application would nullify a public policy.kajima,supra,cal th at,d.
in kajima,our supreme court considered whether bid preparation costs and lost profits could be recovered against a public entity under the doctrine of equitable estoppel.kajima,supra,cal th at,d.the supreme court noted that the competitive bidding statutes are enacted for the benefit of property holders and taxpayers,and not for the benefit or enrichment of bidders,and should be so construed and administered as to accomplish such purpose fairly and reasonably with sole reference to the public interest.id.at,d.it therefore rejected the equitable remedy because it is clear that neither the doctrine of estoppel nor any other equitable principle may be invoked against a governmental body where it would operate to defeat the effective operation of a policy adopted to protect the public.id.at,d.
in the present case,the trial court found that requiring ballard to install full sprinklers would cost a significant amount of money because much of these costs could not be passed onto the tenants due to rent ordinances.it further ruled there was little evidence to establish full sprinklers were that much better than partial sprinklers.when considering the policy of full sprinklers,the court found that they must not be that necessary because in the city considered partial sprinklers adequate protection.in addition,nfpa standard,section provides when partial sprinkler systems are installed the requirements of this standard shall be used insofar as they are applicable.the court stated,if city had really judged life safety to be endangered,and that was the paramount consideration,it never would have approved partial sprinklers as satisfying the requirements for existing,it never would have ceased making annual inspections of the building for many years and it would not have waited until to initiate this action.the conclusion the court draws from considering all of the evidence on life safety and the effect which full sprinklering would have on life safety is that the increment is indeterminate,and city has not proven that it is any more than marginal.
it is not our role to determine whether a partial or a complete sprinkler system is necessary for adequate fire protection rather,we must consider whether an enforcement action challenging a party compliance with fire protection statutes and regulations constitutes a policy directed towards protecting the public.there is no doubt that fire hazards and the prevention of them is a policy adopted to protect the public.see city of bakersfield miller cal d,fire hazard is a nuisance and therefore city has power to define by statute standard by which courts are to judge whether nuisance exists.
ballard argues that it is undisputed that in the building complied with the fire regulations as they were then interpreted.he also argues that nfpa standard allows partial sprinkler systems when they have been inspected and approved by the local enforcing agency and the new interpretation can not now be applied against him.city responds that building standards code section does not call for existing to conform to the nfpa standard,but rather to the current nfpa standard,and it claims the new standard requires full sprinklers.
the foregoing issues,however,relate to the merits of city lawsuit and are immaterial to whether the trial court properly applied the defense of laches against city attempt to enforce regulations regarding fire safety.we are concerned with whether city lawsuit concerns a public policy and therefore,as a matter of law,laches is not available as a defense.we hold that fire safety is clearly a public policy concern and laches can not bar city claims that the partial sprinkler system in the building violated the fire prevention regulations for structures and thus constituted a public nuisance.
the trial court found that an independent reason for rejecting city claims of public nuisance was that the fire prevention regulations for structures did not apply because the building did not meet the criteria of a building.section,subdivision b defines a h structure as every building of any type of construction or occupancy having floors used for human occupancy located more than feet above the lowest floor level having building access,except buildings used as hospitals,as defined in section.the trial court ruled that the measurement to determine whether the building is a should be from the hyde street entrance and that this measurement is less than feet.it therefore concluded that the building was not a under the statute.
it is undisputed that the building has three doors of entry on hyde street,which is the first floor of the building.it is also undisputed that the mezzanine is directly below the first level and the basement is below the mezzanine.the basement has two doors entering washington street.it is undisputed that the measurement of the building exceeds feet from either the basement or mezzanine floor.thus,the building is a unless the measurement should be from the first floor on hyde street and that measurement falls below feet.
section provides that the measurement should be from the the lowest floor level having building access and city contends the trial court erred when it considered building access to be from the first floor on hyde street.further,even if the measurement is from hyde street,city argues that the measurement should have been from the mezzanine floor under the rule.we consider each of these arguments.
standard of review 
we review the interpretation of the statutes de novo.the factual issues related to the measurement of the building from various points of entry are reviewed under the standard of substantial evidence.when a finding of fact is attacked on the ground that there is no substantial evidence to sustain it,the power of an appellate court begins and ends with the determination as to whether there is any substantial evidence,contradicted or uncontradicted,which will support the finding of fact.citations.when two or more inferences can reasonably be deduced from the facts,a reviewing court is without power to substitute its deductions for those of the trial court.scott common council th,d,quoting green trees enterprises,palm springs alpine estates,cal d.the testimony of a single credible witness may constitute substantial evidence.in re marriage of mix cal d.
interpreting building access 
as already set forth,section,subdivision b defines a building as having floors used for human occupancy located more than feet above the lowest floor level having building access city maintains that under the clear language of the statute the measurement must be from the basement level on washington street,since it is the lowest floor in the building with building access.
the trial court found that the state fire marshal regulations applicable to existing provide that the enforcement agency has discretion to determine the lowest floor level having building access.the note to california building standards code section states that the enforcing agency has discretion to use its reasonable judgment to determine the level from which the highest occupied floor is to be measured and it is to consider overall accessibility to the building by fire department personnel and vehicular equipment.the note further provides that when the building,such as the one at issue here,is on a sloping terrain and there is building access on more than one level,the enforcing agency may select the level which provides the most logical and adequate fire department access.
city maintains that the foregoing note contradicts the express language of subdivision b of section,which defines a building as one that has floors used for human occupancy located more than feet above the lowest floor level having building access according to city,under the clear language of this statute,the basement is the lowest floor level having building access and the extent to which these administrative regulations attempt to enlarge the terms of the enabling statute,they are invalid.see,duskin state board of dry cleaners cal d.in the absence of valid statutory authority,an administrative agency may not,under the guise of a regulation,substitute its judgment for that of the legislature.harris alcoholic bev.appeals bd.d.see also,pulaski occupational safety health stds.bd.th,d morris williams cal d.
we disagree that the statute definition of is unambiguous.section specifies that a structure is measured by the distance between the level of the highest occupied floor and the lowest floor level having building access.the lowest floor level having building access could mean the lowest floor where one can enter or the lowest floor where it is reasonable to enter or where the fire department is likely to enter.under city interpretation,even when the basement door is so narrow or so small that it would not provide access to the fire department,it would be considered the level having building access.indeed,building access is possible on a floor that has no door,simply a window,and the statute could be interpreted to measure from a floor with a window that provides building access.further,the statute is silent regarding situations similar to the one here where the building is on sloping terrain.thus,we hold that lowest floor level having building access is ambiguous and,consequently,the interpretative note to california building standards code section is not inconsistent or contrary to the statute.
further,the legislature made its grant of authority to the state fire marshal broad.section authorizes the state fire marshal to prepare and adopt building standards relating to fire and panic safety in structures and to establish minimum standards for the prevention of fire although the legislature provides for specific considerations for new in section,it sets forth no specific requirements for existing.section,subdivision a,which relates to existing,merely requires that b uilding standards and other regulations of the state fire marshal shall provide to the greatest feasible extent for the safety of occupants of the structure and persons involved in fire suppression activities 
finally,public policy also supports giving the enforcement agency discretion.the definition of building access should be sufficiently flexible to accommodate various structural configurations.moreover,the enforcing agency is in a position to make the best decision regarding the most reasonable access to the building and whether the building meets the requirements of a.accordingly,we conclude that building access is to be determined by the enforcing agency and is to be reviewed only for its reasonableness.
evidence that the hyde street level provides building access under the statute 
the trial court found that medina,the fire marshal during,and farrell,medina captain in charge of code enforcement,as well as the current fire marshal,gary massetani,testified that building access for the purposes of determining whether the building was a,was the main building entrance on hyde street.captain thomas harvey,the current code enforcement officer for the fire department,also considered the building access to be the hyde street entrance.indeed,city argument focuses on the power of the fire marshal to make this determination and does not challenge the court finding that the fire department considered the hyde street entrance as the level for building access.in addition,the trial court found,based on expert testimony of ballard surveyor,that the measurement was feet from the floor level at the front door of hyde street to the highest occupied floor of the building.
we conclude that city has not established that the interpretation of building access from the hyde street level was not reasonable.moreover,we hold that substantial evidence supported the trial court findings that this was the enforcing agency interpretation and the measurement from that level to the penthouse floor was less than feet.
city maintains that,even if hyde street is the level for building access under the statute,the measurement should be from the mezzanine level under the rule.it is undisputed that the measurement from the mezzanine level to the penthouse floor exceeds feet and therefore,according to city,the building is a structure under the statute.
at trial,city argued that the elevation of the exterior door opening for all three doors on hyde street is more than two feet above the adjacent ground level.under the rule in california building standards code section,when the elevation of the exterior door opening is more than two feet above the adjacent ground level,the measurement to the highest floor used for human occupancy shall be taken from the floor surface of the story or basement immediately below.
the trial court found that the evidence at trial established that the southerly door opening,which for some time did not contain an operable door,is less than two feet above the ground level.city does not challenge this finding and therefore we conclude that substantial evidence supported the court finding that the rule does not apply.
accordingly,we affirm the trial court determination that the building does not qualify as a structure for the purpose of the fire prevention regulations and statutes.
c.other claims 
in addition to the claims regarding the partial sprinkler system,city claimed that enclosures of the stairways,trash chute doors,and bars on windows violated the regulations.these issues,however,were not presented in the briefs before this court and we therefore do not consider these issues on appeal.
city also presented an unfair business practices claim on behalf of the people of the state of california.since we conclude that the fire protection required for structures did not apply to the building,this claim must also fail 
attorney fees 
it is elementary that each party bears his or her own attorney fees in litigation,unless otherwise provided by contract or statute,pacific custom pools,turner construction th,d.no contract authorizes attorney fees in the present case but,pursuant to section,subdivision c,the trial court awarded attorney fees in the sum of to ballard.city does not challenge the amount of the fees but argues the fees were not authorized under this statute.
the determination of the legal basis for an award of attorney fees is a question of law that we review de novo,honey baked hams,dickens th,d.we are not aware of any court that has considered the issue presented here,and therefore this is a question of first impression.
o ur first task in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.in determining such intent,a court must look first to the words of the statute themselves,giving to the language its usual,ordinary import and according significance,if possible,to every word,phrase and sentence in pursuance of the legislative purpose the words of the statute must be construed in context,keeping in mind the statutory purpose,and statutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized,both internally and with each other,to the extent possible,fair employment housing com.cal d.rules of statutory construction require courts to construe a statute to promote its purpose,render it reasonable,and avoid absurd consequences.ford gouin cal th,d.exceptions to the general provisions of a statute are to be narrowly construed only those circumstances that are within the words and reason of the exception may be included.city of lafayette east bay mun.utility dist.th,d.
in the present case,city alleged in its pleading that,among other things,ballard violated section,which is part of the state housing law et.it requested attorney fees pursuant to section,subdivision d.city,however,did not prevail on its claims and therefore was not entitled to attorney fees.
the clear language of section,subdivision d establishes that ballard is not entitled to fees under this provision.this subdivision provides d if the court finds that a building is in a condition which substantially endangers the health and safety of residents pursuant to section,upon the entry of any order or judgment,the court shall do all of the following order the owner to pay all reasonable and actual costs of the enforcement agency including,but not limited to,inspection costs,investigation costs,enforcement costs,attorney fees or costs,and all costs of prosecution.
the state housing law,however,has two separate attorney fees provisions the foregoing,and section,subdivision c.the court awarded ballard attorney fees pursuant to this latter provision.section,subdivision c reads in relevant part c the enforcement agency,tenant,or tenant association or organization may seek and the court may order,the appointment of a receiver for the substandard building pursuant to this subdivision the prevailing party in an action pursuant to this section shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees and court costs as may be fixed by the court.
city contends attorney fees under section may be awarded only to the enforcing agency in an abatement action under subdivision d and to any party in a receivership action under subdivision c.since neither ballard nor city filed motions based on receivership or in any other way presented evidence regarding a receivership,attorney fees should not have been awarded pursuant to this subdivision.awarding attorney fees under subdivision c,city maintains,renders the attorney fee provision of subdivision d a nugatory.see,slatkin white th,d.
ballard responds that authorizing attorney fees under section,subdivision c does not render the language in subdivision d meaningless,because the former only refers to attorney fees,while the latter permits the enforcing agency to recoup all its costs in prosecuting the case,including pre and costs.ballard argues that the express language of the statute establishes that attorney fees are authorized.as already set forth,the statute provides,the prevailing party in an action pursuant to this section shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys fees and court costs as may be fixed by the court,subd.c.ballard argues that the construction urged by city would rewrite the statute and substitute subdivision or action for a receivership for section.
ballard argues that the legislature intent is particularly evident by using the word section in section,subdivision c,because it provides definitions of section and subdivision elsewhere.the legislature has set forth the following definitions section means a section of this code unless some other statute is specifically mentioned.subdivision means a subdivision of the section in which that term occurs unless some other section is expressly mentioned.ballard maintains that section can not be judicially revised to limit its construction to receivership actions.see,people jones cal th,d.
no revision is necessary to conclude that the trial court award of attorney fees was unauthorized in the present case.we consider both the clear language of the statute and the placement of the attorney fees provision in section.the attorney fees provision is not placed as its own subdivision in this section.see,subd.c.rather,subdivision the provision regarding attorney fees to the prevailing under c.subdivision c is limited solely to receivership proceedings.ballard completely ignores this placement of the attorney fees and prevailing party provision.it is true that subdivision uses the language of section it is therefore authorizing attorney fees to the prevailing party in an action under section.thus,subdivision c of section provides that the prevailing party in a claim pursuant to section shall be awarded attorney fees in the receivership proceedings.here,there were no receivership proceedings.
alternatively,ballard argues that,even if the prevailing party provision applies only to a receivership action,city did request a receiver in its pleading and therefore he is still entitled to attorney fees under this provision.we disagree.section,subdivision c specifies that an enforcing agency may seek and the court may order,the appointment of a receiver for the substandard building pursuant to this subdivision thus,this subdivision does not apply to every situation where a request for a receivership merely appears in the pleading.rather,it applies when the party seeks and the court orders a receiver.in the present case,there were no receivership proceedings,because the court determined the building was not substandard.since there were no receivership proceedings,no party prevailed in such proceedings.
our construction of the statute not only considers the clear language and the placement of subdivision under the subdivision related to receiverships subd.c in section,but our construction is also consistent with the clear language of section.section provides neither an enforcement agency,any of its officers,nor any city or county for which an enforcement agency may act,is liable for costs in any action or proceeding that the enforcement agency may commence pursuant to this article.if we were to interpret subdivision c of section as urged by ballard,then we would be interpreting it in a manner that is contrary to the express language of section.
ballard contends section is immaterial because only one of city claims was made pursuant to the state housing law.he asserts that city is liable for costs because it lost its other three claims and he cites to department of industrial relations lee th,d.lee is inapplicable.in lee,the court held that labor code section,which exempted the department from court costs,referred to filing fees and the like and did not exempt the department from litigation costs to the prevailing party under code of civil procedure section.lee,supra,th at,d.in contrast,section exempts city from all costs,not simply court costs.further,it is immaterial that only one of the four causes of action for public nuisance was brought under the state housing law.the gist of city pleading is that the building did not comply with the state housing law and other regulations and codes because it did not have a complete sprinkler system.thus,the tenor of the entire action is enforcement under that law.the specific unlawful business practices and housing code violations alleged in the complaint were clearly related to the state housing law enforcement action and therefore the role of the state law was not limited to this one nuisance claim.section applied to the entire action.
more significantly,ballard fails to address the clear inconsistency between section and his interpretation of section,subdivision c.both of these statutes are part of the state housing law.ballard is arguing that he is entitled to attorney fees for prevailing in the enforcement action against him,but subdivision c of section authorizes attorney fees and costs.however,section expressly disallows costs against an enforcement agency in a state housing law action.thus,ballard interpretation is inconsistent with the clear language of section and contravenes the basic principle of statute construction that statutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized,both internally and with each other,to the extent possible,fair employment housing,supra,cal d at.
finally,public policy does not support the construction urged by ballard.clearly,as indicated by section,the legislature did not want to discourage local enforcement agencies from pursuing public nuisance actions and protecting the public interest.permitting a defendant to collect attorney fees in these enforcement actions would stymie efforts to vigorously pursue such cases.accordingly,we hold that the trial court award of attorney fees was not authorized and reverse.
award of sanctions 
city challenges the trial court order of discovery sanctions against it for failing to produce two documents during discovery and failing to admit these documents importance in requested admissions.these two documents established that city had approved the partial sprinkler system installed by the previous owner of the building.the two documents were subsequently made available to ballard at trial,and the court admitted them into evidence.however,the court ruled that the delay in production seriously hindered ballard in the preparation of his defense and made the defense much more difficult,expensive and complex than it should have been.
the trial court granted ballard sanctions in the amount of and it further conditionally granted him the additional sum of.the court noted that the fees sought as a sanction overlap and duplicate entirely the fees awarded to ballard as prevailing party.the award of fees as a sanction will be effective only in the event that it should later be determined that this court erred in awarding prevailing party fees to defendant.in that event,defendant should recover attorney fees as a sanction for misuse of discovery in the total sum of.in that same event,defendant should recover in addition to such attorney fees,costs in the total amount of,in reimbursement for items of statutory costs,as sought in the cost bill filed by ballard.
this is an unusual situation in that the court anticipated possible problems with its award of attorney fees,and then determined those fees that it deemed related to unnecessary litigation or costs related to city failure to provide the documents.the general rule is that an order imposing sanctions on a party or its attorney is reviewable on appeal from the final judgment under the abuse of discretion standard.code of civ,subd.b.
city maintains that it inadvertently failed to produce these two documents,known as the blueys.city asserts that it did not know about its failure to provide ballard with the documents until ballard used them at trial.these documents were in the fire department file and,according to city,ballard attorney had inspected this file.further,city maintains this evidence was duplicative because it produced numerous documents establishing that the previous owner had installed seven sprinklers under the existing ordinance per city request.
the trial court was in the best position to determine whether city admitted during the trial that the sprinkler system in had been inspected and approved as complying with npfa standard.the court found that city had initially denied this.these documents established that the inspections uncovered no code violations and the determination at that time that a complete fire sprinkler system was not necessary under npfa standard.given the trial court unique position of being able to listen to the argument and evidence we can not say that these documents were not critical to ballard defense.the trial court was better able to determine that these documents were not cumulative of other evidence provided.consequently,city has failed to establish that imposing sanctions was an abuse of discretion.
