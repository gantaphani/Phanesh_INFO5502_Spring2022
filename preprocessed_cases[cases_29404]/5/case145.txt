this appeal arises from a dispute between software companies over several trademarks containing the word collective.appellant collective,ci,defendant and in the district court,owns the registered marks collective network,collective video,and c collective the audience engine,a stylized mark in which the word collective appears most prominently together,the registered marks.ci also asserts rights in the unregistered mark collective,standing alone.appellee cross commerce media,ccm,plaintiff and in the district court,operates under the name collective i.ci alleges that this name and two variants infringes its registered and unregistered marks.ccm seeks a judgment to the contrary,along with a declaration that ci holds no rights in the unregistered mark collective and an order compelling the patent and trademark office pto to cancel or modify ci registered marks.
in a series of three orders,the district court katherine forrest,judge granted summary judgment to ccm on virtually all points in dispute and awarded attorney fees under the lanham act.we reverse those decisions in part,vacate them in part,and remand for further proceedings.
background 
ci provides analytic software that helps businesses select effective marketing opportunities on multiple electronic platforms,including computers,smart phones,tablets and connected television.declaration of joseph apprendi,ceo and co founder of ci,dated july,at app x.it was incorporated as collective media,in,and its name was changed to collective,in.from to,the company registered the trademarks collective network,collective video,and c collective the audience engine.during the same period,ci acquired the domain name for its principal website and referred to itself in at least several instances as collective.
ccm provides its own brand of analytic software.according to one of the company trademark registrations,the software aids companies in deploying and analyzing marketing campaigns.see ccm statement of undisputed material facts dated june,at app x.the company was founded as cross commerce media,in,but it began to do business under the mark collective i and the related marks collective intelligence and collectivei in.
in late,ci contacted ccm to express its concern that use of the mark collective i in commerce would create confusion over the two companies because they operate in similar fields.after negotiations failed to solve the perceived problem,ci sent ccm a letter in late asserting ccm infringement of ci trademarks,including the registered marks and the unregistered mark collective.in response,ccm filed this action in the united states district court for the southern district of new york in an effort to preempt an infringement lawsuit by ci.ccm sought three remedies a declaration that ci did not own trademark rights to the unregistered mark collective a declaration that the name collective i did not infringe any of ci registered or unregistered marks and an order compelling the pto to cancel or modify the registered marks.ci,in turn,filed counterclaims under the lanham act alleging that ccm use of collective i along with collective intelligence and collectivei infringed ci registered marks and the unregistered mark collective.
the district court resolved the parties claims and counterclaims in a series of three orders.first,before the parties had completed discovery,ccm moved for partial summary judgment as to the inherent distinctiveness of the unregistered mark collective.trademarks,whether registered or unregistered,are grouped for purposes of analysis into four categories of increasing inherent distinctiveness generic,descriptive,suggestive,and arbitrary or fanciful.bernard commerce drug,cir.ccm sought a decision by the district court that the unregistered mark collective,as used by ci,is descriptive as a matter of law.ci countered that the mark is suggestive or,alternatively,that a jury should decide the issue.in a march,order,the court,agreeing with ccm,classified the mark as descriptive.cross commerce media,collective,civ.kbf,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,the march order.
the march order did not reject ci counterclaim for infringement of the unregistered mark collective outright.by classifying the mark as descriptive,however,the order imposed a heightened evidentiary standard for establishing its entitlement to protection under federal trademark law.the lanham act affords protection to a descriptive mark only if the trademark holder can demonstrate that it has acquired secondary meaning in the marketplace in other words,that the mark primary significance to relevant consumers is to identify the trademark holder as the source of the product.bristol myers squibb mcneil,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.that showing entails rigorous evidentiary requirements.century wear,sanmark stardust,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.had the mark instead been classified as suggestive,it would have received some degree of trademark protection even without proof of secondary meaning.mcgregor doniger drizzle,cir,superseded on other grounds by fed.civ.a 
seeking to build on the march order,ccm subsequently moved for summary judgment as to ci counterclaim for infringement of the unregistered mark collective,on two grounds.first,ccm argued that ci could not establish that the mark had acquired secondary meaning which,as noted,would mean that it was not entitled to protection under the lanham act.second,ccm contended that even if collective had acquired secondary meaning,ci could not establish infringement because it had not used the mark in commerce and acquired corresponding trademark rights until after ccm had introduced its own marks.ci argued in response that it had raised triable issues of fact as to both issues,precluding summary judgment.in an august,order,the district court again agreed with ccm,concluding that ci had no protectable rights in the unregistered mark collective both because the mark lacked secondary meaning and because ci had not used it in commerce before ccm introduced its marks.see cross commerce media,collective,cv kbf,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,the august order.the court therefore dismissed ci counterclaim for infringement of the unregistered mark collective.
surprisingly,we think,the august order also dismissed ci distinct counterclaim for infringement of the registered marks.ccm memorandum of law in support of its summary judgment motion had advanced no argument regarding that counterclaim.the memorandum mentioned the registered marks only to argue that their validity which ccm assumed for the sake of argument would not buttress ci claim that the distinct,unregistered mark collective was protectable.in keeping with the cabined nature of ccm memorandum,ci opposition papers focused exclusively on the counterclaim for infringement of the unregistered mark collective,mentioning the registered marks only to contend that their validity would,in fact,buttress that counterclaim.the district court did not analyze the counterclaim for infringement of the registered marks but nonetheless ruled that the counterclaim failed as a matter of law.
having prevailed on ci counterclaims for infringement,ccm moved for several remedies an order compelling the pto to cancel the registered marks collective network and collective video,either because they were descriptive and lacked secondary meaning or because ci had abandoned them an order compelling the pto to disclaim the term collective within the registered mark c collective the audience engine because it is not independently entitled to trademark protection attorney fees under the lanham act and sanctions under various federal rules for abuse of the discovery process.in a december,order,the district court granted summary judgment for ccm on the issue of abandonment and awarded all of its requested remedies except for sanctions,which the court deemed duplicative of attorney fees under the lanham act.see cross commerce media,collective,cv kbf,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,the december order.
ci timely appealed the portions of the district court three orders that dismissed its counterclaims and granted ccm requested remedies.
discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party and drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor.scr joint venture warshawsky,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.we will affirm only if there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.a.an issue of fact is genuine and material if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.see scr,at.
after applying that standard of review to the voluminous record in this case,we reverse or vacate all contested portions of the march order,august order,and december order.we do so on four grounds.first,in our view the unregistered mark collective is suggestive,not descriptive.second,there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether ci used the unregistered mark collective in commerce before ccm introduced its allegedly infringing marks.third,the district court prematurely granted summary judgment as to ci counterclaim for infringement of the registered marks,an action that neither party requested and the district court did not explain.finally,there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether ci abandoned its registered marks collective network and collective video.we therefore remand the case for a new round of summary judgment proceedings should either party choose to pursue them.
inherent distinctiveness 
a trademark inherent distinctiveness is a issue.it must be evaluated in relation to the particular goods to which the mark is attached,the context in which it is being used,and the possible significance that the term would have to the average purchaser of the goods because of the manner of its use or intended use.coach,triumph learning llc,fed.cir.internal quotation marks omitted.applying that contextual approach,we conclude that ci use of the mark collective is suggestive as a matter of law,and that the district court committed clear error in concluding otherwise.see bristol myers squibb,at we will substitute our own judgment as to inherent distinctiveness if the district court determination is clearly erroneous.
both descriptive and suggestive marks convey information about,and thus are associated with,the product to which they are attached.the difference between them lies in the immediacy of association how quickly and easily consumers grasp the nature of the product from the information conveyed.a descriptive mark communicates an immediate idea of the ingredients,qualities or characteristics of the goods,bernard,at quoting abercrombie fitch hunting world,cir.friendly,while a suggestive mark requires consumers to employ imagination,thought and perception to reach a conclusion as to the nature of goods,time,petersen publ g,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.thus,i f the mental leap between the word and the product attributes is not almost instantaneous,this strongly indicates suggestiveness,not direct descriptiveness.thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed.
to determine the immediacy of association between a mark and a product,we generally consider how specifically and exclusively the mark describes the product.a descriptive mark,we have said,is one that conjure s up the image of the precise good with which it is associated.playtex,pac,cir,superseded by statute on other grounds as recognized in starbucks wolfe borough coffee,cir.a suggestive mark,by contrast,is ordinarily one that describes an attribute of the product but could plausibly describe a wide variety of other products as well.id.in other words,the meaning of a descriptive mark is narrowly tailored to its associated product,such that it calls that product immediately to mind.the meaning of a suggestive mark typically evokes an array of goods,which means that consumers must make an additional mental effort to identify the associated product in particular.
thus,in playtex,we affirmed the district court conclusion that the mark wet ones,used for moist towelettes,was suggestive rather than descriptive.we reasoned that the mark evoked qualities dampness and usage that towelettes shared with a wide range of goods,which made it relatively difficult for consumers to divine the nature of the particular product at issue from the mark alone.see id.similarly,we decided in hasbro,lanard toys,cir,that the mark gung ho,used for a marine action figure,was suggestive because it described elements of the personality attributed to the action figure,as well as other toys,without describing the particular action figure itself or its differentiating qualities,id.at emphases added.by contrast,we have classified the mark sportscreme,used for an analgesic rub designed for athletes,as descriptive because it specifically conjured a cream useful in connection with sports.thompson med.pfizer,cir.
applying the same analytic framework here,we conclude that the mark collective is only suggestive of ci products.as the district court noted,merriam webster online dictionary defines the adjective collective as denoting a number of persons or things considered as one group or whole formed by collecting aggregated and of,relating to,or being a group of individuals.collective,merriam webster online dictionary,last visited,see march order,wl,at,dist.lexis,at the same dictionary defines the noun collective as a collective body group or a cooperative unit or organization.collective,merriam webster,supra.
after reviewing the record,we find three plausible associations between those definitions and ci products.first,ci asserts that it is able to analyze vast amounts of data in order to help clients identify effective marketing opportunities,a service that could be described as collective in nature or,perhaps,producing a collective of relevant data.second,ci points to its capacity to identify marketing opportunities across multiple electronic devices,which could be framed as offering consumers a collective of marketing platforms.and third,in the most general sense,the company software works to aggregate advertising opportunities and present them,as a collective,to users.
these associations lack the specificity that would enable an average consumer to intuit the nature of ci business from the collective mark,at least absent considerable imaginative effort or luck.as in playtex and hasbro,the mark has comparably strong associations with a range of distinct enterprises that offer unrelated goods,including software,to consumers search engines and investment advisers seek to aid their clients by analyzing collectives of data health insurers and banks serve clients across a collective of platforms and real estate brokers and online ticket exchanges could be said to offer a collective of options for their clients to consider.indeed,the word collective might even bring to mind businesses that could themselves be called collectives,such as collective farms or collective grocery stores.when encountering ci use of the term collective for the first time,therefore,the average consumer does not,in our view,have a compelling reason to conclude that the company provides marketing tools.conjuring the image of ci software in particular,rather than other goods or services that the word collective might be used to describe,demands a substantial mental leap.for that reason,we conclude that collective is a suggestive mark in this context.
in reaching a contrary conclusion,the district court did not adequately evaluate the mental leap between the mark collective and ci products.after reciting several of the dictionary definitions set forth above,the court observed this is precisely the manner in which ci uses the word it is an advertising network that offers a collection or collective of advertising opportunities.march order,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.based on that observation alone,the court then concluded that t he word collective thus literally describes an immediate idea of the ingredients,qualities or characteristics of ci product.id.quoting bristol myers squibb,at.in doing so,the court mistakenly equated the fact of association which does not distinguish between descriptive and suggestive marks with immediacy of association which does.the word collective in ci marks provides a clue as to the nature of ci products.but the critical inquiry,which the court did not reach,is how easily consumers would deduce the nature of ci products from collective alone.
the district court suggested that its decision was reinforced by two additional considerations the frequency with which third parties have used the word collective in their names,and the pto prior treatment of various trademark applications containing that word.see,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.to be sure,such considerations may,in some circumstances,inform a court evaluation of inherent distinctiveness.in this case,however,the available evidence regarding usage is indeterminate,while the pto prior practice indicates that collective is a suggestive mark.
as a general matter,information about how third parties have used a mark in commerce may shed light on its inherent distinctiveness in several ways.first,we have recognized that a mark is more likely to be descriptive,rather than suggestive,if a ccording it trademark exclusivity would inhibit competitors from using descriptions of their competing products.tcpip holding haar commc ns,cir.see also papercutter,fay drug,cir.noting that the distinction between descriptive and suggestive terms may be sharpened by evaluation of the potential impact on competitors of the appropriation of the term as a trademark by a particular seller.information about how rival third parties have used a mark could be instructive in that regard consistent usage by competitors might indicate that it is a vital descriptive tool in the industry,while minimal usage might suggest the contrary.additionally,as we have observed,a mark is more likely to be suggestive,rather than descriptive,if its meaning evokes a wide range of products.see playtex,at.information about how third parties in unrelated industries have used a mark could bear on that issue widespread usage by different types of businesses might indicate that it calls to mind a variety of products,while minimal usage might imply otherwise.
here,the district court cited three statistics regarding usage of the collective mark t he word collective is used in the name of over businesses in states t here are over internet domain names that contain the word collective and more than a dozen companies in the digital advertising and marketing field also use the word collective.march order,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.these statistics do not,in our view,provide enough information to be probative of the mark inherent distinctiveness.it is unclear to what extent the first two numbers pertain to ci competitors in which case widespread use might indicate that collective is descriptive or third parties in unrelated industries in which case widespread use might indicate that collective is suggestive.the third statistic is somewhat more narrowly drawn,inasmuch as it relates only to companies involved with digital marketing.even so,however,it is not limited to companies that produce software similar to ci.and in any event,the fact that a dozen companies have used the word collective is a numerator without a denominator a dozen companies could be a significant portion of the field which might indicate that collective is a vital descriptive tool in the industry or a tiny sliver which might indicate that competitors need not rely on collective to describe their products.overall,therefore,the cited evidence of usage carries little weight regarding the inherent distinctiveness of collective in this case.
the pto prior treatment of trademark applications may inform a court analysis of inherent descriptiveness in a different way.before deciding whether to grant an application,the agency determines the inherent distinctiveness of the mark at issue and,in many instances,its constituent parts.because the agency has developed expertise in trademarks,courts accord great weight to its conclusions.murphy door bed interior sleep,cir.thus,if the pto has previously classified the particular mark before the court as either descriptive or suggestive,the court will generally follow suit absent compelling grounds for disagreement.see,papercutter,at t he decision of the pto to register a mark without requiring proof of secondary meaning affords a rebuttable presumption that the mark is more than merely descriptive.quoting mcgregor doniger,at.and even where the pto has not previously considered the particular mark at issue,courts may draw a measure of guidance from the way the agency has classified analogous marks.see,real news project,indep.world television,civ.gel,wl,at,dist.lexis,at may,classifying the plaintiff use of the mark real news as descriptive and noting that the pto classification of similar marks incorporating the term real as descriptive confirm ed the court analysis.
the district court cited one statistic about the pto prior practice the agency has either required disclaimer of the use of the word collective as being descriptive or rejected the application entirely on the same basis in instances.march order,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.again,we are not convinced that this statistic is probative of inherent distinctiveness.it pertains to all uses of the word collective not solely those analogous to ci use of the word,where the pto analysis would be of import.and in any event,the figure is another numerator without a denominator.as we understand the record,the pto has required disclaimer of the word collective because it is descriptive,or rejected applications for the same reason,times out of approximately percent of the time.app x.it is therefore far from clear that the pto routinely classifies collective as a descriptive mark in any context,let alone the context relevant to this case.
in our view,the district court seems to have overlooked a more probative fact about the pto prior practice although each of ci registered marks contains the word collective,the pto did not disclaim that word as descriptive or,as far as we can tell from the record,require a showing of secondary meaning in any instance.that fact bolsters ci argument that the mark should be classified as more than merely descriptive.papercutter,at internal quotation marks omitted.
we therefore reverse the portion of the march order that concluded,as a matter of law,that collective is a descriptive mark.although ci bore the burden of proving collective was suggestive,see nola spice designs,haydel,cir.noting that where the moving party has pointed to the absence of evidence to prove a fact material to an issue on which the opposing party has the burden of proof at trial,the opposing party has the burden of demonstrating by competent summary judgment proof that there is an issue of material fact warranting trial internal quotation marks omitted reese publ g hampton int l commc ns,cir.concluding that where the mark is not registered,the burden is on the proponent to prove that its mark is a valid trademark,we think that the relevant evidence already in the record when ccm moved for partial summary judgment including the dictionary definitions of collective,the nature of ci business,and the pto prior decisions regarding the registered marks uniformly supports the classification of collective as a suggestive mark.ci was not obligated to submit still more evidence to prevail on the issue instead,we conclude that collective is a suggestive mark,which means it is entitled to some degree of trademark protection even absent proof of secondary meaning.see mcgregor doniger,at.for that reason,we also vacate the portion of the august order that dismissed ci counterclaim for infringement of the unregistered mark collective based on ci purported failure to show secondary meaning,along with the portion of the december order that compelled the pto to disclaim the word collective in c collective the audience engine.
finally,we note that when ccm moved for summary judgment as to ci counterclaim for infringement of the unregistered mark collective,it presumably chose its arguments in light of the district court classification of the mark collective as descriptive.we direct the district court,on remand,to give ccm a reasonable o
