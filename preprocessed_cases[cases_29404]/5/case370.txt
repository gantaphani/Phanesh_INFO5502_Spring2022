opinion sur motion for attorneys fees and costs 
the determination of a reasonable attorney fee for a prevailing party under a fee shifting statute generally is a disagreeable and tedious task,especially where the fee petition is vigorously contested and the petition is in behalf of numerous lawyers who worked on the appeal.the fee motion before us claims over hours of attorney time expended exclusively for work on the appeal.we are required to analyze the motion and supporting data to ascertain whether the amount claimed is reasonable.the motion is especially troublesome because in this single issue appeal,ten lawyers represented the plaintiffs and claim compensation for not only an aggregate of hours of service on the appeal,but an additional claim of hours for services expended on the fee petition.the total sum claimed is in attorneys fees and in costs.
the plaintiffs,welfare recipients in pennsylvania,brought a class action in in the united states district court challenging the constitutionality of pennsylvania durational residency requirement limiting the amount of public assistance benefits for new residents.the plaintiffs claimed that the welfare scheme violated their constitutional rights to travel,to equal protection,and to treatment under the privileges and immunities clause.they moved for class certification and an injunction.the plaintiffs sued pursuant to,naming the state secretary of public welfare and the executive director of the philadelphia board of assistance as defendants.the district court held that the welfare scheme violated the fourteenth amendment equal protection clause,granted the injunction,and certified the class action.on the basis of a stipulation of counsel,the district court ordered the defendants to pay for the plaintiffs fees for services rendered in that court,and costs.the commonwealth appealed and,after briefing and oral argument,we affirmed.see maldonado houstoun,cir.
after our decision,the supreme court of the united states granted certiorari to review roe anderson,cir,a decision which struck down similar provisions in a california statute.
based on our decision and the decision of the united states supreme court in saenz roe,d affirming the judgment of the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit in roe anderson,cir,we now have before us the plaintiffs motion for attorneys fees and costs in connection with their appeal to this court.
the plaintiffs appellees claim that they are entitled to the attorneys fees and costs requested because they prevailed on the appeal within the meaning of.see b providing,in the court discretion,a reasonable attorney fee to a prevailing party to a action.as we stated above,they also prevailed in the district court where the trial judge,acting on a stipulation of counsel for the parties,entered an order on january,awarding plaintiffs in full satisfaction of fees and costs incurred in that court.regrettably,we have no stipulations in the motion before us on the contrary,the appellants effectively the state strenuously oppose the motion in all of its aspects.
the state contends that the fees requested are grossly unreasonable.it acknowledges that the appellees are entitled to receive a fee award,but asserts that the fee request is grotesquely inflated.the state emphasizes that the appeal presented only a single issue which,although important,was not particularly complicated,and turned largely on the court construction of shapiro thompson,d.specifically,the state argues that an award for the hours claimed for preparation of the brief at oral argument should be substantially reduced,and that the appeal single issue,which had already been thoroughly explored in the district court,reasonably should have required no more than hours.the state also contends that the hourly rate claimed for the attorneys is excessive and that the allowable hourly rate for all lawyers,including those of a private law firm,should conform to the rates of community legal services cls,which have been widely accepted as fairly reflecting the prevailing market rates in philadelphia.the state asserts that attorneys of dechert,price rhoads provided insufficient support for their high rates claimed.
on the other hand,the appellees assert that the issues on appeal were complex and difficult,required familiarity with a large body of case law,state statutes and regulations,that the case was not by the plaintiffs,and that they have already substantially reduced their hours to account for any inefficiencies created by a team.they further assert that the time they spent on the appeal was reasonable,and that the state lack of cooperation in the preparation of the appendix added to the expense.they also argue that the hourly rate claimed is reasonable and that the state should be ordered to pay dechert at its normal rates,which are set by the market.
in assessing the reasonableness of a claimed fee in cases like this,we use the lodestar formula,which requires multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended by a reasonable hourly rate.see hensley eckerhart,d pennsylvania delaware valley citizens council for clean air,d pennsylvania environ,at.when the applicant for a fee has carried his burden of showing that the claimed rates and number of hours are reasonable,the resulting product is presumed to be the reasonable fee to which counsel is entitled.delaware valley citizens council,at.internal quotation omitted.
in calculating the hours reasonably expended,a court should review the time charged,decide whether the hours set out were reasonably expended for each of the particular purposes described and then exclude those that are excessive,redundant,or otherwise unnecessary.public int.research group of,windall,cir internal citation omitted see also rode dellarciprete,cir the district court should exclude hours that are not reasonably expended.hours that would not generally be billed to one own client are not properly billed to an adversary.public interest group,at.thus,we have a positive and affirmative function in the fee fixing process,not merely a passive role.
generally,a reasonable hourly rate is calculated according to the prevailing market rates in the relevant community.see blum stenson,d dellarciprete,at.the court should assess the experience and skill of the prevailing party attorneys and compare their rates to the rates prevailing in the community for similar services by lawyers of reasonably comparable skill,experience,and reputation.dellarciprete,at.the prevailing party bears the burden of establishing by way of satisfactory evidence,in addition to the attorney own affidavits,that the requested hourly rates meet this standard.washington philadelphia cty.of common pleas,cir citing blum stenson,d.the starting point in ascertaining a reasonable hourly rate is the attorney usual billing rate,but this is not dispositive.public interest group,at.
in analyzing this heated controversy,some concepts and precepts are indisputable.the plaintiffs presented an excellent case and a high quality brief.accordingly,they are entitled to all hours reasonably expended on the litigation.west virginia university hospitals,casey,cir quoting hensley eckerhart,d.the converse is also true they are not entitled to compensation for hours unreasonably expended on the litigation.
we do not question the accuracy of counsel records.our principal concern is whether the time claimed is reasonable for the services performed,a concern which is accentuated because of the many lawyers involved in behalf of the plaintiffs.ordinarily,this appeal could have been briefed and argued by a single lawyer or two.lawyers should understand that although the likelihood of success in a fee shifting case may be promising,the prospects of payment by a defendant with a deep pocket or a defendant with tax collecting powers should not encourage the utilization of an excess number of lawyers on the preparation of the appeal.nor is work on the appeal intended to be a training school for law students or embryonic lawyers at the expense of the losing party.a reviewing court must adhere to the statutory and case law standards.as do the district cou
