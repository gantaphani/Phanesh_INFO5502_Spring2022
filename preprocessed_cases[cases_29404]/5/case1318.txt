background procedural history 
carl and dorothy legg,citizens of alabama,brought this action in the circuit court of madison county,alabama against wyeth,a citizen of delaware and new jersey,indevus pharmaceuticals,a citizen of delaware and massachusetts,and three wyeth sales representatives stacy stubblefield,michael sullivan,and betsy weaver.sullivan is alleged to be a citizen of georgia stubblefield and weaver are alleged to be citizens of alabama.carl legg contends he took wyeth drug redux and,as a result,developed valvular heart disease.dorothy legg claims loss of consortium.
wyeth removed the matter to the united states district court for the northern district of alabama.wyeth alleged that federal jurisdiction was proper under diversity jurisdiction,and that the leggs fraudulently joined three sales representatives to destroy diversity.wyeth attached affidavits of the sales representatives in support of its contention that the sales representatives were fraudulently joined.wyeth then moved to transfer the case to the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania for consolidation with similar cases pending before the litigation panel.before reviewing that motion,the district court granted the leggs motion to remand,concluding that diversity did not exist.the court found that the sales representatives were not fraudulently joined because there was a possibility that the leggs could prevail in their claims against them.the court reached this conclusion on the face of the complaint,concluding that it could not consider the affidavits provided by wyeth.the court also concluded that the leggs stated a possible cause of action for innocent or negligent misrepresentation against betsy weaver,even if her affidavit was taken as true.in a separate order,the district court granted the leggs attorneys fees and costs in the amount of.wyeth appeals the grant of attorneys fees and costs.
ii.standard of review 
we may review the merits of a remand order in considering whether the district court abused its discretion by awarding attorneys fees and costs under c.fowler safeco ins.of,cir.while d bars our review of a remand such as this one based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction,the statute does not exclude the district court assessment of costs from appellate review.id.at.as the fifth circuit has explained,w hile we may not review the decision to remand itself,we must,as part of our examination of the award of fees,consider the objective validity of the removing party efforts,at the time that party attempted to remove the case.hornbuckle state farm lloyds,cir.we review the district court award of attorneys fees and costs for an abuse of discretion.fowler,at.an error of law is an abuse of discretion.wexler lepore,cir.therefore,an award of attorneys fees based on a legally erroneous remand order constitutes an abuse of discretion.
iii.contentions of the parties 
wyeth contends on appeal that the district court erred in concluding that wyeth removal was improper,and therefore that no fees or costs should have been awarded the leggs.wyeth argues that the district court erred in refusing to consider unrebutted evidence submitted by it in support of removal.wyeth also argues that the district court erred in concluding that the leggs stated possible claims against betsy weaver based on innocent or negligent misrepresentation,even if her affidavit was taken as true.the leggs defend the decision of the district court,and assert that the decision to award fees and costs was not an abuse of discretion,even if we would have decided the matter differently.
iv.discussion 
this lawsuit by the leggs is but one of thousands of cases brought by plaintiffs across the country who claim they suffer from valvular heart disease because they took one of wyeth diet drugs a common strategy employed by the plaintiffs in these cases is to name local parties,often wyeth local sales representatives,as defendants,thus defeating wyeth right to remove a case to federal court the multidistrict litigation court,which has overseen a large part of this litigation,concluded that this joinder can only be characterized as a sham,at the unfair expense not only of wyeth but of many individuals and small enterprises that are being unfairly dragged into court simply to prevent the adjudication of lawsuits against wyeth,the real target,in a federal forum.anderson am.home prods,d.indeed,there are dozens of district court decisions finding that wyeth sales representatives were fraudulently joined as defendants to defeat federal diversity jurisdiction wyeth contends that this is such a case.
the leggs named three local sales representatives as defendants in this case.michael sullivan,the first sales representative named as a defendant in this suit,submitted an affidavit to the district court stating that he is a citizen and resident of the state of georgia.at ex.if that is true,sullivan presence would not defeat diversity jurisdiction.the second sales representative,stacy stubblefield,claims he never sold redux.in his affidavit,stubblefield swore that he never advertised,assembled,created,designed,detailed,distributed,labeled,made,manufactured,marketed,packaged,promoted,sold,sterilized,supplied,tested,or warranted pondimin or redux,or trained anyone to do so.at ex.finally,the third sales representative,betsy weaver,admitted that she promoted redux to licensed healthcare providers and answered their questions about the drug based on information provided to me by wyeth.id.however,weaver asserts that she had no knowledge of redux alleged association with valvular heart disease until the allegation was first publicized 
my knowledge of the drugs i detailed was derived exclusively from education provided to me by wyeth.wyeth provided me with the package inserts and other information regarding the drugs i detailed.i had no involvement in the development or preparation of package inserts for any drugs,and had no control over content or other written warnings.
i was not expected,as a field sales representative,to conduct independent research regarding the drugs i detailed,and did not do so.i was not expected to,and did not,review independent scientific studies published in journals unless they were supplied to me by wyeth.
i was not aware of any alleged association between pondimin redux and valvular heart disease until the time such an allegation was first publicized.i was not aware before that time of any published study,report or other literature which claimed that an association exists between pondimin redux and valvular heart disease.
id.wyeth attached these three affidavits as exhibits to its notice to remove this case to federal court.in the notice of removal,wyeth alleged that the action could have originally been filed in federal court because complete diversity of citizenship exists between the properly joined parties,and that the three sales representatives were fraudulently joined.
in response to the sales representatives affidavits,the plaintiffs did not dispute sullivan sworn statement that he was a citizen of georgia,nor did they respond to stacey stubblefield sworn statement that he never promoted or sold redux.in an effort to rebut weaver sworn statement that she did not know of redux alleged connection with valvular heart disease,the plaintiffs pointed out to the district court that all of wyeth sales representatives had to participate in a sales training program.the plaintiffs submitted to the cou
