we affirm the judgment entered pursuant to the order sustaining the demurrer.
the second amended complaint alleges as follows 
lazy acres market,hired premier protective services premier to apprehend shoplifters in its market.the contract required premier to defend and indemnify lazy acres market,its shareholders and employees hereinafter collectively lazy acres for any claims arising out of premier loss prevention activities.premier obtained a policy of insurance from western heritage insurance company western heritage,naming lazy acres as an additional insured.
premier employee,johnny lopez,arrested scott courts for shoplifting an item from lazy acres market.courts sued premier,lazy acres and others,alleging intentional and negligent torts.the complaint demanded punitive as well as compensatory damages.
western heritage agreed to defend lazy acres.it did not reserve any rights to deny coverage.instead,western heritage accepted full responsibility to defend and indemnify lazy acres pursuant to the insurance policy.
western heritage selected jennifer tseng to represent lazy acres and premier.on august,tseng wrote lazy acres stating she had been retained to defend it,but tseng disclosed no actual or potential conflict of interest.earlier that day,cappello noël,lazy acres personal counsel,had obtained an extension of time to respond to courts complaint.on august,terrence bonham wrote to tseng advising her that he had been retained by lazy acres own insurance carrier to represent lazy acres interest in the suit.bonham stated that because western heritage had accepted defense and indemnity,he would monitor the case.
tseng represented lazy acres,premier and lopez in the lawsuit until july of.during this time,tseng spoke to,advised,and corresponded with all defendants.bonham monitored the case on behalf of lazy acres carrier,and cappello noël played no role in the litigation.
tseng failed to assert defenses that would benefit lazy acres she failed to advise lazy acres of her conflict of interest in representing lazy acres and premier and she failed to advise lazy acres that lazy acres could be entitled to have western heritage assign independent,counsel at western heritage expense.
in july of,lazy acres contacted cappello noël regarding the status of the courts case.cappello noël advised lazy acres that tseng had an actual,or at least potential,conflict of interest in representing both premier and lazy acres.cappello noël told tseng they were replacing her as lazy acres counsel.
by the time cappello noël began representing lazy acres in july of,crucial trial deadlines were looming.lazy acres requested documents retained by tseng.tseng responded only after repeated phone calls and letters.she refused to allow her former clients to remove the legal file from her office.instead,she required lazy acres to come to her office to copy the file.this prejudiced lazy acres in its ability to prepare for trial.
lazy acres requested tseng to recuse herself from representing premier because of a continuing conflict of interest.tseng refused,and lazy acres moved to disqualify her.tseng submitted opposition and the trial court denied the motion.nevertheless,tseng called cappello noël the next day and acknowledged a conflict of interest existed,and expressed the view that the trial court was wrong in denying the motion.tseng resigned from the case,and western heritage appointed new counsel for premier and lopez.
lazy acres was forced to pay for its own defense beginning in july of.western heritage did not respond to lazy acres requests for payment of its fees and costs.
trial began on january.prior to a jury being impaneled,western heritage paid to courts to settle the case.the lazy acres defendants were all dismissed with prejudice without paying anything to courts.
as a proximate result of tseng breach of fiduciary duty,lazy acres suffered damages in an amount in excess of in attorney fees,expert witness fees,monetary sanctions and costs.
discussion 
a demurrer tests the sufficiency of a pleading.postley harvey d.because it raises only a question of law,our review is de novo.code civ,holiday matinee,rambus,th,d.all facts pleaded in the complaint must be deemed true.holland thacher d.we do not assume the truth of contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.moore regents of university of california cal d.if it appears the plaintiff is entitled to any relief,the complaint will be held good.chase chemical hartford accident indemnity d.
lazy acres contends the second amended complaint states causes of action against tseng for legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty.
in this case,the elements of these causes of action are the same the duty to use such skill as members of the legal profession commonly possess and exercise a breach of that duty damages and a proximate causal relationship between the breach and damages.citing coscia mckenna cuneo cal th,d,pompilio kosmo,cho brown th,d.
lazy acres therefore argues that at the outset of the courts action,tseng was required to advise lazy acres of any potential and actual conflicts of interest,and obtain written waivers.citing cal.rules conduct,rule b c.it claims her failure to do so was a breach of duty per se.
but assuming,without deciding,that tseng breached such a duty,the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to show the breach proximately caused any damages.the damages lazy acres alleges is an expenditure for attorney fees and costs in defending itself.but the complaint alleges western heritage,not tseng,had a duty to pay fees and costs in defending the action.
nor does the complaint allege facts to show that anything tseng did,or failed to do,influenced western heritage decision not to pay lazy acres attorney fees.the complaint alleges that western heritage refused to pay lazy acres fees,even after tseng declared a conflict.it is pure speculation to say the outcome would have been any different,had tseng declared a conflict at the beginning of the case.
moreover,the complaint alleges that western heritage paid courts and obtained a dismissal against all lazy acres defendants.lazy acres paid nothing to courts.the complaint alleges no facts that show any different result would have been obtained,no matter what tseng did or failed to do.
