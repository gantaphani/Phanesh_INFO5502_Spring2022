emery celli brinckerhoff abady,llp emery,which represented six prevailing plaintiffs in a consolidated lawsuit against libya arising out of the bombing of pan am flight over lockerbie,scotland,appeals from a sealed order of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york platt,ordering it to pay out of the contingency fees it negotiated with its clients a portion consisting of of its clients recovery equivalent to,or per client to the plaintiffs committee appointed by the court to oversee the plaintiffs side of the litigation.emery argues that the district court erred in employing improperly abbreviated procedures to decide the question,committed two prejudicial errors in using letters written by emery and one of its clients to make findings against emery about the value of its lobbying for statutory amendments that were crucial to the recovery,and relied illogically on the fact that other attorneys willingly contributed a similar amount as persuasive evidence that this formula was fair to emery.we agree with emery that the district court made significant errors in justifying its conclusion.accordingly,we vacate the ruling and remand for further proceedings.
background 
on december,a bomb destroyed pan am flight in flight over lockerbie in southern scotland,killing all individuals on board and persons on the ground.survivors of the deceased brought wrongful death actions in various united states district courts against pan am and an affiliate,which provided security services at the originating airport.in april,these cases were consolidated in the eastern district of new york.the court appointed a plaintiffs committee to coordinate and oversee the actions of counsel for the plaintiffs in the consolidated proceedings against pan am and its affiliate pan am plaintiffs committee,with lee kreindler,serving as lead counsel.
on november,based on the findings of an international investigation,criminal charges were filed against three libyan officials,accusing them of involvement in the bombing.while the proceedings against pan am and its affiliate were still pending,two representatives of decedents brought suit against libya in the united states district court for the district of columbia.one of these two lawsuits was filed by emery on behalf of paul hudson.the other was filed by attorneys mark zaid and allan gerson on behalf of bruce smith.both cases were transferred to the eastern district of new york.
because the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia as it existed at the time precluded such suits against sovereign nations,the pan am plaintiffs committee opposed both lawsuits against libya.while the cases were pending,emery client,hudson,began lobbying congress to amend the fsia to allow federal courts to assert jurisdiction over foreign sovereign states for involvement in terrorist acts.hudson coordinated his lobbying with smith and smith attorneys.according to unrebutted evidence,emery,as hudson counsel,participated actively in hudson lobbying effort,assisting hudson with his congressional statements,meeting with members of the clinton administration,preparing legal memoranda,and coordinating with smith attorneys.
the court dismissed the suits against libya for lack of jurisdiction in accordance with the version of the fsia.smith socialist people libyan arab jamahiriya.the judgment of dismissal was then affirmed by this court.smith socialist people libyan arab jamahiriya,cir.however,congress then amended the fsia by providing a terrorism exception to the immunity of a foreign sovereign state.see.as a result,this court issued an order dated february,recalling our mandate and modifying our earlier ruling to allow the district court to entertain the suits against libya.
smith and hudson their complaints against libya.in addition,new suits against libya were filed by other attorneys,including kreindler and other members of the pan am plaintiffs committee,on behalf of representatives of other decedents of flight.emery eventually represented five other plaintiffs,in addition to hudson,in their case against libya and negotiated contingency fee agreements with each client.
the various actions against libya were again consolidated in the eastern district of new york.in june,the district court appointed a plaintiffs committee for the libya action libya plaintiffs committee.this libya plaintiffs committee was also chaired by kreindler and included several other members of the pan am plaintiffs committee.it did not include emery.the members of the libya plaintiffs committee,with one exception,had not assisted with the lobbying for amendment of the fsia.
the libya plaintiffs committee did substantial work on behalf of the class,including successfully defending against defendants motion to dismiss,see rein socialist people libyan arab jamahiriya,aff in part,cir,and negotiating a billion settlement,whereby libya,seeking to end its international isolation,agreed to pay million to the representative of each victim of pan am flight.
ultimately,of the decedents representatives accepted the terms of the settlement agreement.of these parties,were represented by members of the libya plaintiffs committee.the remaining parties were represented by fourteen other by emery.
a dispute then arose between the libya plaintiffs committee and the counsel over whether the committee was entitled to receive a portion of the contingency fees received by the counsel to compensate committee counsel for the work done and expenses incurred on behalf of all plaintiffs.eventually,all counsel except emery agreed to pay the libya plaintiffs committee a portion of the contingency fees they had negotiated with their clients,equivalent to of the total settlement recovery of each client,per client,for the initial million received by each client the libya plaintiffs committee used part of these payments to offset a portion of the common expenses advanced by committee members on behalf of all plaintiffs.it donated the remainder to a nonprofit foundation established in the name of lee kreindler,which has subsequently used its funds to endow a chair in his name at harvard law school and a conference center in his name at dartmouth college.
emery refused to pay a portion of its agreed counsel fee to the libya plaintiffs committee,contending that it was entitled to be compensated by the plaintiffs committee for its own work,which benefitted all the plaintiffs.as justification,emery cited the considerable work that it had done lobbying congress to amend the fsia,which had benefitted all the plaintiffs.emery argued that without this change in law,none of the plaintiffs would have recovered against libya.emery also objected to the use of a share of counsel fees for nonprofit causes unrelated to victims rights and,serving instead to glorify lee kreindler legacy.
the issue was presented to the district court to rule on whether emery should be required to share its negotiated fees with the libya plaintiffs committee.the district court ruled that emery should make the same contribution to the libya plaintiffs committee as made by the other counsel.the court rejected emery argument that it was entitled to credit for the lobbying and legal work it contributed to the common cause of all plaintiffs.the court justified ordering emery contribution to the committee based on the unprecedented magnitude and complexities of the litigation.in rejecting emery argument that it was entitled to credit for its lobbying work,the court relied on two letters a letter sent by hudson to the libya plaintiffs committee,with copy to the court,in which hudson spoke of his own extensive efforts to lobby congress,and a letter sent by emery to the court during the course of settlement discussions over fee allocation,in which emery took the position at the time that a fee contribution to the committee equal to of its clients recovery was reasonable in principle but disagreed over the use of these funds.based in part on adverse findings resulting from the two letters,as well as the willingness of all other counsel to make a fee contribution,the district court ordered emery to pay a contribution to the libya plaintiffs committee equivalent to of libya payment to its clients.the court accordingly ordered that emery contribute to the libya plaintiffs committee payment in the amount of of its clients recovery,which at the time amounted to,or,of emery contingency fees.emery appeals from that decision.
discussion 
a district court ruling concerning the allocation of attorneys fees is reviewed on appeal for abuse of discretion.see,darnet realty assocs.llc owners,cir.appellate courts recognize that the district court,which is intimately familiar with the nuances of the case,is in a far better position to make such decisions than is an appellate court,which must work from a cold record.in re bolar pharm.sec,cir per curiam.
i.the district court conclusion that emery must pay the same contribution as all other counsel 
we find three important deficiencies in the findings of the district court supporting its conclusion that emery,despite its lobbying efforts,should pay the same contribution to the committee as other counsel.the court relied on three erroneous bases a letter written by emery client,paul hudson,used by the court to show that emery did not do significant lobbying work,a letter written by emery to the court for the purpose of settlement negotiations,upon which the court relied to discredit emery objection to the contribution of fees to the committee equal to of its clients total recovery,and the acceptance by other counsel of a fee contribution to the committee equal to of their clients total recovery,used by the court to support its finding that the same contribution was reasonable in emery case.we find that each of these represented an error falling outside the range of the court permissible discretion.
a.the hudson letter 
paul hudson,the legal representative of decedent melina hudson,was himself a lawyer.he retained the emery firm as counsel.on october,during the discussions of the allocation of attorneys fees,hudson sent a letter to kreindler,as chairman of the libya plaintiffs committee,with copy to the court,demanding,among other things,that the committee pay half of his legal fees.in the letter,hudson pointed to his work lobbying for the fsia amendment,the benefit all plaintiffs had derived from it,and the committee initial hindrance of the litigation he initiated against libya.quoting from hudson letter,in which he claimed to have done substantial legal work in lobbying for the legislation,the court concluded,a disinterested view supports the committee position that emery just happened to hitch itself to an enterprising and motivated client with the hope of sharing in his efforts.in other words,the district court concluded on the basis of hudson letter that any beneficial lobbying was done by hudson personally and that his counsel emery had not contributed significantly to the success of the lobbying effort.
this use of hudson letter was impermissible for two reasons.first,the court interpretation was based on a serious misunderstanding of hudson letter,which did not support the conclusion that emery had not performed valuable lobbying.to be sure,hudson letter,designed to claim credit for the lobbying effort,stressed his own contribution,but it did not negate the contribution to the effort by his attorneys.the theory of hudson he was entitled to receive contribution from other plaintiffs and their counsel for his lobbying efforts which brought benefit to all of not depend in any way on whether the lobbying was done by him personally or by the attorneys he hired to assist him.in fact,hudson letter expressly referred,although in passing,to work done by emery in support of the lobbying effort.considering the nature of its message,along with its explicit text,the letter could not logically be understood as a statement by hudson that emery had not contributed valuable services to the lobbying effort.
furthermore,the district court appears to have ignored,without explanation,an affidavit submitted by hudson in support of emery position,in which hudson shared credit with emery for the success of the lobbying effort.hudson expressly asserted that,but for the advocacy and legal services of emery,at a time when the chance of holding libya accountable was minimal,the ultimate success of the cases against libya would not have been realized.he also noted that emery undertook substantial risk and incurred significant costs in seeking to change the law.
second,even if hudson letter had expressly asserted that it was he and not emery who performed the valuable lobbying,so that hudson position in fact had been in conflict with emery assertion that it rendered valuable lobbying services,the court could not simply adopt one of two conflicting adverse assertions of fact to defeat the other without some reason for doing so.where a and b have adverse interests and are in conflict on a question,for a court to say simply that a statement shows that b is wrong,without any reason for preferring a version over b,would be arbitrary and would not satisfy the basic requirements of principled fact finding.
emery settlement letter 
the court also committed a significant legal error in using a concession made by emery for purposes of settlement negotiations as the basis of its finding against emery in violation of.at one point during the settlement negotiations over fee contributions to be made by counsel to committee counsel,emery wrote to the court,though we believe no surcharge is appropriate in this case,the plaintiffs committee proposal to set aside a fee equivalent to per client from committee counsel to establish a charitable foundation to aid the victims of terrorism is acceptable.the letter further stated that the contribution appeared to be eminently reasonable and our firm accepted it in principle,subject to certain other demands which were eventually not met on the basis of that letter,the court found,over emery objection,that emery opposition to the fee contribution was disingenuous.emery protests the court use against emery of a position it took in settlement negotiations,in violation of a fundamental rule,memorialized in,which essentially forbids a court from basing adverse findings on a party concessions in settlement negotiations.see.s tatements made in compromise negotiations regarding the claim are not admissible when offered to prove liability for,or amount of a claim that was disputed as to validity or amount see also jack weinstein margaret berger,weinstein federal evidence joseph mclauglin,ed.rule codifies the axiom in federal courts that compromises proposed are not evidence of an admission of the validity of the claim or the amount of damage.
the court gave two reasons for rejecting emery objection.both reasons were invalid.first,the court reasoned that the rule prohibiting the use of statements made in compromise negotiations did not bar its use of this letter because the letter is drafted to the court and is part of the court record.the fact that emery notified the court of its settlement position did not justify the court use of that information in a manner forbidden by law.courts regularly receive information from the parties,including settlement positions,for use for specified purposes.the fact that a court received a communication from a party does not free the court to use its contents in a manner prohibited by law.if the district court view were correct,parties would act at their peril in revealing their proposed settlement concessions to the court because the court would be free to use those concessions against them in subsequent fact finding.
the district court also reasoned it was free to use emery settlement letter because,under authority of catullo metzner,cir,compromise offers are admissible to demonstrate intent of the parties or to explain an ambiguity in their agreement.the court misunderstood the catullo precedent,which was directed to a very different problem.in that case,the parties had reached an oral settlement of their dispute.when it became necessary to interpret ambiguities of the settlement agreement without a memorializing writing,the court reasoned that the intent of the settlement could be illuminated and its
