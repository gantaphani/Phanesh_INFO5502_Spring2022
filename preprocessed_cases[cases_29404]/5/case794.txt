on september,the republican national committee rnc held a campaign rally at the noelridge park in cedar rapids,iowa,supporting the candidacies of president george bush and other republican candidates for federal and state offices in the november elections.two days prior to the rally,joel miller,the chairman of the linn county democratic party,arranged to hold a protest at the pool house within the park,obtaining permission from the cedar rapids police department to do so.miller sent an email to various registered democrats in eastern iowa,inviting peaceful protestors to come to the pool house and protest president bush visit.america coming together,a political action group,sent a similar email to others including christine nelson,a schoolteacher now retired,inviting her to come to the pool house during the rally to protest the iraq war.nelson decided to attend the rally and invited one of her friends,alice mccabe,a retired schoolteacher,to join her.mccabe accepted the invitation and invited another friend,barb hannon,to join them.the three women agreed to meet with fellow demonstrators near the pool house on the day of the rally.
in preparation for the rally,federal secret service agents implemented security measures to ensure the safety of president bush and other rally attendees.in cooperation with state and local law enforcement officials,the secret service constructed physical barriers between the park and adjoining,imposed restrictions upon entry to the park,and imposed restrictions on vehicular and pedestrian use of adjoining.a parking lot in the southwest corner of the was set up as the secure entrance,with snow fences constructed around the rest of the park.rally attendees could either enter the parking lot on foot or take a shuttle bus into the parking lot,and then pass through metal detectors before entering the park itself.with the exception of law enforcement vehicles,shuttle buses were the only vehicles allowed on street ne,the street bordering the south side of the park.
the restrictions the secret service placed on pedestrian traffic on the roads and sidewalks adjacent to the park generally prohibited people from standing or congregating on the roads or sidewalks so as not to disrupt the flow of shuttle buses or pedestrians into the rally,impede emergency evacuation,or make it more difficult for law enforcement to monitor the crowd for potential threats.members of the general public were not allowed to stop and stand in or around the shuttle bus entrance on the sidewalk of street ne.in addition,only moving pedestrians were allowed on the sidewalk across the street from the park on street ne.
the pool house is on the south edge of the park,flanked by the parking lot to the west and tennis courts to the east.significantly,the secret service designated the pool house as a command center that would be off limits to all but authorized personnel,requiring a change in the protestors plans.the afternoon before the rally,steven,the cedar rapids police officer who had given permission for the protest at the pool house,emailed joel miller to notify him the entire park had been designated a secure area,including the pool house.officer assured miller,however,t here will be a location for your demonstration,and that law enforcement officers would direct demonstrators to a location suitable for the planned protest.the southwest corner of council street ne and street ne was made available as a place for protestors to gather.
nelson,mccabe,and hannon did not learn about the change in plans regarding the pool house.the three women were also unaware of the restrictions on pedestrian traffic on the sidewalks and streets adjacent to the park,because the restrictions were not posted for public view.on the day of the rally,the three women approached the southwest corner of the park on foot,walking on the sidewalk across the street from the park on street ne.mccabe carried an x piece of paper affixed to a small yard sign.the sign said bad war no more and a had a w with a slash through it.nelson and hannon did not have protest signs,but nelson displayed a small button and hannon wore a small kerry button.
still planning to meet other protestors at the pool house,the three women crossed street ne directly south of the tennis courts.they then turned and doubled back,walking westward on the sidewalk,all the while looking for the pool house demonstration and their fellow protesters.hannon got separated from mccabe and nelson when she met an acquaintance the other two women continued walking,finally stopping next to the shuttle bus entrance believing they could meet fellow protestors there.
secret service agent michael parker was posted near the shuttle bus entrance in plainclothes.he saw mccabe standing next to the bus entrance and told her to move off the sidewalk.nelson heard parker as well,and both women moved off the sidewalk and onto the strip of grass between the sidewalk and the street,still standing close to the shuttle bus entrance.after the two women had been standing in this location for several minutes,parker told mccabe to move down the street or across the street.a few other people were near the bus entrance,including a man with a bucket collecting donations on behalf of republicans.mccabe,feeling she was being singled out,asked parker whether he was going to tell everyone else to move as well.parker then radioed for assistance.secret service agent bruce macaulay,also in plainclothes,approached mccabe and nelson and ordered them to move.the two women questioned why they were not permitted to stay where they were.after confronting mccabe three times,macaulay made the decision to arrest the women for trespass if they did not move within thirty seconds.after thirty seconds passed,iowa state troopers rich busch and troy bailey,who along with sergeant jim loveland had also responded to parker request for assistance and had also directed mccabe and nelson to move several times,finally arrested the two women.
after being arrested and charged with simple misdemeanor trespass under iowa law,the two women were taken to the linn county jail.at the jail,despite the fact neither woman was suspected of hiding weapons or contraband and had only been charged with a simple misdemeanor,linn county deputy sheriff michelle mais conducted a full strip search of the two women in violation of jail policy the full strip search required the two women to strip naked and included a visual body cavity search.in a visual body cavity search,detainees must bend over and spread their buttocks and allow an officer to inspect their rectal area.the visual body cavity search also included an inspection of the women vaginas.while nelson was searched,the top half of a dutch door to the room in which the search took place was open,and male jailers passed by the open door during the search.
because the rally organizers had never obtained formal approval from the city of cedar rapids to hold the rally in the park,or to close the adjacent public streets and sidewalks for the exclusive use of the rally there was no lawful basis for the trespass charges against mccabe and nelson.three months after the rally,the linn county attorney dismissed the trespass charges.
mccabe and nelson brought suit in federal district court against a number of federal,state,and county officials,including secret service agents macaulay and parker,iowa state troopers busch and bailey,and linn county jailer michelle mais.the two women asserted various violations of their first and fourth amendment rights arising out of the allegedly unlawful arrest and unlawful strip and body cavity search.mccabe and nelson also alleged a nationwide conspiracy on the part of the bush administration to target and suppress protesters for exercising their first amendment rights to oppose bush policy on the iraq war.
mccabe and nelson sought to add as defendants tom ridge then the secretary of the department of homeland security and ralph basham then the director of the united states secret service for their part in the alleged conspiracy.these two defendants moved to dismiss the claims against them for lack of personal jurisdiction.mccabe and nelson opposed the motion and requested jurisdictional discovery,supporting their response with several newspaper articles and hundreds of pages of internet research showing the existence of a number of lawsuits pending around the united states involving the alleged unlawful arrests of protesters at bush campaign rallies.the district court granted the motion to dismiss ridge and basham without allowing mccabe and nelson to conduct discovery.
most of the claims brought by mccabe and nelson were dismissed prior to trial,including federal tort claims act ftca claims brought directly against the united states.the district court dismissed the ftca claims as a sanction against mccabe and nelson on the grounds they filed an inadequate brief in response to the government motion to dismiss.the iowa state troopers who executed the arrest reached a settlement agreement prior to trial,and testified as witnesses rather than parties.mais,the jailer who conducted the strip and visual body cavity searches,conceded and only contested damages.the district court concluded agent macaulay was not responsible for any damages that arose from the unlawful searches.thus,the only claims that proceeded to trial were the first and fourth amendment claims against agent macaulay arising from the allegedly unlawful arrests,and the damages portion of the fourth amendment claims against mais arising from the strip and visual body cavity searches at the jail.
at trial,mccabe and nelson described the humiliation and trauma they experienced as the result of being forced to stand naked in front of a complete stranger and expose intimate parts of their body.barb hannon bailed the two women out of jail and described them as being in shock.both spent the night crying.when describing the search,mccabe testified she was horrified.she said it was like it was happening to another person,i was almost standing back watching this happen to me,because i just could i could wrap my brain around what was going on.nelson testified she was humiliated,and i felt violated.i felt as though i had lost control of my own body.i could imagine many things that would be worse.nelson was diagnosed with depression following the arrest and search,and obtained medical treatment for her depression.
in answers to special interrogatories,the jury found agent macaulay reasonably believed mccabe and nelson disobeyed a law enforcement officer order to move and the arrests were not motivated by the two women exercise of their first amendment rights based upon the jury answers to the special interrogatories,the district court concluded the arrests were supported by probable cause and dismissed the first and fourth amendment claims against agent macaulay arising from the arrests.
at the close of the plaintiffs case,mais requested that a directed verdict be entered against her on the issue of liability,but argued only nominal damages should be awarded to mccabe on the grounds mccabe had not presented sufficient evidence of emotional distress arising from her unlawful search.the district court entered a directed verdict on the issue of liability,but denied the request for nominal damages against mccabe and allowed the jury to decide the amount of both mccabe and nelson damages arising from the searches.the jury awarded mccabe and nelson in damages.
mais brought a motion for a new trial on the grounds the jury damage award was excessive.the district court granted the motion,concluding the damage award was excessive and shocked the court conscience.the district court gave mccabe and nelson the option of accepting a remittitur in the amount of in lieu of a new trial,which they rejected.mais then made an offer of judgment under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure in the same amount as the district court remittitur,which the two women also rejected.the district court set the date for a second trial just three weeks after granting the motion for a new trial.because of the short notice,mccabe and nelson filed a motion for a continuance setting forth their counsels scheduling conflicts.the district court denied the request for a continuance.in the second trial,the jury awarded in damages to mccabe,and in damages to nelson.mccabe and nelson brought motions following the second trial,which the district court denied.
finally,mccabe and nelson moved for an award of attorney fees as prevailing parties under.as to the fees incurred up to and through the first trial,mccabe and nelson conceded of their total fees should be attributed toward the unsuccessful claims involving their arrests,and argued the remaining should be awarded for their success on the search claims.mais opposed the request,arguing of the total fees should be allocated to the unsuccessful arrest claims,and only to the successful search claims.the district court agreed with mais and awarded of the fees incurred through the first trial.
with respect to the fees incurred during the second trial,the district court awarded out of a requested amount of.the amount awarded by the district court equaled the amount incurred prior to mais rule offer of judgment.the district court denied the request for fees incurred after the rule offer of judgment because the amount awarded by the second jury was less than the offer of judgment.see city of riverside rivera,holding a defendant is not liable for attorney fees which are incurred after a rule offer of judgment where the judgment recovered by the plaintiff is less than the offer.
mccabe and nelson filed timely appeals raising a host of issues with respect to claims dismissed prior to trial,the arrest claims,the unlawful search claims,and the partial award of attorneys fees.
a.the arrest claims 
mccabe and nelson challenge the adverse resolution of the first and fourth amendment claims arising from their arrests.the two women contend the district court erred in dismissing ridge and basham for lack of personal jurisdiction without allowing jurisdictional discovery,erred in sanctioning them by dismissing the ftca claims against the united states,erred in granting summary judgment to two individual secret service agents prior to trial,abused its discretion by refusing to allow state troopers busch and bailey to be treated as adverse witnesses and by preventing the troopers status as settling parties from being introduced into evidence to establish bias,erred in concluding probable cause supported the arrest based upon the jury answers to the special interrogatories,committed instructional error on their first amendment claims,and erred in failing to submit to the jury a conspiracy claim brought pursuant to.
lack of probable cause is a necessary element of all the claims mccabe and nelson brought arising from the allegedly unlawful arrests.see devenpeck alford,a warrantless arrest by a law officer is reasonable under the fourth amendment where there is probable cause to believe that a criminal offense has been or is being committed.williams city of carl junction,missouri,cir holding that a plaintiff asserting a bivens or claim for an alleged unlawful citation arising from the exercise of first amendment rights must plead and prove a lack of probable cause for the underlying charge pursuant to the supreme court decision in hartman moore.as a consequence,most of the challenges to the disposition of specific claims and the defensive arguments advanced by the appellees will be rendered moot if the arrests were supported by probable cause.we therefore focus our attention on the issues related to probable cause.before we do that,however,we must address the evidentiary issues raised by mccabe and nelson with respect to the sequence of events surrounding the arrests,because a change in that evidence may have affected the jury answers to the special interrogatories.
mccabe and nelson raise two evidentiary issues involving the testimony of iowa state troopers busch and bailey with respect to the sequence of events surrounding the arrests.first,they contend the district court should have allowed them to ask leading questions during the troopers direct examinations because they were adverse witnesses,and the district court improperly disrupted the flow of the direct exam with sua sponte comments at a critical juncture.second,they contend the jury should have been told the troopers were defendants who had settled.we review these evidentiary issues under an standard.gill maciej ewski,cir.
the exact location where the two women were arrested was a hotly contested fact at trial.the two women had been instructed by secret service agents and local law enforcement officers to move away from the shuttle bus entrance,and a primary issue for the jury was whether the two women had disobeyed the orders.mccabe and nelson contend they obeyed the request to move by retreating from the park side of street ne,and into or across the street to the south.a video taken by a bystander,and a still photograph reproduced from the video,depict trooper busch holding nelson by the arm after her arrest.significantly,nelson is standing on the south side of the street at the time,and a witness testified the photo shows the location where nelson was arrested.another photo shows mccabe in the middle of the street after her arrest.the photos discredited testimony given by the troopers marking the location of the arrests on the park side of the street.mccabe and nelson further contend the photos conflicted with the troopers testimony that mccabe and nelson could have avoided being arrested if they had just moved south across the street,because the photos showed they already had moved south across the street by the time they were arrested.
mccabe and nelson called the troopers as witnesses in their.during the troopers direct examination,at times when plaintiff counsel was attempting to impeach the troopers regarding the location of the arrests,the district court instructed plaintiff counsel to avoid leading questions and denied counsel request to treat the first testifying trooper bailey as an adverse witness.mccabe and nelson contend these evidentiary rulings were an abuse of discretion and had a substantial impact on the jury answer to the probable cause inquiry.we disagree.
a similar challenge to a district court sua sponte instructions to avoid leading an adverse witness on direct examination was addressed in scenic holding,llc new board of trustees of tabernacle missionary baptist church,cir.scenic holding explained that under federal rule of evidence c t he standard,acceptable,and preferred procedure is to permit counsel to lead an adverse or hostile witness on direct examination but that the rule is permissive and must be read in context with the trial court general authority and discretion to control the conduct of the trial.id.at.the court concluded the impact of the district court sua sponte instructions was minuscule and did not affect the appellant substantial rights.id.we reach the same conclusion here.
a review of the trial transcript indicates plaintiffs counsel was able to adequately present the conflicting testimony regarding the exact location of the arrests,including the discredited testimony given by the two troopers,despite the district court instruction to avoid leading questions during direct examination.significantly,the troopers also testified during agent macaulay,and counsel had a full opportunity to conduct cross examination using leading questions.thus,any limitations placed on the questions during the plaintiffs had little impact on the overall trial.
moreover,even assuming the comments had some impact on counsel ability to discredit the officers regarding the exact location of the arrests,we do not believe the actual location of the arrests is as critical as mccabe and nelson contend.although the two women testified they complied with the requests to move across the street,multiple secret service agents and local law enforcement officers testified both women refused repeated requests to move over an extended period of time,interrupting the officers by claiming other people were not being asked to move and insisting they had a right as taxpayers to be on a public sidewalk.the jury heard all the conflicting evidence on the disputed sequence of events surrounding the arrests,and ultimately decided mccabe and nelson disobeyed a law enforcement officer order to move.in other words,even if the evidence showed mccabe and nelson eventually moved away from the park and across the street before they were actually arrested,the jury was free to decide they had already disobeyed an order to move by then.
mccabe and nelson also complain the district court improperly excluded any reference to their settlement with the troopers or the troopers status as former parties to the lawsuit.while settlement evidence of this type is generally prohibited,settlement evidence can be used to prove a witness bias or prejudice.b see also hennepin county afg,cir.prior to trial and before the troopers settled,mccabe and nelson filed a motion in limine seeking to have all settlement negotiations with the defendants excluded from trial.the district court granted the motion.after settling with the troopers,mccabe and nelson changed course and sought to introduce evidence of the settlement,purportedly to show the troopers bias.the district court declined to change its ruling on the prior motion in limine,ultimately excluding any evidence related to the settlement under federal rule of evidence.see wood.mining,cir indicating evidence may be excluded under rule balancing test even assuming it is relevant and admissible under rule.in this case,counsel was allowed to ask other questions related to the troopers alleged bias,and we perceive no abuse of the district court discretion in excluding the settlement evidence under rule.
we turn next to the probable cause issue.mccabe and nelson challenge the district court conclusion that the jury answers to the special interrogatories support a finding of probable cause as a matter of law.the district court conclusion there was probable cause to support the arrests is reviewed de novo.united states.quiroga,cir see also united states brunette,cir explaining de novo review of probable cause determinations is no different where first amendment concerns may be at issue.
the special interrogatory posed to the jurors asked 
in light of the information available to defendant bruce macaulay at the time of the arrest of plaintiff alice mccabe and christine nelson,did defendant bruce macaulay have a reasonable basis to conclude that plaintiff alice mccabe and christine nelson had disobeyed a law enforcement officer order to move 
app.at.the jury answered yes to this question with respect to both alice mccabe and christine nelson.id.
as noted above,there was no lawful basis for the trespass charges actually brought against mccabe and nelson.that fact has no bearing on whether the arrests comported with the fourth amendment,as long as there was probable cause to believe some criminal offense had been committed.see devenpeck,at indicating an officer subjective reason for making the arrest need not be the criminal offense as to which the known facts provide probable cause.in determining whether probable cause supported an arrest,we consider the totality of the circumstances as set forth in the information available to the officers at the time of the arrest.united states kelly,cir citing illinois gates.furthermore,because agent macaulay is entitled to qualified immunity if he had a mistaken but objectively reasonable belief mccabe and nelson had committed a criminal offense,mccabe and nelson lose even if there was merely arguable probable cause to support the arrests.amrine brooks,cir.
the district court determined the jury answers to the interrogatories supported a finding of probable cause for the arrests under one or more of five separate federal and state statutes,specifically d iowa code.iowa code and iowa code 
we conclude there was arguable probable cause to arrest mccabe and nelson for violating d,which prohibits a person from resisting a federal law enforcement agent who is performing protective services for the president.united states mcpherson,cir unpublished table disposition wl,at affirming the conviction of a woman under d for repeatedly refusing a secret service agent request to move from a restricted area while he was performing protective services for former first lady barbara bush.notwithstanding the secret service failure to publicly post the restrictions on pedestrian traffic on the sidewalks and streets adjacent to the park which was unfortunate,it is clear the area near the shuttle bus entrance had been designated as a restricted area to ensure the safety of the president.mccabe and nelson were in the restricted area,and the jury found that agent macaulay had a reasonable basis to conclude mccabe and nelson had disobeyed a law enforcement officer order to move from the area.the totality of the circumstances present in this case supports a finding of arguable probable cause that the two women violated d 
the remaining challenges to unfavorable rulings on the arrest claims are mooted by the presence of arguable probable cause,including the claim the district court committed instructional error on the first amendment claims.see hartman,at requiring absence of probable cause to be proven as an element of a case williams,at applying hartman to a first amendment claim where the plaintiff alleged he received citations in retaliation for exercising his first amendment rights see also beck city of upland,cir indicating a claim alleging an unlawful arrest in retaliation for exercising first amendment rights can only go forward under hartman if a plaintiff can prove that the officials secured his arrest or prosecution without probable cause and were motivated by retaliation against the plaintiff protected speech emphasis added.
in sum,we find no reversible error with respect to the disposition of the claims mccabe and nelson brought arising from their arrests.
b.the search claims 
mccabe and nelson also raise a number of challenges to the manner in which the search claims were resolved.the two women contend the district court erred in concluding agent macaulay could not be held liable for damages arising from the unlawful strip and visual body cavity search at the jail,abused its discretion in granting the jailer request for a new trial or,in the alternative,requiring them to accept a remittitur in the amount of,abused its discretion by denying their request for a continuance before the second trial,and abused its discretion by refusing to grant their request for a new trial following the second trial.
mccabe and nelson first contend the district court erred in granting summary judgment to agent macaulay on the claim that he,in addition to mais,could be held liable for damages arising from the unlawful search.we review a grant of summary judgment de novo.rand yer song moua,cir.one of the premises for the claim that macaulay could be held liable for the damages the two women suffered at the jail following their arrests is that the arrests themselves violated the fourth amendment.from this premise,mccabe and nelson contend there was a causal link between the unconstitutional arrests and any damages later caused by the unlawful strip and visual body cavity searches.we do not need to address this causation argument,however,because we have already concluded the women arrests did not violate the fourth amendment.because agent macaulay did not commit a constitutional violation in arresting the two women,it necessarily follows that he can not be held liable for any damages arising from the unlawful searches that followed the arrests.
mccabe and nelson next contend the district court abused its discretion in granting mais motion for a new trial on the grounds the damage award was excessive,and in remitting the award to.we review a district court conditional grant of a new trial,and offer of a remittitur,for an abuse of discretion.dominium mgmt,nationwide hous.group,cir.assuming the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting a new trial on the grounds the verdict was excessive,we must also determine the propriety of the amount of the remittitur offered.t he standard we will apply in determining whether there was an abuse of discretion in ordering the remittitur is whether the remittitur was ordered for an amount less than the jury could reasonably find.slatton martin eby const,cir.
mccabe and nelson contend the district court improperly determined the award was excessive.in support of their contention,the two women point to a number of damage awards comparable to or larger than in cases generally involving claims for emotional distress,but not necessarily cases involving unlawful strip and body cavity searches.mccabe and nelson further contend it was improper for the district court to judge the excessiveness of this award by comparing it to damage awards in other cases involving unlawful strip and visual body cavity searches,because we have said comparisons to other jury verdicts are often not particularly helpful in claims involving noneconomic damages.herold burlington,cir.
the district court justified its decision to use a damage comparison approach on the grounds this particular case was a garden variety strip and body cavity search case without any particularly unique or egregious facts.although we have said a damage comparison approach is often not helpful in claims involving noneconomic damages,we have never prohibited the practice.in some cases,where the facts are not easily comparable to the facts of other cases,the use of a damage comparison approach may be an abuse of discretion.we do not,however,believe that to be true here.
mccabe and nelson have not identified any particularly egregious or unique facts which would make this case difficult to compare to the facts of other cases involving an unlawful strip and body cavity search.we do not mean to downplay the emotional distress that arises from being subjected to an unlawful strip and body cavity search.as the district court noted,however,the claims brought by mccabe and nelson were solely for the emotional distress that would naturally arise in every such case.neither mccabe nor nelson presented evidence,for example,regarding lost wages,loss of consortium,or loss of earning capacity.moreover,while nelson offered testimony from a physician regarding the diagnosis of depression and treatment she received following her arrest and the search,mccabe did not we therefore find no abuse of discretion in the district court determination this was a garden variety case,or in its decision to use a damage comparison approach.
likewise,we find no abuse of discretion in the district court determination the damage award was excessive.as the district court further noted,mccabe and nelson were unable to cite to any case in which a court upheld a verdict this large solely for the emotional distress associated with an unlawful strip and body cavity search.as a consequence,we find no reversible error resulting from the district court decision to grant a new trial and offer a remittitur.
having determined there was no abuse of discretion i
