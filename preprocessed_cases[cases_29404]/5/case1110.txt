this appeal arises from a class challenge to the district court final approval of a settlement of the antitrust claims of a certified nationwide class of consumers of department store cosmetics.we must decide two questions.
first,as a matter of first impression,we must decide whether,or under what circumstances,appellate attorney fees are costs on appeal that a district court may require an appellant to secure in a bond ordered under federal rule of appellate procedure rule.we conclude that a district court may require an appellant to secure appellate attorney fees in a rule bond,but only if an applicable statute includes them in its definition of recoverable costs,and only if the appellee is eligible to recover such fees.the provision in section of the clayton act,includes attorney fees in its definition of costs recoverable by a prevailing plaintiff.however,this provision does not authorize taxing attorney fees against a class challenging a settlement in an antitrust suit.therefore,we hold that the district court erred by requiring security in the rule bond for attorney fees as costs taxable under clayton act section.
we further conclude that a district court may not include in a rule bond appellate attorney fees that might be awarded by the court of appeals if that court holds that the appeal is frivolous under federal rule of appellate procedure rule.
second,we must decide whether appellant appeal on the merits should be dismissed for failure to post the bond.in the circumstances of this case,we hold that it should not.
in a separate unpublished memorandum disposition,we reach the merits of the appeal and affirm the district court approval of the settlement.
background 
appellant kamela wilkinson is one of a large number of consumers who bought cosmetics products manufactured and sold by.in july,commenced,on behalf of these consumers,a nationwide,antitrust class action lawsuit in the federal district court for the northern district of california.they alleged that had violated the sherman act and california cartwright and unfair competition acts by enter ing into and engag ing in a contract,combination or conspiracy to fix,raise,and stabilize the prices of department store cosmetics and to limit the supply of department store cosmetics.on march,the district court approved a settlement of all class claims.wilkinson appealed from the final approval order on april.
in july,sought an appeal bond of under rule.this amount included two times their estimate of anticipated appellate costs,not including attorney fees,recoverable under federal rule of appellate procedure rule,appellate attorney fees,interest on the settlement million attorney fees award,and damages resulting from delay.the district court ordered wilkinson to post a bond in the amount of,representing an anticipated in appellate costs taxable under rule and in appellate attorney fees.the district court noted that a split in circuit authority exists regarding whether attorney fees are costs on appeal securable under rule,and that this circuit had not yet addressed this issue.it concluded that the bond could cover appellate attorney fees because the provision in section of the clayton act,defines attorney fees as among the costs recoverable,and the court of appeals was likely to find that the instant appeal was frivolous.
on august,wilkinson tendered to the district court clerk,which was rejected.wilkinson then moved the district court to reduce the bond amount.after the district court denied her motion,she appealed from that order.on september,filed a motion asking us to dismiss wilkinson appeal of final approval of the settlement,based on her failure to pay the rule bond.a motions panel of this court denied the motion on december,with leave to to renew their request for dismissal in their answering brief,which they have done.
ii.discussion 
federal rule of appellate procedure,derived from former federal rule of civil procedure c,provides that the district court may require an appellant to file a bond or provide other security in any form and amount necessary to ensure payment of costs on appeal.fed.wilkinson argues that the phrase costs on appeal does not include attorney fees.contend that costs on appeal includes attorney fees if they are described as costs by an applicable statute or if the appeal is likely to be found frivolous by the court of appeals.

costs on appeal under rule may include attorney fees 
whether attorney fees are part of costs on appeal under rule is a question of first impression in this circuit.six other circuits are split on the question.an older,minority rule,used by the and third circuits and endorsed by the wright,miller cooper treatise,holds that the costs referred to in rule are simply those that may be taxed against an unsuccessful litigant under federal appellate rule,and do not include attorney fees that may be assessed on appeal.in re am.president lines,per curiam footnote omitted see also charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice procedure ed.the more recent,majority rule,adopted by the second,sixth,and eleventh circuits,holds that a district court may order security for appellate attorney fees in a rule bond if they would be treated as recoverable costs under an applicable statute.see in re cardizem cd antitrust litigation,cir pedraza united guaranty,cir adsani,at.finally,the first circuit has held that a district court may require a rule bond covering appellate attorney fees if it concludes that the court of appeals might award attorney fees as costs under rule because the appeal is frivolous.sckolnick harlow,cir per curiam.
the circuit appears to have been the first court of appeals to address the question.in in re american president lines,the district court ordered a rule bond including security for appellate attorney fees.at.the court of appeals remanded to the district court for a statement of its reasons for setting the bond at.id.at.on remand,the district court gave four reasons first,a portion of the bond was proper under rule second,the district court had acted within its inherent or power to require a plaintiff with no assets in the court jurisdiction to post a bond before proceeding with what appears to be a frivolous suit third,the appeal likely would be found to be frivolous under rule and fourth,the appellant failure to pay attorney fees assessed against him in the underlying bankruptcy proceeding increased the need for security on appeal.id.
the circuit rejected each of these reasons and reduced the amount of the bond to the amount of costs recoverable under rule.first,the court concluded,without discussion,that the definition of the term costs on appeal in rule is synonymous with the costs listed in rule.id.therefore,t he costs referred to in rule are simply those that may be taxed against an unsuccessful litigant under rule,and do not include attorneys fees that may be assessed on appeal.id.second,the court rejected the argument that a district court may order payment of attorney fees in an appeal bond under its inherent power,see,observing that such power really adds nothing to the authority already conferred by rule.in re am.president lines,at.third,the court wrote that a bond for attorney fees is not a legitimate means of protecting against the possibility that an appeal might turn out to be frivolous.id.according to the court,this function would be better served by t he traditional countermeasure for an appeal thought to be frivolous a motion to dismiss,which is available at the outset of the appeal and before expenses thereon begin to mount or by a motion for sanctions under rule.id.when a district court requires a bond order that includes attorney fees on the ground of frivolousness,it effectively preempts the circuit court prerogative to determine whether the appellee is entitled to a rule recovery and may impermissibly encumber the right to seek appellate review.id.at.fourth,the court indicated that any concerns about the appellant ability to pay should have been addressed by a supersedeas bond a bond imposed as a condition of staying the execution of a judgment rather than by a rule bond.id.at.
two years later,the first circuit,without discussing in re american president lines or examining the language,purpose,or history of rule,upheld a bond including attorney fees on the ground that the district court implied a view that there was a real possibility the appeal would be found frivolous and sanctions would be ordered under rule.sckolnick,at.
ten years passed before the meaning of costs on appeal again received substantial appellate attention.then,the third circuit,in hirschensohn lawyers title insurance,wl cir.june,an unpublished opinion,approved of the holding of in re american president lines.the court held that the district court erred in requiring security for anticipated appellate attorney fees that might be awarded under a provision in a virgin islands statute.id.at.like the circuit,the court concluded that c osts referred to in rule are those that may be taxed against an unsuccessful litigant under rule,and that attorneys fees are distinct from the costs defined by rule.id.at.according to the court,this approach is consistent with the prevailing american rule under which attorney fees are not recoverable costs.id.at citing roadway express,piper,d.
the court briefly noted marek chesny,d,but did not regard it as controlling.wl,at.marek had not been discussed or cited by either the circuit in in re american president lines or the first circuit in sckolnick.
in marek,the supreme court held that the term costs in federal rule of civil procedure shifts to the offeree all costs incurred subsequent to an offer of judgment if the judgment finally obtained is not more favorable than the attorney fees awardable under,which authorizes the district court to allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney fee as part of the costs.b marek,at.the court observed that,notwithstanding the american rule,b y the time rule was adopted,federal statutes had authorized and defined awards of costs to include attorney fees for more than years.id.at.it concluded that by not defining the term costs,the drafters of rule likely intended to refer to all costs properly awardable under the relevant substantive statute or other authority.id.at.thus,absent congressional expressions to the contrary,where the underlying statute defines costs to include attorney fees,the court was satisfied such fees are to be included as costs for purposes of rule.id.
one year after the third circuit decision in hirschensohn,the second circuit reached the opposite result from the and third circuits,holding that a district court may include security for attorney fees in a rule bond so long as an applicable statute explicitly authorizes attorney fees as part of the costs upon appeal.adsani,at.the district court had ordered the,whose copyright infringement and state law claims had been dismissed,to post a bond under rule that included security for appellate attorney fees that might be awarded under the copyright act.id.at.relying on marek,the court affirmed,holding that rule does not exhaustively define costs on appeal.id.at according to the court,rule does not have a definition of costs any more than,the rule interpreted in marek,had its own definition.id.the court noted that the supreme court in marek had mentioned the copyright act as among the federal statutes that provide for attorney fees as part of the costs.id.at.
in pedraza,the eleventh circuit followed adsani in holding that a rule bond may include appellate attorney fees if they could be recoverable to the appellee under the governing statute.at.the district court had ordered six objectors to a class settlement under the real estate settlement procedures act respa to pay a rule bond,comprised mostly of security for anticipated appellate attorney fees.pedraza,at.the court of appeals agreed with the second circuit analysis in adsani,but concluded that the district court had erred insofar as its bond order rested on respa.id.at.in contrast to the civil rights and copyright provisions at issue in marek and adsani,respa provision does not provide for recovery of attorney fees as part of the costs but instead authorizes award of costs of the action together with reasonable attorneys fees.id.at emphasis in original comparing b and with d.the court pointed to the supreme court statement in marek that where the underlying statute defines costs to include attorney fees they could be included as costs for purposes of rule.id.at quoting marek,at.emphasis added in pedraza.
in young new process steel,lp,cir,the eleventh circuit followed pedraza but reversed a rule bond securing appellate attorney fees ordered against in a civil rights case under b.id.at.although b expressly allows the court to award the prevailing party a reasonable attorney fee as part of the costs,id.at quoting b emphasis added in young,the court held that the bond was improper.id.at.it explained that courts must look beyond the mere fact that a provision defines attorney fees as part of costs,to whether the statute could actually support an award of fees to the appellees.id.at.the court noted that while the language of is itself,the supreme court has restricted the award of attorney fees to defendants under the statute to exceptional cases where the plaintiff action was frivolous,unreasonable,or without foundation.id.at quoting christiansburg garment equal employment opportunity comm n,d.because the district court had not made a determination that the was actually likely to be able to collect attorney fees on appeal under b,the court concluded that the bond order was improper.id.at.
the sixth circuit has recently adopted the reasoning of adsani and pedraza in cardizem,holding that a tennessee statute shifting fees to prevailing defendants supported including attorney fees in a rule bond.at.
we agree with the second,sixth,and eleventh circuits and hold that the term costs on appeal in rule includes all expenses defined as costs by an applicable statute,including attorney fees.we do so for a number of reasons.first,rule does not define costs on appeal.at the time of its adoption in,however,a number of federal the clayton departed from the american rule by defining costs to include attorney fees.marek,at.courts had long awarded appellate attorney fees to prevailing parties under these statutes.see,am.can ladoga canning,cir clayton act section louisville dickerson,cir interstate commerce act.because a gainst this background of varying definitions of costs,rule drafters did not define the term,we conclude that they likely intended it to refer to all costs properly awardable at the conclusion of the appeal,including attorney fees authorized by relevant statutory authority.marek,at.
second,rule does not contain any expression to the contrary.see id.at.there is no indication that the rule drafters intended rule to define costs for purposes of rule or for any other appellate rule.the rules advisory committee note to rule e states that t he costs described in this subdivision are costs of the appeal and,as such,are within the undertaking of the appeal bond.fed.e advisory committee note adoption.we read this language to mean that the costs identified in rule e are among,but not necessarily the only,costs available on appeal.further,rule provides that the court of appeals may award damages and costs,which include,according to that rule advisory committee note,damages,attorney fees and other expenses incurred by an appellee.fed.id.advisory committee note adoption.the discrepancy between the use of the term costs in rule and its use in rule strongly suggests that the rules d
