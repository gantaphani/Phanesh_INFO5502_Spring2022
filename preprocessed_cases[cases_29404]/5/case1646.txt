this is an appeal from an order sustaining the demurrers of squire sanders squire and scott harrington in a by appellant hartford casualty insurance company hartford for reimbursement of allegedly excessive or otherwise inappropriate legal fees and costs billed by squire to hartford.squire served as independent counsel for marketing,noble locks enterprises,jane and robert ratto,lenore and germain demartinis,and penelope kane collectively,insured in a california tort action after hartford disclaimed coverage for the action under the relevant insurance policy.squire also served as counsel for certain of the insured in two actions,and as counsel for the to wit,harrington,wheatland baking,and kane processing,in the california action or one or more of the actions collectively,uninsured.according to hartford,some portion of the fees and costs billed by squire and paid by hartford were for legal services provided to outside the scope of hartford contractual obligations as insurer under the relevant policy.for reasons discussed below,we affirm the order.
factual and procedural background 
this is not the first time this court been called upon to review trial court rulings in this insurance coverage lawsuit.we have twice before decided appeals in this matter.see marketing,hartford cas.ins,nonpub marketing,hartford cas.ins,nonpub.as such,we have already set forth in detail much of the relevant factual and procedural background of this coverage dispute,allowing us,in the name of judicial efficiency,to borrow extensively from our previous opinions for purposes of this appeal.with respect to more recent events,however,we abide by principles requiring us,when reviewing an order on demurrer,to accept as true all factual allegations set forth in the operative complaint.foley interactive data cal d,fn.we thus turn to the relevant facts.
in summer,hartford issued two commercial general liability policies,the first policy to noble locks enterprises,effective july,to july,and the second policy to marketing,effective august,to august,collectively,the marketing and noble locks policies.under these policies,hartford promised to defend and indemnify claims against the named insureds for certain damages subject to various exclusions of coverage.
in september,several individuals,including meir avganim,sued except wheatland baking,and others for intentional misrepresentation,breach of fiduciary duty,unfair competition,restraint of trade,defamation,interference with business relationships,conversion,accounting,mismanagement and conspiracy in marin superior court marin or avganim matter.were subsequently filed by marketing,the rattos,kane and kane processing.the marin matter was immediately tendered to hartford for defense and indemnity under the marketing and noble locks policies.
around the same time,two actions were brought against various of the in courts matters.the complaints in the matters were likewise tendered to hartford for defense and indemnity under the marketing noble locks policies.
in the marin matter,hartford refused to defend or indemnify the named on the ground,among others,that the acts complained of appeared to have occurred before the relevant insurance policy inception date.hartford nonetheless invited them to provide more information should they believe its position to be erroneous.in february,marketing,noble locks enterprises,the rattos,and kane,represented by squire,filed this coverage lawsuit,after which hartford reconsidered its position and,based on newly provided information,agreed in march to provide a defense in the marin matter under the marketing policy subject to a reservation of rights.in doing so,hartford continued to refuse to pay defense costs incurred before january,or to provide the named independent counsel in place of its panel counsel.the named thus moved for summary adjudication on the issue of whether hartford owed them a duty to defend,including a duty to provide independent counsel,from the initial tender of the marin matter in september.the trial court granted their motion on july,finding a legal duty to defend and to fund independent cumis counsel under the marketing policy 
the trial court also granted a subsequent motion by marketing,noble locks enterprises,the rattos,and kane to enforce hartford duty to defend and fund independent counsel under the marketing policy hereinafter,enforcement order.specifically,on september,the trial court ordered hartford to pay the insured outstanding invoices within days and to pay all future reasonable and necessary defense costs within days of receipt.acknowledging a right of reimbursement,the enforcement order provided,t o the extent hartford seeks to challenge fees and costs as unreasonable or unnecessary,it may do so by way of reimbursement after resolution of the avganim matter.american motorists insurance superior court amico th,buss superior court cal th,et 
finally,the order provided that,while squire bills had to be reasonable and necessary,hartford was barred from invoking the protective provisions afforded insurers under civil code section because it has breached and continues to breach its defense obligations by failing to pay all reasonable and necessary defense costs incurred by the insured and by failing to provide cumis counsel.see,stalberg western title ins.d.in so ordering,the trial court expressly reasoned there was no authority for the proposition that once an insurer breaches its duty to defend by refusing to provide cumis counsel,when that insurer is later ordered to provide cumis counsel,and continues to refuse the order,but later agrees to provide that counsel,it can unilaterally take advantage of the rate limitation provision of section.indeed,such an outcome would encourage insurers to reject their cumis obligation for as long as they chose,safe in the notion that they could,at any point,invoke the protection of the statute,effectively forcing their policyholder to transfer the file to yet another law firm whose rates are lower.in this case,the court added,such a result would work an injustice,since hartford has already forced its policyholders to transfer the defense of the avganim matter from squire to hartford panel counsel,only to have it come back again.finally,the court concluded t he province of the court is not to continually monitor the conduct of a breaching insurer to determine at what point it is no longer in breach so that it may benefit from a statute whose protection it previously waived.
this court affirmed both the enforcement order and the underlying summary adjudication order in the aforementioned nonpublished opinion dated november,
on or about october,the marin matter was resolved,including the insured and uninsured,submitted bills to hartford for defense fees and costs totaling over million,which hartford subsequently paid.according to hartford,these defense fees and costs were charged by squire for its legal services as independent counsel for the insured in the marin matter,as well as for its services as counsel for the insured and uninsured in the marin actions.hartford further alleges authorized and ratified each act of legal service rendered by squire on their behalf as counsel in those actions,and did so under the auspices of the enforcement order.
after paying squire invoices,on july,hartford filed the operative in this action,asserting causes of action for reimbursement of monies paid pursuant to the enforcement order,unjust enrichment,accounting and rescission in this,hartford alleges squire submitted improper invoices to hartford under the auspices of the enforcement order,which caused it to pay in excess of million in defense fees and costs.as such,hartford claims a right under the enforcement order to obtain reimbursement of all unreasonable or unnecessary fees and costs billed to and paid by hartford,including those amounts outside the scope of the enforcement order for services rendered a for individuals and entities not insured under the underlying policies b prior to any proper tender to hartford by any individual or entity c for any individual or entity in one of the actions d for prosecution of any affirmative in the marin action e for any individual or entity to the extent such fees or costs are abusive,excessive,unreasonable or unnecessary.
respondents squire and harrington,as well as marketing,the rattos,the demartinis,and kane,thereafter demurred to the operative on the ground that each cause of action fails to allege facts sufficient to state a valid legal claim against any of the named.following a hearing on september,the trial court sustained the demurrer to the unjust enrichment and accounting causes of action without leave to amend as to all and to the reimbursement and rescission causes of action without leave to amend as to respondents squire and harrington.the trial court overruled the demurrer to the reimbursement and rescission causes of action as to marketing,the rattos,the demartinis,and kane.
on december,a judgment of dismissal was thus entered in favor of squire and harrington and against hartford.hartford appeals.
discussion 
hartford raises one primary issue for our review in seeking to overturn the trial court order sustaining without leave to amend the demurrer of respondents squire and harrington does hartford have a right rooted in common law to maintain a direct suit against squire,independent counsel for certain in the marin action,or harrington,an uninsured defendant in the marin action,for reimbursement of excessive or otherwise defense fees and costs for reasons set forth below,we conclude the answer with respect to both respondents is no.

ii.the law governing the relationship among insurer,insured and independent counsel.
under california insurance law,an insurer has the right to control defense and settlement of a third party action against its insured,and to otherwise directly participate in the litigation on the insured behalf,so long as no conflict of interest arises between the insurer and the insured.gafcon,ponsor associates th,gafcon recognizing a fiduciary relationship between an attorney retained by an insurer,on the one hand,and both the insurer and insured,on the other hand,where no conflict of interest exists see also national union fire ins.stites law d,s o long as the interests of the insurer and the insured coincide,they are both the clients of the defense attorney and the defense attorney fiduciary duty runs to both the insurer and the insured.
in this case,however,it is undisputed a conflict of interest between hartford and the insured did in fact arise.as such,a different rule was triggered.specifically,where,as here,the interests of the insurer and the insured no longer align,the insured is entitled under civil code section section to independent counsel at the insurer expense.codifying and clarifying the cumis doctrine,gafcon,supra,th at.although independent counsel owes certain limited duties to the insurer under these circumstances mainly related to sharing nonprivileged information,independent counsel represents the insured alone,subds.d,f.otherwise stated,there is no relationship between cumis counsel and the insurer.assurance of america haven th,assurance.
section also provides certain protections for the insurer.these protections include provisions governing the amount of fees payable to independent counsel,the subject matter of this dispute.for example,the statute limits the rate of fees an insurer may be obligated to pay to the rates which are actually paid by the insurer to attorneys retained by it in the ordinary course of business in the defense of similar actions in the community where the claim arose or is being defended.in addition,the statute mandates that fee disputes shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration by a single neutral arbitrator selected by the parties to the dispute,subd.c.
yet these protective rules come with an important caveat.to take advantage of the provisions of section,an insurer must meet its duty to defend and accept tender of the insured defense,subject to a reservation of rights.atmel paul fire marine d,see also truck ins.exchange superior court th.when,to the contrary,the insurer fails to meet its duty to defend and accept tender,the insurer forfeits the protections of section,including its statutory limitations on independent counsel fee rates and resolution of fee disputes.more generally,w hen an insurer wrongfully refuses to defend,the insured is relieved of his or her obligation to allow the insurer to manage the litigation and may proceed in whatever manner is deemed appropriate.eigner worthington th.see also stalberg western title ins,supra,d at an insurer that wrongfully refuses to defend the insured forfeits its right to control the defense,including its rights to select defense counsel and litigation strategy.
here,undisputedly,hartford failed to meet its duty to defend and accept tender of the defense in the marin matter,thereby,as this court recognized in,forfeiting its right to rely on the statutory protections of section and to otherwise control the defense.see marketing,hartford cas.ins,at.
iii.the right of an insurer to seek reimbursement for defense fees and costs.
does hartford have a right to seek reimbursement from squire 
it is within this context that we are left to consider hartford asserted right to seek reimbursement in a direct suit against squire.in doing so,we first identify two legal principles relevant to any claimed right of reimbursement by an insurer.first,with respect to claims that are at least partially covered under the relevant policy,an insurer duty to defend extends to the insured entire defense cost.buss superior court,supra,cal th at recognizing that insurers contract to pay the entire cost of defending claims buss.and second,with respect to claims not even potentially covered under the relevant policy,an insurer,like hartford,does indeed have a right to seek reimbursement of its cost to defend such claims once the underlying suit has been resolved,buss,supra,cal th at as to the claims that are not even potentially covered,however,the insurer may indeed seek reimbursement for defense costs reliance ins.alan d.however,having acknowledged this right to seek reimbursement as to claims,the question remains against whom may the insurer assert this right.
hartford,in arguing its right to seek reimbursement extends against independent counsel,looks to language in the california case law,including the high court decision in buss,describing the nature of this right as both contractual and under the policy,the insurer does not have a duty to defend the insured as to the claims that are not even potentially covered.with regard to defense costs for these claims,the insurer has not been paid premiums by the insured.it did not bargain to bear these costs.to attempt to shift them would not upset the arrangement.citation.the insurer therefore has a right of reimbursement that is implied in law as,whether or not it has one that is implied in fact in the policy as contractual.fn.omitted.as stated,under the law of restitution such a right runs against the person who benefits from unjust enrichment and in favor of the person who suffers loss thereby.the enrichment of the insured by the insurer through the insurer bearing of defense costs is inconsistent with the insurer freedom under the policy and therefore must be deemed unjust.buss,supra,cal th at italics added see also durell sharp healthcare th,durell where appropriate in cases involving fraud,duress,conversion,or similar conduct,the law will imply a contract or rather,a,without regard to the parties intent,in order to avoid unjust enrichment.
according to hartford,buss and durell stand for the proposition that a right of restitution lies,independent of a contractual relationship,between any person who has suffered loss and the person who has been unjustly enriched thereby.thus,relying on the language,and in particular the language in buss relating to an insurer right to reimbursement for defense costs,hartford argues one step further that insurers are entitled to reimbursement from independent counsel of those costs to prevent counsel unjust enrichment by the insurer.as we will explain,the relevant law and policy both suggest otherwise.
with respect to the law,hartford argument ignores several implications of the important caveat governing restitution claims identified in both buss and durell.according to this caveat,t he fact that one person benefits another is not,by itself,sufficient to require restitution.the person receiving the benefit is required to make restitution only if the circumstances are such that,as between the two individuals,it is unjust for the person to retain it.citation.citation.durell,supra,th at see also buss,supra,cal th at.or,as other courts have expressed,restitution should be required only when it involves no violation or frustration of law or opposition to public policy,either directly or indirectly.county of san bernardino walsh th.peterson cellco partnership,supra,th at.
in this case,important policies to wit,those underlying the enactment of section would indeed be frustrated by allowing hartford to directly sue squire for reimbursement.as explained in great detail above,hartford and squire relationship is governed by the cumis scheme,which envisions an attorney pursing an insured defense independently of the insurer rather than intertwined with it.assurance,supra,th at,fn.thus,under this scheme,where,as here,the insurer breaches its duty to defend the insured,the insurer loses all right to control the defense,including,necessarily,the right to control financial decisions such as the rate paid to independent counsel or the of any particular defense tactic or approach.james truck ins.exchange th,fn th e right to control the defense necessarily encompasses the right to determine what measures are cost effective,bearing in mind liability and indemnity exposure dynamic concepts,truck ins.exchange th,fn.insurers are barred from imposing on the insured counsel discovery or research limitations that would impede counsel professional judgment or otherwise unreasonably interfere with the insured defense.retroactively imposing the insurer choice of fee arrangement for the defense of the insured by means of a suit for reimbursement against the insured separate counsel,such as hartford seeks to pursue here against squire,runs counter to these principles for several reasons by the facts at hand.
recall hartford,an insurer in breach of its duty to defend,chose not to align its interests with the insured for purposes of the marin defense and thereby forfeited all right to control that defense.placed in this position,not hartford,hired squire as independent counsel to represent their interests in the defense,negotiated the relevant fee arrangement with squire,and oversaw all matters of defense strategy including,presumably,deciding with squire the of various litigation pursuits.it is within this context that hartford claims the legal right to bring a reimbursement action against squire for allegedly charging excessive,unreasonable or unnecessary fees for their provision of legal services in the name of defense.we think not.as set forth above,it is clear california law bars an insurer,like hartford,in breach of its duty to defend from thereafter imposing on its insured its own choice of defense counsel,fee arrangement or strategy.this court now takes the law one slight step further by holding hartford likewise barred from later maintaining a direct suit against independent counsel for reimbursement of fees and costs charged by such counsel for crafting and mounting the insureds defense where hartford considers those fees unreasonable or unnecessary.
to hold otherwise would effectively afford the insurer that has waived the protections of section through its own wrongdoing more rights in a fee dispute with independent counsel than the insurer that has not waived such protections.specifically,while the insurer in compliance with its duty to defend would be limited under section to arbitrating a fee dispute,the insurer in breach of its duty could bring the fee dispute to court the law does not sanction this inequitable result.see comunale traders general ins.cal d,certainly an insurer who wrongfully refused to defend should be in no better position than if it had assumed the defense the housing group pma capital ins.th,rejecting the position that insurers always can take advantage of despite immediately failing to meet their burden to defend because it would encourage insurers to reject their cumis obligations for as long as they chose because they knew they could invoke the limitations and remedies of section at any time.
indeed,by providing legal services to,squire did not confer any benefit upon hartford.rather,squire conferred a benefit on its clients to wit.that hartford paid squire for those services does not change this fact.there simply is no legal basis here for the restitution claim that hartford has asserted against squire.here,it is the insured cross defendants rather than independent counsel that the insurer should look to for reimbursement if it believes the fees were incurred to defend claims that were not covered by the insurer policies or that the insured agreed to pay squire more than was reasonable for the services that squire performed.
finally,we add that our holding in this regard is actually quite limited.given the precise issue raised by the parties to this appeal,we have no reason to,and do not,take a position as to whether an insurer would have the right to maintain a direct suit against independent counsel for fraudulent billing practices in connection with the underlying defense of its insured.caiafa law state farm fire cas.th,pointing out that if the only issue in dispute truly was the amount of cumis counsel fees the insurance company owed,it would be improper,in most circumstances at least,for a trial court to stay the arbitration proceeding mandated under section in order to allow a judicial proceeding in the california courts to decide that issue and that issue alone fireman fund ins.companies younesi th,where an insurer sued its insured cumis counsel for fraudulent billing practices,the appellate court affirmed an order denying counsel motion to compel arbitration under section,subd.c,holding the language of section,subd.c can only be interpreted to limit the scope of arbitrable disputes to those in which only the amount of legal fees or the hourly billing rates are at issue.
thus,for all the reasons stated,we conclude that,where a conflict arises with respect to defense fees or costs paid by an insurer in breach of its duty to defend to the independent counsel hired by its insured following this breach,the insurer must look to the insured,not independent counsel,to resolve the conflict 
does hartford have a right to seek reimbursement from harrington 
finally,we address hartford contention the trial court erred by sustaining the demurrer to its reimbursement cause of action as to respondent harrington,an individual named as a defendant in the marin matter but not insured by hartford in seeking reimbursement from harrington,hartford raises one argument in its opening brief without any citation to legal authority or to the factual record hartford claims simply that it has a right to restitution from harrington because he was unjustly enriched by receiving
