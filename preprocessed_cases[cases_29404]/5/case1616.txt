plaintiff cb richard ellis,cbre,citing a listing agreement,sought a commission after the sale of acres of land in murrieta,california the property.arbitration proceedings between cbre and the seller,jefferson,llc jefferson,resulted in a confirmed arbitral award in cbre favor,but no monetary satisfaction for cbre because jefferson had no assets by the time of the arbitral award and judgment.
this action represents cbre attempt to recover damages from jefferson individual members.a jury trial resulted in a judgment in favor of cbre both defendants and cbre appeal the judgment,citing alleged errors pertaining to jury instructions,the admissibility of evidence,juror misconduct,attorney fees,and prejudgment interest.we reject the parties contentions,except with regard to cbre entitlement to attorney fees.
in march of,cbre and jefferson signed an exclusive sales listing agreement for the property.cbre agreed to use its best efforts to effect a sale of the property within the term of the listing agreement.subject to certain exclusions,jefferson agreed to pay a sales commission of percent of the gross sales price for any sale completed within the term of the listing agreement.utilizing its expertise and contacts,cbre sought a buyer for the property.
on september,covenant development,covenant,through its agent david stolte of nai capital,transmitted a letter of intent to jefferson to purchase the property for million.jefferson directly responded to stolte the next day with a counteroffer of million.before this exchange of letters,an individual representing jefferson told stolte that jefferson had fired cbre because they had not moved the sale forward fast enough.
meanwhile,cbre continued to market the property.on november,cbre contacted a jefferson representative regarding additional potential buyers.jefferson responded with a letter the next day,stating jefferson position that the listing agreement expired six months from its march,listing date.jefferson acknowledged a pending letter of intent identifying walmart as a prospective buyer,a deal that would result in a commission for cbre.but jefferson otherwise expressed its dissatisfaction with cbre performance,which according to the letter led jefferson to allow the listing agreement to expire.cbre claims the term of the listing agreement was actually one year,plus applicable extensions based on the circumstances of the sale there is no evidence cbre took action to insert themselves into the negotiations between jefferson and covenant.
in a transaction between jefferson and an entity to which covenant assigned its interests,the sale of the property eventually closed on july,for a gross sales price of.escrow would have closed sooner but for two extensions requested and paid for by covenant.nai capital the buyer agent received a commission payment of,percent of the gross sales price out of an aggregate commission of,percent of the gross sales price the other half of the commission was paid to james grattan associates,which was designated as the seller agent.roy matthew haskin a defendant and judgment debtor worked for james grattan associates and began representing jefferson as the seller agent right around the same time covenant submitted its offer.roy matthew haskin personally received for his services.cbre did not receive a commission.there is no evidence cbre attempted to make a claim upon the funds deposited into escrow.
on july,was transferred into jefferson bank account as a result of the close of escrow.the next day,jefferson transferred all but out of its account.this money was ultimately transferred in varying amounts to defendants and others.there is no evidence cbre made a claim upon jefferson at this time or otherwise attempted to interfere with the distribution of funds.
in july,cbre initiated arbitration against jefferson in accordance with a clause in the listing agreement.cbre was apparently unsuccessful in its attempt to add four individuals to the arbitration who are now defendants and appellants roy randall haskin,roy matthew haskin,jack dilemme,and hanan haskell.the arbitration eventually proceeded as a default hearing because jefferson did not and claimed it could not comply with its obligation to pay required deposits.the arbitrator issued a award in favor of cbre,comprised of a percent commission,interest,and attorney fees and costs.the arbitration award was confirmed and judgment entered in the amount of by the los angeles superior court,a judgment affirmed on appeal.cb richard ellis,jefferson,llc,nonpub.opn.
in june,cbre filed a complaint for breach of written contract and prohibited distributions in the instant case against defendants,the alleged individual members of jefferson.a jury trial commenced in july.by way of a special verdict,the jury found that cbre and jefferson entered into a contract,cbre performed its contract obligations,all the conditions occurred that were required for jefferson performance,jefferson failed to perform,and cbre was harmed in the amount of by that failure to perform.the jury also found the dissolution of jefferson occurred and jefferson made a distribution to its members upon dissolution.in separate special verdicts,the jury found each of the defendants were members of jefferson,then specified the amount distributed to each of these defendants upon the dissolution of jefferson 
the court entered judgment in accordance with the special verdicts,awarding to cbre and against defendants jointly and severally up to their individual limit as established by the jury determination of the amount distributed to each defendant upon dissolution.the court denied cbre posttrial motions for attorney fees and prejudgment interest,as well as defendants motions for a new trial and judgment notwithstanding the verdict.
discussion 
defendants appeal 
defendants do not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence with regard to any of the jury factual findings,jefferson breach of contract,cbre damages,defendants membership in jefferson,or the amount distributed to each defendant upon jefferson dissolution.instead,defendants claim they are entitled to a new trial based on instructional error,evidentiary error,and juror misconduct.
instruction of jury regarding dissolution of limited liability companies 
in general,members of a limited liability company are not liable for the debts,obligations,or other liabilities of the limited liability company,subd a see id.subds.b e identifying ways in which members can be held liable,including alter ego liability,a member participation in tortious conduct,and a member explicitly agreeing to personal liability for particular obligations.
cbre successfully argued that defendants should be held liable for jefferson breach of contract in failing to pay cbre a commission.part of cbre case involved proving jefferson was a dissolved limited liability company,which lacked the ability to pay cbre as a result of its distribution of assets to its members without reserving sufficient funds to pay cbre.former sections to and current to address the dissolution of limited liability companies and related issues.see kwok transnation title ins.th.
after dissolution,t he dissolved company continues to exist for the purpose of winding up its affairs,prosecuting and defending actions by or against it in order to collect and discharge obligations,disposing of and conveying its property,and collecting and dividing its assets.citation.after all known debts and liabilities of the company have been paid or adequately provided for,any remaining assets are distributed among the members according to their respective rights and preferences.citation.a certificate of cancellation of the company may then be filed with the secretary of state.kwok transnation title ins,supra,th at.
cbre brought its first cause of action for breach of contract against defendants pursuant to former section,subdivision a which provided in relevant part causes of action against a dissolved limited liability company,whether arising before or after the dissolution of the limited liability company,may be enforced against any of the following a against the dissolved limited liability company,to the extent of its undistributed assets b if any of the assets of the dissolved limited liability company have been distributed to members,against members of the dissolved limited liability company to the extent of the limited liability company assets distributed to them upon dissolution of the limited liability company.
thus,key issues in the case include when jefferson dissolved and whether assets were distributed to defendants by jefferson upon dissolution.the court over defendants objection instructed the jury with cbre requested special instruction as follows dissolution of a limited liability company occurs when it ceases operating in the ordinary course of its business,with the intention,on the part of its members,not to resume the ordinary course of its business.dissolution of a limited liability company is not the same as cessation of all business activity.a limited liability company may continue to do business after it has dissolved for the purpose of winding up its affairs,paying its creditors and distributing its remaining assets.in determining whether a dissolution of jefferson occurred,you may consider all evidence bearing on that issue,including for example,the ordinary business of the limited liability company,the assets of the limited liability company both before and after a distribution,the continuation of the ordinary business and the cessation of its ordinary business activities.
essentially,to avoid conditioning relief to cbre on the precise date of formal dissolution,special instruction utilizes the concept of de facto dissolution,the notion that dissolution can occur although the formalities of corporate dissolution were not completed.central coast baptist first baptist church of las lomas th,see hentschel fidelity deposit cir,a de facto dissolution means that a dissolution has in circumstances and in fact taken place,as where the corporation by reason of insolvency,or other reason,suspends all its obligations and goes into liquidation without having technically availed itself of statutory procedure provided for that purpose.
applying this instruction,the jury concluded that jefferson dissolved and defendants received distributions upon dissolution,presumably based on undisputed evidence that jefferson only substantial asset was the property,the proceeds of the july sale of the property were distributed immediately after the sale,jefferson conducted no substantial business after the close of escrow,and jefferson filed a certificate of cancellation with the california secretary of state on february,signed february by hanan haskell and roy randall haskin indicating jefferson had been dissolved in a vote by all of its members.
defendants contend special instruction incorrectly states the law.the court rejected defendants proposed special instruction on the issue,which tracked nearly word for word former section defendants position is that the jury should have been limited to inquiring whether one of the three preconditions to dissolution as stated in former,an occurrence specified in the governing documents,a majority vote of the members to dissolve,or a judicial dissolution decree had happened before distribution to defendants.according to defendants,the jury can not be allowed to determine the date of dissolution by conducting a inquiry into when a limited liability company ceases to operate in the ordinary course of business.thus,defendants posit,so long as the distribution of funds to members comes before the de jure dissolution of a limited liability company,the distribution was not upon dissolution.bacarella transp.services,right way logistics,llc d,granting summary judgment in favor of members because limited liability company was not dissolved at time of lawsuit.by limiting dissolution to the specified statutory preconditions,defendants seek to prohibit the application of former section when the distribution precedes,as relevant here,the vote of the members to dissolve the limited liability company.
it is unclear whether the legislature intended former section to preclude a determination for purposes of an action pursuant to former or otherwise that a limited liability company dissolved prior to the date of any of the three circumstances specified.certainly,the plain language of the statute does not explicitly preclude that possibility.the statute does not say there are no other potential causes of dissolution.nor does the statute indicate that satisfaction of one of the three statutory events is the exclusive determinant of dissolution.pertinent legislative history likewise does not provide an answer to this question.
to break this interpretive logjam,we interpret former section in light of the purposes of the entire statutory scheme,and in particular the purpose of section,subdivision a.it is that former section,subdivision a,was designed to prevent the unjust enrichment of members of limited liability companies,when such members have received assets the dissolved company needs to pay creditors.see gottlieb kest th,former simply creates an enforcement mechanism so that company liabilities can be recovered out of distributed assets it compel s a member to return distributed assets.other sections contemplate that limited liability companies will not distribute funds to members without reserving sufficient assets to pay debts and liabilities.former.if defendants interpretation of the statutory scheme were correct,companies and their members could avoid the force of former section,subdivision a b,by the simple expedient of transferring assets out of the company the day before voting to dissolve.on the other hand,cbre interpretation of former section allows for a jury to find that the company had actually dissolved at the time of the distribution,based on the reality of the company finances and operations.
we agree with cbre and hold that the jury was correctly instructed.de facto dissolution is an acceptable predicate to a claim under former section,subdivision a b.
admissibility of arbitration award at trial 
denying a motion in limine and overruling repeated objections by defendants,the court authorized the admission of evidence pertaining to the arbitral award against jefferson,including exhibit,a copy of the arbitral award.defendants contend the court erred because this evidence supposedly allowed the jury to review,weigh,and be influenced by the arbitrator reasoning and factual determinations,which goes well beyond the permissible scope of judicial review of arbitration awards.the jury was to determine the facts based on the relevant evidence presented at trial,not based on an arbitrator determination of facts 
relevant evidence means evidence having any tendency in reason to prove or disprove any disputed fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action.no evidence is admissible except relevant evidence.except as otherwise provided by statute,all relevant evidence is admissible.the court in its discretion may exclude evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its admission will a necessitate undue consumption of time or b create substantial danger of undue prejudice,of confusing the issues,or of misleading the jury.
we review the court ruling as to the admissibility of evidence for an abuse of discretion.pannu land rover north america,th.while the concept abuse of discretion is not easily susceptible to precise definition,the appropriate test has been enunciated in terms of whether or not the trial court exceeded the bounds of reason,all of the circumstances before it being considered gouskos aptos village garage,th.
the court explained its reasoning when it denied defendants motion in limine i think the award is relevant.i think this lawsuit makes no sense unless the jury knows how they got here.just reality people need to put things in context.whether or not the defendants are liable,that partly what they decide,but the fact that jefferson has an award against it matters,and a lot does make sense without that knowledge.i familiar with it,and your case would make no sense to me without that knowledge.i have to assume that jurors,being normal people,would come to it with that same perspective,why am i here,what the lawsuit about.so i would be inclined to allow it 
the court erred by admitting the entire arbitral award,complete with the arbitrator factual findings and reasoning.as the court recognized,the arbitral award could not collaterally estop defendants.see vandenberg superior court cal th,gottlieb kest,supra,th at former,subds.a,b does not permit a court to declare a member personally liable for fraud based solely on a judgment against the company.and,as explained above,jefferson individual members can not be held to account for jefferson liabilities as a matter of course,subd.a.cbre needed to prove its breach of contract action at trial on the merits against defendants.to the extent the jury needed background information concerning the arbitration to make sense of the case,the information could have been provided to the jury without revealing the arbitrator factual findings and legal reasoning 
but n o form of civil trial error justifies reversal and retrial,with its attendant expense and possible loss of witnesses,where in light of the entire record,there was no actual prejudice to the appealing party.citation.accordingly,errors in civil trials require that we examine each individual case to determine whether prejudice actually occurred in light of the entire record.cassim allstate ins.cal th,see,subd.b no reversal of judgment based on erroneous admission of evidence unless it resulted in a miscarriage of justice.to establish prejudice based on the wrongful admission of evidence,an appellant must show a reasonable probability exists that,in the absence of the error,he or she would have obtained a more favorable result.people ex rel.city of santa monica gabriel th.
o ur duty to examine the entire cause arises when and only when the appellant has fulfilled his duty to tender a proper prejudice argument.because of the need to consider the particulars of a given case,rather than the type of error,the appellant bears the duty of spelling out in his brief exactly how the error caused a miscarriage of justice.paterno state of california th.defendants briefs are entirely silent on the question of prejudice and defendants appeal of this issue must therefore be deemed forfeited see people ex rel.city of santa monica gabriel,supra,th at.
even if we were to overlook defendants forfeiture and conduct a prejudicial error review without the benefit of briefing,we would conclude based on our review of the record that there is not a reasonable probability defendants would have obtained a more favorable result had the arbitration award been excluded from evidence.for one,the award is terse and conclusory and deals largely with the procedural history of the arbitration.it does not wrestle with the factual complexities introduced at trial because it was a default proceeding.second,cbre did not ask the jury to defer to the arbitrator findings.cbre counsel stated in closing argument,i not suggesting that the arbitrator is taking over your position.you going to independently determine the evidence as it in here.finally,the jury did not simply adopt the arbitrator view of the case.recognizing the need to pay the buyer agent,the jury awarded only percent of the purchase price as damages to cbre rather than the full percent commission set forth in the listing agreement and awarded by the arbitrator,alongside interest,attorney fees,and costs.
alleged juror misconduct 
defendants also claim they are entitled to a new trial based on alleged juror misconduct.on appeal,defendants assertion is limited to the accusation leveled by two jurors in posttrial declarations that a third juror referred to as juror b said,at least three times during deliberations,that if he could only tell them what he knew about these defendants and the ranch,the jury would see how these people are guilty,guilty,guilty.these declarations were very brief,consisting of a few sentences of information.
cbre responded with a lengthier declaration from juror b,which unequivocally denied any pretrial knowledge of or connection with the parties or the dispute at issue.juror b denied conducting any independent research regarding the parties,attorneys,or dispute.juror b attested,at no time during the jury deliberations did i state to other jurors that i knew or knew of the defendants or the ranch and at no time did i ever state or suggest that i had any knowledge indicating the guilt or liability of any of the defendants outside of the evidence.during the nearly two weeks of deliberations and extensive discussions with all jurors of the evidence,i did state to the other jurors that,based on all of the evidence presented,i believed that the defendants were liable to plaintiff 
the court denied defendants motion for new trial,observing that the two declarations supporting an inference of misconduct were conclusory and not credible,while juror b declaration was detailed,more convincing,and most credible.
we review the court denial of defendants motion for a new trial for an abuse of discretion.abf capital berglass th.in determining whether misconduct occurred,we defer to the trial court findings of historical fact and credibility determinations if they are supported by substantial evidence.citations.whether a prospective juror failed to disclose relevant information or answered falsely and whether he or she did so intentionally are questions of fact for the trial court to decide.ovando county of los angeles th.
here,there is substantial evidence supporting the court conclusion that no misconduct occurred juror b thorough declaration denying he had preexisting knowledge concerning defendants or that he uttered the alleged improper statement.the court explicitly rejected the credibility of the other two jurors based on their brief,conclusory declarations.that is the end of our inquiry there is no need to decide whether the court should have granted a new trial had it found juror b actually said what he was accused of saying 
cbre limits its appeal to the court denial of cbre posttrial motions for attorney fees and prejudgment interest.
attorney fees 
the court denied cbre motion for attorney fees on the ground that such an award was not authorized as a matter of law thus,our review is de novo.conservatorship of whitley cal th.unless authorized by either statute or agreement,attorney fees ordinarily are not recoverable as costs.reynolds metals alperson cal d,reynolds.
cbre claims attorney fees are authorized by the listing agreement which was signed by jefferson,not defendants in conjunction with cbre statutory basis for recovery against defendants,jefferson members.we agree with cbre position and therefore reverse the court order denying the recovery of attorney fees.
former section,subdivision a b,provides causes of action against a dissolved limited liability company may be enforced against any of the following b if any of the assets of the dissolved limited liability company have been distributed to members,against members of the dissolved limited liability company to the extent of the limited liability company assets distributed to them upon dissolution of the limited liability company.
the statute explicitly authorizes cbre to enforce its breach of contract cause of action against defendants.thus,subject to the limitation that they can not be held liable beyond the amount they were distributed upon dissolution,jefferson members were deemed to be statutory parties to the contract with cbre by reason of the jury findings pertaining to jefferson dissolution.the obvious purpose behind this statute is to dissuade limited liability companies from distributing funds to its members without paying creditors or reserving sufficient funds to pay contingent claims during the winding up process.because cbre could recover attorney fees pursuant to the listing agreement against jefferson,former section likewise authorizes the recovery of attorney fees against defendants,jefferson members,so long as the total recovery against any individual member does not exceed that member distribution upon dissolution.allowing defendants to escape payment of attorney fees would only encourage abuses by limited liability companies seeking to avoid the payment of attorney fees when there are disputed creditor claims.
our statutory analysis is buttressed by reynolds,supra,cal d.in reynolds,our supreme court addressed whether nonsignatories to a contract can share the benefits and burdens of a prevailing party attorney fees clause.the plaintiff a supplier sued the defendants shareholders and directors of a bankrupt corporation supplied by the plaintiff on an alter ego theory.id.at.the trial court rejected the alter ego theory and awarded attorney fees to the shareholder defendants,based on a contract signed by the bankrupt corporation.ibid.highlighting the policy of reciprocity established in civil code section the reynolds court affirmed the award.reynolds,at.its purposes require section be interpreted to further provide a reciprocal remedy for a nonsignatory defendant,sued on a contract as if he were a party to it,when a plaintiff would clearly be entitled to attorney fees should he prevail in enforcing the contractual obligation against the defendant.id.at.reynolds concluded that the shareholder defendants must be entitled to recover attorney fees because if they had lost,they clearly would have been held liable for the supplier attorney fees as the alter egos of the bankrupt corporation.id.at see also pueblo radiology medical group,gerlach th,applying reynolds.
this is not an alter ego case.but the statutory remedy provided by former section is similar to alter ego doctrine in that it prohibits investors from inequitably leaving creditors high and dry with an empty judgment against an insolvent entity.likewise,had defendants prevailed on the merits in this action,cbre should not have been able to disclaim its contractual obligation to pay attorney fees for an unsuccessful attempt to enforce the listing agreement.in sum,cbre is entitled to an award of reasonable attorney fees as the prevailing party in this civil litigation.
we disagree,however,with cbre contention that it should be allowed to recover the attorney fees it incurred when it arbitrated its breach of contract claim with jefferson.defendants are simply not liable for any aspect of the arbitral judgment,whether for damages,attorney fees,costs,or interest.former section does not hold members liable for judgments entered against a dissolved limited liability company.instead,it authorizes third parties to enforce against members of a dissolved limited liability company the causes of action that ordinarily would be brought against the limited liability company.
prejudgment interest 
finally,cbre asserts the court erred by not awarding prejudgment interest.a person who is entitled to recover damages certain,or capable of being made certain by calculation,and the right to recover which is vested in the person upon a particular day,is entitled also to recover interest thereon from that day,subd.a.under section,subdivision a,the court has no discretion,but must award prejudgment interest upon request,from the first day there exists both a breach and a liquidated claim.citation.courts generally apply a liberal construction in determining whether a claim is certain,or liquidated.citation.the test for determining certainty is whether the defendant knew the amount of damages owed to the claimant or could have computed that amount from reasonably available information.citation.uncertainty as to liability is irrelevant citation.the certainty required by section,subdivision a,is not lost when the existence of liability turns on disputed facts but only when the amount of damages turns on disputed facts.citation.moreover,only the claimant damages themselves must be certain.damages are not made uncertain by the existence of unliquidated counterclaims or offsets interposed by the defendant.howard american national fire ins.th.
cbre claimed it was owed a commission on the million sales price as of the date of the close of escrow.the jury awarded in damages,which represents percent of the sales price.this damage award is the same amount as was paid to each of the two brokers participating at the july escrow.with just these facts in mind,cbre claim for prejudgment interest looks like a slam dunk.see martin ede cal,prejudgment interest awarded on broker commission,which was capable of being made certain by computation.
additional facts complicate the picture,however.the listing agreement required payment of a percent commission to cbre not percent.although the listing agreement authorized cbre to share the commission with a buyer agent,it did not specify that the split would necessarily be equal.testimony suggested commissions usually are split in this fashion,but not in all cases.in cbre initial arbitration filings against jefferson,it requested on july,then on july.cbre obtained a judgment of including damages,attorney fees,interest,and costs against jefferson as a result of the confirmed arbitral award.cbre complaint requested the same in damages against defendants,which included but was not limited to a commission,percent of the sales price.see wisper california commerce bank th,the greater the disparity between the complaint and the damages,the less likely prejudgment interest is appropriate.there is no evidence cbre demanded at any time before trial that defendants pay or even to satisfy cbre claim.
on appeal,cbre acknowledges there were at least two possible damage awards percent or percent.but cbre argues the jury selection of the lower figure represents an offset,which should not affect cbre right to prejudgment interest.indeed,some of the defendants pleaded offset as an affirmative defense,claiming cbre would be required to share any commission with cooperating brokers.
this is a difficult issue.had cbre consistently requested and advocated for a commission of,it would have been entitled to prejudgment interest.but under the specific circumstances of this case,damages were uncertain and unliquidated.the jury was instructed with a modified version of caci,which pertains to contract damages the jury was tasked with determining the harm suffered by cbre as a result of any breach by jefferson that might have occurred.the jury was not instructed to consider the effect of cooperating broker commissions as an affirmative defense or offset.in closing argument,cbre counsel stated damages amounted to percent of the sales price over.neither defense counsel argued in their closing arguments for to be awarded because of the need to pay a buyer agent commission.neither defense attorney mentioned the issue of damages,preferring to argue there was no liability for a number of reasons.
during its deliberations,the jury indicated in four questions that it was struggling with the issue of damages,in particular the question of whether cbre was harmed in the amount of a percent commission or a percent commission counsel for both sides agreed the question of damages,in particular the question of percent versus percent,was a factual dispute.substantial evidence would support either award,as it was unclear whether cbre would have been able to secure the entire percent commission had jefferson not breached the listing agreement.substantial evidence might also support an award of damages other than the two options focused on by the jury,on the theory that a percent buyer commission is not set in stone.the court invited counsel to address the jury.interestingly,at this late stage,defense counsel argued that the correct amount of damages would be.one might speculate this was simply a misstatement or miscalculation,but it is nonetheless fitting that,to the end of the trial,the supposedly clear,liquidated number was not being used by either party.
based on all the foregoing circumstances,we conclude damages were unliquidated and uncertain.cbre was not entitled to prejudgment interest under civil code section,subdivision a.
disposition 
the postjudgment order denying cbre motion for attorney fees is reversed and the matter is remanded for a new hearing as to the amount of attorney fees.the judgment and accompanying postjudgment order denying recovery of prejud
