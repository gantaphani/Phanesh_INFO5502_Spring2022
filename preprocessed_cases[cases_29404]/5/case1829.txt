william alnor appeals from a postjudgment order awarding him in attorney fees as the prevailing defendant on his motion to strike alnor contends his counsel reasonably expended more than hours on the motion and the ensuing appeal,but the trial court disagreed,reducing the compensable attorney time to just hours.substantial evidence supports the trial court conclusion counsel leavened the fee request with noncompensable hours and vague,indecipherable billing statements,destroying the credibility of the submission and therefore justifying a severe reduction.we may not reweigh the trial court implicit credibility determination,and we therefore affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
following a successful appeal in which we overturned,by a decision,the trial court denial of his motion to strike,alnor filed a motion in the trial court to recover his costs and attorney fees under subdivision c of the statute.section,subdivision c,provides in any action subject to an motion,a prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike shall be entitled to recover his or her attorney fees and costs.if the court finds that a special motion to strike is frivolous or is solely intended to cause unnecessary delay,the court shall award costs and reasonable attorney fees to a plaintiff prevailing on the motion,pursuant to s ection.
alnor submitted billing statements and attorney declarations claiming his counsel worked hours on the motion to strike and the appeal.according to the records,counsel dedicated hours to the pretrial motion and the rest,approximately hours,to the appeal.
the trial court provided a tentative decision in which the court awarded alnor in attorney fees and in costs.the trial court observed while the court is required to award attorney fees to the prevailing defendant after a slapp motion,the court is only required to award reasonable attorney fees.the court finds that the moving party claim for over hours of time by attorneys for total attorney fees of over is excessive.while slapp motions are generally difficult,this one was not particularly complex.there was only one cause of action for defamation.the plaintiff conceded the first prong of the two prong test.thus,the only issue was whether plaintiff met its burden of showing a probability of success.this issue was narrowed further,focusing on the question of malice and the applicable standard.the court found that much of the work done by the different lawyers was duplicative and unnecessary.the court found that the use of block billing obscured the nature of some of the work claimed.much of the work claimed also appeared more related to preparing the case for trial rather th a n advancing the motion 
at the hearing on the motion,the trial court again noted that t his was a single slapp motion on a single issue and you claimed attorney fees of over hours,more than,with five attorneys working on this motion.the court added,i just do think that appropriate,but i listen to what you have to say.unpersuaded by counsel argument,the court awarded counsel in attorney fees,based on hours for the motion,hours for the appeal,and hours of attorney time for the fee motion.alnor now appeals.

as the moving party,the prevailing defendant seeking fees and costs bear s the burden of establishing entitlement to an award and documenting the appropriate hours expended and hourly rates.citation.to that end,the court may require a defendant to produce records sufficient to provide a proper basis for determining how much time was spent on particular claims.citation.the court also may properly reduce compensation on account of any failure to maintain appropriate time records.citation.computerxpress,jackson th,d computer xpress.the evidence should allow the court to consider whether the case was overstaffed,how much time the attorneys spent on particular claims,and whether the hours were reasonably expended.ibid.
a trial court assessing attorney fees begins with a touchstone or lodestar figure,based on the careful compilation of the time spent and reasonable hourly compensation of each attorney involved in the presentation of the case.ketchum moses cal th,d,ketchum.the court tabulates the attorney fee touchstone,or lodestar,by multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended by the reasonable hourly rate prevailing in the community for similar work.id.at,d,serrano priest cal d,priest.t he lodestar figure may be increased or decreased depending on a variety of factors,including the contingent nature of the fee award.ketchum,at,d,italics added.the ketchum court further noted that pursuant to serrano unruh cal d,serrano iv,absent circumstances rendering the award unjust,an attorney fee award should ordinarily include compensation for all the hours reasonably spent,including those relating solely to the fee.ketchum,at,d,first italics added.the supreme court cautioned in ketchum that padding in the form of inefficient or duplicative efforts is not subject to compensation.citation.id.at,d.

inflated fee requests constitute a special circumstance.in emphasizing that a trial court retains the discretion to award attorney fees in an amount that is less than the lodestar amount,the ketchum court noted,to the extent a trial court is concerned that a particular award is excessive,it has broad discretion to adjust the fee downward or deny an unreasonable fee altogether.ketchum,supra,cal th at,d.specifically,the ketchum court stated,a fee request that appears unreasonably inflated is a special circumstance permitting the trial court to reduce the award or deny one altogether.id.at,d,quoting serrano iv,supra,cal d at.

alnor fails to demonstrate the trial court abused its discretion 
the trial court applied the lodestar method 
alnor contends the trial court abused its discretion by failing to utilize the lodestar method approved by the supreme court for fee awards.ketchum,supra,cal th at,d,horsford board of trustees of california state university th,d horsford.alnor complains the trial court failed to acknowledge the lodestar method.there is no requirement,however,that the trial court provide a statement of decision see,ketchum,at,d,or otherwise detail its fealty to the law,which we presume.
in any event,the record shows the trial court applied the lodestar method.the lodestar tabulation consists simply of the reasonable hours spent multiplied by the hourly prevailing rate for private attorneys in the community conducting noncontingent litigation ketchum,supra,cal th at,d,italics omitted.here,the trial court identified the reasonably compensable attorney hours,and,based on that figure,awarded alnor in fees.the court did not specify the billing rate,but basic the award by the hours a rate of an hour,which the court determined was reasonable and alnor does not challenge on appeal.the court comment on the rate,combined with the specific number of compensable hours it identified,demonstrates the court applied the lodestar method.alnor contrary claim is unsupported by the evidence.
in a related claim,alnor suggests the trial court wholly ignored the billing statements submitted by his counsel.alnor observes that,w ithout an examination of the time records,a court may lack the foundation to decide that the hours spent were excessive.we agree the attorneys submissions form the starting point horsford,supra,th at,d for the trial court determination of the hours reasonably expended component of the lodestar analysis.ketchum,supra,cal th at,d,see also id.at,d,italics added court assessing attorney fees begins with a touchstone or lodestar figure,based on the careful compilation of the time spent.
here,there is no basis for alnor charge that the trial court fail ed to begin the lodestar process by examining the billing entries and supporting evidence as the trier of fact,it is the trial court role to examine the evidence,and we presume the court performed its duty.moreover,the record amply demonstrates the trial court familiarity with alnor billing submissions.the trial court specified in its tentative decision that much of the work done by the different lawyers was duplicative and unnecessary,the use of block billing obscured the nature of some of the work claimed,and m uch of the work claimed also appeared more related to preparing the case for trial rather th a n advancing the motion.thus,alnor suggestion that the trial court failed to review the billing records is baseless.
the trial court reasonably concluded the billing hours alnor submitted were padded and vague and therefore noncredible 
alnor contends the trial court had no reasonable basis for disregarding counsel s time records.it is,however,that the statute fee provision applies only to the motion to strike,and not to the entire action.berti,supra,cal th at,d,lafayette morehouse,supra,th at,d.nevertheless,counsel inflated the fee claim with a multitude of time entries devoted to matters other than the motion to strike,thereby undermining the credibility of counsel other entries.for example,counsel sought reimbursement for efforts such as attacking service of process,preparing and revising an answer to the complaint,summary judgment research,a senior associate w ork on a press release,and a conference regarding the appropriate way to address opposing counsel and the client.
the record suggests alnor sought to transfer to the opposing parties the cost of every minute counsel expended on the case,whether or not work was involved.the fee request included,for example,billings for obtaining the docket at the inception of the case,obtaining unspecified but numerous court documents,and attending the trial court mandatory case management of which would have been incurred whether or not alnor filed the motion to strike.indeed,counsel even sought reimbursement for drafting the client retention agreement,which does not appear to have been limited to measures given the hours counsel billed for other work.counsel willingness to flout the statutory restriction on the scope of fee claims justified the trial court in taking a jaundiced view of the fee request.
counsel compounded the boldness of unauthorized reimbursement requests with vague billing entries.at least entries described the work for which counsel sought fees as merely further handling.and more than of the billing entries submitted for counsel work made no reference at all to the motion to strike or otherwise designated the hours expended as work.the experienced trial judge is the best judge of the value of professional services rendered in his court priest,supra,cal d at.substantial evidence supports the trial court conclusion blockbilling obscured the nature of some of the work claimed,further damaging counsel credibility.blockbilling,while not objectionable per se in our view,exacerbated the vagueness of counsel fee request,a risky choice since the burden of proving entitlement to fees rests on the moving party.computerxpress,supra,th at,d.
where,as here,the trial court severely curtails the number of compensable hours in a fee award,we presume the court concluded the fee request was padded.levy,supra,th at,d substantial fee reduction indicat es levy improperly inflated his claimed attorney fees see maughan,supra,th at,d.an attorney
