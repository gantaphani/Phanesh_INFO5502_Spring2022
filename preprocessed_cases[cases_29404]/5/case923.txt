we affirm the district court order denying fees under california law.under federal law,we hold that because klein lawsuit achieved its goals and klein never attempted to secure compensatory damages under,the farrar exception does not apply,and the district court erred by not considering klein entitlement to fees under the standard framework.see hensley eckerhart,gonzalez city of maywood,cir.we vacate and remand for further proceedings.
in,laguna beach municipal code section prohibited people from using any radio loudspeaker or sound amplifier in such a manner as to cause any sound to be projected outside without having first procured a permit from the city manager so to do sic.section stated that a permit shall be granted at the will of the city manager,although the code gave no standards for exercising his discretion.at the same time,laguna beach had another code provision,section,on amplified speech that required speakers to secure a permit from the chief of police,who was directed to consider the constitutional right of free speech of all persons along with factors ranging from the volume of traffic to the threat of the overthrow of the lawfully established government.the code also prohibited use of amplifying devices within yards of hospitals,churches,schools,and city hall.section was intended to repeal other inconsistent code provisions,which would include sections.
on november,steve klein sent a letter to the city manager applying for a sound amplification permit under section to conduct religious youth outreach on public sidewalks around laguna beach high school.the city manager rejected the request,explaining that his longstanding and consistently followed policy and practice has been not to issue amplified sound permits.klein filed a complaint on december,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief under the and california constitutions and the california bane act,cal.b klein also sought nominal damages for each claim and statutory damages under the bane act six days later,the laguna beach city council passed an ordinance repealing chapter of the municipal code and amending to remove the permit requirement.at the same time,the city further restricted the hours that amplifying equipment could be used from to.these amendments were temporary while the subject matter was further studied.
klein amended his complaint to incorporate new factual developments and direct his constitutional challenge to.on december,klein wrote another letter to the city manager,this time seeking permission to use a sound amplification device in derogation of in two ways first,by speaking within yards of laguna beach high school and city hall,and second,by speaking between in the busy downtown commercial area of the city.speaking through counsel,the city responded in a letter that did not address klein request,stating instead that no permission was necessary to use amplification equipment and that klein should familiarize himself with the applicable regulations if he had not already done so.
on june,the city replaced the temporary ordinance with a permanent ordinance that limited the application of the yard ban at city hall and the high school to times when such facilities are in use or operation,and for a period of thirty minutes both before and after such use and operation.the city kept the general to ban citywide.this new ordinance continued to preclude klein request to use amplifying devices downtown after,at city hall between,and at the school between 
klein filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on august,which the district court denied,concluding that the ordinance was a content neutral,reasonable restriction on time,place and manner of speech.we reversed on appeal,holding that laguna beach presented insufficient evidence that the ordinance was narrowly tailored to the city interests.klein city of laguna beach,app x,cir klein i.we also concluded that the remaining preliminary injunction factors favored klein given the fundamental interest in the protection of all people constitutional rights and that the city had other ordinances prohibiting excessive and disruptive sound.id.at.
our decision issued on june.on october,the city amended section to remove the yard restriction around schools and city hall and to increase the time amplified speech was allowed from to.the parties then filed for summary judgment,with klein seeking an award of nominal damages and attorneys fees.the district court granted klein motion in part,entering judgment in favor of klein on his nominal damages claims that the repealed permitting scheme was an unconstitutional prior restraint and that the city restriction of klein speech in the downtown business district violated the first amendment.klein received damages for each of those claims.the court also granted the city motion in part,concluding that laguna beach did not violate klein rights by restricting his speech outside the high school and outside city hall.the court then entered judgment in favor of the city on klein remaining claims for nominal damages,his california bane act claim,and his claims for declaratory and injunctive relief for federal and state constitutional violations.the judgment stated that plaintiffs shall recover their costs,including reasonable attorneys fees pursuant to motion for the two claims on which they prevailed.
klein again appealed.we affirmed the district court as to the high school and downtown business district,but we reversed with respect to klein proposed speech near city hall,holding that klein was entitled to summary judgment on that claim as well.klein city of laguna beach,app x,cir klein ii.klein therefore won nominal damages on three of his four challenges under federal law.
klein then filed a motion for attorneys fees.the district court denied the motion in the decision now on appeal.although the court ruled that klein award of nominal damages made him a prevailing party under b,the court relied on farrar hobby to conclude that klein was not entitled to fees for his merely technical victory.see farrar hobby.the court analyzed the three farrar and concluded that the nominal damages judgment accomplished no public goal,that klein achieved de minimis success,and that klein first amendment rights were not so significant as to overcome the other two factors,which counsel strongly against an award of fees.the court also concluded that it was unable to award klein fees under california civil procedure code because klein had not prevailed on his california state law claims.klein appeals both of these issues 
we review de novo whether the district court applied the correct legal standard in determining entitlement to attorneys fees.labotest,bonta,cir.
