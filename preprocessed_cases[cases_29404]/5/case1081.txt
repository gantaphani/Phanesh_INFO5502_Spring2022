southwest marine,the operator of a shipyard in san diego,california,was awarded and performed several contracts with the united states navy for repairs and alterations to naval vessels.during the time period relevant to this dispute,some of southwest marine government contracts were contracts,which provided that the government would reimburse southwest marine costs deemed allowable in accordance with subpart of the far.
on april,several private parties,including the natural resources defense council nrdc,notified southwest marine and certain state and federal agencies that they believed southwest marine was violating the clean water act.the government agencies declined to act on the complaint,and on august,the nrdc filed suit against southwest marine in the united states district court for the southern district of california the complaint alleged violations of the clean water act and sought declaratory relief,injunctive relief and civil penalties as authorized by the act.
after a bench trial,the district court found that southwest marine had been in violation of the clean water act since august.in addition to injunctive relief,the district court imposed a civil penalty pursuant to d.payment of the penalty was to be made to the united states treasury.the district court noted,however,that the penalty could be offset by direct costs incurred by southwest marine in improving its stormwater diversion system.the district court also found that,as the prevailing party,the nrdc was entitled to an award of its attorneys fees

from to,southwest marine incurred in fees and expenses associated with its unsuccessful defense of the nrdc lawsuit.southwest marine included these expenses in its general and administrative indirect cost pool and assigned the costs to all of its contracts,including its government contracts.
in,the defense contract audit agency dcaa initiated an audit to determine the allowability of southwest marine costs associated with the nrdc lawsuit.the dcaa audit report questioned the allowability of the costs,and the dispute was assigned to a contracting officer.on december,southwest marine submitted a certified claim seeking a decision by the contracting officer that its costs were allowable under the far.on may,the contracting officer denied the claim.southwest marine filed a timely appeal to the armed services board of contract appeals.

southwest marine appeals the district court denial of its motion for summary judgment and the district court determination that its claimed costs are unallowable.

statutory and regulatory constructions are questions of law,which we review de novo.lear siegler,rumsfeld,see also b.although we need not defer to the board or district court interpretation of the far provisions at issue in this case,brownlee dyncorp,the board deserves due respect because of its expertise concerning government contracts,lear,at.
the allowability of costs under government contracts is governed by far subpart.section,which provides guidance for determining whether specific costs are allowable,states 
a costs shall be allowed to the extent they are reasonable,allocable,and determined to be allowable under,and.these criteria apply to all of the selected items that follow,even if particular guidance is provided for certain items for emphasis or clarity.
c section does not cover every element of cost.failure to include any item of cost does not imply that it is either allowable or unallowable.the determination of allowability shall be based on the principles and standards in this subpart and the treatment of similar or related selected items.when more than one subsection in is relevant to a contractor cost,the cost shall be apportioned among the applicable subsections,and the determination of allowability of each portion shall be based on the guidance contained in the applicable subsection.when a cost,to which more than one subsection in is relevant,can not be apportioned,the determination of allowability shall be based on the guidance contained in the subsection that most specifically deals with,or best captures the essential nature of,the cost at issue.
southwest marine focuses on far to contend that its costs are allowable.section provides 
a professional and consultant services,as used in this subsection,are those services rendered by persons who are members of a particular profession or possess a special skill and who are not officers or employees of the contractor.examples include those services acquired by contractors or subcontractors in order to enhance their legal,economic,financial,or technical positions.professional and consultant services are generally acquired to obtain information,advice,opinions,alternatives,conclusions,recommendations,training,or direct assistance,such as studies,analyses,evaluations,liaison with government officials,or other forms of representation.
b costs of professional and consultant services are allowable subject to this paragraph and paragraphs c through f of this subsection when reasonable in relation to the services rendered and when not contingent upon recovery of the costs from the government but see and.
the government focuses on far b to contend that southwest marine claimed costs are unallowable.section b provides 
b costs incurred in connection with any proceeding brought by a federal,state,local,or foreign government for violation of,or a failure to comply with,law or regulation by the contractor including its agents or employees,or costs incurred in connection with any proceeding brought by a third party in the name of the united states under the false claims act,are unallowable if the result is 
in a civil or administrative proceeding,either a finding of contractor liability where the proceeding involves an allegation of fraud or similar misconduct or imposition of a monetary penalty where the proceeding does not involve an allegation of fraud or similar misconduct.
because no provision of the far explicitly addresses southwest marine costs,c directs us to examine the far treatment of similar or related costs.id.c.we determine that the costs disallowed in far b are similar to the costs at issue in this case.although the costs for which southwest marine seeks reimbursement arose from a lawsuit that was not brought by the government,the clean water act authorizes both citizen and governmental suits and permits the gover
