background 
yassin,a licensed contractor,contracted with the solises to construct an addition on the solises home and to do additional work on the home for a total of.the contract provided as follows the contractor shall furnish to the owner all of the labor and material required for the construction of a new addition a ccording to building department approved plans and specifications the owner shall pay to the contractor for furnishing the labor and materials and for the construction of this residence the sum of,paid as follows downpayment on the signing of this agreement foundation placement rough framing inspection final inspection certificate of occupany.the final payment shall be made upon completion of the work and before occupancy there were some change orders.after the city inspector signed a final inspection on the project which was actually the drywall inspection,yassin demanded payment of.yassin had already received from the solises.the solises claimed that yassin had performed deficient work and violated the contractors state license law bus,et,the subcontractors were unlicensed,and the work deviated from the plans and was substandard.the solises asserted that as a result of these deficiencies,they terminated yassin from the job and hired another contractor to complete the work.the solises contended at trial that yassin caused repeated problems in connection with the project,created difficulties in communications,made spurious claims of change orders,delayed the project,and caused numerous work deficiencies.
yassin sued the solises for the he claimed was owed him.the solises for damages.yassin submitted evidence attributing the alleged construction defects to preexisting conditions on the property.the solises contended that it would cost to repair the damage caused by yassin.
the trial court awarded yassin nothing on his claim and awarded the solises on their in damages.after a posttrial motion based on sections and,the trial court awarded the solises in attorney fees under section,subdivision g on the theory that the solises prevailed on yassin claim for due and payable upon completion of the work and issuance of a certificate of occupancy which payment the trial court deemed to be a retention under section.
yassin asserts on appeal that there was a lack of substantial evidence to support the solises claim for damages that sections and are inapplicable to this action because there was no withholding of progress payments or retention of monies due under the contract that the failure of any of the parties to invoke in their pleadings sections and precludes an award of attorney fees under those sections and that any liability under section is barred by the statute of limitations.code civ,subd.a.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review a contention that evidence does not support a damage award under the substantial evidence standard of review.see major western home ins.th,fn.the normal standard of review for a challenge to the attorney fees award is abuse of discretion,but de novo review of such a trial court order is warranted where the determination of whether the criteria for an award of attorney fees and costs in this context have been satisfied amounts to statutory construction and a question of law.connerly state personnel board cal th.
substantial evidence of damage 
substantial evidence of cause of damages 
yassin contends that there is not substantial evidence that he caused any damage and that any defects existed prior to his work.where findings of fact are challenged on a civil appeal,we are bound by the elementary,but often overlooked principle of law that the power of an appellate court begins and ends with a determination as to whether there is any substantial evidence,contradicted or uncontradicted,to support the findings below.citation.we must therefore view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party,giving it the benefit of every reasonable inference and resolving all conflicts in its favor in accordance with the standard of review so long adhered to by this court.citation.bickel city of piedmont cal th,abrogated by statue on another ground as stated in deberard properties lim cal th.
in addition to the testimony of the solises regarding defects and nonperformance of the contract by yassin,an expert testified that yassin caused defects on the roof,failed to install shear walls resulting in structural problems,utilized inadequate nails and plywood causing other structural problems,and committed code violations.this evidence constituted substantial evidence that yassin caused the damages.
substantial evidence of amount of damages 
the solises contend that yassin failure to move for a new trial on the ground of excessive or inadequate damages see code civ.proc,subd.precludes yassin from raising that issue for the first time on appeal.we do not have to resolve that issue because substantial evidence supported the award of damages.there was evidence of the monies paid by the solises to another contractor to complete and repair the work,and expert testimony concerning the defects in yassin work.the specific evidence of the amount of damages consisted of expert testimony that repairing yassin work would cost.this expert,a contractor,reviewed the premises and the recommendations for repairs made by another expert,described the repairs that had to be made,and gave an opinion on the costs of repair.this expert opinion testimony constituted substantial evidence because it was based on conclusions or assumptions supported by evidence in the record.roddenberry roddenberry th,see,subd.b.
attorney fees 
applicable facts 
there was no attorney fees clause in the contract.the solises moved for attorney fees under sections and.the trial court awarded the solises in attorney fees pursuant to section,subdivision g,reducing the amount requested.
section,subdivision b provides,except as otherwise agreed in writing,the owner shall pay to the contractor,within days following receipt of a demand for payment in accordance with the contract,any progress payment due thereunder as to which there is no good faith dispute between the parties.in the event of a dispute between the owner and the contractor,the owner may withhold from the progress payment an amount not to exceed percent of the disputed amount.if any amount is wrongfully withheld in violation of this subdivision,the contractor shall be entitled to the penalty specified in subdivision g of section.section,in relevant part,provides b the retention proceeds withheld from any payment by the owner from the original contractor,or by the original contractor from any subcontractor,shall be subject to this section.c within days after the date of completion,the retention withheld by the owner shall be released g in the event that retention payments are not made within the time periods required by this section,the owner or original contractor withholding the unpaid amounts shall be subject to a charge of percent per month on the improperly withheld amount,in lieu of any interest otherwise due.additionally,in any action for the collection of funds wrongfully withheld,the prevailing party shall be entitled to his or her attorney fees and costs.
the solises paid yassin a down payment and various progress payments.the solises refused to pay yassin the required after the final inspection because the solises,inter alia,did not believe the drywall inspection was the final inspection.the solises ordered yassin off the project in september,without paying him either the final inspection payment or the due upon the issuance of the certificate of occupancy.the solises contracted with another contractor in december to complete the work.yassin filed a mechanic lien and then in july,filed this action.
the trial court concluded that yassin sought to recover retention proceeds held by the the due upon the issuance of certificate of therefore,as the prevailing parties on that claim,the solises were entitled to an award of attorney fees under section,subdivision g.the trial court stated that section did not provide for attorney fees.
rules of interpretation 
o ur task in interpreting these statutes is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.citation.bernard foley cal th.the search for intent,however,takes a specific form.because statutory language generally provide s the most reliable indicator of legislative intent citations,we turn to the words themselves,giving them their usual and ordinary meanings and construing them in context citation.citation.if the language contains no ambiguity,we presume the legislature meant what it said,and the plain meaning of the statute governs.citation.people allegheny casualty cal th.a court in interpreting a statute should employ the common usage and understanding of the statute words.people linwood th,smith peterson d.it is a familiar rule of statutory construction that common words are to be extended to all the objects which,in their usual acceptation they describe or denote,and that technical terms are to be allowed their technical meaning and affect,unless in either case the context indicates that such construction would frustrate the real intention of the power.technical words when relating to a trade,when used in a statute or ordinance,dealing with the subject matter of such trade,are to be taken in their technical sense and will be so construed unless the context or other considerations show a contrary intent.in re smith,see singer and singer,statutes and statutory construction new ed,in the absence of legislative intent to the contrary,or other overriding evidence of a different meaning,technical terms or terms of art used in a statute are presumed to have their technical meaning fns.omitted id.at.w here a word of common usage has more than one meaning,the one which will best attain the purposes of the statute should be adopted,even though the ordinary meaning of the word is enlarged or restricted and especially in order to avoid absurdity or to prevent injustice.friends of mammoth board of supervisors cal d,disapproved on another ground in kowis.howard cal th.
to the extent this examination of the statutory language leaves uncertainty,it is appropriate to consider the consequences that will flow from a particular interpretation.citation.citation.where more than one statutory construction is arguably possible,our policy has long been to favor the construction that leads to the more reasonable result.citation.citation.this policy derives largely from the presumption that the legislature intends reasonable results consistent with its apparent purpose.citation.thus,our task is to select the construction that comports most closely with the legislature apparent intent,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the statutes general purpose,and to avoid a construction that would lead to unreasonable,impractical,or arbitrary results.citations.copley press,superior court cal th.
contentions of the parties 
even though the parties disagree on what was meant by final inspection,the parties agree that after that inspection,yassin was required to do more work and that the solises terminated yassin from the job before he had completed it.accordingly,the final inspection payment claimed by yassin was payable under the contract before completion of the work.the final payment due under the contract was the to be paid upon completion of the work and issuance of the certificate of occupancy.
yassin sued for the unpaid portion of the contract price,plus work on change orders and extras.the trial court concluded that at least the final payment required under the contract was a retention amount covered by section.the trial court permitted the yassins to recover their attorney fees to defend against the amount claimed that constituted what the trial court considered a,the payment due upon the issuance of the certificate of occupancy.yassin asserts on appeal that neither he nor the solises ever asserted in the trial court that the claim was brought pursuant to section,yassin never requested a penalty,and the final certificate of occupancy payment did not constitute a retention amount under section.
no pleading requirement or applicable period of limitations 
there is no requirement that a party plead that it is seeking attorney fees,and there is no requirement that the ground for a fee award be specified in the pleadings.pearl,cal.attorney fee awards ed,witkin,cal.procedure ed.judgment,but alpha mechanical,heating air conditioning,travelers casualty surety of america th,claim that complaint did not seek relief under business and professions code section and civil code section for penalty interest was forfeited by not raising the claim at trial.yassin asserts that the penalty under section is barred by the statute of limitations.but the trial court expressly did not impose a penalty or award fees under section.as the trial court noted,section did not authorize an award of attorney fees.see murray iron works,boyce,supra,th at,fn by this we do not express a view that civil code section supports an award of attorney fees even in a dispute over a contractually agreed progress payment.see denver darling controlled environments construction,th at implicitly distinguishing between the percent penalty provision and the attorney fees provision of subd.g.see also mcandrew hazegh th,the percent penalty and attorney fees under section,subdivision,subdivision g morton engineering construction,patscheck th,with respect to a prevailing party clause,a provision that has equal application to both parties is not a sanction against one of the parties.thus,we do not have to reach yassin argument that the statute of limitations bars a claim for attorney fees under section.
application of statute 
the last payment of the installment payments was to be made after the completion of the work and issuance of a certificate of occupancy.that last payment did not constitute retention proceeds withheld from any payment by the owner from the original contractor,subd.b.by its terms,that statute refers to a retention proceeds as being funds withheld from a payment,not the payment itself.retention amounts are a form of security generally retained by the owner from prior payments due for work previously performed.
authorities have noted that a retention occurs when the owner retains a percentage from each progress payment as a form of security against potential mechanics liens and as security that the contractor will complete the work properly and repair defects.acret,drafting construction contracts,cal.construction contracts,defects,and litigation cgb at gibbs hunt,cal.construction law ed a most construction agreements contain a provision for retention,which is a percentage usually percent of the amounts due the contractor final payment consists
