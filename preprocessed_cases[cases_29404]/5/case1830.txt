in the published portion of this opinion,we affirm the denial of a request for contractual attorney fees,concluding that the provision relied upon to authorize fees is a standard indemnity clause.we conclude these types of provisions do not create a reciprocal right to fees,despite a reference to performance of work under the contract.
in the unpublished portion of the opinion,we affirm an award of prejudgment interest payable on retention damages from the date the contract work was completed,despite the existence of offset claims and a dispute regarding liability.

contract provisions 
carr and west contend that the trial court erred in denying their request for attorney fees by improperly interpreting section of the contract and section of the contract as standard indemnity provisions,applicable only to claims.both argue that the provisions contemplate not only claims,but also claims on the contract itself.

carr and west contend that section of the contract,found under the section title insurance requirements for contractors,and the provision heading,hold harmless and indemnification agreement,authorizes an award because its language includes within its scope actions arising out of the performance of the work provided for in the contract.the provision reads 
carr shall indemnify and hold harmless chowchilla and its officers,officials,employees,agents of the above from and against all claims,damages,losses and expenses including attorney fees arising out of the performance of the work described herein,caused in whole or in part by any negligent act or omission of carr,any subcontractor,anyone directly or indirectly employed by any of them or anyone for whose acts any of them may be liable,except where cause by the active negligence,sole negligence,or willful misconduct of chowchilla.italics added.
in contrast to the hold harmless and indemnification agreement section,the contract contains section,a provision under the section title of indemnity agreement,which reads 
carr agrees to indemnify and save harmless chowchilla,giersch olson,their agents and employees,for and against all loss or expense including costs and attorney fees on account of injury or death of persons employed by carr,or his subcontractors,his or their agents or employees injury to or death of any other person or injury to,damage or destruction of property,real or personal,including loss of use thereof.upon demand,carr shall defend any suits or actions covered by the terms of this agreement.
the section goes on to require that,before commencing work,carr was to obtain insurance coverage for comprehensive general liability,automobile liability,and worker compensation.in addition,carr was required to acquire the performance bond issued by west.
on remand,the trial court agreed with chowchilla and found that the above provisions were standard indemnity provisions,which do not authorize attorney fees on a dispute arising out of the contract.we begin our analysis with several basic principles relating to indemnity clauses.an indemnity against claims,or demands,or liability,expressly,or in other equivalent terms,embraces the costs of defense against such claims,demands,or liability incurred in good faith,and in the exercise of a reasonable discretion,subd.generally,the inclusion of attorney fees as an item of loss in a provision does not constitute a provision for the award of attorney fees in an action on the contract which is required to trigger section.myers,supra,th at,d meininger california,d.meininger.a clause which contains the words indemnify and hold harmless is an indemnity clause which generally obligates the indemnitor to reimburse the indemnitee for any damages the indemnitee becomes obligated to pay third persons.citation.indemnification agreements ordinarily relate to third party claims.citation.myers,supra,th at,d.an indemnity agreement is to be interpreted according to the language and contents of the contract,as well as the intention of the parties as indicated by the contract,using the same rules that govern the interpretation of other contracts.widson international harvester d.herman christensen sons,paris plastering d.
