this case,which comes before us a second time,is one of many related to the united states government terrorist surveillance program,a program that intercepted international communications into and out of the united states of persons alleged to have ties to al qaeda and other terrorist networks.al haramain islamic found.bush al haramain i,cir.in the previous appeal,we determined that the state secrets privilege d id not bar the very subject matter of th e action and remanded to the district court to consider,among other issues,whether the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa preempts the state secrets privilege.id.at.on remand,the district court held that fisa preempts or displaces the state secrets privilege,that the government implicitly waived sovereign immunity for damages under fisa civil liability provision,and that two of the al haramain plaintiffs were entitled to statutory damages and attorney fees.
the threshold issue in this appeal is whether the district court erred in predicating the united states liability for money damages on an implied waiver of sovereign immunity under.it is well understood that any waiver of sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed.section does not include an explicit waiver of immunity,nor is it appropriate to imply such a waiver.consequently,we reverse the district court judgment awarding damages and attorney fees to al haramain under.we also affirm the dismissal of robert mueller,director of the fbi,in his personal capacity.
this case effectively brings to an end the plaintiffs ongoing attempts to hold the executive branch responsible for intercepting telephone conversations without judicial authorization.however,we can not let that occur without comment on the government recent,unfortunate argument that the plaintiffs have somehow engaged in.
in early,the treasury department announced an investigation of al haramain islamic foundation.then in late,for the first time publicly alleged links to terrorism involving al haramain.also in,the plaintiffs received a copy of a document from the office of foreign assets control the sealed document,which may or may not have suggested certain of the plaintiffs or their lawyers had been electronically surveilled.in,a new york times article revealed that the national security agency had obtained the cooperation of telecommunications companies to tap into a significant portion of the companies telephone and traffic,both domestic and international.based on some or all of the above,the plaintiffs thought that they had been unlawfully surveilled,and in they filed suit.
over the last six years,the plaintiffs have faced a moving and shrinking target.in,congress narrowed the list of potential defendants by granting telecommunications providers retroactive immunity.see in re sec.agency telecomms.records,cir describing amendments to fisa.meanwhile,the evidentiary arsenal at the plaintiffs disposal has been constantly in flux.on one hand,the sealed document was excluded,pending a determination whether the fisa preempted the state secrets privilege in the telecommunications field.see al haramin i.on the other,the public evidence favorable to the plaintiffs grew to include the fbi admitting to having used surveillance in connection with its investigation of al haramain,the treasury department acknowledging it intercepted telephone conversations involving an al haramain member,and top executive branch officials testifying before congress that most modern international communications are wired.
in light of the complex,nature of this litigation,and considering the significant infringement on individual liberties that would occur if the executive branch were to disregard procedures for obtaining judicial authorization of international wiretaps,the charge of lobbed by the government is as careless as it is inaccurate.throughout,the plaintiffs have proposed ways of advancing their lawsuit without jeopardizing national security,ultimately going so far as to disclaim any reliance whatsoever on the sealed document.that their suit has ultimately failed does not in any way call into question the integrity with which they pursued it.
background 
al haramain i 
in al haramain i,al haramain islamic foundation and two of its lawyers collectively al haramain claimed that they were subject to warrantless electronic surveillance in in violation of the foreign intelligence surveillance act.at.at the core of the allegations stood a classified top secret document the sealed document that the government inadvertently gave to the al haramain organization in during a proceeding to freeze the organization assets.id.
we held that the suit itself was not precluded by the state secrets privilege,although the privilege protected the sealed document.id.without the sealed document,the al haramain organization could not establish that it suffered and therefore did not have standing to bring suit.id.at.as to the attorney plaintiffs,we remanded to the district court to consider whether fisa preempts the common law state secrets privilege.id.at.
ii.district court proceedings on remand 
on remand,the district court held extensive proceedings and issued multiple orders on the various remaining legal issues,including three published decisions.at the outset,the district court held that fisa preempts or displaces the state secrets privilege in cases within the reach of its provisions.in re sec.agency telecomms.records,d.this,the district court wrote,is such a case.id.
concluding that waives the united states sovereign immunity,the district court denied the government motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.id.at.the court acknowledged that i t is,of course true that section does not contain a waiver of sovereign immunity analogous to that in u.section a which expressly provides that the aggrieved persons may sue the united states for unlawful surveillance id.however,because it is only such federal officers and employees acting in their official capacities that would engage in surveillance of the type contemplated by fisa,the court feared that fisa would offer scant,if any,relief in the absence of a waiver.id.thus,it held that a waiver was i mplicit in the remedy under.id.
in light of the sealed document,the court ruled it was necessary for the al haramain plaintiffs to establish they were aggrieved parties under fisa using information.the district court dismissed the complaint with leave to amend the fisa claims,and al haramain filed an amended complaint.the district court then concluded that w ithout a doubt the amended complaint alleged enough to plead aggrieved person status so as to proceed to the next step in proceedings under fisa sections f and.in re sec.agency telecomms.records,d.moving to the merits,in its next ruling,the court directed plaintiffs to move for summary judgment on their fisa claim relying only on evidence.in re sec.agency telecomms.records,d.al haramain did so and the government filed a to dismiss and for summary judgment.the court denied the government motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,rejecting the argument that al haramain lacked standing because the program under which it was surveilled had been terminated,and once again holding that waived the united states sovereign immunity.id.at.
on the merits,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of al haramain with respect to governmental liability under fisa.id.at.al haramain then accepted the court invitation to voluntarily dismiss the remaining claims in order to take the steps necessary for the entry of judgment on the fisa claim.id.at.the district court also dismissed claims against fbi director robert mueller in his individual capacity.id.
in a order on remedies,the court first denied damages to the al haramain organization because it was a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power under fisa broad definition of that term,and therefore ineligible to recover damages under the statute.the two individual plaintiffs did not seek actual damages but were awarded liquidated damages of each.the district court denied punitive damages and equitable relief.finally,the court awarded the requested in attorney fees and in costs.see.
sovereign immunity 
the key and dispositive issue on appeal is whether the government waived sovereign immunity under fisa civil liability provision.contrary to the district court reliance on implied waiver,a waiver of sovereign immunity can not be implied but must be unequivocally expressed.united states mitchell,internal quotation marks omitted.
we have the benefit of the supreme court most recent pronouncement in this area.earlier this year,the court interpreted the waiver provision of the privacy act of,which,like fisa,protects individuals against the government collection,use,and disclosure of information.faa cooper.according to the privacy act,the united states shall be liable to an individual in an amount equal to the sum of actual damages.g a.in determining that the scope of the immunity waiver did not unequivocally authorize an award of damages for mental or emotional distress,cooper.at,the court reiterated the standard for sovereign immunity what we thus require is that the scope of congress waiver be clearly discernable from the statutory text in light of traditional interpretive tools.if it is not,then we take the interpretation most favorable to the government.id.at.
in light of these principles we now consider,which was the basis on which the district court ordered relief and the section relied on by al haramain.at oral argument,al haramain confirmed that it was not proceeding under other sections of fisa.al haramain argues that,as a result of purported illegal surveillance,it may bring a claim against the united states under,which states 
an aggrieved person,who has been subjected to an electronic surveillance or about whom information obtained by electronic surveillance of such person has been disclosed or used in violation of section of this title shall have a cause of action against any person who committed such violation 
a person who may have committed the violation is defined as any individual,including any officer or employee of the federal government,or any group,entity,association,corporation,or foreign power.m.glaringly missing from the definition is the united states.an offense under is predicated on a violation of,a criminal provision,which provides that 
a a person is guilty of an offense if he intentionally 
engages in electronic surveillance except as authorized by any express statutory authorization 
discloses or uses information obtained under color of law by electronic surveillance,knowing or having reason to know that the information was obtained through electronic surveillance not authorized by express statutory authorization 
d there is federal jurisdiction if the person committing the offense was an officer or employee of the united states at the time the offense was committed.
in considering whether encompasses a waiver of sovereign immunity,it is useful to benchmark the statutory language against other explicit waivers of sovereign immunity.the federal tort claims act provides the most prominent example the united states is liable in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.b.however,congress has used similarly explicit waiver provisions in other contexts.see,k in any action or proceeding under this subchapter the united states shall be liable for costs the same as a private person.unlawful employment practices a a civil action in admiralty in personam may be brought against the united states.a if any officer or employee of the internal revenue service disregards any provision of this title a taxpayer may bring a civil action for damages against the united states.
we need not comb the united states code for disparate examples of sovereign immunity waivers such examples are available closer to home within fisa.congress included explicit waivers with respect to certain sections of fisa as part of the usa patriot act,a,which states in relevant part 
any person who is aggrieved by any willful violation of sections a,a,or a of the foreign intelligence surveillance act of et may commence an action in united states district court against the united states to recover money damages 
this section underscores the importance of considering the statutory scheme as a whole.see food drug admin.brown williamson tobacco,it is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.internal quotation marks omitted.congress well understood how to express a sovereign immunity waiver in the context of fisa.admittedly,magic words,such as an action against the united states,are not required to deduce a waiver of sovereign immunity.in certain circumstances,the supreme court has determined the existence of a waiver,by using the other traditional tools of statutory construction.richlin sec.serv.chertoff.nonetheless,contrasted against other provisions deemed sufficient to invoke waiver,the lack of an explicit waiver in is stark,permitting suit only against a person,without listing the united states.just as the term damages was deemed ambiguous and thus limited sovereign immunity under the privacy act,cooper,at,so too is the term person ambiguous governmental liability.because there is a plausible interpretation of the statute that would not allow money damages against the government,any ambiguity is construed in favor of the sovereign.id.at.
although our decision is grounded solely in the text of the statute itself,the legislative history surrounding a further confirms what we have concluded from the text alone.mohamad palestinian,see levin united states,cir considering legislative history to confirm that the gonzales act does not waive sovereign immunity.because fisa did not,on its own terms,waive sovereign immunity,an initial version of the patriot act proposed a sovereign immunity waiver for violations of.see,at,proposing to amend to provide a remedy for its violation under the federal tort claims act.this proposed amendment to was deleted the very next day instead,a waiver of sovereign immunity was incorporated into.while creates united states liability for certain fisa violations such as those of,it does not include claims under thus,our conclusion is consistent with congressional consideration and later rejection of an immunity waiver for violations of.
contrasting liability,for which sovereign immunity is not explicitly waived,with liability,for which it is,also illuminates congressional purpose.liability under the two sections,while similar in its reach,is not identical.section,combined with,renders the united states liable only for the use and disclos ure of information by federal officers and employees in an unlawful manner.section,by contrast,also creates liability for the actual collection of the information in the first place,targeting electronic surveillance or disclos ure or use of that information.emphasis added.under this scheme,al haramain can bring a suit for damages against the united states for use of the collected information,but can not bring suit against the government for collection of the information itself.aclu nsa,cir lead opinion of batchelder,noting that fisa potentially allows limitless information collection upon issuance of warrant,but limits use and dissemination of information under,inter alia,a.although such a structure may seem anomalous and even unfair,the policy judgment is one for congress,not the courts.also,because governmental liability remains under,the district court concern that fisa relief would become a dead letter is not valid.see in re sec.agency telecomms.records,d at.
consistent with the congressional scheme,unlike,and,has not been incorporated into the waiver of sovereign immunity in,or elsewhere.nor does liability under come with the procedures that accompany such actions against the united states.section b sets out detailed procedures by which a claim may be filed against the united states,referring to federal tort claims act requirements,as well as to fisa.paragraph b states 
notwithstanding any other provision of law,the procedures set forth in section f,g,or f of the foreign intelligence sur
