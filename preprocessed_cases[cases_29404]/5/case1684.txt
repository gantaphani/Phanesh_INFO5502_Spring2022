respondents building a better redondo,and james light bbr brought a petition for writ of mandate and declaratory relief claim against appellants city of redondo beach,its city council and city clerk collectively,city or appellants.bbr sought an order compelling appellants to submit a local coastal program amendment to public vote in compliance with a recently enacted charter amendment requiring any major change in allowable land use to be approved by city voters.appellants argued that the local coastal program amendment predated the charter amendment and thus was not governed by it.the trial court found the local coastal program amendment constituted a major change in allowable land use and ordered appellants to place the amendment before the voters.although appellants appealed the judgment,they also voluntarily complied with the court writ of mandate.the court subsequently awarded bbr its attorney fees.appellants appeal the judgment and attorney fees order.we hold the appeal from the judgment should be dismissed as moot and affirm the award of attorney fees.
general background and facts 
coastal act 
the legislature enacted the california coastal act of pub.resources code,et as a comprehensive scheme governing land use planning for the entire california coastal zone.yost thomas cal d.the coastal act requires cities and counties in the coastal zone to prepare and adopt a local coastal program to implement coastal development and preservation policies found in chapter of the coastal act.yost,supra,at.the local coastal program consists of a land use plan and zoning ordinances,zoning district maps and,if needed,other implementing measures.yost,supra,at.although local governments may amend any portion of their land use plans,no such amendment shall take effect until it has been certified by the coastal commission,subd.a.
coastal land use plan 
in,the city approved,and the coastal commission certified,a coastal land use plan for redondo beach.the redondo beach coastal land use plan generally designated the area encompassing king harbor and redondo beach pier area for commercial uses,imposing no quantitative restrictions or standards of development.
in,the city council approved a coastal zone ordinance intended to be part of the local coastal program.it concurrently approved a plan called heart of the city,for the area and adjoining territory,comprising a combination of coastal land use plan,zoning ordinance,general plan and specific plan amendments.this plan would have allowed intensive commercial and condominium development for the heart of the city.the proposed development was unacceptable to many city voters,who filed referendum petitions on the heart of the city specific plan and related general plan amendments.in response to the petitions,the city council repealed the heart of the city plan in june and reinstated a prior center specific plan for the area.
the city council decided not to submit the heart of the city zoning and coastal land use plan amendments to the coastal commission for certification.instead,the city council submitted to the coastal commission portions of a new coastal zoning ordinance covering only the predominantly residential portions of the city coastal zone area.in april,after approving the geographical segmentation of the city into two areas area and area for coastal act purposes the coastal commission certified the coastal zoning ordinance for area,subject to the city agreement to a number of modifications.see,subd.c.
on august,the city council passed resolutions and ordinances ordinances amending the coastal zoning ordinance,coastal land use plan,general plan and center specific plan for area.the ordinances provided this ordinance shall go into effect and be in full force and operation from and after thirty days after its final passage and adoption.a companion resolution,however,further provided that t he city council hereby certifies that the local coastal program as amended is intended to be carried out in a manner that is fully in conformity with the coastal act,and the submittal of the local coastal program amendments to the coastal commission is consistent with section the resolution further declared that the proposed amendments will take effect automatically upon coastal commission approval pursuant to sections,and for local coastal programs.
enactments 
on may,the city council approved a resolution and companion ordinance ordinance amending the local coastal program for area.the council eliminated earlier residential use designations in area and proposed five coastal commercial zones allowing for a net increase of square feet in new development.the allowable uses in the coastal commercial zones were to include retail sales,restaurants,bars,nightclubs,offices,hotels and motels,as well as hybrids between motels and residential condominiums,referred to as,fractional ownership hotels and timeshares.
the ordinance purported to decree two separate effective dates.section of the ordinance provided this ordinance shall go into effect and be in full force and operation from and after thirty days after its final passage and adoption.for purposes of approving coastal development permits,this ordinance shall be effective on the date of certification by the coastal commission.however,in the companion resolution the city council declared its coastal zoning and land use plan decisions were proposed amendments to its local coastal program that would take effect automatically upon coastal commission approval pursuant to sections,and for local coastal programs.
measure dd 
about this time,bbr and other advocates of a or no growth philosophy began circulating an initiative petition measure dd to place on the ballot a proposed amendment to the city charter.a notice of intention to circulate measure dd was published in july and circulated among voters for signature.proponents of the initiative petition obtained sufficient signatures to qualify the petition for submission to the voters at an election.in march,the city council ordered the initiative measure to be placed on the ballot for the november,general election.the question put to the voters was shall an initiative to amend the redondo beach city charter by adding article xxvii to require voter approval of specified changes in allowable land use be adopted 
at the general election of november,measure dd passed,adding article xxvii to the city charter on december,the charter amendment was accepted and filed by the california secretary of state.article xxvii thus took effect on december.cal,art.xi,subd.a.
in passing measure dd,the voters of redondo beach found,among other things,that t he city traffic circulation system is already oversaturated,and at or near gridlock during rush hours,and,as such,is inadequate to support the city existing level of development and that t hese existing traffic and traffic circulation system conditions,and their adverse public safety,public health and quality of life consequences,bear testimony to the fact that the city existing land use and development review and approval procedures do not carefully or accurately consider,nor adequately weigh,the adverse impacts to the local environment and quality of life caused by increased density and congestion resulting from major changes in allowable land use.redondo beach city charter,art.xxvii,b c.redondo beach city charter charter,article xxvii,section a provides each major change in allowable land use shall be put to a vote of the people provided,however,that no such change shall be submitted to the voters unless the city council has first approved it.a major change in allowable land use shall become effective only after approval by the city council and a majority of the voters of the city voting yes on a ballot measure proposing such change at either a regular or special municipal election.charter section defines a major change in allowable land use as any proposed amendment,among other things,to the coastal zoning ordinance meeting any one or more of three listed conditions,including,defined significant increases in traffic,density or intensity of use above specified physical baseline conditions.charter f.
submittal to coastal commission 
on may,the city submitted the and the local coastal program amendment resolutions and related ordinances to the coastal commission for certification under the coastal act.
on july,a public hearing took place before the coastal commission on the city local coastal program amendment submittal.based on detailed findings,the commission denied certification of the amendment proposed under the city and land use plan amendment resolutions and ordinances.the coastal commission suggested a number of modifications to the city local coastal program amendment proposal.the suggested modifications directed the city to amend portions of the land use and implementation plans to address certain deficiencies,such as in the protection of environmentally sensitive habitat areas and marine resources.the commission indicated that if the city council should accept and adopt the commission suggested modifications,it would certify the amendment as modified.however,the city was notified that the amendment would not be deemed final and effective for implementation in the local coastal zone until certain conditions were satisfied.these conditions included the city council acceptance by resolution of the coastal commission suggested modifications,a determination by the executive director that the city has legally complied with the coastal commission action and the commission acceptance of that determination after a public hearing,tit.
modification of amendment to local coastal program 
on april and april,the city council approved an amendment to the city local coastal program for area incorporating the modifications suggested by the coastal commission,but it rejected putting the change to a vote as to the coastal zoning ordinance regulations and portions of the land use policies contained in them.the city council declared that only certain amendments to the area coastal land use plan adopted in may constituted or were integrally related to a major change in allowable land use within the meaning of charter section and thus were subject to a public vote.the city council also deferred the election order to an unspecified future time when,by a further resolution,the council would set an election.the city council rejected requests that the entire area coastal zoning ordinance amendment be placed on an election ballot.
procedural history 
in face of the city council refusal to place the entire area local coastal plan on a ballot,bbr filed a petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory relief against appellants on may.bbr alleged it was formed to give city residents the right to vote on major commercial and residential zoning actions that would significantly increase traffic and traffic congestion in the city.bbr sought a writ of mandate to require appellants to submit the entire area local coastal program amendment,including the implementing coastal zoning ordinance amendment for area,on the ballot for voter approval under charter article xxvii.in addition to the coastal land use plan amendments that the city council indicated would be submitted to the electorate,bbr contended city residents should have the right to vote on the coastal zoning ordinance amendment which the city deemed to be already legally effective,the coastal zoning and coastal land use plan amendments,and the modifications to the coastal zoning ordinance and coastal land use plan approved by the city council in april.
a hearing was held before retired judge robert,who issued a written decision in favor of bbr on july.the court determined that charter section defined a major change in allowable land use as any proposed amendment,among other things,to the zoning ordinance for the coastal zone,meeting any one or more of three listed conditions,including defined significant increases in traffic,density or intensity of use above specified physical baseline conditions.when such a major change takes the form of an amendment to the city local coastal program,the court determined,voter approval is a supplement to,not substitute for,coastal commission review and certification the court found that the area coastal zoning ordinance amendment constituted a major change in allowable land use because the amendment allowed square feet of additional floor area.
the trial court rejected the city argument that the coastal zoning ordinance amendment was not subject to a popular vote because the amendment predecessor ordinances took effect prior to december,the date charter article xxvii became effective.the court further disagreed with the city position that the zoning ordinance and the zoning ordinance were effective days after their adoption by the city council,september,for the zoning ordinance and june,for the zoning ordinance.the court found that because the and ordinances had not been certified by the coastal commission prior to december,they could not have taken effect prior to december,and so amounted to mere contemplated legislation.
the trial court determined,moreover,that the coastal act,state administrative regulations and city zoning regulations prescribe special procedures for passing,approving and putting into effect local coastal programs.the coastal act established the coastal commission duty and authority to certify local coastal programs to ensure that coastal land programs anywhere in the california coastal zone met the requirements of and conformed to the policies set forth in chapter of the coastal act.see,subd.c.the court indicated that section specifically provides that if the coastal commission rejects a coastal zoning ordinance as submitted as the court found occurred here,it may suggest modifications in rejecting such ordinance.similarly,the same procedure equally applied to a proposed amendment before a local government may obtain certification of an amendment to a land use plan.see,subd.b.the court concluded that pending city adoption and transmittal to the coastal commission of the commission suggested modifications to the ordinance,the coastal zoning ordinance can not be deemed approved.without approval of the commission suggested modifications to that ordinance,the court decided,the ordinance itself was inconsistent with several chapter policies and with ceqa pub.resources code,et.
the trial court determined that the and zoning ordinances could not have been in effect before december,when charter article xxvii took effect,because the ordinances were never certified by the coastal commission before december,the ordinances were ultimately rejected by the commission,and the city did not accept and formally approve of the modifications suggested by the commission until april.accordingly,the court determined that the city must submit the coastal zoning ordinance amendment to public vote and that the city must place the entire area local coastal program amendment including the coastal commission suggested modifications on the ballot.
the trial court rebuffed as spurious the city further argument that section could not apply to the local coastal program amendments because no coastal zoning ordinance had ever been certified for area in the first instance.the city had consistently treated the ordinance as an amendment to the zoning ordinance for the coastal zone.moreover,the court found that by september the city had an effectively certified local coastal program for the entire coastal zone and an effectively certified zoning ordinance for the coastal zone that contained development standards for area,along with definitions and procedural provisions applicable to both area and area.there is no doubting,the court stated,that the and ordinances purported to amend the c ity certified local coastal program,including its certified zoning ordinance,and thus their effective dates are determined by reference to a.neither ordinance,the court found,was certified by the coastal commission prior to the december,effective date of charter article xxvii.
the trial court ruled the city must submit the amendment to the city local coastal program for area to popular vote,as mandated by city law.the trial court therefore granted the petition for writ of mandate and declaratory relief in its entirety and ordered bbr to prepare and submit a judgment and writ.
after unsuccessfully seeking clarification of the court writ decision,the city interposed objections to the proposed writ of mandate and judgment submitted by bbr.the court signed the judgment as proposed on august,and it issued a writ of mandate on august.on august,appellants filed an appeal from the judgment.
on august and august,appellants voluntarily complied with the writ of mandate issued by the trial court and adopted all resolutions necessary to place measure g on the november,ballot the voters approved the ballot measure by a majority of percent.after obtaining the voters approval,the city submitted the modifications to the coastal commission executive director,who determined the city action was legally adequate and so reported to the coastal commission.the commission concurred with the executive director determination,and the certification of the area local coastal program became effective on january,
on september,bbr filed a motion requesting an award of costs and attorney fees of pursuant to code of civil procedure section,which included a multiplier of applied to the lodestar amount.the city opposed the motion.although the city did not dispute that bbr was entitled to an award of fees,the city asserted counsel rates were unreasonably high and the number of hours claimed was not reasonable.the city also claimed that there was no valid justification for applying a multiplier of to the lodestar amount of fees and that costs should not have been included in the claim for attorney fees.the city further argued that bbr was not entitled to attorney fees for administrative proceedings occurring prior to the lawsuit,and,in any case,the total fees should not exceed.
the trial court issued an order on october,awarding bbr attorney fees under code of civil procedure section.the court reduced the amount of precourt litigation fees,rejected the claim of costs,applied the full number of hours claimed for the court litigation along with a multiplier and awarded attorney fees in the sum of.
appellants timely appealed from the court order awarding attorney fees.we granted a motion to consolidate the appeal on the merits with the appeal of the attorney fee award.
contentions 
in its appeal,the city contends that its zoning and coastal land use plan amendments were not subject to voter approval requirements under the plain language of city charter article xxvii bbr claims that the and coastal zoning ordinances were legally ineffective are barred by the day statute of limitations governing challenges to the validity of zoning decisions the city was not precluded by the coastal act from adopting legally effective zoning ordinances in area prior to certification of a complete local coastal program the trial court erred in finding that minor amendments to the zoning and land use plan adopted by the city council at the request of the coastal commission constituted major changes in allowable land use subject to voter approval and the trial court abused its discretion in awarding attorney fees.as we hold below,all of appellants contentions except for the last are moot in light of appellants voluntary compliance with the writ of mandate.
discussion 
after filing a notice of appeal from the judgment on august,on august and,the city council took action to comply with the writ of mandate issued by the trial court by placing measure g on the november,ballot.
on september,while the election was pending,bbr moved this court for an order dismissing the appeal as moot and for sanctions against appellant for filing a frivolous appeal.bbr argued that the appeal should be dismissed because by complying with the judgment,appellants had waived the right to appeal.bbr asserted that the city council postjudgment actions and their implementation by the city clerk had taken the life out of the parties controversies.specifically,bbr stated that because the election day was only six weeks away,a decision on the merits of the appeal could have no practical effect in providing the city any effectual relief because no decision could be rendered by this court before election day.
appellants opposed the motion to dismiss the appeal,arguing among other things that a motion for attorney fees was then pending in the trial court,and entitlement to such fees was dependent upon the correctness of the judgment the outcome of the upcoming election would directly affect the merits of the appeal as to the declaratory relief portion of the judgment the writ of mandate purported to reserve to the trial court apparently unlimited authority to monitor and enforce city compliance during the election process and the issues on appeal concern issues of major interest to numerous other cities and counties located in the california coastal zone that as yet do not have a certified local coastal program for their entire coastal zone,issues which this court has the discretion to hear and decide.
both sides sought sanctions,either for filing and maintaining a patently frivolous appeal or for filing a frivolous motion.
on november,the voters of redondo beach overwhelmingly passed measure shortly afterwards,on november,this court denied the motion to dismiss the appeal and both of the motions for sanctions.the parties then proceeded to brief the appeal on the merits.
having conducted a detailed review of the record and the briefs on the merits,we now conclude that the city voluntary compliance with the trial court judgment and writ of mandate during the pendency of this appeal renders the appeal of the judgment moot.as the prior motion to dismiss was summarily denied in an unsigned order,the prior ruling denying bbr motion to dismiss the appeal is not binding upon us.kowis howard cal th,d.we may thus reexamine the issue of mootness to determine whether all or part of the pending appeals may be dismissed.see department of industrial relations nielsen construction th,fn,d summary denial of motion to dismiss appeal not law of the case.although the parties have not directly raised the question of mootness again in their briefs on the merits the court may examine a suggestion of mootness on its own motion.city of hollister monterey ins.th,d see also bullis charter school los altos school district th,d bullis.upon reexamination,we conclude that through their acceptance and compliance with the judgment,and having effectively carried out the judgment,appellants have waived the right to appeal from the judgment.
when the trial court granted a judgment for bbr and issued a writ of mandate,appellants had two available options,to appeal the judgment or to comply with it.city of carmel by the sea board of supervisors d.appellants chose to voluntarily comply with the judgment,thereby waiving their right to challenge it.see morehart county of santa barbara cal th,d,morehart compliance by county with trial court writ rendered dispute between parties over validity of zoning ordinances moot mhc operating limited partnership city of san jose th,d mhc city postjudgment action in amending rent control ordinance in compliance with trial court writ rendered appeal moot.
appellants postjudgment acquiescence in the judgment rendered the issues raised in their appeal of the judgment moot.appellants concede in their reply brief that i t is true that the voter approval of the minor amendments and all other zoning and coastal land use plan amendments on the november ballot and subsequent final certification of the local coastal program means that all measures passed by the city are now indisputably in effect for all purposes,and will remain so regardless of the outcome of this appeal.italics added.therefore,even if this court should grant appellants relief from the judgment as requested,it would have no effect on the results of the november,election,which are now indisputably in effect for all purposes as appellants acknowledge.however,a n action that involves only abstract or academic questions of law can not be maintained.citation.and an action that originally was based on a justiciable controversy can not be maintained on appeal if all the questions have become moot by subsequent acts or events.witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal,see also streator linscott cal.if the issues on appeal are rendered moot,a reversal would be without practical effect,and the appeal will be dismissed.witkin,supra,appeal,in re jessica th,d,citing eye dog foundation state board of guide dogs for the blind cal d,eye dog foundation.
as we have explained it is well settled that an appellate court will decide only actual controversies and that a live appeal may be rendered moot by events occurring after the notice of appeal was filed.we will not render opinions on moot questions or abstract propositions,or declare principles of law which can not affect the matter at issue on appeal.daily journal county of los angeles th,d see also giles horn th,d,quoting finnie town of tiburon d.it is well settled that an appellate court will decide only actual controversies.consistent therewith,it has been said that an action which originally was based upon a justiciable controversy can not be maintained on appeal if the questions raised therein have become moot by subsequent acts or events wilson county civil service com.d,although a case may originally present an existing controversy,if before decision it has,through act of the parties or other cause,occurring after the commencement of the action,lost that essential character,it becomes a moot case or question which will not be considered by the court.
the general rule regarding mootness,however,is tempered by the court discretionary authority to decide moot issues.when an action involves a matter of continuing public interest that is likely to recur,a court may exercise an inherent discretion to resolve that issue,even if an event occurring during the pendency of the appeal normally would render the matter moot.morehart,supra,cal th at,d,mhc,supra,th at,d eye dog foundation,supra,cal d at,bullis,supra,th at.another exception exists when,despite the happening of a subsequent event,material questions remain for the court determination.eye dog foundation,supra,at,bullis,supra,at,d.this exception has been applied to declaratory relief actions on the basis that the court must do complete justice once jurisdiction has been assumed.eye dog foundation,supra,at.
in the present case,appellants compliance with the trial court judgment has already taken place and the election ordered by the court has now been held.on august,the day before the filing of the notice of appeal,the city council adopted resolutions placing the area local coastal program amendment on the november,ballot on august,the council adopted further resolutions amending the august resolutions in compliance with the trial court judgment.city clerk manzano implemented those resolutions as measure g,which was overwhelmingly approved by the electorate.the reversal sought by appellants would be an exercise in futility because the election bbr sought has already taken place as ordered by the trial court.appellants can not maintain an appeal that their own discretionary decisions have rendered nonappealable and nonjusticiable.appellants could have requested that the trial court stay enforcement of the writ or sought a writ of supersedeas had there been any issue of the judgment being enforced pending appeal,but they did not.see city of hollister monterey ins,supra,th at,d witkin,cal.procedure,supra,appeal.
moreover,the appeal of the judgment in this case presents issues that are unlikely to recur and thus does not justify our exercise of discretion to resolve moot questions in opposing the action in the court below and on appeal,appellants have taken the position that the and ordinances were precursor ordinances predating december,the date charter article xxvii became law,and thus the ordinances were not subject to the vote of the electors.by logical necessity,no future zoning ordinances purporting to amend the city local coastal program can ever be passed by the city council prior to the effective date of charter article xxvii.appellants assert that there are coastal jurisdictions with incomplete local coastal programs and the issue of the legality of precertification amendments to local zoning regulations has a reasonable probability of recurring.as bbr notes,however,the unusual facts giving rise to the present suit with its unique ties to local events likely will not be replicated again.nor is there merit to the argument that the claim for declaratory relief still presents a justiciable issue.bbr has acknowledged that its primary aim in the litigation was a writ commanding appellants to place the entire area local coastal program amendment to a public vote and the declaratory relief claim was merely ancillary to,and explanatory of,the writ relief.moreover,as bbr notes,appellants have never disputed that any future major changes in allowable land use in the coastal zone passed by the city council will be subject to the voter approval requirement of charter article xxvii.
appellants assert that,when a petitioner has sought and been awarded attorney fees based on its success in the trial court under the private attorney general doctrine or other statute,a subsequent appeal on the merits is not subject to dismissal.appellants claim their appeal from the judgment is not moot because the award of attorney fees is dependent upon the propriety of the trial court ruling on the merits of the action.they maintain that a reversal of the trial court ruling on the merits necessarily would require reversal of any award of attorney fees,as bbr would no longer qualify as a prevailing or successful party for purposes of the attorney fee claim.we disagree.
appellants rely on four cases for their proposition.center for biological diversity county of san bernardino th,d center for biological diversity carson citizens for reform kawagoe th,d kawagoe mapstead anchundo th,d mapstead save our residential environment city of west hollywood th,d save our residential environment.we find the cases are not controlling here.
center for biological diversity and save our residential environment both arise under the provisions of ceqa.unlike the appeal here,they involved the rights of third parties,who exercised their own,separate right of appeal from judgments finding environmental impact reports eir for their projects inadequate and thus ordering the agency to perform further eir review.center for biological diversity,supra,th at,d save our residential environment,supra,th at,d.in center for biological diversity,the objectors had filed a petition for writ of mandate against the county however,the real party in interest had a written indemnity agreement with the county under which the real party was required to reimburse the county for any attorney fees incurred in a legal action arising from the proposed project.center for biological diversity,supra,at,d.the court of appeal held that the real party in interest was aggrieved and had standing to appeal the judgment and attorney fees order and that the county voluntary compliance with the writ of mandate did not render the appeal of the judgment moot.id.at,d.in save our residential environment,m ultiple notices of appeal were filed,and all the appeals were consolidated.save our residential environment,supra,at,d.the question arose whether the city had waived its right to appeal by complying with the writ.id.at,d.after first reasoning that the appeal was not moot b ecause the award of attorney fees depends on the propriety of the trial court ruling on the merits of the action,the court noted that even if the city has waived its right to appeal the issuance of the writ by complying with its directives,the city is powerless to waive the real party in interest right to appeal.id.at,d.the material facts in both cases therefore are distinguishable from our case as there are no third party rights at stake here.
mapstead and kawagoe are also distinguishable.both involved local election officials with ministerial duties to verify petition signature requirements to be complied with by petition signers,circulators and proponents requirements intended to safeguard the integrity of the electoral proc
