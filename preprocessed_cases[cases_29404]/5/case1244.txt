shirley graham brought suit after she was denied disability benefits under a plan administered by hartford life accident insurance company hartford.the district court for the northern district of oklahoma concluded that hartford denial of graham claim violated the employment retirement income security act erisa because hartford decision was arbitrary and capricious.the court did not award graham benefits,but instead remanded the claim to hartford for a full and fair redetermination.graham appeals both the decision to remand and the court earlier decision that erisa preempted her state law claim.in companion case,wl graham appeals the court denial of her request for attorney fees.
we conclude that the district court order to remand graham claim for benefits to hartford is not a final decision that gives rise to our jurisdiction under.because graham will have the opportunity later to appeal the issues before us once a final judgment has been entered,we dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.we further hold that graham related action for attorney fees is not ripe,and therefore vacate the district court denial of her request for fees,and remand with directions to dismiss her motion without prejudice.
background 
graham was employed by the united states postal service since as a mail carrier.she also was a member of the relevant union,the national rural letter carriers association nrlca.in,while carrying mail,graham encountered a small but aggressive dog.in stepping away from the dog,she backed off the sidewalk and twisted her knee.this injury required surgery and precipitated more problems in her knees and feet,including osteoarthritis.despite her attempt to work in a sedentary position for the postal service from to,she continued to have health problems.
nrlca offered its members the opportunity to participate in a disability insurance plan.even though the collective bargaining agreement with the postal service did not provide for such a plan,the nrlca arranged for the postal service to deduct premiums from its participating employees paychecks.graham applied to participate in the nrlca disability benefits plan,and became insured on november.
graham last day of work was july.she applied for disability retirement with the postal service,which was approved on december.on october,graham filed a claim for disability benefits with hartford,the administrator of nrlca disability plan.graham submitted a statement from her attending physician,jeffrey emel,that diagnosed ankle osteophytes and an ankle sprain.hartford considered graham claim in early,and sought a clarification from emel regarding graham ankle and knee problems.hartford then denied graham claim on the basis that she did not meet the plan definition of totally disabled,defined as unable to perform the essential duties of one occupation and as a result earn less than percent of one earnings.hartford specifically concluded that graham most recent occupation was classified as sedentary,and that she had not shown that she could not perform sedentary work.graham appealed,submitting additional documentation from emel in which he stated that graham could not drive or sit for more than an hour at any one time.however,hartford again rejected graham claim on the same basis as its previous denial.graham made a second and final internal appeal to hartford,which again denied her claim because it concluded a job that accommodated her disability was available to her.
having exhausted her internal appeals,graham filed suit in federal court on february,invoking the court diversity jurisdiction.she alleged that hartford had breached its duty of good faith and fair oklahoma state law failing to investigate,evaluate and pay graham claims properly.she further alleged that hartford malicious and intentional conduct had caused her extreme emotional distress and financial losses.as a remedy,she sought actual and punitive damages.
graham complaint did not mention erisa.erisa provides a private right of action to a beneficiary under an plan,but limits a claimant remedies to recover y of benefits due to him and enforce ment of his rights under the terms of the plan.a b.erisa does not allow consequential or punitive damages.see allison unum life ins,cir.
the district court first decided that the nrlca plan was governed by erisa,and that erisa preempted graham state law claim.specifically,the court found that the nrlca plan did not fall under the governmental plan exception to erisa coverage,because the insurance lacked an adequate connection to governmental control,functional responsibilities and financial support.the district court accordingly dismissed graham state law claim against hartford.the court then ordered the parties to submit an administrative record within days so the court could review the merits of graham claim for benefits under the nrlca plan.in so doing,the court apparently converted graham complaint to an erisa action.there is no indication in the record that graham objected at this time to the court decision to substitute her state law claim with one brought under erisa.
eight months later,the district court ruled on the merits of graham claim for benefits employing erisa,the court concluded that hartford decision was arbitrary and capricious,specifically that it failed to prove that its denial of benefits was supported by substantial evidence under sandoval aetna life cas.ins,cir.the court faulted hartford for relying on the fact that graham had been able to work in a modified job for the postal service,even though the postal service established the accommodation three years prior to her disability benefits claim giving undue weight to a single statement by her treating physician that was not consistent with the other medical evidence in the record and not undertaking an independent medical review in the face of conflicting evidence.the court did not state that graham was necessarily eligible for disability benefits,but instead found that,in v iewing the record as a whole,hartford did not meet its evidentiary burden to support the denial of benefits to graham.
the district court did not award graham benefits instead,the court remanded her claim to hartford for a full and fair redetermination.the district court did not state whether or not it would retain jurisdiction over the matter.however,the docket entries administratively entered for this decision indicate that the court was the case.
graham petitioned the district court for attorney fees,which may be awarded at the court discretion under erisa.see g.the court applied our standard from gordon steel,cir,and determined that a fee award would be inappropriate.specifically,the court said it had made no finding of bad faith on the part of hartford,and noted that the record does not suggest that plaintiff claim for benefits is particularly meritorious.
on appeal,graham seeks to revive her state law claim,contending that nrlca disability insurance is a governmental plan exempt from erisa because the postal service recognizes the nrlca as a union argues that the court should have awarded her disability benefits rather than remanding the claim to hartford and asserts that an award of attorney fees is appropriate,alleging that hartford engaged in bad faith conduct.
hartford does not appeal the district court conclusion that its decision was arbitrary and capricious.instead,hartford argues that we have no jurisdiction over this appeal,on the theory that a district court decision to remand a claim to a plan administrator is not a final appealable decision under the meaning of.
ii.jurisdiction and finality 
we have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the united states.it is well settled that we can only address the underlying merits of a lawsuit if it meets the requirements for appellate jurisdiction outlined in.albright unum life ins,cir.a final decision is one that ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.rekstad first bank,cir quoting catlin united states.in considering whether the judgment constitutes a final decision under,the label used to describe the judicial demand is not is,we must analyze the substance of the district court decision,not its label or form.albright,at quotation,citation omitted.
thus,we must determine if the district court order to remand,which is the decision giving rise to this appeal,is final the tenth circuit has declined to adopt a rule regarding whether a district court order remanding a benefits determination to a plan administrator is final,and therefore appealable,under.the decision should be made on a basis applying principles governing final decisions.rekstad,at see also metzger unum life ins,cir same.in rekstad,both parties appealed a district court order to remand a benefits determination claim to the plan administrator after the court concluded that the administrator decision to deny benefits was arbitrary and capricious because it unreasonably relied on one particular doctor medical examination.at.we held that the decision to remand was not final in that case.
likening a benefits determination to a computation of damages,we noted that we had previously held that a district court grant of summary judgment to the plaintiff on an erisa claim that left the question of damages unresolved was not a final appealable order.id.at citing albright.t he rule is that an order determining liability but leaving damages to be calculated is not final unless the correct amount of damages is and not likely to be the subject of future appeal.id.and a district court remand of a benefits decision to a plan administrator similarly is indeterminate.id.
in rekstad,we also drew a comparison between a district court remand to a plan administrator and a remand to an administrative agency,calling it perhaps the best analogue to an erisa remand.id.at.in the administrative context,a remand order is generally considered a nonfinal decision not subject to immediate review in the court of appeals.id.quoting guigni,cir.we recently reiterated the administrative agency analogue in metzger.see at.
however,we also have held that the practical finality rule provides an important caveat that could result in jurisdiction over an appeal of a remand decision.rekstad,at.the practical finality rule may be invoked when the lack of immediate review of an order for an administrative remand would violate basic judicial principles,at quoting bender clark,cir.in the context of a district court order remanding a matter to an administrative agency,jurisdiction may be appropriate when the issue presented is both urgent and important.trout unlimited dep t of,cir citing bender,at.if these two conditions are met,this court will apply a balancing test and assert jurisdiction if the danger of injustice by delaying appellate review outweighs the inconvenience and costs of piecemeal review.id.quoting bender,at.under this rule,we review orders to remand a matter to an administrative agency when it is necessary to ensure that we can review important legal questions which a remand may make effectively unreviewable,because administrative agencies may be barred from seeking district court and thus circuit court review of their own administrative decisions.rekstad,at see also metzger,at.
we have observed that the practical finality rule has led a checkered life in both our court and the united states supreme court,and we have openly questioned whether the doctrine of practical finality is still viable,at quotations omitted.we have suggested,though,that the doctrine is more robust in the context of agency review.see id.noting that this court has developed a particular form of practical finality as a prudential limitation on the rule rekstad,at noting the practical finality rule exists in the administrative agency context,if nowhere else.still,we have cautioned that the doctrine must be narrowly construed to preserve the vitality of.trout unlimited,at alteration,quotation omitted.
pursuant to rekstad rule that we evaluate the finality of an erisa remand order on a basis,and applying the factors discussed in rekstad,the district court order here remanding graham claim to hartford is not final.the district court did not decide that graham was eligible for benefits.it concluded only that hartford denial of her benefits violated erisa because hartford decision was arbitrary and capricious.graham articulates no argument that a remand of her benefits claim to hartford falls within the practical finality exception employed by this circuit we discern nothing on appeal that is urgent or presents a danger of injustice if not immediately appealable.trout unlimited,at.
hartford redetermination of graham,hartford assured the court at oral argument,would be de lead to an award of benefits for graham.if hartford again determines that graham is ineligible for benefits,she may return to district court to argue that hartford decision violates erisa we observe that hartford has conceded that if its benefits determination on remand is unfavorable to graham,she may simply move to reopen the case,or file an amended complaint to address any dissatisfaction with hartford decision on remand.
graham argues that the district court decision to remand is final in her case because it is based on the earlier decision to dismiss her state law claim that sought punitive damages,a type of relief that is not available from either a plan administrator on remand or a court reviewing the decision under erisa but this argument does not change the availability of appellate review after hartford redetermines graham claim for benefits.after the remand to hartford,graham still can appeal the district court decision that erisa preempts her state law claim,and if successful,she will be able to pursue punitive damages.in other words,this is not a situation in which remand may make either the district court earlier decision that erisa preempted graham state law claim or the merits of hartford decision on graham claim for benefits effectively unreviewable.rekstad,at.
graham also contends that the order is a final judgment,because to hold otherwise allows a plan administrator to delay awarding benefits with impunity,since the administrator is not penalized for improperly denying benefits in the first instance.but the mere fact that erisa does not expressly penalize a plan administrator for its initial arbitrary and capricious issue of statutory design that rests in the hands of not warrant a change in our jurisprudence surrounding finality 
we note that although circuits vary on how they approach the issue of finality in cases involving erisa remand orders,see metzger,at describing the circuit split,graham would fare no better under most of those approaches.the majority of circuits have relied on one of the analogues invoked in rekstad or the collateral order doctrine in deciding whether a decision to remand a benefits decision to a plan administrator is final.see borntrager cent.states,se.sw.areas pension fund,cir following the first,sixth,ninth,tenth and eleventh circuits in holding that an order remanding to an erisa plan administrator for further proceedings is interlocutory in nature and therefore not immediately appealable,particularly when the district court retained jurisdiction or otherwise deferred considering the merits of the administrator decision being reviewed.the sixth circuit has found that an order to remand was not final,in part because the assessment of damages or awarding of other relief remains to be resolved.bowers sheet metal workers pension fund,cir quoting liberty mut.ins.wetzel,d.
a number of other circuits apply the comparatively strict collateral order doctrine as a means for appealing a remand to a plan administrator,and in cases similar to the one at bar,hold that a district court remand order is not final.see borntrager,at reiterating supreme court precedent that the doctrine is a narrow exception and noting that w hile there may be factors unique to the world of administrative law that justify a somewhat broader final order exception for orders remanding to federal agencies,in our view no such factors apply to orders remanding to private erisa plan administrators petralia v.at t global info.solutions,cir holding a remand order
