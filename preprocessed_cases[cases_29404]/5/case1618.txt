law offices of dimitri gross and dimitri gross for defendant and respondent.
plaintiff and appellant nancy lee hired attorney william hanley to represent her in certain civil litigation.after the litigation settled,lee sought a refund of unearned attorney fees and unused expert witness fees she had advanced to attorney hanley.not having received a refund,lee hired attorney walter wilson and terminated the services of attorney hanley.attorney hanley thereafter refunded certain expert witness fees,but no attorney fees.more than a year after hiring attorney wilson,lee filed a lawsuit against attorney hanley seeking the return of attorney fees.
attorney hanley filed a demurrer to lee second amended complaint,based on the statute of limitations contained in code of civil procedure section the court sustained the demurrer and dismissed the action with prejudice.lee appeals.we reverse.
section provides the statute of limitations for an action based on a wrongful act or omission,other than for actual fraud,arising in the performance of professional services according to the plain wording of the statute,to the extent the wrongful act or omission in question arises in the performance of professional services,the statute applies to the extent the wrongful act or omission in question does not arise in the performance of professional services,the statute is inapplicable.
this notwithstanding,it seems that almost any time a client brings an action against his or her attorney the wrongful act in question is construed as one arising in the performance of legal services,such that section applies.but surely it can not be the case that every conceivable act an attorney may take that affects his or her client is one arising in the performance of legal services.for example,if a client leaves her purse unattended in the attorney office and the attorney takes money from it,would we say that act arose in the performance of legal services how different is it if,when the legal services have been completed and the attorney representation has been terminated,the attorney keeps the unearned fees belonging to the client to steal from a client is not to render legal services to him or her.we hold that,to the extent a claim is construed as a wrongful act not arising in the performance of legal services,such as garden variety theft or conversion,section is inapplicable.
the matter before us was resolved at the demurrer stage,before the facts were developed.however,the r esolution of a statute of limitations defense normally is a factual question citation.city of san diego gypsum th,baright willis d.here,the facts alleged in lee second amended complaint could be construed as giving rise to a cause of action for the theft or conversion of an identifiable sum of money belonging to her.this being the case,we can not say that lee second amended complaint demonstrates clearly and affirmatively on its face that her action is necessarily barred by the section statute of limitations.stueve.farms,llc berger kahn th,stueve.farms.because this action has not reached a point where the court can determine whether the wrongful act in question arose in the performance of legal services,and thus,whether or not section applies,the demurrer should not have been sustained.
in her second amended complaint,lee alleged that the litigation attorney hanley had handled for her settled on january,the lawsuit was dismissed three days later,and attorney hanley did no further work on the matter thereafter.attached to her second amended complaint were copies of a february,letter from attorney hanley to lee and a february,invoice for legal services.the letter stated that lee had a credit balance of and the invoice so reflected.the invoice itemized work performed in january,including the drafting of a settlement agreement and cover letter on january.lee also alleged that in april,she telephoned attorney hanley and asked for a final billing statement and a return of her unused funds but that attorney hanley,in a harsh manner,told her she had no credit balance and would receive no refund.
on december,lee and attorney wilson each sent a letter to attorney hanley demanding the refund of in unearned attorney fees plus approximately in unused expert witness fees.by these letters,lee terminated the services of attorney hanley and she and attorney wilson each informed him that attorney wilson would pursue the collection of the monies owed by attorney hanley to lee and also would handle any remaining matters associated with the settled litigation.
in her second amended complaint,lee also alleged that,on or about december,attorney hanley returned in unused expert witness fees.however,he never returned the in unearned attorney fees.
on december,lee filed her initial complaint against attorney hanley.attorney hanley filed a demurrer based on the statute of limitations.however,before that demurrer was heard,lee filed a first amended complaint.the court ruled that the demurrer was moot.
attorney hanley filed a demurrer to the first amended complaint,also on the basis of the statute of limitations.the court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend.
lee then filed her second amended complaint and attorney hanley filed another demurrer,again based on the statute of limitations.the court sustained the demurrer with leave to file a further amended complaint.in her opening brief on appeal,lee represents,albeit without citation to the record,that the court sustained the demurrer with respect to all grounds other than fraud,but gave lee leave to amend with respect to allegations based on fraud.lee also states that because she was unwilling to plead fraud against hanley,she did not file a further amended complaint.the court dismissed her action with prejudice.
discussiona.preliminary matter request for judicial notice 
lee has filed a request for judicial notice,in which she asks this court to take notice of certain portions of the legislative history of section,and certain correspondence concerning her complaint to the state bar of california about attorney hanley.attorney hanley opposes the motion.he says lee failed to put the documents in question before the trial court and they are,in any event,irrelevant to the issues raised in this appeal.
the fact that lee did not address the legislative history of section in the trial court does not mean she may not raise it on appeal from a judgment of dismissal following the sustaining of a demurrer.an appellate court may consider new theories on appeal from the sustaining of a demurer to challenge or justify the ruling.as a general rule a party is not permitted to raise new issues not presented in the trial court.citation.however,a litigant may raise for the first time on appeal a pure question of law which is presented by undisputed facts.citations.a demurrer is directed to the face of a complaint code civ,subd.a and it raises only questions of law citations.thus an appellant challenging the sustaining of a general demurrer may change his or her theory on appeal citation,and an appellate court can affirm or reverse the ruling on new grounds.citations.after all,we review the validity of the ruling and not the reasons given.citation.b p development city of saratoga d.
in this case,the proper interpretation of section is a question of law and this court may consider the legislative history of section in addressing the issue.consequently,we grant lee request to take judicial notice of the portions of the legislative history attached as exhibits through to her request.
however,the correspondence concerning the state bar investigation of lee complaint about attorney hanley is irrelevant to the determination of the issues on appeal.consequently,we deny lee request to take judicial notice of the documents attached as exhibit to her request.

performance of professional services 
levin and prakashpalan cases 
lee argues that the plain wording of section shows the statute is inapplicable to her case.she says attorney hanley completed his legal work when the litigation he was handling was settled and the case was dismissed.any actions he took thereafter,including the wrongful keeping of the money belonging to her,were not part of the performance of professional services,because the performance of professional services had terminated.she also contends that the misappropriation of client funds can not be construed as the performance of professional services,no matter what the timing.
attorney hanley disagrees,citing levin graham james th levin and prakashpalan engstrom,lipscomb lack th prakashpalan.in levin,the plaintiff stated causes of action for malpractice,identified unconscionable attorney fees as an aspect of malpractice,and requested a refund of unconscionable attorney fees as a remedy for malpractice.under the facts of the case,the court rejected the assertion that a claim of unconscionable attorney fees was anything other than a claim for malpractice,subject to section.the court observed that the plaintiff had asserted no claim independent of attorney malpractice,such as money had and received,and had not suggested another statute of limitations.levin,supra,th at.
according to attorney hanley,levin,supra,th shows that lee claim for a refund of attorney fees is subject to the statute of limitations contained in section.however,that case is distinguishable from the one before us.the court in levin did not address either a demurrer or a situation where the plaintiff had asserted a cause of action other than malpractice.furthermore,it did not purport to address all possible claims with respect to attorney fees,such as claims of theft or conversion.
here,lee expressed her general satisfaction with attorney hanley performance of services.her claim that the credit balance belonged to her was not based on either malpractice or the unconscionability of the fee.rather,she simply sought the return of money belonging to her,on various causes of action,including money had and received.levin,supra,th simply does not control.
we turn now to prakashpalan,supra,th.in that case,the plaintiffs alleged that the defendant law firm settled a class action lawsuit for insureds in november,but that the plaintiffs,as class members,did not learn until february that the defendant had failed to fully
