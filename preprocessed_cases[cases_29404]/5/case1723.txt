facts and procedual history 
a.the schlage lock site and upc development plans 
upc is a real estate development firm.in,it purchased real property in the brisbane area adjacent to a property owned by the corporation,known as the schlage lock site.the schlage lock site was contaminated with acid used in metal works and with fuel from railroad operations by the southern pacific railroad.this contamination was migrating to upc property.upc wished to acquire the schlage lock site so it could control the environmental of that site as well as that of its own property.it planned to develop both properties as part of a larger project.
in,upc sued in federal court,seeking to gain control of the schlage lock site.the parties agreed to dismiss the case and toll the statute of limitations to see if they could agree on a joint remediation plan or an arrangement for upc to purchase the property.this tolling agreement expired when upc not cp m failed to renew it and refused to execute a new agreement.in early,upc attempted to negotiate the purchase of the schlage lock site,but those talks ceased because insisted on complete indemnity for future litigation arising from the contamination,to be secured by a million line of credit.
upc retains cp m as counsel negotiates a retainer agreement 
in may,upc retained cp m to develop a litigation strategy for acquiring the schlage lock site so that upc could clean up the property and proceed with development.upc initially hired cp m on an hourly basis,not to exceed in fees and costs,for the limited purpose of rendering an opinion on the best way to move forward.
both ucp and cp m recognized the risks and extreme difficulties of litigation against.upc wanted to avoid attorney fees and allocate some of the risk of litigation to cp m through a contingency fee agreement.because upc was seeking to acquire the schlage lock property,another concern was determining the value of any settlement that included the acquisition of that property.cp m was concerned that a contingency fee based on the value of the contaminated property alone would be too low.
between may and july of,upc and cp m negotiated the details of a contingency fee retainer agreement designed to meet the parties various concerns.attorney phillip gregory represented cp m in the negotiation and upc was represented by steve hanson,its general manager,and attorney mike mccracken,its outside counsel.cp m initially proposed a hybrid agreement under which cp m would charge a reduced hourly rate,plus costs,as well as a percent contingency on any monies received in the resolution of the case with of hourly billed subtracted from.this proposal was memorialized in a june draft of the agreement,which also provided that if upc received property rather than cash,cp m would get paid with a multiplier.
in response to this proposal,hanson sent an to cp m stating that instead of the multiplier the double fee system,as he put it,upc would prefer to agree to value the property and pay including that same percentage on any other settlement cash.in other words we are going to sue for damages,these damages most probably would be over and above the property value anyway.an internal memorandum circulated by cp m suggested that under this proposal,if upc made a settlement demand of million,and in response was offered the property for,cp m would get a percentage of million.after cp m indicated that it would agree to some version of this proposal,the parties continued to work on the language.
gregory hanson and mccracken,stating,i will put together a revised contingency agreement tonight and fax it to you.it will provide that in the event of the acquisition of the property by upc that our firm receives a contingency payment based on the last settlement offer made by upc to,correct hanson responded,why would we talk about when we were going to pay you some base fees and then pay you that the deal we like.i guess the question is,can we fairly determine the value of the whole settlement if the property is exchanged i would think the answer would be reasonably yes.
gregory sent hanson a new draft of the fee agreement and copied mccracken on the.paragraph of this new version provided,the settlement of this case may involve upc or a related entity acquiring real property from one or more defendants.in such an event,the amount of the contingency fee payable to cp m would be difficult to value.if such a settlement occurs,upc has specifically requested that cp m be paid a percentage of the dollar value of the last settlement offer made to defendants that does not include acquisition of real property as part of the consideration payable to upc.therefore,in the event that settlement of the case includes a provision whereby upc or any of its related entities acquires real property from one or more defendants,the fee payable to cp m shall include two parts a upc shall pay cp m a sum equal to of the dollar value of the last settlement proposal made by upc to defendants that did not include,as a component of the settlement proposal,a provision for acquisition of the property and b in addition to the contingency set forth in subparagraph a,above,upc agrees to pay attorneys fees under the may hourly agreement at reduced rates an example of the foregoing is attached to this agreement.
attorney mccracken sent an to gregory and hanson in which he stated that this draft confused him and proposed the following solution if and upc reach a global settlement,and a transfer of the property is the consideration,then it follows that the property must first of necessity be assigned a fair market value,which,of course,will by done by an mai member of the appraisal institute appraiser the fair market value must,by appraisal practices,be based upon the highest and best use.this will be an amount certain,without regard for deductions for remediation costs,demolition and diminution in value.this is the number that will serve as the base number for calculating the contingency.i will give two examples to illustrate my point both assume an appraisal of which may or may not be in the ballpark the property is appraised at.upc total damages,insurance,demolition,diminution of value are.settlement occurs based on these numbers.upc writes a check to for.cp m contingent fee is of.the property is appraised at.upc total damages are.settlement occurs based on these numbers.conveys the property to upc and writes a check to upc for.cp m contingent fee is of.
gregory responded that mccracken had captured the basic point and asked mccracken to draft the language for the final agreement.mccracken proposed that to speed things up,gregory should simply revise cp m contingent fee paragraph to reflect mccracken formula,use fair market value,as determined by an agreed upon mai appraiser as the basis for calculating the contingent fee total damages,remediation costs,insurance,demolition,diminution in value will not enter into this analysis,unless of course they exceed the fair market value gregory responded,here the proposal as i understand it upc will be seeking damages totaling past costs of remediation.x future costs of remediation.y diminished fmv of the property based on an appraisal z upc settlement position will be based on x y or if upc settles with defendants where defendants transfer their property to upc for some consideration from upc,then the contingency will be calculated by taking an agreed percentage of the greater of x y or z.correct 
final version of the retainer agreement including hypothetical 
the final version of the retainer agreement was signed by the parties on july.hanson signed on behalf of upc after reviewing the agreement with mccracken.paragraph of the agreement was entitled fees and costs and provided as follows upc agrees to pay attorneys fees on the following basis.it is understood that no specific fee is set by law,and that this contingent percentage fee has been specifically negotiated and agreed to between the parties.the sum of sixteen percent of the net amounts of any monies recovered by compromise or trial.these monies include any and all sums paid by the defendants to upc to remediate,or pay for loss of value of the property.in addition to the contingency set forth in paragraph,above,upc agrees to pay attorneys fees under the may hourly agreement attached however,the hourly rates shall be reduced to for partners and for associates.should there be a recovery pursuant to paragraph,above,upc shall be credited against the above for of the attorneys fees paid,if any,to cp m.the settlement of this case may involve upc or a related entity acquiring real property from one or more defendants.in such an event,the amount of the contingency fee payable to cp m would be difficult to value.if such a settlement occurs,upc has specifically requested that cp m be paid a percentage of an amount equal to the greater of the fair market value based on its highest and best use of upc real property as determined by a registered mai appraiser in the litigation the fair market value of the property,or the total damages suffered by upc remediation costs,insurance,demolition and diminution in value.therefore,in the event that settlement of the case includes a provision whereby upc or any of its related entities acquires real property from one or more defendants,the fees payable to cp m shall include two parts a upc shall pay cp m a contingency sum equal to sixteen percent of the greater of i the fair market value of the property,or ii the total damages as contained in upc most recent damages assessment made for settlement purposes and b in addition to the contingency set forth in subparagraph a,above,upc agrees to pay attorneys fees under the may hourly agreement however,the hourly rates shall be reduced to for partners and for associates.should there be a recovery pursuant to this paragraph,upc shall be credited against the above for of the attorneys fees paid,if any.said sums are due at the time the settlement agreement is executed.an example of the foregoing is attached to this agreement.
attached to the retainer agreement was a hypothetical example of alternative contingency described in paragraph of fee agreement.this hypothetical assumed that an mai appraiser concluded the fair market value of the property at its highest and best use was,and that upc had performed a damages analysis for settlement purposes and concluded its total damages were,without taking into consideration the acquisition of the property.assuming upc accepted an offer by to sell the schlage lock site to upc for in exchange for indemnification,cp m would be entitled to percent of the fair market value of the property after adjusting for litigation costs which was greater than the million in total damages,and would also be entitled to collect its hourly fees,less a credit to upc for of the fees paid.the hypothetical also stated,had upc total damages been an amount great er than the fair market value,then the calculation would have been performed using the total damages figure and upc would owe a contingency fee based on that number.
the retainer agreement also provided for arbitration in the event of a dispute over the fee in the event that any dispute arises relating to this agreement or cp m performance of services hereunder,it is agreed that such dispute shall be submitted to judicial arbitration mediation services jams in san francisco.upc agrees to submit to the jurisdiction of jams sf for purposes of enforcing this arbitration.the dispute shall be conclusively decided,without appeal or review,by a mutually agreeable jams judge upc specifically waives a right to a jury trial or court trial to resolve any dispute under this agreement and understands this waiver after consulting with independent counsel.this agreement to arbitrate is not intended to abrogate upc right to require a fee arbitration pursuant to california business professions code.
litigation and settlement of the litigation 
cp m filed a complaint against on behalf of upc,and against union pacific railroad.the matter was litigated aggressively by cp m,which filed numerous motions and conducted extensive discovery and negotiations.in september,hanson sent an to gregory estimating the settlement value of the case to be million and the damages to be between million and million.upc presented a settlement conference statement that estimated its damages to be between million and million.the following settlement was ultimately reached upc would acquire the schlage lock property would pay million to upc for damages and upc would have the right to pursue claims against union pacific railroad a right that cp m believed had no value.upc was not required to indemnify as a condition of the settlement.
fee dispute and arbitration 
cp m sent a letter to upc claiming legal fees of over million,reflecting percent of the average of the damages range set forth in upc settlement statement million to million.upc took the position that the contingency should be calculated based on the actual value of the property and cash received in settlement,not on its calculation of damages.as called for by the fee agreement,cp m initiated arbitration proceedings with jams to determine the amount of the fee owed to it by upc.
upc demanded a fee arbitration under business and professions code sections,which was submitted to the san mateo county bar association.the bar association arbitrators awarded cp m in fees on a quantum meruit basis.upc rejected this award and requested that the jams arbitration proceed.
the jams arbitration was heard before the rebecca westerfeld ret.cp m proposed alternative methods of calculating the fee owed under the agreement that took into account upc damages assessment of between million and million.cp m alternatively argued that the contingency should be based on the million settlement value that hanson had placed on the case in september,along with the million in cash received as part of the settlement.upc responded that the contingency agreement was unconscionable and unenforceable due to a lack of mutual assent,mistake and misrepresentation.it took the position that the parties always intended to base the contingency fee on the value of the property and cash received,not on the damages assessment.upc urged the arbitrator to calculate the fee based on either the original hourly fee agreement or quantum meruit,which would result in an award of between and.
following a arbitration hearing,judge westerfeld issued a decision thoroughly discussing the facts and legal principles applicable to the case and awarding cp m in fees.she reasoned as follows the value of the real estate obtained by upc as part of the settlement,by upc own reckoning during the arbitration,was million.although the damages range appearing in the settlement conference statement million to million was inflated for purposes of negotiation,hanson,the general manager of upc,had calculated its damages to be between million and million in september and had conveyed that figure to gregory of cp m.this was the best evidence of the upc most recent damages assessment made for settlement purposes under the retainer agreement,and it exceeded the fair market value of the real property.using the lower figure of million in damages,cp m was entitled to of this amount,or million,less half of the amount already billed under the hourly fee agreement,less in litigation costs,for a total award of.judge westerfeld declined to award prejudgment interest as requested by cp 
judge westerfeld specifically rejected upc argument that the contingency fee agreement was unconscionable.she noted that there had been no disparity in bargaining power between upc and cp m that upc was a very sophisticated client represented by independent counsel in the negotiation of the fee arrangement that upc and its attorney had the opportunity to review the retainer agreement before it was signed and that cp m had done an excellent job for upc,reaching what hanson had characterized as a stupendous result.contingency fees,in judge westerfeld experience,typically range from percent to percent of a settlement amount,and a contingency of percent is not unconscionable.during the arbitration,upc itself had valued the settlement at million for the fair market value of the property,plus million in cash,meaning that the approximately million in attorney fees fell well within this range.judge westerfeld also rejected arguments that the fee agreement and its reference to total damages was too vague to be enforced.
petition to confirm arbitration award 
cp m filed a petition to confirm the arbitration award,which was granted by the superior court over upc objection.code civ.the trial court specifically considered and rejected the argument that the award violated public policy.judgment was entered in favor of cp m and this appeal follows.
ii.discussion 
upc urges us to reverse the judgment confirming the arbitrator award of approximately million in attorney fees as unconscionable.cp m responds that the substance of the arbitration award may not be judicially reviewed because upc contractually agreed to resolve any fee dispute through arbitration and to be bound by the outcome of that arbitration.upc argues that judicial review is appropriate because the award violates a public policy against unconscionable legal fees and thus exceeded the arbitrator power under code of civil procedure section.
the trial court concluded that in light of the arbitrator findings of fact,upc had not carried its burden of showing the award of fees was unconscionable and a violation of public policy.see woodside homes of,superior court th,party asserting unconscionability as defense has burden of establishing that condition.we review the trial court ruling de novo,but defer to the factual and legal findings made by the arbitrator.california faculty superior court th,oaktree capital management,bernard th,oaktree.w e do not review the arbitrator findings,but take them as correct.roehl ritchie th.
limited judicial review of arbitration awards 
judicial review of an arbitrator award is very limited because of the strong public policy in favor of private arbitration.board of education round valley teachers cal th,moncharsh heily blase cal th,moncharsh.as a general rule,the courts may not review an arbitrator decision for errors of fact or law.cable connection,directv,cal th,cable connection.a contractual arbitration agreement gives the arbitrator the power to decide the historical facts,the relevant law and the interpretation and validity of the contract.see id.at burlage superior court th,burlage.inherent in this power is the possibility the arbitrator may make legal or factual errors.burlage,at.an arbitration award ordinarily will not be vacated due to such error because the arbitrator resolution of the issues is what the parties bargained for.ibid.
the general rule that arbitration awards are immune from judicial review is not without its limits.code of civil procedure section lists the grounds on which a court may vacate an award,including t he arbitrators exceeded their powers and the award can not be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision upon the controversy submitted.an arbitrator may exceed her powers within the meaning of this section by issuing an award that violates an explicit legislative expression of public policy.jordan department of motor vehicles th,city of palo alto service employees internat.union th,see also eastern associated coal united mine workers of america.but this is the exception,not the rule absent a clear expression of illegality or public policy undermining this strong presumption in favor of private arbitration,an arbitral award should ordinarily stand immune from judicial scrutiny.moncharsh,supra,cal th at.
upc makes no claim that the arbitration clause in the retainer agreement was itself invalid or unenforceable,or that the fee dispute should not have been submitted to jams.rather,it argues that the arbitrator exceeded her powers by issuing an award that violated the public policy expressed in rule a of the rules of professional conduct,which provides,a member of the bar shall not enter into an agreement for,charge,or collect an illegal or unconscionable fee.upc claims the contingency fee was unconscionable within the meaning of this rule because it exceeded the value of the settlement itself and was based on upc estimated damages rather than on what it actually received.
the rules of professional conduct are adopted by the board of governors of the state bar of california and approved by the supreme court of california pursuant to business and professions code sections and to protect the public and to promote respect and confidence in the legal profession.rules conduct,rule.fee agreements that violate the rules of professional conduct may be deemed unenforceable on public policy grounds.see bird,marella,boxer wolpert superior court th,scolino kolts th,altschul sable d.
but,it does not necessarily follow that public policy requires the court,rather than an arbitrator,to finally determine whether a fee is unconscionable under the rules of professional conduct.to the contrary,in cases where the arbitration clause within a contract itself is valid and enforceable and no claim has been made in this case that it was not,it is up to the arbitrator to resolve a claim that the substance of the contract is unconscionable.bruni didion th.to permit judicial review of the arbitrator award in this case would be contrary to the strong policy favoring the finality of arbitration awards,even though it has been couched as a public policy violation.see moncharsh,supra,cal th at.
the moncharsh decision specifically rejected an argument similar to that made by upc in this case.in moncharsh,the plaintiff was a former law firm associate who argued that his fee splitting arrangement with the firm was unconscionable and violated the rules of professional conduct,thereby authorizing judicial review of an arbitration award in favor of the law firm the supreme court disagreed.we perceive nothing in the rules of professional conduct at issue in this case that suggest resolution by an arbitrator of what is essentially an ordinary fee dispute would be inappropriate or would improperly protect the public interest.moncharsh,supra,cal th at.
b.the award was not unconscionable 
assuming that upc claim of unconscionability is subject to judicial review as a predicate for determining whether the arbitration award violates public policy,we reject it on the merits neither the fee agreement nor the award actually issued by the arbitrator is unconscionable under rule of the rules of professional conduct.
civil code section codifies the principle that a court may refuse to enforce an unconscionable provision in a contract.rule b of the rules of professional conduct describes the factors relevant to determining whether a particular legal fee is unconscionable unconscionability of a fee shall be determined on the basis of all the facts and circumstances existing at the time the agreement is entered into except where the parties contemplate that the fee will be affected by later events.among the factors to be considered,where appropriate,in determining the conscionability of a fee are the following the amount of the fee in proportion to the value of the services performed.the relative sophistication of the member and the client.the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved and the skill required to perform the legal service properly.the likelihood,if apparent to the client,that the acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other employment by the member.the amount involved and the results obtained.the time limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances.the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client.the experience,reputation,and ability of the member or members performing the services.whether the fee is fixed or contingent.the time and labor required.the informed consent of the client to the fee.
the factors listed in rule b include both procedural and substantive aspects of unconscionability,similar to those found in the common law.the doctrine of unconscionability has both a procedural and a substantive element,the former focusing on oppression or surprise due to unequal bargaining power,the latter on overly harsh or results.citation.the procedural element of an unconscionable contract generally takes the form of a contract of adhesion,which,imposed and drafted by the party of superior bargaining strength,relegates to the subscribing party only the opportunity to adhere to the contract or reject it.substantively unconscionable terms may take various forms,but may generally be described as unfairly.discover bank superior court cal th,see also armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,armendariz school th,stirlen supercuts,th,stirlen a m produce fmc d,a m produce.
the prevailing view is that procedural and substantive unconscionability must both be present in order for a court to exercise its discretion to refuse to enforce a contract,although they need not be present in the same degree.armendariz,supra,cal th at.t he more substantively oppressive the contract term,the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable,and vice versa.ibid.a contract is largely an allocation of risks between the parties,and therefore a contractual term is substantively suspect if it reallocates the risks of the bargain in an objectively unreasonable or unexpected manner.citations.but not all unreasonable risk allocations are unconscionable rather enforceability of the clause is tied to the procedural aspects of unconscionability such that the greater the unfair surprise or inequality of bargaining power,the less unreasonable the risk allocation which will be tolerated.citation.stirlen,supra,th at stirlen,citing a m produce,supra,d at.
upc argues that rule b supersedes this approach because it lists specific factors relevant to fees charged by lawyers and does not explicitly require a showing of both procedural and substantive unconscionability.we see no reason not to apply the analysis to a dispute by a client regarding an allegedly unconscionable legal fee.see shaffer superior court th.rule b does not conflict with the more general method of analyzing unconscionability.instead,it provides a nonexclusive list of factors,both procedural and substantive,that may be relevant when determining whether a legal fee is unconscionable.shaffer,at.
rule b superseded former rule,which had specified that a fee is unconscionable when it is so exorbitant and wholly disproportionate to the services performed as to shock the conscience of lawyers of ordinary prudence practicing in the same community.rules conduct,former rule.in its request that the california supreme court approve the amendments to the rules of professional conduct that included the enactment of rule,the state bar explained,current rule prohibits an attorney from charging an unconscionable fee.the rule then explains the factors in determining whether a fee is reasonable.this is ambiguous because unconscionability and unreasonableness are two different standards.the amendments are proposed to remove the ambiguity by deleting the reference to reasonableness.request that the supreme court of california approve amendments to the rules of professional conduct of the state bar of california,and memorandum and supporting documents in explanation.the state bar also noted that the t he unconscionability standard reflects existing california supreme court decisions to the effect that the state bar has no power to regulate the amount of fees charged by its members unless such fees are so outlandish as to merit discipline or the conduct of the attorney in negotiating for or attempting to collect a fee merit discipline.ibid.the outlandishness of a fee is most readily judged by examining both its procedural and substantive aspects as with other contractual arrangements,the less evidence there is of substantive unconscionability,the greater the need to show procedural unconscionability,and vice versa.see stirlen,supra,th at.
even assuming it is unnecessary to show both procedural and substantive unconscionability under rule b,upc can not prevail because in this case there is neither.on the issue of procedural unconscionability,upc is a sophisticated corporate client that initiated the litigation to acquire real property it intended to develop as part of a larger project.it employed outside counsel to negotiate the fee agreement with cp m,and wielded equal bargaining power during those negotiations.the fee agreement was not a contract of adhesion if upc had not been satisfied with its terms,it could have employed any of a number of law firms in lieu of cp m.this was a private business transaction between equally matched parties,pure and simple.ramirez sturdevant th,negotiation of fee agreement is,in general,an arm length transaction.
nor was the contingency fee awarded by the arbitrator substantively unconscionable.a percent contingency rate is less than half of the typical to percent rate noted by the arbitrator.the parties decision to base the contingency fee on the fair market value of the real estate at its best and highest value after remediation was appropriate in light of the very low value of the property in its unremediated state.upc conceded during the arbitration that the fair market value of the property in a remediated state was.when added to the million in cash,the total value of the settlement was,meaning that the award of approximately million in attorney fees reflects about percent of the total settlement value as agreed to by the parties,well within the range of reasonable contingency fees.that the fee was based on upc estimate of actual damages rather than the fair market value of the property does not render the fee unconscionable when it was within upc power to control this estimate.
moreover,the factors set forth in rule b that are relevant to this case also militate against a finding of unconscionability.although the fee was substantial,the value of the services to upc was also great given that it needed to obtain the property to proceed with its planned development.rule b.upc and cp m were equally sophisticated parties.rule b.the litigation was extraordinarily complex and required a high level of legal skills to obtain a favorable result.rule b b.cp m was an experienced litigation firm that obtained a stupendous result for the upc.rule b.the disputed portion of the fee was contingent in nature which always presents the possibility that the attorney will be entitled to greater fees than would be recoverable under an hourly fee agreement,and the basis for that contingency had been specifically negotiated by upc with the assistance of counsel.rule b.and in light of its representation by counsel during the negotiation of the retainer agreement,upc gave informed consent to the fee.rule b.
upc argues that in assessing the conscionability of the settlement,we should look not to the value of the real property at its best and highest value,but to its actual value at the time of settlement in its unremediated state,which upc estimates to have been about million.upc posits that when this million figure is added to the million in cash,the total value of the settlement was only million,meaning that the total fees awarded,when added to those billed under the may hourly rate agreement,exceeded the actual recovery.citing tarver state bar cal d,tarver,upc argues that this result is unconscionable because it is so exorbitant and wholly disproportionate to the services performed as to shock the conscience.
tarver is readily distinguishable.in that case,the attorney represented the client in an age discrimination action and recovered in back wages plus reinstatement.tarver,supra,cal d at.the court ordered the defendant to pa
