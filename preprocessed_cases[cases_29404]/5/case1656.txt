this appeal and arise from defendant jimenez alleged breach of a contract to sell his home to plaintiffs.defendants appeal from a general judgment that awarded plaintiffs damages and attorney fees against jimenez for breach of contract,that declared defendant guerrero recorded interest in the home void,and that dismissed jimenez counterclaim for assault.plaintiffs the denial of specific performance and an award of equitable compensation on their contract claim.
on appeal,we reverse the judgment on the breach of contract claim,reverse the dismissal of jimenez counterclaim for assault,and affirm the declaratory judgment.in light of our disposition of the appeal,we dismiss the as moot.
some procedural background is helpful in this case.plaintiffs alt and soliz,who are married,filed an action that alleged two of contract and declaratory judgment.under the breach of contract claim,plaintiffs included two counts count for specific performance of the land sale contract and,in the alternative,count for damages.the declaratory judgment claim sought a declaration that the conveyance to guerrero of an interest in the property that plaintiffs sought to purchase was void as against plaintiffs.jimenez counterclaimed for assault.
plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on count of their breach of contract claim for specific performance and on their declaratory judgment claim.defendants moved for summary judgment on both counts of plaintiffs breach of contract claim.after a hearing,the trial court issued a letter opinion in which it made findings of fact and concluded that,as a matter of law,jimenez had breached the contract when he failed to participate in the closing on the contract specified closing date.however,the court denied plaintiffs an award of specific performance for the breach,concluding that the appropriate remedy was an award of damages and attorney fees.the court further granted summary judgment for plaintiffs on their declaratory judgment claim and dismissed jimenez assault claim.the general judgment reflected the court letter opinion,awarding damages to plaintiffs on the breach of contract claim,entering the declaration sought by plaintiffs on their declaratory judgment claim,and dismissing jimenez counterclaim.
defendants first and third assignments of error pertain,respectively,to the granting of summary judgment for plaintiffs on their breach of contract claim and to the denial of defendants motion for summary judgment on that claim.plaintiffs sole assignment of error on is that the trial court erred in denying them specific performance and an award of equitable compensation for jimenez breach of the land sale contract.
plaintiffs argue on appeal that an order denying a motion for summary judgment is not appealable and,therefore,that defendants third assignment of error is not reviewable.however,as in this case,when for summary judgment are made on a claim and the parties have assigned error to the granting of the adverse parties motion and the denial of their own motion,both of those rulings are subject to review.ellis ferrellgas.
summary judgment is appropriate if,after reviewing the evidence in the record in a manner most favorable to the adverse party,the court concludes that no objectively reasonable juror could return a verdict for the adverse party.orcp c.we therefore review the record on each motion in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.ellis.at,see also oregon steel mills,coopers lybrand,llp,or.because we will be considering both the granting and the denial of motions for summary judgment on the breach of contract claim,for ease of organization we recite at this point all of the pertinent evidence,disputed and undisputed,favorable and unfavorable to the parties.
on may,plaintiffs and jimenez entered into an agreement entitled contract for purchase of residence or other real estate,in which jimenez agreed to sell his home to plaintiffs.guerrero,not a party to the contract,was jimenez domestic partner and lived with him in the home.the written agreement provided that plaintiffs would purchase the home for and pay into an escrow account as a deposit on the contract,and further provided that closing would take place on may.soliz arranged for the title company at which she worked to handle the escrow account and closing.on may,plaintiffs signed all of the documents for closing,having obtained the financing necessary to close the transaction.because the title company wanted to ensure that the loan was funded and the deed was recorded by may,the title company scheduled friday,may,as the date to close the transaction at the title office,notwithstanding that the contract specified may as the closing date.
on the evening of may,plaintiffs went to defendants home.defendants spoke only spanish,and alt did not speak spanish,so soliz spoke with defendants in spanish and then interpreted the conversation for alt.soliz explained to jimenez that she wanted him to sign one paper tomorrow,because we are not going to close the deal on may.jimenez,understanding the request as one to extend the may closing deadline,initially refused,but then agreed to review the document with guerrero.he told soliz that she could bring the paper over to his house during lunchtime the next day.soliz agreed and told alt about the understanding that she had reached with jimenez.alt reacted angrily,insisting that jimenez sign the paper the next morning and offering to bring the paper to jimenez workplace.when jimenez refused to sign the paper anywhere but at his home at lunchtime,alt said,i am going to sue you and make sure you lose your job.in his affidavit,jimenez stated that alt then advanced toward me in a threatening manner and pushed me with his chest.guerrero intervened between the two men,and both women told alt to calm down.when alt continued to advance toward jimenez,guerrero ordered both plaintiffs to leave the property.
a representative for the title company,jeanne ayala,stated in an affidavit that the title company had made arrangements for jimenez on three occasions to have one of our courtesy signers go to his location.however,jimenez failed or refused to sign the documents.in his affidavit,jimenez stated that no one came to the house the day after the altercation.
on may,jimenez received a letter from an attorney,dated may,indicating that she represented plaintiffs and stating,in pertinent part 
although you signed the contract,and agreed to be bound thereby,my clients are informed that you are now refusing to complete the sale.
while my clients could file an action seeking,among other things,an injunction from the court requiring you to specifically perform your agreement to sell your property,they are willing to agree to rescind the contract provided that you execute any paper work required to refund their deposit money in the amount of and reimburse them for the amounts they have spent to have the property inspected and appraised.
demand is hereby made that you respond to this letter within ten days,indicating whether you will agree to either perform the contract or to arrange to refund the deposit and reimburse the costs described above.please address your response to me at the above address.if you are represented by legal counsel in this matter,please direct any communications to this office through your attorney.
if you are unwilling to either perform the contract or to refund the deposit and reimburse the costs described above,my clients intend to initiate legal proceedings against you seeking specific performance or damages and the recovery of attorney fees pursuant to ors.
notwithstanding the foregoing,my clients reserve all rights under the contract,at law and in equity.thank you for your attention to this matter.
on may,jimenez contacted an attorney for assistance with the matter,and jimenez attorney sent a letter to plaintiffs attorney on june,advising her that jimenez was willing to refund plaintiffs deposit but not to reimburse plaintiffs for the inspection and appraisal costs.on june,plaintiffs attorney spoke to jimenez attorney,explaining that she had not yet spoken to plaintiffs,but that she felt both sides could settle the dispute because they were only apart.jimenez attorney stated in his affidavit that both attorneys agreed not to take any action against the other without notice,as long as negotiations were pending.on june,plaintiffs attorney left a phone message with jimenez attorney reporting that she had forwarded his letter to plaintiffs and that she would be in touch.neither jimenez nor his attorney heard anything more from plaintiffs until plaintiffs filed this action on june.
in granting summary judgment for plaintiffs,the trial court concluded that jimenez had breached the contract when he failed to participate in the closing on may.jimenez argues that the court decision was erroneous because it made findings of fact not supported by the record the trial court findings of fact include,in pertinent part,the following 
plaintiffs became concerned that the closing might be complicated by the memorial day weekend and sought to accelerate the closing date,but defendant did not agree to sign the papers early.defendant testimony and the testimony of his domestic partner that they thought plaintiffs wanted to delay the closing date is not credible.had the plaintiffs wanted to delay the closing,they would not have asked defendant to sign the papers in advance of the scheduled closing date.
although we question whether some of those findings are supported by the record,the trial court most significant error was in failing to review the evidence in the light most favorable to jimenez.jimenez stated in his affidavit that soliz wanted him to sign a paper.given that closing documents consist of more than one paper,and giving jimenez all favorable inferences from the evidence,a factfinder could find that jimenez did not understand that he was being asked to sign the closing documents early,and consequently,that he had not refused to sign the closing documents.it is also reasonable for a factfinder to infer from that evidence that the paper that soliz wanted him to sign was,in fact,a document to delay the closing date.the trial court simply believed plaintiffs version of events over defendants version.in taal union pacific,we said that credibility questions are not for the court to resolve in dealing with contradictory evidence in a summary judgment setting.the trial court sole responsibility was to determine whether,based on the evidence in the record,no objectively reasonable juror could return a verdict in favor of of jimenez.orcp c.the trial court erred in its review of the evidentiary record.
nevertheless,our review of the trial court letter opinion leads us to believe that the court ultimate conclusion had more to do with its treatment of plaintiffs may letter to jimenez than with impermissible credibility determinations.with regard to the letter effect,defendants argued to the trial court that the may letter waived performance of the contract until after may,and once that date passed,the contract expired by its own terms.in its letter opinion,the court concluded 
defendant ability to ignore the closing date was conditioned on his acceptance of the offer to rescind.while defendant was given the opportunity to rescind the contract by the payment of by june,the closing date was never changed.he ignored that date at his peril when he neither attended the closing on may,nor accepted the alternative offer.
on appeal,defendants again argue,in a somewhat different manner,that the letter constituted a waiver of all of plaintiffs rights under the contract.plaintiffs counter that the letter intent was to offer terms for rescission and to confirm to jimenez that they intended to enforce their contractual rights against him if he did not agree to the terms set forth in their offer to rescind.plaintiffs argue that in no way did their letter indicate an intentional relinquishment of their rights under the contract.
none of those arguments is entirely correct.we agree with plaintiffs that the may letter acted as an offer to rescind.see phillips gibson.however,that letter also demanded that jimenez respond to their new offer or agree to perform under the contract by a date that would occur after the may closing date.we conclude that,based on the undisputed facts in the record,including plaintiffs statement in their letter that jimenez must respond by a date past the may closing date,and including the actions that plaintiffs thereafter took through their attorney to negotiate a settlement,plaintiffs waived their right to have the contract performed by may.
under contract law,a party to a contract may waive performance of any provision of the contract that is for its benefit.south lake center waker.even though a contract may require all modifications to the contract to be in writing,a waiver of a provision in the contract need not be in writing.bennett farmers ins,or,moore mutual of enumclaw ins,or.a waiver may be inferred from the party conduct,provided that the conduct is clear,unequivocal,and decisive in manifesting an intention to waive a right to performance.cusick meyer,or.a waiver can also occur if the party acts so as to justifiably induce the other party to believe that the party will not assert or exercise the right to performance and to permit the first party to insist upon the right would prejudice the second party.id.the time of a party performance may be waived by the parties.walker feiring.in alk lanini,or,we held that a time of the essence clause,which was included in an earnest money agreement for the benefit of both buyers and sellers,could be waived by either party with regard to the timing of the other party performance footnote omitted 
in this case,the letter demand was clear and was given ten days to respond to plaintiffs demand by either agreeing to perform the contract or agreeing to the proposed rescission terms.as written in the letter,the ten days would lapse on a date past may.according to plaintiffs,the fact that they told jimenez that he could respond after may,by agreeing either to perform the contract or to accept the rescission terms,had no effect on jimenez obligation to close on the contract by may,because their letter also said that they were reserving all of their rights under the contract.we fail to see how a general reservation of rights prevails over a clear demand giving a new date by which to agree to perform or to rescind the contract.
the trial court focused on what occurred before plaintiffs may letter as evidence of the parties intentions and expectations regarding the contract.however,the letter altered plaintiffs and jimenez expectations under the contract.there is nothing that occurred after plaintiffs sent their letter that could have led jimenez to believe that he should ignore the letter demands and sign closing papers by may moreover,plaintiffs conduct,through their attorney negotiations and assurances that plaintiffs would consider jimenez offer to refund the earnest money and would get back to jimenez,further confirmed to jimenez that plaintiffs had waived the may date of performance.we conclude,therefore,that,as a matter of law,plaintiffs letter waived jimenez obligation to close the sale of the house by may.
that conclusion,however,does not end the inquiry.contrary to defendants arguments,waiver of the time of performance does not constitute waiver of an entire contract it simply waives the time of performance.alderman davidson,or.according to the evidence in the summary judgment record,plaintiffs had signed the closing documents and done everything required of them under the contract.hence,they were not in breach of the contract,which continued to exist after may.therefore,in order not to breach the contract,jimenez would still need to perform his contractual obligations.the only question is when jimenez was required to perform.
in cases involving land sale contracts,oregon courts have consistently held that,once a seller waives a time of the essence clause,a buyer,inter alia,must be afforded a reasonable time within which to perform on the contract.peck security bank of oregon,or,see also legg allen,iversen kiger.that principle also applies when a buyer is the party who waives the time of the essence
