factual history 
on june,officers associated with the judicial drug task force in colorado set up a narcotic ruse checkpoint on highway just north of the town of rico,in dolores county,colorado.as part of this ruse checkpoint,the officers placed a sign on the highway that stated a narcotics checkpoint was being conducted one mile ahead.a second sign was placed further down the highway stating that a drug dog was in use as part of the narcotics checkpoint.the statements made on the signs,however,were false.no narcotics checkpoint existed.instead,officers were stationed in inconspicuous areas along the highway in the area of the signs watching for any illegal or suspicious activity.no stops were to be made unless officers observed or otherwise had reasonable suspicion of some type of illegal activity associated with a particular vehicle.
at approximately on june,deputy hugh richards of the montezuma county sheriff department was stationed between the two signs on highway.richards observed a female passenger in a blue toyota throw an object out of the window.based upon his observations,richards radioed ahead and the blue toyota was stopped for littering by task force member dennis spruell,a sergeant with the cortez colorado police department.after initially radioing spruell,richards retrieved the object,which turned out to be a wooden pipe with burnt residue and a screen.the pipe smelled of marijuana.richards again radioed spruell to advise him of what he had found.the driver of the vehicle,stephen roth,was advised that he had been stopped because his passenger had been observed throwing an object out the window.roth stated that the object was a pop can.roth was then asked if he would consent to a search of his vehicle.roth declined to give consent.spruell informed roth and the passenger,ellen gumeson,that he suspected that marijuana contraband had been thrown from the vehicle,and thus he had reasonable suspicion that further evidence of contraband would be found in the vehicle.during the ensuing search,spruell and jeff coleman,another member of the task force from the durango colorado police department,found a wooden marijuana pipe with burnt residue under the front driver seat.inside a cooler located in the back seat,officers found plastic baggies containing psilocybin mushrooms,a schedule i controlled substance.both roth and gumeson were arrested.
during the ensuing criminal proceedings in dolores county,roth unsuccessfully moved to suppress the evidence seized during the search of the vehicle.gumeson subsequently pled guilty to littering.on december,roth was found guilty at trial of possession of drug paraphernalia and fined.roth appealed his conviction to the colorado court of appeals cca,arguing that the evidence seized from his vehicle should have been suppressed because it was the fruit of an unconstitutional checkpoint employed by law enforcement officers,and because deputy richards could not reasonably have observed gumeson throw anything out of the vehicle window likely searched the incorrect area after observing gumeson actions.the cca affirmed roth conviction on august.people roth.in doing so,the cca held that the use of the fictitious drug checkpoint did not violate roth rights under the fourth amendment because the stop of his car was based on the officers individualized suspicion of unlawful activity,and the officers had probable cause to believe the car contained evidence of a crime and thus were justified in searching the car and its contents.although roth filed petitions for writs of certiorari with the colorado supreme court and the united states supreme court,those petitions were denied.roth people,wl,cert.denied,d.
the original district court proceedings 
on june,while roth state criminal appeal was still pending,roth and gumeson initiated this action by filing a complaint in federal district court against defendants,including various state and county officials,the governor of the state of colorado and the heads of at least three municipal police departments whose employees participated in the narcotics task force,several colorado municipalities,and approximately fifty unknown doe defendants.in their complaint,roth and gumeson alleged that the defendants created,established,and executed an unconstitutional drug checkpoint on june,that ultimately resulted in roth and gumeson being unlawfully stopped,detained,searched and arrested.roa,vol,doc.at.the complaint,which alleged four separate causes of action under arising out of the general allegations,sought general,special and punitive damages,attorneys fees and costs,and declaratory relief.
defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for summary judgment.rather than responding directly to those motions,roth and gumeson asked the district court to stay the case until the appellate process,including any writs,in roth state criminal case was completed.roa,vol,doc.at.the district court denied the motion to stay and ordered roth and gumeson to respond to the defendants pending motions,doc.after responding to defendants motions,roth and gumeson filed a motion asking the district court to stay all pretrial proceedings,vol,doc.that motion was granted by the magistrate judge on february.
on december,after allowing the parties to complete their briefing on the pending motions to dismiss for summary judgment,the district court granted the motions and dismissed the action in its entirety.in doing so,the district court concluded it was precluded by the doctrine from considering roth claims because the identical issues were decided against roth in his state criminal proceedings roth was precluded under the doctrine of collateral estoppel from challenging the constitutionality of the ruse checkpoint and his stop,detention and arrest both roth and gumeson were precluded,pursuant to the supreme court decision in heck humphrey,d,from pursuing their claims until such time,if ever,that they had successfully challenged their colorado state convictions arising from the stop,search and arrest the claim of civil conspiracy asserted by roth and gumeson under failed as a matter of law because they did not allege any specific facts showing any agreement or collaboration between the defendants to undertake an improper,illegal,or unconstitutional activity,roa,vol,doc.at and in addition to these various bases for dismissal,defendants were entitled to summary judgment because the undisputed facts established that the ruse checkpoint was constitutional in light of the decision in united states flynn,cir,which the district court concluded involved virtually identical facts and wa s dispositive,roa,vol,doc.at.judgment was entered in the case on december.
roth and gumeson filed a notice of appeal on january.on that same date,roth and gumeson filed a motion asking the district court for permission to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis.the district court denied that motion on february,concluding th e appeal wa s not taken in good faith because plaintiffs ha d not shown the existence of a reasoned,nonfrivolous argument on the law and facts in support of the issues raised on appeal,doc.at.
the motions for sanctions fees and costs 
in late december after the district court entered judgment but before roth and gumeson filed their notice of appeal and in early january,defendants filed motions for sanctions against robert mulhern,the attorney for roth and gumeson,for attorney fees and costs pursuant to.mulhern filed a lengthy response to those motions on january.according to mulhern,he filed the complaint on june,out of concern that the statute of limitations was about to expire on june,doc.at.mulhern argued that the case was meritorious because the case should have been stayed,not dismissed,until the conclusion of roth state criminal proceedings,id.at the holding in heck was not applicable to this search and seizure case,he was not allowed to engage in discovery all defendants were at least personally involved,the case should have been analyzed using checkpoint law,not individualized suspicion,and t he flynn case wa s in conflict with decisions from not only the supreme court of the united states,but also a decision from the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit,among other courts.id.in addition,mulhern argued that the defendants failed to meet and confer with him prior to filing their motions,as required by the district court local rules,and also failed to comply with the procedures outlined in rule by providing him with copies of their motions at least days prior to filing those motions.
on february,roth and gumeson filed a motion for sanctions pursuant to rule attorney fees and costs pursuant to against the defendants attorneys.the only ground offered in support of the motion was that the defendants attorneys did not meet and confer with the plaintiffs,through their attorney of record,prior to filing the ir motions for sanctions fees and costs and did not follow the required procedure for rule sanctions,doc.at.
on june,the district court granted the defendants motion for sanctions fees and costs,and denied the plaintiffs similar motion,doc.in its order,the district court concluded that rule sanctions were appropriate because the defendants respective letters to mulhern satisfied rule safe harbor requirement,mulhern pursuit of the lawsuit,despite numerous rule safe harbor warnings from defendants,created unnecessary delay and needlessly increased the cost of this litigation,id.at,the plaintiffs claims and legal contentions were not warranted by existing law or by a argument for the extension,modification,or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law,id.internal quotation marks omitted,and the allegations and other factual contentions contained in plaintiffs claims lacked evidentiary support and would not have gained evidentiary support after further investigation or discovery.id.although the district court stated it ha d no information on mulhern ability to pay sanctions,or on his history,experience,or ability,it consider ed his offense severe in terms of wasted time and wasted money,and that despite many opportunities to change his a failed appeal in the colorado court of appeals,and the rule letters failed to do so.id.at.in short,the district court concluded that mulhern acted in bad faith,and thus rule sanctions we re appropriate.id.at.

this court award of fees and costs to defendants 
on february,this court issued an order and judgment affirming the district court order dismissing the action on its merits,affirming the district court order denying plaintiffs motion for sanctions,and dismissing for lack of jurisdiction mulhern own appeal of the district court order granting defendants motions for sanctions fees and costs against him roth green.cir.
on february,one group of defendants dennis spruell,danny dufur,roy lane,and the city of cortez,colorado filed a motion for an award of attorney fees and costs pursuant to fed.and.in their motion,these defendants asked that the fees and costs be assessed against plaintiffs attorney,mulhern.mulhern filed a response to the motion on behalf of himself,as well as on behalf of roth and gumeson.in his response,mulhern argued that he had a reasonable basis for pursuing the appeal,sanctioning him would effectively result in the loss of his ability to practice law,and that roth and gumeson ha d no money and c ould not pay costs.add.to aplt,resp.at.on march,this court granted the defendants motion in part.joint app.at.rather than relying on fed.or,however,this court awarded costs in the amount of pursuant to fed,and,p ursuant to,award ed the defendants attorney fees on appeal,in an amount to be determined by the district court on remand.id.

a did the law of the case preclude the district court from issuing sanctions 
in his first issue on appeal,mulhern contends that this court,in deciding the first set of appeals,concluded he should not be sanctioned,thereby establishing the law of the case and precluding the district court from deciding the issue again.
the law of the case doctrine posits that when a court decides upon a rule of law,that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.christianson colt indus.operating,d internal quotation marks omitted.thus,when a case is appealed and remanded,the decision of the appellate court establishes the law of the case and ordinarily will be followed by both the trial court on remand and the appellate court in any subsequent appeal.rohrbaugh celotex,cir.
applying those principles to the case at hand,the question is whether this court previously decided,as a matter of law,that mulhern was not subject to sanctions under either rule or.after this court resolved the three prior appeals by affirming the district court rulings in two of those appeals and dismissing the third appeal for lack of jurisdiction,one group of defendants dennis spruell,danny dufur,roy lane,and the city of cortez,colorado filed a motion asking this court to assess attorney fees and costs against mulhern pursuant to fed.and.this court ultimately granted the motion in part,but instead of assessing fees and costs against mulhern pursuant to fed.or,assessed fees against roth and gumeson pursuant to.
there are several reasons why this court prior order did not decide the issue of mulhern liability for sanctions under rule or.to begin with,neither the defendants motion nor this court order mentioned or otherwise cited either rule or,the two authorities relied upon by the district court in sanctioning mulhern.and for good reason.rule,which focuses only on a challenged pleading or written motion,steinert winn group,cir,is generally employed in the district court,whereas rule the rule cited in defendants appellate motion is used to sanction groundless appeals.in re east street equities,cir.although is available to an appellate court,most appellate sanctions are imposed under rule.id.second,and relatedly,this court rejection of sanctions under rule or costs under could have no bearing on the issue of the propriety of the district court sanctions,both because the statutes differ in their focus,and because at issue before this court in the prior appeals was mulhern conduct in pursuing those appeals,whereas the question at issue before the district court in imposing sanctions was mulhern conduct in filing and pursuing the claims in the district court.third,the issue of sanctions under fed.is a matter of discretion.the fact that this court chose not to exercise that discretion and impose sanctions against mulhern has no relevance to,and thus no impact on,the district court decision to impose sanctions under rule and,wasko moore,cir affirming district court award of rule sanctions,but denying appellee motion for sanctions pursuant to fed.fourth,and finally,this court ruling on the motion for sanctions occurred after the district court granted the defendants motions for sanctions,and thus could not have established the law of the case for purposes of the motion that was before the district court.
in sum,we conclude that this court prior ruling on the motion for sanctions had no bearing on the district court order sanctioning mulhern under rule.
b did the claims have merit 
mulhern next contends that sanctions should not have been imposed against him because the claims asserted in the complaint had merit.more specifically,mulhern argues that a the legal contentions we re warranted by existing law and by arguments for the reversal of existing law,including the flynn case,b the allegations and other factual contentions ha d evidentiary support,and c the claims we re not being presented to harass,cause unnecessary delay,or for the needless increase in the costs of the litigation in this case.aplt.br.at.in addition,mulhern argues,the district court should have granted his request to stay the case pending the outcome of roth state criminal proceedings and,had the district court done so,very little time,effort,money would have been expended by the court the defense attorneys in this case.id.at.
the district court noted,and we agree,that there were a host of legal impediments to roth and gumeson prevailing on their claims.to begin with,the majority of the defendants named in the complaint had,at best,only tangential relationships to the ruse checkpoint,and thus were not properly named as defendants in the complaint.for example,defendant bill owens,the governor of the state of colorado,was not alleged to have had any direct connection with,or participation in,the ruse checkpoint.
even with respect to the named defendants who directly participated in the ruse checkpoint,it is clear that their conduct was entirely legal.although mulhern continues to maintain that the claims asserted in the complaint were not controlled by our decision in flynn,he is mistaken.in flynn,the defendant mack flynn,while driving on in muskogee county,oklahoma,encountered two road signs nearly identical to those encountered by plaintiffs roth and gumeson in this case the first said drug checkpoint mile ahead and the second said drug dogs in use.the defendant,upon seeing the signs,made an abrupt lane change and immediately took the nearest exit ramp off of.at.at the top of the exit ramp,the defendant briefly stopped his car while his passenger opened the door and dropped a large sack from the car.id.officers who were surveilling the highway examined the sack and determined it contained narcotics it was later verified to be methamphetamine.the defendant was then stopped,placed under arrest,and charged with various federal offenses in connection with the incident.after the district court denied his motion to suppress,the defendant entered a conditional guilty plea to four offenses.on appeal,the defendant argued,in pertinent part,that his arrest was the result of law enforcement illegal conduct in operating a narcotics checkpoint.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.we rejected that argument,concluding that t he posting of signs to create a ruse does not constitute illegal police activity,and that the defendant never reached a drug checkpoint.see also id.at the creation of a ruse to cause the defendant to abandon an item is not illegal.
if there were any doubts about the legality of the ruse utilized by defendants in this case and it appears that,even prior to flynn,the legality of such a ruse was clear,those doubts should have ceased when we issued flynn.mulhern,in turn,upon receiving notice of the flynn decision and the record indicates he was repeatedly advised of the decision by the defendants in their respective letters to him,should have voluntarily dismissed the complaint.stated differently,it was unreasonable,and a violation of his obligations as a licensed attorney,to continue to pursue the claims after the issuance of flynn.although mulhern now argues that a reasonable basis exists for overruling the flynn decision,he fails to offer any such basis.
mulhern assertion that he had to file the complaint to avoid the running of the statute of limitations,and that,in turn,the district court had an obligation to stay the case pending the outcome of roth state criminal proceedings,is simply wrong.a plaintiff may not bring a civil rights suit if a favorable result in the suit would necessarily demonstrate the invalidity of an outstanding criminal judgment against the plaintiff.smith gonzales,cir citing heck,at.as correctly noted by the district court,that was precisely the situation here by asserting that they were the victims of an unconstitutional drug checkpoint,roth and gumeson were effectively questioning the validity of their arrests and convictions.thus,to recover damages based on their allegations,roth and gumeson were first obligated to prove that the ir conviction s ha d been reversed on direct appeal,expunged by executive order,declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination,or called into question by a federal court issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.id.quoting heck,at.not until they successfully did so would their claims have arisen.id.in other words,b ecause the ir cause s of action d id not accrue until such time,the applicable statute of limitations d id not begin to run until the same time.id.quoting heck,at.thus,mulhern was in no way obligated to file suit against defendants,and indeed clearly should have waited until such time,if ever,as the colorado state courts granted relief to roth and gumeson from their convictions.
in sum,the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that mulhern violated the provisions of both rule and in filing and pursuing the claims on behalf of roth and gumeson.
c did the defendants fail to meet and confer with mulhern 
mulhern contends that sanctions were improperly imposed against him because the defendants failed to first meet and confer with him prior to filing their motions for sanctions,as required by rule of the district court local rules.we review a district court application of its local rules for abuse of discretion.hernandez george,cir.
district of colorado local rule provides,in pertinent part,as follows 
duty to confer.the court will not consider any motion,other than a motion under.or,unless counsel for the moving party or a pro se party,before filing the motion,has conferred or made reasonable,efforts to confer with opposing counsel or a pro se party to resolve the disputed matter.the moving party shall state in the motion,or in a certificate attached to the motion,the specific efforts to comply with this rule.
in its order granting defendants motions for sanctions,the district court rejected mulhern assertion that defendants failed to comply with local rule.specifically,the district court noted that each set of defendants sent mulhern a warning or letter outlining the deficiencies of each claim asserted in the complaint,asking that mulhern voluntarily dismiss the complaint,and warning that mulhern failure to do so would result in the filing of motions for sanctions and fees.roa,vol,doc at.in the district court view,these letters substantially satisf ied the local rule.id.
mulhern offers four reasons why the defendants letters should not be deemed sufficient to satisfy rule meet and confer requirement.first,he argues that if defense counsel did meet and confer with him,they would have stated and were required to state in their sanctions motions certify their specific efforts.aplt.br.at.second,he argues that the letters did not say anything about rule a or that the letters were meet and confer letters.id.third,he argues that the letters failed to address each of the grounds ultimately asserted by defendants in their respective motions to dismiss for summary judgment.fourth,he argues that the defendants letters were sent to him up to eleven months prior to defendants filing the motions for sanctions,and thus did not meet the spirit of rule.id.at.
we reject mulhern arguments and conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in applying rule.as noted,each letter advised mulhern that,in the defendants view,the claims asserted in the complaint were,for various reasons,meritless and should therefore be voluntarily dismissed.further,each letter provided mulhern with notice that,should he fail to voluntarily dismiss the complaint,defendants would move for sanctions against him.in short,each letter effectively complied with local rule by attempting to seek a resolution of the issue,the frivolousness of the plaintiffs claims without first seeking resort to the district court intervention.although mulhern complains that defendants failed to outline,in their motions,their efforts to meet and confer,he acknowledges that defendants attached to their motions copies of the letters they sent to him.in our view,the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that this substantially satisfied the requirements of rule.lastly,rule is silent with regard to precisely when the parties must meet and confer prior to the filing of a related motion.thus,it was not a violation of rule for defendants to wait several months after sending their letters to mulhern before filing their motions for sanctions indeed,it arguably favored mulhern by providing him with a considerable period of time in which to voluntarily dismiss the complaint.
d did defendants follow the procedures outlined in rule 
finally,mulhern contends the district court should not have granted the defendants motions for rule sanctions because defendants did not serve him with their rule motions prior to filing the motions,and thus violated the safe harbor provision of rule.aplt.br.at.mulhern also contends that rule required that the motions for sanctions were to be served and filed before the conclusion of the civil rights case.id.at.
federal rule of civil procedure provides,in pertinent part,as follows 
c sanctions.if,after notice and a reasonable opportunity to respond,the court determines that subdivision b has been violated,the court may,subject to the conditions stated below,impose an appropriate sanction upon the attorneys,law firms,or parties that have violated subdivision b or are responsible for the violation.
how initiated.
a by motion.a motion for sanctions under this rule shall be made separately from other motions or requests and shall describe the specific conduct alleged to violate subdivision b.it shall be served as provided in rule,but shall not be filed with or presented to the court unless,within days after service of the motion or such other period as the court may prescribe,the challenged paper,claim,defense,contention,allegation,or denial is not withdrawn or appropriately corrected.if warranted,the court may award to the party prevailing on the motion the reasonable expenses and attorney fees incurred in presenting or opposing the motion.
the first question raised by mulhern is whether defendants complied with the safe harbor provisions outlined in rule c a.as noted,that subsection states that motions for sanctions shall be served but not filed with or presented to the court unless,within days after service of the motion the challenged pleadings or claims have not been withdrawn or appropriately corrected.although defendants all sent mulhern warning letters well in advance of filing their motions for sanctions,it is uncontroverted that they did not,as required by subsection c a,serve him with copies of their actual motions for sanctions days prior to filing those motions.indeed,it appears from the record on appeal that the motions were served on mulhern at the same time as,or after,the motions were actually filed.
as they did in the district court,however,defendants contend that the warning letters they sent to mulhern months in advance of filing their motions for sanctions effectively satisfied the requirements of subsection c a by providing mulhern with notice of their intent to seek sanctions and an opportunity to withdraw the complaint prior to them filing their motions.although the district court agreed with defendants,we conclude,for the reasons discussed below,that defendants letters were not sufficient to satisfy the requirements of subsection c a,and thus the district court abused its discretion in granting defendants motions for rule sanctions.
contrary to defendants arguments,nothing in subsection c a suggests that a letter addressed to the alleged offending party will suffice to satisfy the safe harbor requirements.rather,the plain language of subsection c a requires a copy of the actual motion for sanctions to be served on the person s accused of sanctionable behavior at least days prior to the filing of that motion.this conclusion is bolstered by the advisory committee notes to the amendment to rule which added the safe harbor provision 
the rule provides that requests for sanctions must be made as a separate motion,not simply included as an additional prayer for relief in another motion.the motion for sanctions is not,however,to be filed until at least days or such other period as the court may set after being served.these provisions are intended to provide a type of safe harbor against motions under rule in that a party will not be subjec
