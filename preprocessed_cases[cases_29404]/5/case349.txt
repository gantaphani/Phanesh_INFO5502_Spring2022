under the common fund doctrine,the court may award a attorney fees for successfully pursuing a shareholder derivative suit that confers a benefit upon the corporation.the question that we confront in this case is whether a successful who represented only himself as a pro se attorney in such a suit is entitled to attorney fees.
because we have published a prior opinion on another issue in this case in zucker westinghouse electric,cir,we repeat only those details that are relevant to the issue before our court.shareholders of filed a derivative suit and a related class action suit following the announcement of westinghouse that it would suffer dollar losses because of several loans it made.id.at.in the derivative suit they alleged that the officers and directors of westinghouse grossly and recklessly mismanaged the corporation.id.in the class action they alleged that westinghouse had violated sections b and of the securities exchange act of,as amended the exchange act,b,and rule promulgated thereunder,as well as sections,and of the securities act of,as amended the securities act,a.the class action plaintiffs also alleged a claim for negligent misrepresentation under principles of pennsylvania common law.in re westinghouse sec,aff in part,rev in part,cir.
in,insurers of the officers and directors of westinghouse agreed to pay damages to the class action plaintiffs on the condition that the plaintiffs in the derivative suit terminate that litigation zucker,at.in,the parties in the derivative suit reached a settlement agreement,stipulating,inter alia,that the plaintiffs attorneys in the derivative suit could submit to the court an application for attorney fees and expenses of,which westinghouse agreed to pay.id.at.
the district court approved the settlement for both the derivative suit and the class action suit.id.plaintiffs counsel then requested attorney fees and expenses of.however,rand,a holder of shares of westinghouse stock and an attorney acting pro se,objected to the award on the ground that the settlement had not conferred a benefit upon westinghouse.the district court nonetheless awarded to plaintiffs counsel fees and expenses in the amount of.
rand,acting as a pro se attorney,filed an appeal to this court,contesting the fees award.we reversed the district court judgment on the ground that the derivative litigation did not confer a benefit on westinghouse and therefore plaintiffs counsel was not entitled to any fee award.id.at.we remanded the case to the district court with instructions to deny the application of the plaintiffs attorneys for fees and expenses.id.at.
following our remand order,rand petitioned the district court for an award of as attorney fees for his successful appeal.in support,rand asserted that the request represented of the that plaintiffs counsel might have received but for rand successful intervention.he cited several class action cases in which the attorneys for the received attorney fees,ranging from to of the fund.in the alternative,rand appended a lodestar calculation of for attorney fees based on an hourly rate and in expenses.rand also submitted to the district court a stipulation in which rand and westinghouse stated that westinghouse benefited economically from rand appeal and agreed to pay rand for attorney fees and expenses.
the district court concluded that rand was not entitled to recover attorney fees based on his pro se representation.the court stated,inter alia,
at first blush,it appears that rand should be entitled to counsel fees.as a pro se attorney objector rand conferred a definite benefit upon the corporation by successfully challenging the award of attorneys fee sic to plaintiff counsel in the underlying derivative action.rand represented himself,however.as a result,he did not incur any attorney fees for which he is personally responsible.thus,an award of attorney fees would not compensate him for expenses incurred in initially objecting and subsequently prosecuting the appeal.
app.at.the court thus denied rand motion for attorney fees and costs and declined to endorse the stipulation for for attorney fees.however,it approved the portion of the stipulation awarding rand for expenses.
rand timely appealed,seeking reversal of the district court order and an award of for attorney fees.appellees,westinghouse and the directors and officers thereof,take no position on this appeal,except to acknowledge that they entered into the stipulation described above.amicus curiae howard bashman urges that although rand successfully raised a shareholder objection,a pro se attorney should not be able to recover fees.
we exercise de novo review of the standards and procedures applied by the district court in determining attorneys fees,as it is purely a legal question.planned parenthood att y of,cir.however,we review the district court findings of fact for clear error.id.in this case,there are no disputed issues of fact.the district court recognized that rand had conferred a definite benefit upon the corporation.app.at.we agree.that,however,is not the issue before us.
rand argues that the district court erred as a matter of law in holding that attorney fees may not be awarded to an attorney who represented himself in a shareholder derivative suit even where the suit has benefited the corporation.the supreme court has issued two opinions that guide our decision on this appeal trustees of the internal improvement fund of greenough,and kay ehrler,d.
trustees of the internal improvement fund of greenough 
in trustees,francis vose,a bondholder of the florida railroad company,sued the trustees of several realty companies to prevent them from wasting a land trust fund and failing to pay interest on its bonds.vose ultimately succeeded and saved the trust fund a significant amount of money.trustees,at.vose then petitioned for an allowance out of the fund for his expenses and services because he had borne the whole burden of this litigation for more than a decade and had advanced most of the expenses which were necessary for the purpose of rendering the litigation effective and successful.id.the courts below had approved the bulk of vose requests,including the fees for his solicitor and counsel,costs of court,and copying.critically,they also approved an award for personal services and private expenses.id.at.
the supreme court approved of compensating vose for his attorney fees and court fees as a matter of equity and justice.id.at.because vose had worked for other bondholders as well as for himself,the court found that it would have been unjust to give other bondholders an unfair advantage by not requiring them to contribute to the expenses which vose had fairly incurred in the course of litigation that had benefited all bondholders.id.at.the supreme court thus established the common fund doctrine as a federal common law doctrine that prevents the unjust enrichment of beneficiaries at the litigant expense.accordingly,it affirmed the award for reimbursement for attorney fees and costs to vose,the litigant whose actions resulted in the creation of the common fund for the benefit of himself and others.
critically for our purposes,the supreme court denied vose petition for personal services and private expenses because such an award would have been without precedent in law or equity.id.at.the court found pivotal that vose was a creditor,suing on behalf of himself and other creditors,for his and their own benefit and advantage.id.at.in denying vose request for payment of personal services and private expenses,the court distinguished the character of a trustee,who could properly receive a salary from the trust,from that of an interested objector such as vose,who could not reap a salary 
where an allowance is made to trustees for their personal services,it is made with a view to secure greater activity and diligence in the performance of the trust,and to induce persons of reliable character and business capacity to accept the office of trustee.these considerations have no application to the case of a creditor seeking his rights in a judicial proceeding.
