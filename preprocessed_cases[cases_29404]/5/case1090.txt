the main question that we must decide is whether the principles announced in united states currency,cir,survive the enactment of the civil asset forfeiture reform act of cafra codified at,and.we hold that they do.accordingly,we reverse the district court dismissal of a claim for accrued interest on currency that the government wrongfully seized and then returned months later,without having instituted judicial forfeiture proceedings.
factual and procedural background

on march,plaintiff submitted administrative claims contesting the seizure of the money.six days later,plaintiff administrative claims were referred to the united states attorney.on june,the statutory period expired.the united states neither instituted a timely judicial forfeiture proceeding nor requested an extension of the period within which it could commence a forfeiture proceeding,as required under cafra,a a.

discussion 
a.the district court improperly dismissed plaintiff claim for interest on wrongfully seized currency.
in,at,an opinion that predates the enactment of cafra by about five years,we held that sovereign immunity does not bar a claim against the united states for interest on wrongfully seized money.in reaching our conclusion,we acknowledged the general rule that interest can not be recovered in a suit against the government in the absence of an express waiver of sovereign immunity.id.at quoting library of congress shaw,d.but we characterized that rule as applicable to inchoate interest,as an item of damages in a forfeiture action.id.at.by contrast,we explained,the payment of interest on wrongfully seized money is not a payment of damages,but instead is the disgorgement of a benefit actually and calculably received from an asset that the government has been holding improperly.id.at.as a result,no express waiver of sovereign immunity was necessary,and the plaintiff was entitled to the payment of interest actually or constructively earned by the government during the period the asset was wrongfully held.id.
the united states first requests that we read into,as the district court did,the requirement of a court order before interest accrues on improperly seized money.under such an interpretation,plaintiff would not be entitled to interest because the united states eventually returned plaintiff money without a court order.although the district court and the united states correctly identify a factual distinction between this case and,our holding in rested on a different point.
interest earned,whether actually or constructively,is part of the res that must be returned to the owner.id.at.had the district court order for the return of the money served as the trigger for a right to interest,we would have ruled in that the plaintiff was entitled to interest from the date of that order.instead,we held that the plaintiff was entitled to interest accruing from a date eight years earlier.id.we reasoned from the common law if the government seized a pregnant cow and was ultimately found not to be entitled to the cow after it had given birth,it could hardly be contended that the government had fulfilled its duty by returning the cow,but retaining the calf.id.footnote omitted.thus,the plaintiff had a right to the interest even in the absence of a court order and,moreover,the right existed in the absence of an express waiver of sovereign immunity.
the united states voluntary return of plaintiff,along with its concession that it did not have a right to the money,obviated the need for a court order to that effect.under the government rationale,the united states could avoid the disgorgement of matter how long it wrongfully held voluntarily returning seized money at the very last minute before such an order is entered.permitting the united states to retain the proverbial calf would be inconsistent with our holding in.as a result,we are bound by that decision unless and until clearly irreconcilable intervening authority requires a different result.miller gammie,cir en banc.
the united states next argues that cafra,as a comprehensive statute governing forfeiture procedures,supersedes and does not provide for the return of interest in this case.in support,the government cites b a,which states that t he united states shall not be required to disgorge the value of any intangible benefits nor make any other payments to the claimant not specifically authorized by this subsection.the government reads that phrase to mean that cafra preempts all other types of recovery in seizure cases and,because cafra does not provide for the payment of interest in the absence of a civil forfeiture proceeding,see id.b c providing that,in cases involving currency,the government shall be liable for interest in any civil proceeding to forfeit property in which the claimant substantially prevails,plaintiff claim must fail as a matter of law.
in determining whether cafra superseded our holding in,we turn to the text of the statute,as well as its object and policy,to discern congressional intent.see united states in currency,cir analyzing cafra to determine whether congress intended to supersede the burden of proof requirement in and concluding that it did not.we also consider the legislative history of the statute.tahara matson terminals,cir.
