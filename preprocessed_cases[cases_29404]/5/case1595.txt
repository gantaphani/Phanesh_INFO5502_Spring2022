background 
the dissolution action between susan and paul was tried to the court in a trial on february.paul was represented by his attorney at the trial susan was not represented by counsel at the trial.in april,the court entered a judgment dissolving the marriage,declining to award spousal support to either party,and dividing the couple real and personal property.the judgment contained five pages of findings and a chart corresponding to those findings.it recounted that the court had denied susan continuance request and admitted paul exhibits into evidence.the judgment also stated that susan had waived any future spousal support and that the court would not have awarded spousal support in any event because each party was.the court found that paul was entitled to a credit of for support payments he had made to susan in and.in connection with the credit,the court found that susan worked each month wherein spousal support was an issue.it also made express findings regarding each item of real property at issue,each car,and each retirement account,and it determined each claim for reimbursement and found that paul owed susan an equalizing payment of.
in june,susan timely filed a notice of appeal from the judgment.she also filed a notice designating the record on appeal.susan chose to proceed with a clerk transcript,and she designated that it would include all of paul exhibits and his trial brief.she elected to proceed with a settled statement under rule as to the oral proceedings before the superior court at the same time,susan filed a motion for a settled statement in the superior court under rule.in her motion,she asserted that the trial was conducted without a use of a court reporter,was not tape recorded,and therefore the only way to provide to the appellate court a record of the trial would be for this court to allow submission of a settled statement on appeal.susan attorney declared that a proposed settled statement would be submitted to the court and paul attorney.they could submit c hanges and corrections to the proposed settled statement,which would then be submitted with the proposed settled statement to the court of appeal.the motion was initially set for hearing on august.
on july,paul filed opposition to susan motion.he claimed that susan was not entitled to a settled statement because she had not identified the issues that she intended to raise on appeal she could have retained a court reporter to report the oral proceedings,she had not requested a statement of decision,it is highly dubious a settled statement could be agreed to without a significant burden to paul and the court,and her appeal would be meritless.
at the august,hearing,susan attorney acknowledged that he had encountered great difficulty in preparing a proposed settled statement because he had to rely on the imperfect memory of my client.nonetheless,he had prepared a proposed settled statement.the court took the position that susan had the burden of persuading the court that the settled statement could be produced without significantly burdening opposing counsel or the court.responding to paul attorney claim that susan had not identified the issues she intended to raise on appeal,susan attorney offered an oral explanation of the issues he intended to raise on appeal one,whether or not the court recognized an interspousal transfer deed,and giving credits appropriately to the parties two,whether or not the motion to continue because of my client medicated condition should have been considered by the court,whether she was denied access to the court as a result of her inability to participate in the court proceeding.whether or not there was appropriate credits for my client claim on a credit card,whether or not my client was given credit for payment on credit cards or the assumption of those credit cards appropriately.he also asserted that there was an issue on appeal about the court determination that the house value went up and,as a result,my client interests were protected in that record.susan attorney asserted that these were the issues addressed in this proposed statement on appeal.the court decided to allow counsel to brief the issue of this burden and set another hearing for august.
susan attorney submitted a brief in which he pointed out that there was no burden issue because rule permitted a settled statement to be prepared where there was no record of the oral proceedings.since no proposed statement could be submitted until after the motion was granted,he argued that a denial of the motion could not be premised on the content of the proposed statement.paul attorney continued to insist that susan was not entitled to a settled statement because she had failed to have the trial reported and failed to request a statement of decision.she also continued to argue that the burden on paul was a justification for denying the motion.
at the august,hearing,the court ruled that rule a a,which concerns the burden on the court and opposing counsel,did not apply since the trial had not been reported.nevertheless,the court still believed that t he issue is the work that parry paul attorney will have to do because hannon susan attorney was not here for the trial.the court pointed out that it had retained my personal notes from the trial,so i prepared to add to,supplement,adjust,or edit the proposed statement once it comes to me.however,the court considered it not fair that paul attorney should do all this work to respond to the proposed settled statement,so i going to award her attorney fees for the work that is necessary for her to time sic to create the settled statement.and i going to order that they be paid ahead of time.the reason i going to do that is because of the history of this case.the court explained that susan had a history of failure of cooperation and had previously chose n not to follow court orders.the court also found that susan can afford to pay paul attorney fees.
when susan attorney inquired about the basis for the attorney fees award,the court stated that it was not awarding fees under family code section.it stated it just seemed fair,hannon.if you want me to go get you a code section,i do some research and get you a code section.i t seems to me,if i going to order parry to participate in a settled statement on appeal,she should be compensated for her time and not by her client,but by the person who is asking for her assistance.that was my thought process.i do have a code section to attach to it.when susan attorney questioned the court order that susan pay paul attorney fees in connection with the settled statement,the court said i could be mistaken.the court then scheduled a hearing for september,at which it would decide whether it had the authority to order attorney fees,and it asked the parties to submit updated income and expense declarations.
on august,susan filed a proposed settled statement.the proposed statement contained paragraphs purporting to relate the oral proceedings at the trial.one paragraph stated when the parties were married and separated,and the length of their marriage.two paragraphs concerned a motion to continue the trial.three paragraphs concerned spousal support.four paragraphs concerned a parcel of real property.one paragraph concerned an ira account.the final paragraph concerned the couple tax refund.paul attorney disputed the accuracy of the statements in the proposed settled statement.both paul and susan filed updated income and expense declarations.
at the september,hearing on the court authority to award attorney fees,the court recalled that at the prior hearing the court presented its indicated that i was going to order a settled statement and request parry to participate in that but my tentative was to order susan mooney to pay attorney fees to parry for her time spent in that matter.the court stated that it was relying on family code sections and as the authority for awarding attorney fees when just and reasonable.the court recounted how susan conduct throughout the trial court proceedings had prolonged the litigation.it concluded that her conduct made it appropriate to award attorney fee to parry ahead of time for her role in the preparation of the settled statement on appeal.the court found that susan had the financial ability to pay these fees.
paul attorney told the court that her fees so far in connection with the settled statement motion were.the court agreed with paul attorney that the proposed settled statement contained very little that even remotely resembles what occurred during the trial on february.it decided that susan should pay to parry for time already expended and then that will include it not quite for more time towards this settled statement of appeal.if she does pay that money then you do have to do any further work towards the appeal.paul attorney complained that was not enough,but the court allowed her to come back and ask for more if needed.a hearing was set for october,for susan to pay the and provide a statement of proposed issues.the court minute order stated respondent shall pay attorney fees in the amount of.is due for attorney already expended,and the remaining balance shall be paid if respondent chooses to go forward with the statement of.the trial court never issued or filed a written order granting or denying susan motion for a settled statement.
on october,susan filed a petition for a writ of mandate in this court challenging the trial court order,which she characterized as allowing paul attorney to prepare the settled statement on appeal,requiring susan to pay the attorney fees of paul in preparing the settled statement on appeal,and requiring susan to pay the attorney fees of paul for all work performed in responding to the motion seeking to proceed by way of a settled statement on appeal.this court issued a stay of all trial court proceedings.after requesting and receiving opposition and a reply to the opposition,this court issued an order to show cause.paul filed a return,and susan filed a traverse.
ii.discussion 
the trial court abused its discretion by failing to rule on susan motion,linking its decision on susan motion with its decision on attorney fees,and making an invalid attorney fees order.because the trial court should not have linked susan motion and paul attorney fees,we examine each issue separately in order to decouple them and provide guidance to the trial court.
motion for settled statement 
rule sets forth the procedure for seeking a settled statement.an appellant intending to proceed under this rule must serve and file in superior court with its notice designating the record on appeal under rule a motion to use a settled statement instead of a reporter transcript or both reporter and clerk transcripts.the motion must be supported by a showing that a a substantial cost saving will result and the statement can be settled without significantly burdening opposing parties or the court b the designated oral proceedings were not reported or can not be transcribed or c the appellant is unable to pay for a reporter transcript and funds are not available from the transcript reimbursement fund see rule c.a party proceeding in forma pauperis is deemed unable to pay for a transcript.rule a,italics boldface added.
the rule also prescribes what shall occur upon the denial of the motion or the grant of the motion.if the court denies the motion,the appellant must file a new notice designating the record on appeal under rule within days after the superior court clerk sends,or a party serves,the order of denial.rule a.within days after the superior court clerk sends,or a party serves,an order granting a motion to use a settled statement,the appellant must serve and file in superior court a condensed narrative of the oral proceedings that the appellant believes necessary for the appeal.subject to the court approval in settling the statement,the appellant may present some or all of the evidence by question and answer.if the condensed narrative describes less than all the testimony,the appellant must state the points to be raised on appeal the appeal is then limited to those points unless,on motion,the reviewing court permits otherwise.within days after the appellant serves the condensed narrative,the respondent may serve and file proposed amendments.the proposed statement and proposed amendments may be accompanied by copies of any document includable in the clerk transcript under rule b and.rule b.the clerk must set a date for a settlement hearing by the trial judge that is no later than days after the respondent files proposed amendments or the time to do so expires,whichever is earlier,and must give the parties at least five days notice of the hearing date.at the hearing,the judge must settle the statement and fix the times within which the appellant must prepare,serve,and file it.if the respondent does not object to the prepared statement within five days after it is filed,it will be deemed properly prepared and the clerk must present it to the judge for certification.rule c.
susan filed a timely motion for a settled statement based on the fact that the trial has not been reported.it is undisputed that the trial was not reported.despite that fact,the trial court never ruled on susan motion.at oral argument,both susan and paul asserted that the trial court granted susan motion.no such order appears in the record.rule plainly requires the court to make a written order granting or denying a motion for a settled statement as only a written order could possibly trigger rule s timing provisions.rule a,b.in this case,since the court issued no written order granting or denying susan motion,it is clear that the trial court did not anticipate making a decision on susan motion in advance of susan paying at a pending hearing that has not yet occurred.the prolonged proceedings that preceded this writ petition demonstrate that the trial court was not familiar with the requirements of rule and did not comply with those procedures.
susan motion for a settled statement was timely filed in june in conjunction with her notice of appeal and notice designating the appellate record.but the trial court,despite having held two hearings in august and another in september,never granted or denied her motion.at the august hearing,the court stated that it intended to require susan to pay paul attorney fees if i going to order parry to participate in a settled statement on appeal.italics boldface added.the if reflected that the court had not made a decision on susan motion.at the september hearing,the court stated that,at the august hearing,the court presented its indicated that i was going to order a settled statement and request parry to participate in that but my tentative was to order susan mooney to pay attorney fees to parry for her time spent in that matter.italics boldface added.the court reference to its indicated and tentative further reflected that it had not yet made a decision on susan motion.at neither hearing did the court actually grant or deny susan motion for a settled statement,and the record before us contains no written order granting or denying the motion.instead,the trial court held susan motion in abeyance while it considered the separate attorney fees issue.
a trial court exercises discretion in ruling on a motion for a settled statement,but here the trial court failed to rule on the motion,which was necessarily an abuse of its discretion.moreover,as the case law demonstrates,the discretion that a trial court has in ruling on a motion for a settled statement is limited.in western states const.municipal court of san francisco cal d western states,after a judgment was entered following a trial that was reported,the defendant filed a proposed settled statement no objections were made to the proposed settled statement,and no amendments were proposed.the trial court did not challenge the fairness or accuracy of the proposed settled statement.western states,at.however,the trial court refused to authorize a settled statement because the plaintiff attorney had died after the trial and the court could not remember the proceedings.the trial court felt that,under these circumstances,there was nothing to settle.western states,at 
the california supreme court found that the trial court had failed to comply with its duty.unless there is some justifiable excuse,a trial judge may not arbitrarily refuse to settle the statement.to so hold would place it in the power of the trial judge to deprive a litigant of his right of appeal by simply refusing to perform a plain duty.western states,supra,cal d at.the court pointed out that a trial court considering a motion for a settled statement may ordinarily consider the suggestions of the respondent on appeal the judge own memory citation notes made by the judge during the trial citation and any other helpful resources,such as a reporter notes or transcript,that are available.western states,at.if the foregoing prove insufficient,then it should be made to clearly appear from the record,and the reasons given therefor,why the trial judge was convinced of his or her inability to settle a satisfactory statement ibid.
the california supreme court decision in western states did not preclude a trial court from making a discretionary decision to deny a request for a settled statement,but it did require a trial court to provide reasons for a denial that amounted to some justifiable excuse why a settled statement could not be produced using the established procedures.in western states,the trial court lack of memory of the proceedings and the unavailability of the adverse party attorney coupled with the fact that the trial had been reported did not add up to a justifiable excuse for denying a request for a settled statement.
sidebotham superior court of san francisco d sidebotham is an example of a case in which the court of appeal found that the trial court had a justifiable excuse for denying a request for a settled statement.in sidebotham,a judgment was rendered after days of trial over a period.witnesses testified at the trial,and the trial was reported.instead of obtaining a reporter transcript to use in their appeal,the appellants submitted a proposed settled statement of the oral proceedings to the trial court for its approval to use as part of the record for their appeal.the real parties made numerous objections to the proposed settled statement.sidebotham,at.
the trial court rejected the proposed settled statement and ordered the appellants to obtain a reporter transcript and prepare an accurate statement from it or to proceed with the appeal without any statement of the oral proceedings.sidebotham,supra,d at.the trial court found that the proposed statement was too incomplete,inaccurate and distorted to serve as a basis for amendment and correction,short of preparing an entirely new statement.id.at.the trial court also found that the notes and memories of the court and counsel were too incomplete to provide a basis for an adequate settled statement in the absence of a reporter transcript.id.at.the court of appeal found no abuse of discretion because the proposed settled statement was inaccurate,incomplete,and distorted,and a reporter transcript could be obtained.sidebotham,at.
although the trial court has not yet ruled on susan motion,we can see nothing in the record that would support a denial of her motion.the record establishes that the trial court took notes during the very short trial,retained those notes,and told the parties that it would be able to evaluate the accuracy of a proposed settled statement.paul attorney had been present at the trial,and it was clear that she recalled the trial testimony,which amounted to the testimony of just paul and susan.she obviously would be able to effectively participate in the settled statement proceedings.the only reasons cited by the trial court for potentially denying susan motion were the interrelated facts that susan attorney had not been present at the trial and had produced a proposed settled statement that was not accurate.these reasons could not justify the denial of the motion as paul attorney and the trial court had an adequate basis for correcting any inaccuracies in the proposed settled statement.that is,after all,the reason for the procedures set forth in rule.we can find no basis in the record for a decision to deny susan motion.
we find no merit in the remaining contentions by the parties concerning susan motion for a settled statement.susan claims that the trial court erred in directing paul attorney to prepare the settled statement.our review of the record does not reveal that such an order was made.the trial court never even ruled on the motion,let alone directed anyone to prepare a settled statement.the trial court expressed its concern that the process of producing a settled statement necessarily would require paul attorney to do all this work and spend time to create the settled statement,but it never directed paul attorney to prepare the proposed or final settled statement.in fact,the court referred only to the possibility of paul attorney being ordered to participate in a settled statement on appeal.italics added.our understanding of the court statements is that,under the circumstances,the court believed that if the court granted susan motion paul counsel would be required to expend considerable time to respond to the proposed settled statement prepared by susan attorney because susan attorney had not been present at the trial.this understanding is consistent with the court observation that it had retained my personal notes from the trial,so i prepared to add to,supplement,adjust,or edit the proposed statement once it comes to me.italics added.
paul argues that the trial court rejected susan proposed settled statement yet correctly applied rule by offering susan the choice to proceed by settled statement,on the condition that she shoulder some of the costs of preparing the settled statement.as we have already explained,the superior court never ruled on susan motion.nothing in rule authorizes a superior court to condition the potential grant of a motion for a settled statement on the moving party payment of the adverse party attorney fees or costs of preparing the settled statement.rule explicitly sets forth the procedure under which a superior court may authorize the preparation of a settled statement.
the trial court erred in attempting to link susan motion with the issue of paul attorney fees.a motion for a settled statement should be granted as a matter of course unless there is a justifiable excuse for denying it.the trial court never identified any justifiable excuse for denying susan motion,and it made no attempt to comply with the procedures set forth in rule.had the court granted the motion at the initial hearing and followed rule procedures,paul counsel would have had the opportunity to respond.after that,the court could have utilized rule procedures to produce a settled statement.instead,the court diverted the proceedings on susan motion into extensive consideration of paul attorney fees.the record does not contain any motion by paul for attorney fees.even if such a motion had been filed,the court should have resolved susan motion before considering a fees motion.the trial court abused its discretion by failing to rule on susan motion and by diverting the proceedings on her motion into hearings on a nonexistent attorney fees motion.
attorney fees order 
trial courts have considerable discretion in ruling on attorney fees motions.however,in this case,there was no attorney fees motion by paul,and the trial court itself initiated proceedings aimed at awarding attorney fees to paul attorney.the court abused its discretion in doing so.
the trial court attorney fees order was expressly premised solely on family code sections and,and the court expressly disavowed any intent to impose sanctions under family code section.family code section pr
