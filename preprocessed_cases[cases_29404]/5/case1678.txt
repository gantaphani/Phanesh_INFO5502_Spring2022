henry lee represented ok song chang chang as her attorney in employment litigation resulting in a judgment in favor of chang after a jury trial.the trial court also awarded chang in attorney fees under labor code sections,subdivision a and,subdivision e.chang later substituted herself in propria persona for her former attorney.henry lee law corporation then moved to intervene in the action and to amend the postjudgment order awarding attorney fees to make the fee award payable to henry lee law corporation the trial court denied the motion.
lee petitioned this court for extraordinary relief contending that he is entitled to intervene and that the attorney fee award belongs to and should be made payable to him.we conclude that lee,as a person whose interests were injuriously affected by the order awarding attorney fees,was entitled to move to vacate the order and enter a new order awarding fees to him.we also conclude that an appeal from the denial of his motion is not an adequate legal remedy in these circumstances and that extraordinary writ review is appropriate.on the merits of the motion,we hold that an attorney fee award under labor code sections,subdivision a and,subdivision e should be made payable to the attorney who provided the legal services rather than the client,unless their fee agreement otherwise provides.because there remains an unresolved factual question as to the terms of the agreement entered into by chang and lee,the trial court,on remand,must reconsider its ruling on lee motion.
factual and procedural background 
chang filed a complaint against a ju tours,a ju tours,and others in november alleging various counts for wage and hour violations and wrongful termination,among other counts.the case was tried before a jury in july.lee represented chang as her attorney.
the jury returned a special verdict finding that chang was an employee of a ju tours and that a ju tours had failed to pay minimum wages.it further found that a ju tours did not fail to pay overtime wages and that chang was not wrongfully forced to resign.the trial court denied a motion for new trial by a ju tours,but granted in part its motion for judgment notwithstanding the judgment.the court entered a judgment in january awarding chang in unpaid minimum wages,a waiting time penalty,a penalty for failure to provide an itemized wage statement,in liquidated damages and in prejudgment interest,all against a ju tours.the total amount awarded in favor of chang and against a ju tours was.the judgment did not determine any entitlement to attorney fees.a ju tours filed a notice of appeal from the judgment in february no.and provided an undertaking.that appeal is still pending.
chang and a ju tours each moved for an attorney fee award.the trial court granted chang motion on april,awarding her in fees under labor code sections,subdivision a and,subdivision e.the court also granted the motion by a ju tours in part,awarding it in fees under labor code section.the court amended the judgment by interlineation to include the attorney fee awards.see cal.rules of court,rule b.a ju tours filed a notice of appeal from the postjudgment order awarding attorney fees in may no.that appeal is also still pending.
the clerk of the court issued a writ of execution on the attorney fee award on may.the trial court,however,granted a ju tours ex parte application to recall that writ on may,stayed enforcement of the attorney fee award and scheduled a hearing for may,to determine whether the undertaking was sufficient.on may,the court determined that the undertaking was insufficient and continued the stay for days to allow a ju tours to either increase the amount of the undertaking or provide a separate undertaking for the attorney fee award a ju apparently did neither.
chang filed a substitution of attorney form in the trial court on may,substituting herself in propria persona for lee.chang signed the form,but the signature line for lee was left blank.chang later retained new counsel.
lee,purportedly on behalf of chang,filed an ex parte application on june,to vacate the stay of enforcement of the attorney fee award and reissue the recalled writ of execution a ju tours opposed the application,arguing that lee no longer represented chang and had no authority to seek relief on her behalf.a ju tours presented a written notice from chang to lee stating that she was discharging him as her attorney and asking him to sign a substitution of attorney form.the trial court denied the ex parte application,stating that lee had failed to establish that he continued to represent chang.the court also stated that if no additional undertaking was provided the stay had expired in accordance with the order of may,
lee filed an ex parte application on his own behalf on june,seeking leave to intervene in the action and an amendment of the postjudgment order awarding attorney fees to make the fee award payable to him.the trial court scheduled a hearing on the motion for july.chang and a ju tours both opposed the motion.chang filed a declaration stating that she had notified lee that he no longer represented her.
the trial court concluded that the pending appeals from the judgment and the postjudgment order awarding attorney fees deprived it of jurisdiction to grant the requested relief.the court stated further that even if it had jurisdiction,the motion was denied on the merits because labor code sections,subdivision a and,subdivision e both unambiguously provide for an award of fees payable to the employee rather than her attorney.the court therefore denied the motion in its entirety on july.
lee commenced a separate action against chang by filing a complaint against her on july,no,alleging counts for breach of a written contract,seeking reimbursement of costs and expenses advanced to prosecute the present action,and declaratory relief,seeking a declaration that the attorney fee award belongs to lee and can not be compromised or settled by chang.that action is pending and is not at issue in this writ proceeding.
in addition,lee petitioned this court for extraordinary relief,challenging the denial of his motion.in light of the important issues raised and their potential impact on the pending appeals,we issued an order to show cause and set the matter for oral argument 
contentions 
lee contends that the attorney fee award should be made payable to him rather than chang and that he is entitled to intervene in this action to seek such relief.
discussion 
lee had standing to move to vacate the attorney fee order and extraordinary writ review of the denial of that motion is appropriate 
a nonparty whose rights or interests are injuriously affected by a judgment or an appealable order may file a nonstatutory motion to vacate the judgment or order,and may appeal the denial of such a motion.luckenbach laer cal,estate of baker cal,people ex rel.reisig broderick boys th.a motion to vacate in the trial court provides a means by which such a nonparty may become a party to the litigation with a right of appeal without the need to formally intervene in the action code civ,luckenbach,supra,cal.at county of alameda carleson cal d,fn.motion to vacate under code civ.

for the purpose of an appeal they have followed the procedure allowed by our practice to one whose rights or interests are injuriously affected by any appealable order made in an action to which he is not a party,through the process of making themselves parties by moving to set those orders aside.citation.their motions being denied,they may,on this appeal,have the proceedings of which they complain reviewed.citations.such proceeding can scarcely be said to make them parties to the action,but it does make them parties to the record,and as such entitled to appeal.citation.unless appellants were permitted to move in the court below to set aside the orders,they would be left without the remedy of an appeal.citations.
lee moved to intervene in this action and to amend the order awarding attorney fees to make the fees payable to him.we construe that motion to amend as a nonstatutory motion to vacate the fee order and enter a new order.lee claims a right to the fee award and that he was injuriously affected by the order awarding fees to chang.such claim gave lee standing to file the motion,and by doing so he became a party to this litigation for purposes of appellate review.
extraordinary writ review by way of a petition for writ of mandate is ordinarily available only if the petitioner has no adequate legal remedy.powers city of richmond cal th,see code civ.an immediate direct appeal is presumed to be an adequate legal remedy.powers,supra,at.writ review is appropriate,however,if such an appeal would be inadequate or the issues presented are of great public importance and require prompt resolution.ibid.
a ju tours appeal from the fee order is currently pending despite the attempt by chang and a ju tours to settle the dispute and dismiss the appeal.lee claim that the fee award should be made payable to him rather than chang must clearly be resolved before the appeal from the fee order proceeds any further so that he may have an opportunity to participate as a respondent in that appeal if he is successful on his claim.we therefore conclude that an appeal from the order denying his motion to vacate is not an adequate remedy and that expedited review in this extraordinary writ proceeding is appropriate.
the trial court retained jurisdiction to rule on lee motion 
a timely appeal stays trial court proceedings on all matters embraced in or affected by the appealed judgment or order,including its enforcement,but the court can proceed on other matters within the action.code civ,subd.a.the purpose of the automatic stay is to protect the appellate court jurisdiction by preserving the status quo and preventing the trial court from undermining or otherwise affecting the effectiveness of the appeal by altering the appealed judgment or order.varian medical systems,delfino cal th.a matter is embraced in or affected by the appealed judgment or order within the meaning of code of civil procedure section,subdivision a only if trial court proceedings on the matter would affect the effectiveness of the appeal.varian,supra,at.
as already suggested,the relief sought by lee motion was to change the fee order so that it was payable to him rather than chang.clearly,such a result would have no impact on the effectiveness of the appeal by a ju tours from the order awarding attorney fees or its appeal from the judgment.a ju tours challenge to the attorney fee award presumably will be the same whether the award is payable to chang or to lee.we therefore conclude that the issues raised by lee motion are not embraced in or affected by the appealed judgment or order within the meaning of code of civil procedure section,subdivision a.therefore,the pendency of the appeals did deprive the trial court of jurisdiction to consider and rule upon that motion.
attorney fees awarded under labor code sections and are payable to the attorney,absent an agreement to the contrary 
labor code sections and 
any employee who receives less than the legal minimum wage or overtime compensation to which the employee is entitled is entitled to recover the unpaid amount in a civil action,in addition to interest and attorney fees,subd.a.any employee who suffers injury as a result of his or her employer knowing and intentional failure to timely provide an accurate itemized wage statement is entitled to recover a penalty and attorney fees,subd.e.labor code sections,subdivision a and,subdivision e both authorize fee awards to an employee.the trial court awarded chang attorney fees under both of these provisions.the question before us is whether a fee award under these provisions belongs to the client or the attorney.

flannery prentice 
the california supreme court in flannery prentice cal th flannery decided a question analogous to the one presented here.flannery construed government code section,subdivision b,which authorizes an attorney fee award to the prevailing party ibid.in actions for employment discrimination under the california fair employment and housing act feha,et.flannery stated,in the countless procedural statutes in which the term party is used,it is commonly understood to refer to either the actual litigant or the litigant attorney of record.citations.since that is the ordinary import of the term,that is the meaning we must ascribe to it when used in a statute,unless the legislature has clearly indicated a contrary intent citations.flannery,supra,at.

flannery concluded that the statute was ambiguous as to the meaning of party and therefore considered the legislative intent in light of federal and california precedents and public policy concerns.flannery,supra,cal th at.flannery distinguished federal opinions generally holding that the client,rather than the attorney,is entitled to seek,recover or waive statutory attorney fees,and stated that the federal opinions were not controlling.id.at.flannery also noted federal authority holding that once the client exercises the right to seek attorney fees,the attorney is entitled to receive the fees recovered.id.at.flannery stated that although federal law was not uniform,t he propriety of a direct award to the plaintiffs attorney,rather than to plaintiffs themselves,in the exercise of the court equitable powers,is no longer questioned in the federal courts.citation.id.at.
flannery noted that at the time the statutory language at issue in that case was originally enacted in,california courts had determined that attorney fee awards,including fees authorized by statute,could be made payable directly to the attorney.flannery,supra,cal th at.flannery also noted the statement in folsom butte county of governments cal d,footnote,that it was established that attorney fee awards under code of civil procedure section are properly made to plaintiffs attorneys rather than to plaintiffs themselves.flannery,supra,at.flannery stated that neither the enactment of government code section nor its amendment showed any legislative intent to repudiate those precedents.flannery,supra,at.
flannery further stated that privately initiated lawsuits often are essential to effectuate the fundamental public policies embodied in constitutional or statutory provisions,and the ability to recover attorney fees may be essential to ensure the filing of such private actions flannery,supra,cal th at.attorneys considering whether to undertake cases that vindicate fundamental public policies may require statutory assurance that,if they obtain a favorable result for their client,they will actually receive the reasonable attorney fees provided for by the legislature and computed by the court.ibid.flannery concluded that construing government code section,subdivision b as vesting ownership of attorney fees in the litigant rather than in counsel,absent a contract providing for
