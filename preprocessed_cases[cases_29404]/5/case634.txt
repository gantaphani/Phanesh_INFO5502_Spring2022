appellants,the geier plaintiffs,appeal the district court judgment awarding them in attorneys fees pursuant to for legal services performed in connection with this civil rights for the past led to the desegregation of tennessee public higher education system.the geier plaintiffs contend that the district court abused its discretion in declining to award fees pursuant to the common fund common benefit method setting a lodestar rate of per hour where the geier plaintiffs had requested and submitted market data supporting an hourly rate of and considering the johnson factors legally unavailable for establishing and enhancing the lodestar figure.we find no abuse of discretion in the district court declining to use the common fund common benefit method for calculating attorneys fees.however,because of errors in the district court analyses concerning the appropriate hourly rate and the geier plaintiffs entitlement to an upward adjustment of the fee award,we vacate the fee award and remand this case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
this action,which was filed in,concerns the desegregation of tennessee public universities.the facts and lengthy history of this litigation have been set forth in the prior opinions of this court and the district court.see geier sundquist,cir geier richardson,cir geier alexander,cir geier alexander.geier university of tennessee,cir,cert.denied,d geier blanton.geier dunn.and sanders ellington.because,however,the matter before us benefits from an appreciation of the history and magnitude of this action,we set forth the case background here.
in,several the geier plaintiffs sued the governor of tennessee,the university of tennessee ut,tennessee a i state university,and various tennessee educational agencies and officials to enjoin ut from expanding its program at a educational institution in nashville.the complaint alleged that any expansion of ut nashville would affect the efforts of tennessee state university tsu,a predominantly institution,to desegregate its student body and faculty.the united states intervened as a plaintiff in,requesting more expansive relief sought by the original plaintiffs.the united states asked the court to order the state defendants to present a plan calculated to produce meaningful desegregation of the public universities in tennessee.sanders.at.the case soon became the vehicle for the desegregation of colleges and universities throughout tennessee.in,a group of parents,teachers,and faculty members were allowed to intervene richardson intervenors.in,the district court allowed another group of and white tsu faculty members and students to intervene mcginnis intervenors.also in,the district court permitted the tsu alumni association to appear as amicus curiae.
the district court found that six years elapsed after brown board of education,before racial requirements for admission to tennessee public universities and colleges were abolished.although all of the state public higher education institutions had open door admissions by,the district court found that the dual system of education created originally by law has not been effectively dismantled.sanders.at.relying on green county school board,d,the district court stated that it was convinced that there is an affirmative duty imposed upon the state by the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the united states to dismantle the dual system of higher education which presently exists in tennessee.id.at.the court then ordered defendants to submit a plan designed to effect such desegregation of the higher educational institutions in tennessee,with particular attention to tennessee a i state university,as to indicate the dismantling of the dual system now existing.id.defendants did not appeal.
defendants submitted a plan to the court that relied primarily on the efforts of predominantly white institutions to expand efforts to recruit black students and faculty.the plan called for tsu to recruit white students and faculty and to develop and publicize academic programs that would attract white as well as black students from the nashville area.the geier plaintiffs and the united states filed objections to the plan,and,after a hearing,the district court found that the plan lacked specificity.instead of disapproving the plan,however,the district court directed defendants to file a report showing what had been done to implement each component of the plan.
defendants report showed some progress in attracting students to the formerly institutions,but little improvement in the number of black faculty at those schools,and virtually no progress in desegregating tsu.the geier plaintiffs filed a motion for further relief,contending that the plan and report failed to offer a scheme for dismantling the dual system of public higher education,as ordered by the court.while that motion was being considered by the district court,a new report showed that tsu remained and that its entering class in the fall of was.the district court found that so long as tsu remained overwhelmingly black,it could not be said that defendants had dismantled the dual system or that they were in any realistic sense,on their way toward doing so.geier dunn.
the district court found that an open door policy,coupled with good faith recruiting efforts is sufficient as a basic requirement for desegregating institutions of public higher education.id.at emphasis in original.however,the court held,where this basic requirement fails to eliminate identifiably white and black institutions,something more is required.defendants were ordered to present another plan to the court by march,that would provide for substantial desegregation of the tsu faculty and ensure a substantial white presence on the tsu campus.id.at.
in the subsequent years,defendants submitted several plans,and the district court ordered that some courses and fields of study be offered exclusively at ut nashville.eventually,all of the plaintiffs,including the united states,proposed a merger of tsu and ut nashville,with tsu as the surviving institution.the district court held a evidentiary hearing on this proposal in.after considering voluminous records and testimony,the district court found steady,but slow progress in attracting black students and faculty to the institutions,but,as before,little or no progress in converting tsu from a university.the court concluded that the plans applied in the course of the eight years that the litigation had been active had not worked and showed no prospect of working.the court therefore ordered the merger of tsu and ut nashville into a single institution under the state board of regents.the district court chose this drastic remedy because the state actions have been egregious examples of constitutional violations.geier blanton.
in affirming the district court,geier university of tennessee,cir,cert.denied,d,we held that the pronouncement in green county school board of an affirmative duty to remove all vestiges of segregation applies to public higher education as well as to education at lower levels.geier,at t he state duty is as exacting to eliminate the vestiges of segregation in higher education as in elementary and secondary school systems it is only the means of eliminating segregation which differ.quotation and citation omitted.we also held that the district court factual findings were not clearly erroneous,id.at,and that the remedy ordered was within the traditional bounds of equitable relief.id.at.
a.the settlement 
the history of the litigation to this point illustrates the arduous path along which the original parties and defendants traveled before they entered a stipulation of settlement settlement on september.geier alexander,aff,cir.all of the parties,except for the united states,agreed to the comprehensive settlement requiring defendants to implement numerous new desegregation programs throughout tennessee system of higher education,including attempting to obtain a student body at tsu that is white assuring that changes in admissions policies do not have an adverse racial impact and actively recruiting faculty and administrative staff for tennessee predominantly white institutions.the settlement also established a monitoring committee and provided for the resolution of disputes among the parties.the plan embodied in the settlement was the culmination of long hours and days of negotiations in which all parties,including the united states,participated.geier,at.
but the struggle to desegregate tennessee system of higher education continued.shortly after the district court approved the settlement,the united states filed a memorandum challenging many of the programs contained in the settlement.the district court rejected the government arguments and the government appealed to this court,geier alexander,challenging only that part of the settlement that established a program pursuant to which qualified sophomores would be selected each year and guaranteed admission to one of the state professional schools upon completing his or her undergraduate work and satisfying the relevant school admissions standards.the government argued that this constituted a racial quota system,but this court rejected that argument and affirmed the district court judgment authorizing the settlement.
next ensued a request for interim attorneys fees by the individual plaintiffs and state defendants,who claimed that they were the prevailing parties within the meaning of after the united states intervened in this suit,sought relief beyond the injunction requested by the private parties,and then challenged the settlement entered into between the parties and approved by the district court,requiring both the private plaintiffs and defendants to defend the settlement terms.the district court awarded attorneys fees against the united states to the geier plaintiffs and the state.the united states appealed and we vacated the award.geier richardson,wl cir.
b.the consent decree 
in,the state moved to vacate the settlement and terminate the litigation based,in part,on a change in the law stemming from the supreme court decision in united states fordice,d,which addressed mississippi dual system of public higher education.in,again relying on fordice,defendants moved for a judgment on the pleadings.the district court did not rule on the motion to vacate,and it eventually denied the state motion for judgment on the pleadings.
ultimately,in january of,the parties entered voluntary mediation.once again,the parties devoted substantial time to considering the state of racial equality in tennessee system of higher education.in january,the parties entered into a consent decree,geier sundquist,d,which states,in part 
in dismantling the vestiges of the former dual system,it is the parties intention to create an education system that enhances the increased enrollment of african american students at the predominantly white institutions and that likewise enhances the enrollment of white students at the state predominantly black institution.to achieve this goal,the parties are committed to maintaining educational institutions that are committed to desegregation and to reaching out to all residents of this state regardless of race.it is also the intention of the parties that employment and promotion decisions within the state system of higher education be made in an environment unfettered by the discriminatory practices of the old dual system.the goal is to increase the presence of faculty,staff,and administrators on the campuses of the state colleges and universities.
attorneys fees 
pursuant to the consent decree,the geier plaintiffs,the richardson intervenors,and the mcginnis intervenors filed applications for attorneys fees with the tennessee attorney general.the mcginnis intervenors reached an agreement with the state and were paid attorneys fees in june.however,unable to agree on an award amount with the state,the geier plaintiffs and richardson intervenors filed their applications for attorneys fees with the federal district court.they requested a hearing concerning the fee applications,but the district court deemed it unnecessary.
on september,the district court issued an opinion and order concerning the attorneys fees,awarding the geier plaintiffs,although they had requested.geier sundquist,d the district court used the lodestar method for calculating the fee award and concluded that per hour was a reasonable hourly fee.it then determined that counsel for the geier plaintiffs should be compensated for hours,which included hours of undocumented time.counsel urged the court to consider the johnson factors,listed in johnson georgia highway,cir,either as bearing upon the lodestar amount or an enhancement thereof.but,for reasons that will be described in more detail below,the district court fixed the lodestar at and deemed any enhancement legally unwarranted.
the geier plaintiffs fee covers the period between june and january the subject of this appeal.pursuant to the settlement,they received in interim attorneys fees in that is the only fee the geier plaintiffs have received to date.
ii.analysis 
we review a district court award of attorneys fees for abuse of discretion.perotti seiter.an abuse of discretion exists when the district court applies the wrong legal standard,misapplies the correct legal standard,or relies on clearly erroneous findings of fact.first tech.safety,depinet,cir.
common benefit method 
the geier plaintiffs first claim on appeal is that the district court abused its discretion in declining to use the common fund common benefit method hereinafter common fund for determining attorneys fees.like the lodestar method,the common fund method is an exception to the general american rule that litigants pay their own attorneys fees.it is employed where a lawyer recovers a common fund for the benefit of persons in addition to those he formally represents.as the supreme court has explained 
the doctrine rests on the perception that persons who obtain the benefit of a lawsuit without contributing to its cost are unjustly enriched at the successful litigant expense.jurisdiction over the fund involved in the litigation allows a court to prevent this inequity by assessing the attorneys fees against the entire fund,thus spreading fees proportionately among those benefitted by the suit.
boeing van gemert,d citations omitted.in order for a class to recover attorneys fees pursuant to the common fund doctrine the class of people benefitted by the lawsuit must be small in number and easily identifiable the benefits must be traceable with some accuracy and there must be reason for confidence that the costs can in fact be shifted with some exactitude to those benefitting.alyeska pipeline serv.wilderness soc y,d.the supreme court has stated that t hose characteristics are not present where litigants simply vindicate a general social grievance.boeing,at.the criteria are met,however,when each member of a certified class has an undisputed and mathematically ascertainable claim to part of a judgment recovered on his behalf.id.as such,the common fund method is often used to determine attorneys fees in class action securities cases,see,boeing,d,and suits by union members against their unions,see,hall cole,d.
it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to decline to use the common fund method in this case.in addition to the doctrine being inapplicable where litigants are vindicating a social grievance,the doctrine is inappropriate here because there is simply no fund.the benefit provided to the plaintiff desegregation of tennessee system of higher not pecuniary in any conventional way and did not result in the creation of a fund to be divvied up among the plaintiffs,as is the case in common fund cases.although as the geier plaintiffs urge the benefits attained could perhaps be measured as the sense that a dollar value could be assigned to the cost of the remedial the action social value into monetary value is imprecise,and more importantly,still leaves us without a fund.the money designated by tennessee for the remedial programs goes to fund the programs,not to pay the plaintiffs.moreover,applying the alyeska factors,described above,the common fund method is unworkable here the class of persons benefitted by this lawsuit is not at all small or manageable.rather,according to the consent decree,the class includes all residents of this state,geier,d at.as such,the class is not easily identifiable and the benefits could not be traced with any accuracy.
reasonable hourly rate 
having declined to use the common fund doctrine for calculating attorneys fees,the district court instead used the lodestar approach whereby the court multiplies a reasonable hourly rate by the proven number of hours reasonably expended on the case by counsel.secretary of treasury,cir.the primary concern in an attorney fee case is that the fee awarded be reasonable,that is,one that is adequately compensatory to attract competent counsel yet which avoids producing a windfall for lawyers.reed rhodes,cir citing blum stenson,d.to arrive at a reasonable hourly rate,courts use as a guideline the prevailing market rate,defined as the rate that lawyers of comparable skill and experience can reasonably expect to command within the venue of the court of record,at.the geier plaintiffs contend that the district court abused its discretion in finding a reasonable hourly rate when they had both requested per hour and submitted evidence that was the reasonable hourly rate for lawyers of skill and experience comparable to george barrett,the geier plaintiffs lead counsel,litigating a civil rights action of this scale.
we recognize that deference is to be given to a district court determination of a reasonable attorneys fee.nonetheless,it remains important for the district court to provide an adequate explanation of the reasons for its award and the manner in which that award was determined.hensley eckerhart,d it remains important for the district court to provide a concise but clear explanation of its reasons for the fee award.at times,we have found an abuse of discretion where a district court fails to explain its reasoning adequately or to consider the competing arguments of the parties.see moore city of paducah,cir.
here,in determining the reasonable hourly rate,the district court appears to have relied almost exclusively on market data provided by defendants,citing to local awards of approximately per hour in civil rights cases.the court also purported to rely on its own judicial experience,noting my recollection is not what it once was,but i can not recall ever awarding a fee in excess of per hour.geier,d at.while this data is informative,the district court never mentioned that the geier plaintiffs counsel requested per hour,and the court never discussed any of the evidence submitted by the geier plaintiffs supporting a per hour rate.attorney lewis donelson,of nashville,memphis,and knoxville baker,donelson law firm,submitted an affidavit stating that a hourly rate for barrett was fair and reasonable and not an uncommon rate for leading attorneys in tennessee at this time,and that barrett is certainly the leading expert on civil rights desegregation cases.there were similar to the reasonableness of a or hourly five other attorneys.in addition,the geier plaintiffs point to the per hour rate awarded attorneys in craft vanderbilt university,a federal class action from the middle district of tennessee alleging civil rights violations in connection with a medical experiment in which pregnant women unknowingly ingested radioactive iron isotope.
we also note that the district court determined that per hour was the appropriate hourly rate for the mcginnis intervenors counsel,norris and weatherly.the geier plaintiffs argued that they were more experienced and more active in the litigation than the intervenors counsel,and that therefore,they are entitled to a higher hourly rate.we find this argument sensible.according to the record,norris and weatherly are less experienced than barrett,and both were paid at lower hourly rates earlier in this lawsuit.see geier d at explaining that,in,norris was paid per hour dinkins per hour and barrett per hour.furthermore,by norris own admission,in a letter to barrett dated february,he and weatherly played a less global role in this action through the years.
in short,the district court order contains no explanation of even accounted for the geier plaintiffs competing information concerning the prevailing market rate.absent some indication of how the district court discretion was exercised,we have no way of knowing whether that discretion was abused.see chalmers city of los angeles,cir vacating award of attorneys fees and remanding where district court opinion insufficiently explained how it arrived at the fee amount.we are,therefore,unable to affirm the decision below.
accordingly,the hourly rate determination as to the geier plaintiffs is vacated and we remand this matter for further review based upon the market data of record,including the geier plaintiffs submissions.
c.the johnson factors 
the geier plaintiffs last claim on appeal is that the district court abused its discretion in failing to consider the johnson factors as bearing on the initial lodestar figure and any enhancement thereof.the supreme court has repeatedly stated that t he primary concern in an attorney fee case is that the fee award be reasonable.blum stenson,d.as already discussed,the first step in determining a reasonable fee in a lodestar case is to multiply the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation by a reasonable hourly rate.once the lodestar figure is established,the trial court is permitted to consider other factors,and to adjust the award upward or downward to achieve a reasonable result.hensley eckerhart,d.in considering any adjustment,the supreme court has cited with approval the twelve factors listed in johnson georgia highway express,cir.hensley,at.those factors are 
the time and labor required the novelty and difficulty of the question the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly the preclusion of other employment by the attorney due to acceptance of the case the customary fee whether the fee is fixed or contingent time limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances the amount involved and the results obtained the experience,reputation,and ability of the attorney the undesirability of the case the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client and awards in similar cases.
johnson,at.the supreme court,however,has limited the application of the johnson factors,noting that many of these factors usually are subsumed within the initial calculation of hours reasonably expended at a reasonable hourly rate.hensley,at.
since we are vacating the lodestar figure in light of the hourly rate issue discussed in part ii,section above,there is no reason to address,at this time,the geier plaintiffs contention that the district court failed to consider the johnson factors in establishing that initial figure.however,we agree with the geier plaintiffs that the district court erred by failing to consider an upward adjustment of the lodestar figure.to help explain why this is so,we set forth,in relevant part,the district court analysis on this point.the district court stated 
counsel urges the court to consider the johnson factors either as bearing upon the lodestar amount or an enhancement thereof the district court here lists the johnson factors 
the one factor in johnson that the supreme court felt may be still available is that of risk.when the case was filed in,there was substantial risk that the outcome might be unfavorable.although brown board had been decided years before,this case involved higher education and the law was unsettled.risk was removed after judge gray early decisions,and certainly was finally removed after the stipulation of settlement in.thereafter,the case only required monitoring for compliance.a flurry of activity in the case arose when the state sought dismissal under the decision in fordice.when attorney general paul summers took office and indicated a desire to settle the case,and initiated mediation,good will and innovative efforts on the part of all counsel and parties resulted in the consent decree.therefore,under the teaching of pennsylvania delaware valley citizens council for clear air,d no enhancement is warranted
