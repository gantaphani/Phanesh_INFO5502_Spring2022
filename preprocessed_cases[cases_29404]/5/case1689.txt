factual and procedural summary 
this is the second time this matter is before us.in an unpublished opinion,fuentes autozone,nonpub.opn.fuentes i we reversed an award of summary judgment in favor of autozone and remanded.following a jury trial,fuentes was awarded in damages,in costs,and in statutory attorney fees.
autozone sells auto parts.fuentes,who was years old,worked as a customer service representative cashier for autozone at the florence and normandie store beginning in december.the store manager was juan vaca,the assistant store manager was melvin garcia,and gonzalo carrillo was one of the parts sales managers.garcia became acting store manager on may,when vaca went on leave.the relevant events occurred from may,to june,while vaca was away and garcia was acting manager of the store.
fuentes testimony related several incidents of inappropriate behavior and comments by garcia and carrillo.these included spreading rumors that she had sexually transmitted herpes and that she and a coworker,ricardo jimenez,were engaged in a sexual relationship and suggesting that she could make more money working as a stripper or being photographed for a magazine in a bikini.in one incident,garcia physically moved fuentes to turn her around and display her buttocks to customers,while he was laughing and clapping.he did this in order to sell more autozone merchandise.later the same day,when two of the regular customers who had witnessed the first turning incident returned to the store,garcia told fuentes to be ready to turn around again for them.fuentes refused.garcia also told fuentes that if he and she owned the store,they could be rich because all she had to do was just turn around and show them her butt.
fuentes complained to carrillo about garcia conduct.carrillo reported it to edward beltran,the district manager.in a telephone conversation with beltran,fuentes described the incidents.she asked for and received a transfer to another store.the other store was not as convenient for her because she did not have a car and had walked to work at the normandie store.the last day fuentes worked at the normandie store was june.
after she was transferred to another store,fuentes met with ricardo bonilla,a district manager for autozone.she told him she had issues at the normandie store and felt no one was looking into the situation.he called the corporate office and put her on the telephone with someone from human resources.fuentes was placed on administrative leave while her complaints were investigated.garcia and carrillo were transferred from the normandie store and were later terminated on august.fuentes continued to work for autozone until,when she left voluntarily for reasons unrelated to this lawsuit.
fuentes sued autozone,garcia,and carrillo after receiving letters from the department of fair employment and housing.she alleged causes of action for sexual harassment in violation of the fair employment and housing act feha,et,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and slander.the trial court granted summary judgment to defendants.we found triable issues of material fact on the cause of action for sexual harassment and reversed the judgment in our unpublished opinion in fuentes i.we affirmed summary adjudication on the causes of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress and slander.
the case was tried to a jury.the jury returned a special verdict,finding unanimously that fuentes was subjected to unwanted conduct by garcia because of her gender that his conduct was severe or pervasive that a reasonable woman in fuentes circumstances would have considered the work environment to be sexually hostile or abusive that fuentes considered the work environment to be sexually hostile or abusive that garcia conduct was a substantial factor in causing harm to fuentes and that he was a supervisor for autozone.the jury reached the same unanimous findings about carrillo conduct.fuentes was awarded in damages as a result of the sexually harassing conduct by garcia and carrillo.the jury found that garcia and carrillo each were responsible for percent of fuentes damages.since autozone was strictly liable for the conduct of its supervisors,garcia and carrillo,the entire judgment was awarded against it.state of health services superior court cal th.

discussion 
fuentes argues that autozone has waived its challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the verdict because its discussion of the evidence presented at trial is incomplete and misleading.it is axiomatic that a n appellant asserting lack of substantial evidence must fairly state all the evidence,not just the evidence favorable to the appellant.citation.a n appellant who challenges a factual determination in the trial court a jury verdict,or a finding by the judge in a nonjury trial must marshal all of the record evidence relevant to the point in question and affirmatively demonstrate its insufficiency to sustain the challenged finding.citations.chicago title ins.amz ins.services,th.if the appellant fails to fairly state all material evidence,we may treat any challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence as forfeited.ibid.
we agree with fuentes that autozone discussion of the trial evidence was incomplete and slanted.while we would be justified in concluding that autozone has forfeited all arguments regarding the sufficiency of the evidence,we will instead address each issue on the merits.we apply the substantial evidence rule,accepting as true the evidence supporting the judgment,disregarding conflicting evidence,and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the judgment.chicago title ins.amz ins.services,supra,th at.in light of the arguments made by autozone that fuentes testimony is improbable,we emphasize that it is not our function on appeal to reweigh the evidence presented at trial.kelly cb i constructors,th.we defer to the jury on questions of the credibility of the witnesses,including fuentes.lenk total western,th.
before reaching the merits,we dispose of one other preliminary issue raised by fuentes.she argues that,based on our earlier opinion in fuentes i,the law of the case doctrine precludes autozone from relitigating the sufficiency of the evidence.fuentes relies on yu signet th,yu,but yu is distinguishable.in yu,the court held conclusions of law established the law of the case.ibid.but here,fuentes attempts to raise our earlier conclusion that triable issues of fact on the sexual harassment cause of action precluded summary judgment to establish that similar evidence presented at trial was sufficient to support the jury verdict.this case was tried to a jury and a verdict was reached.under these circumstances,the law of the case doctrine does not apply.
california law prohibits sexual harassment in the workplace,subd.j.this case involves the hostile environment theory of sexual harassment.fuentes had the burden of showing that the harassing conduct was severe enough or sufficiently pervasive to alter the conditions of employment and create a work environment that qualifies as hostile or abusive to employees because of their sex.citations.there is no recovery for harassment that is occasional,isolated,sporadic,or trivial.citation.hughes pair cal th,hughes.the test for hostile environment sexual harassment has both objective and subjective elements t o be actionable,a sexually objectionable environment must be both objectively and subjectively offensive therefore,a plaintiff who subjectively perceives the workplace as hostile or abusive will not prevail if a reasonable person considering all the circumstances,would not share the same perception.citation.id.at,italics added.
autozone challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence treats each incident or comment in isolation.it ignores the requirement that we consider the totality of the circumstances.this is contrary to the applicable law,as we explained in fuentes t he existence of a hostile work environment depends upon the totality of the circumstances.citation.hughes,supra,cal th at.w hether an environment is hostile or abusive can be determined only by looking at all the circumstances.these may include the frequency of the discriminatory conduct its severity whether it is physically threatening or humiliating,or a mere offensive utterance and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee work performance.harris forklift systems.miller department of corrections cal th.we turn to an examination of the evidence of harassment presented at trial 
humiliating fuentes by exploiting her body 
fuentes was a cashier.she testified that one day she was ringing up some customers when garcia approached,grabbed her hand and pushed her back to spin her around.he said show your butt to the customers and that way you can sell more.this is how you do wittdtjr.wittdtjr is the acronym for what it takes to do the job right.fuentes learned in training that the term refers to an autozone program geared to sell more items to customers.about five customers were present,including two whom fuentes recognized as regular customers who came in nearly every day.the customers laughed and giggled in response to garcia action.one of them moved his hips as if he was dancing.garcia told the customers in spanish tell her you want to see her,referring to fuentes.garcia also was laughing,clapping,and moving his hips.fuentes walked away,but was called back by garcia to finish the transaction with the customer.
later the same day,two of the same customers who were present during the first incident returned to the store.as they were walking toward the parts counter,garcia told fuentes get ready for them.he like,get ready to turn around again for them.fuentes said,no.one of the customers laughed.this time,garcia did not touch fuentes or spin her around.fuentes was uncomfortable and embarrassed.she told guadalupe garcia,another employee,about the incident and said she felt embarrassed.on another occasion,melvin garcia told fuentes that if she and he owned the store,they would be rich because all fuentes had to do was turn around and show them her butt.
excerpts of the deposition of guadalupe garcia were read at trial because she was unavailable.she recounted one incident at the cash register when garcia told fuentes in spanish to turn around,but said that garcia did not touch fuentes to effect the turn.she said fuentes did not turn.according to guadalupe garcia,the customers were laughing during this incident.
carrillo testified at deposition that guadalupe garcia told him about the incident in which melvin garcia made fuentes show her buttocks to the customers.this was after fuentes had complained to him about melvin garcia behavior.carrillo was asked whether fuentes told him that garcia had taken her hand to turn her around.he answered if i recall correctly,she did,and she did it in the form of a gesture.she gestured to carrillo that he had approached her and said,come on,turn around,like sticking her hand in the air above her head so she would stick her hand up and turn.she said the customers cheered her on.carrillo could not recall whether fuentes said garcia physically made her turn around,but he remembered that she said people started taunting her and cheering her on.while reporting this incident to him,fuentes was upset and angry.carrillo described her eyes as teary and her face as flushed.
herpes rumor 
fuentes developed a fever blister on her lip over the memorial day weekend.she called in sick on monday,may,but was told to come in to work.she worked a brief time before being sent home ill.fuentes returned to work the next day,may.she noticed garcia staring at the blister on her lip and looking at her coworker,jennifer arguelles.arguelles told fuentes hey,marcela,melvin garcia is saying that you have herpes.arguelles reported that garcia said look out for marcela when she comes to work so you can see her lip,her blister.this was the first reference to herpes fuentes had heard.
fuentes confronted garcia about his statements and he denied making them,blaming arguelles instead.she and arguelles went together to garcia who first said he would talk about it later but then said he did not want to talk about it.fuentes testified that garcia told them if they brought up the subject again,he would write both of them up and would fire fuentes.
arguelles corroborated fuentes testimony that the two women confronted garcia about the herpes rumor.arguelles said that garcia face turned red,but he did not deny the rumor.he told them to get back to work.carrillo did not discuss the herpes rumor with her.guadalupe garcia also testified that she heard the rumor that fuentes had herpes,but did not recall who said it.
four coworkers told fuentes they had heard the herpes rumor.veronica hernandez,who worked in another department at the store,asked fuentes whether she had heard that people were saying she had herpes.fuentes was upset and told ulises monsivais,a commercial manager at the normandie autozone store,that she could not believe that these managers were saying such things about her.monsivais told fuentes she should report it to vaca when he returned.fuentes also testified that she heard the herpes rumor about herself from jesus,an employee at another autozone store.jesus called the store and fuentes answered the call.he asked if he was speaking to fuentes,and then said that he heard you look nice but that you have herpes,that you the girl with the herpes.one of the managers told me.jesus would not identify which supervisor told him fuentes had herpes.
later fuentes again confronted garcia about his statement that she had herpes.he denied making the statement,said he did not want to talk about it again,and that he would fire her if she brought it up again.garcia told fuentes he had a photograph of her kissing coworker ricardo jimenez and would use that as grounds to fire her fuentes said that was impossible because she and jimenez were not involved in a relationship at that time.fuentes testified this incident occurred on may.
ulises monsivais testified that he was at work answering telephones when he heard a loud ruckus at the front of the store with laughing and giggling.he asked what was going on.garcia came back to where monsivais was working and said fuentes had herpes on her mouth.then both garcia and carrillo joined in making fun of the herpes rumor and carrillo repeated it.some autozone drivers and other sales associates were present.
carrillo testified that other employees repeated the rumor that fuentes had herpes after garcia started it.he identified salas,miles,guadalupe garcia,monsivais,jimenez,and one other whose name he could not recall,as employees who came to him to ask if he had heard that garcia was saying that fuentes had herpes.he said the employees as a group were laughing about the herpes rumor.fuentes told him that she learned from jimenez that garcia was saying that she had contracted herpes from performing oral sex on jimenez.fuentes also told him that an employee at another store asked her if she had herpes.
carrillo testified that garcia treated the herpes rumor as a big joke until he found out that fuentes had complained to carrillo,who then forwarded her complaint to the district office.garcia demeanor changed at that point.carrillo thought herpes was a sexually transmitted disease,like hiv.carrillo said he had a serious conversation about the rumor with guadalupe garcia,discussing the fact that this rumor was messed up and whether something was going to be done about it.
jennifer arguelles also worked at the normandie store during the relevant period.she overheard garcia and carrillo talking,giggling,and laughing together.she heard a mention of the word lips.arguelles testified that garcia and carrillo asked her if she had heard that they are saying the blisters on fuentes lips are herpes.she was helping customers at the time.garcia was giggling and laughing and smiling.garcia denied discussing the herpes rumor with jennifer arguelles.
comments involving jimenez 
jimenez testified that carrillo would ask him if he had hit marcela which jimenez understood to mean whether he had a sexual relationship with fuentes.carrillo asked jimenez,hey,bro,have you fucked marcela yet he also asked if jimenez had beat them cheeks up.jimenez said this was a query about fuentes because carrillo was always talking about marcela.jimenez explained that he worked every other day and carrillo always asked him about fuentes.jimenez said he told fuentes about this because he did not think it was right.when he told her,she stayed quiet and said nothing.
fuentes testified that jimenez told her that carrillo had asked him if he had fucked fuentes.this was after vaca left,between may and.jimenez also told fuentes that they were blaming him for the herpes because fuentes had sucked my dick.he also told her about the other comments by carrillo about having sex with fuentes.she was embarrassed and could not believe the managers were saying these things about her.
garcia and jimenez described an incident in which garcia,omar,carrillo,jimenez and a customer were talking.carrillo told jimenez ricardo,you should be careful with marcela fuentes.according to garcia,when jimenez asked what he was talking about,carrillo said be careful where you put your dick at with marcela.jimenez said carrillo told him that he should wash his dick because look what he had given marcela on her lip.garcia said he asked carrillo what he was talking about.carrillo mentioned that fuentes had herpes blisters on her lip.during this incident jimenez said garcia and the customer were giggling and laughing.jimenez got very upset and left.carrillo was laughing.garcia testified that he warned carrillo he was not supposed to be talking about the herpes rumor.he also asked carrillo if he was sure what he was talking about,and carrillo said,no.garcia denied thinking the blister on fuentes lip was herpes and said he did not know the word.this occurred while vaca was on leave and fuentes was still working at the store.there were customers in the cashier area,six or seven feet away,when carrillo made this statement.
jimenez told fuentes that carrillo had asked,why do you wash your privates,referring to the herpes rumors.he testified that fuentes looked mad and upset when he told her about this incident.fuentes said she heard about this after may,within three to four days of may.jimenez also told fuentes that carrillo said he had placed bets with some employees about jimenez having sex with fuentes.
monsivais testified that garcia asked him whether fuentes and jiminez were dating.he said he did not know.garcia asked this question a few times.monsivais talked with jimenez about garcia comments.
d.other sexual comments 
after vaca went on leave,carrillo asked fuentes to turn up the volume on the radio at work.he said oh,marcela,that my jam,can you turn it up.i got a lap dance with this fine ass cougar at the strip joint.according to fuentes,carrillo talked about strippers about twice a week after vaca left.she also said carrillo invited her to a strip club a couple of times,but she did not go with him.ulises monsivais testified that when vaca left,garcia and carrillo would refer to good looking women customers as cougars and would announce that there was a cougar in a particular aisle.they also would alert other workers to watch when women were reaching for oil on a bottom shelf.they did not do this when vaca was present.
one night when employees were cleaning the store in preparation for closing,carrillo announced that he was getting ready to go to a strip club and invited all present to go with him.fuentes did not accept the invitation.she told her coworker guadalupe garcia that she did not like carrillo inviting her to a strip joint.
on another occasion,fuentes was in the manager office.carrillo grabbed a magazine depicting women in bikinis from the top of the safe and asked her why she did not work at a strip club or pose for a magazine to make more money.in her answers to interrogatories,fuentes said this happened on june,but at trial testified that it was early or.she then changed her testimony and said it was,before june.
the store carries magazines jimenez described as lowrider magazines depicting women in bikinis.garcia told jimenez that fuentes was in the wrong profession and should be working for strip joints or posing for a lowrider magazine.
fuentes subjective feelings 
when the herpes rumor started,fuentes saw her coworkers look at her mouth,look at each other,and smile.they avoided eye contact with her.when she walked by,her coworkers would talk to each other,glance at each other,and look at her mouth.after the herpes rumor started she felt the customers disrespected her.they looked at her funny and one told her not to get mad.nobody,including garcia,made a comment about having herpes directly to her.
fuentes shared her distress at this treatment with a number of coworkers.monsivais testified that fuentes approached him and asked if he had heard what had happened to her.he told her she should report it to juan vaca,the store manager,when he returned.fuentes looked upset and her eyes were watery and sad.fuentes also approached jennifer arguelles and asked if she had heard the herpes rumor.
garcia conduct in making fuentes show her buttocks to the customers was especially disturbing to fuentes because she had told him that she was having problems with certain male customers.she was concerned for her safety when she walked home from work at night.she wore a sweater tied around her waist to cover her backside because of garcia conduct and the flirtation of the customers.this led to her being written up for a dress code violation.
fuentes was so upset by the incident in which garcia forced her to show her buttocks to the customers that she reported it to carrillo,the only other manager available.she also told carrillo about garcia spreading the herpes rumor.carrillo corroborated that fuentes had reported this conduct.
autozone argues that critical portions of fuentes testimony are inherently improbable.it contends that the incidents we have summarized above all occurred on june and june,rather than in the period between memorial day,may,and june,as fuentes contends.we have reviewed the timeline of events as presented by the testimony and conclude that it does not support the construction given it by autozone.fuentes heard about the herpes rumor and confronted garcia about it in late may,after the memorial day weekend.the incident during which fuentes was directed to display her buttocks to the customers occurred after that.other incidents,including the repetition of the herpes rumor and other sexualized comments,occurred at unspecified times during the may to june,period.autozone dismisses the comments to jimenez about whether his sexual conduct with fuentes had given her herpes because the statements were not made directly to fuentes.it contends that fuentes did not learn of these comments until june at the earliest.
autozone also cites inconsistencies about when fuentes first learned of the herpes comments.it contrasts fuentes testimony that jennifer arguelles came to her to ask if she had heard that garcia was spreading a rumor that she had herpes,with arguelles testimony that she heard garcia and carrillo laughing and giggling and mentioning the word lips.according to arguelles,it was fuentes who approached her about the rumor.
the different accounts of the turning incident presented at trial form the third basis for autozone claim that fuentes testimony is inherently improbable.while fuentes said that garcia grabbed her hand to turn her around,guadalupe garcia said he did not touch fuentes in the incident she observed.autozone argues that it is significant whether garcia made his comments in spanish during the display incident.
all of these issues are factual matters for resolution by the trier of fact.t he credibility of witnesses is generally a matter for the trier of fact to resolve.accordingly,the testimony of a witness offered in support of a judgment may not be rejected on appeal unless it is physically impossible or inherently improbable and such inherent improbability plainly appears.citation.similarly,the testimony of a witness in derogation of the judgment may not be credited on appeal simply because it contradicts the plaintiff evidence,regardless how overwhelming it is claimed to be.citation.beck development southern pacific transportation th.
to warrant the rejection of the statements given by a witness who has been believed by a trial court,there must exist either a physical impossibility that they are true,or their falsity must be apparent without resorting to inferences or deductions.citation.such cases are rare indeed.citation.diquisto county of santa clara th,diquisto.the diquisto court reasoning in rejecting a claim similar to the claim made by autozone is instructive this case does not warrant the conclusion that defendant testimony was inherently improbable.the claimed falsity is not apparent without resorting to inferences or deductions.citation.conflicts and even testimony which is subject to justifiable suspicion do not justify the reversal of a judgment,for it is the exclusive province of the trial judge or jury to determine the credibility of a witness and the truth or falsity of the facts upon which a determination depends.ibid.in short,plaintiffs claim that defendant testimony is inherently unbelievable can not be sustained.it thus provides no basis for reversal.ibid.
here,autozone attempts to avoid the deferential substantial evidence standard of review by labeling fuentes testimony inherently improbable.however,as our supreme court has made clear on repeated occasions,g enerally,doubts about the credibility of an witness should be left for the jury resolution.citation.except in rare instances of demonstrable falsity,doubts about the credibility of the witness should be left for the jury resolution people cudjo cal th.people hovarter cal th.people ennis th,ennis.the ennis court explained the inherently improbable standard addresses the basic content of the testimony itself,could that have happened rather than the apparent credibility of the person testifying.hence,the requirement that the improbability must be inherent,and the falsity apparent without resorting to inferences or deductions.citation.in other words,the challenged evidence must be improbable on its face citations and thus we do not compare it to other evidence except,perhaps,certain universally accepted and judicially noticeable facts.the only question is does it seem possible that what the witness claimed to have happened actually happened id.at.
the evidence in this case is not inherently improbable.it presents a common situation where there are inconsistencies and contradictions in trial testimony.as discussed,this is for resolution by the jury.we infer the jury credited fuentes testimony and the testimony corroborating it in light of the unanimous verdicts on liability.
the evidence at trial establishes that all the incidents and comments about fuentes,including the directive that she display her buttocks to customers to increase sales,the herpes rumors,and the profane speculation about a sexual relationship between her and jimenez,were focused on her gender.fuentes was made the object of sexual humiliation and exploitation for the entertainment of managers,employees including those at another store,and customers,tit,subd.b b defining physical harassment as interference with normal work or movement on basis of sex.when garcia was confronted by fuentes about the herpes rumor,he threatened to fire her if she raised the issue again.significantly,he supported his threat by referring to a fictitious photograph of fuentes kissing jimenez,another sexual reference.
while these events occurred over a compressed period of time,the approximately three weeks between may,and june,we find substantial evidence that the harassment suffered by fuentes was both pervasive and severe.during the time vaca was absent on leave,placing garcia and carrillo in charge,the harassment of fuentes was ongoing.the incidents in which garcia directed fuentes to use her body to increase sales were physically humiliating.the herpes rumor and the demands that she display her body to customers unreasonably interfered with fuentes ability to perform her work.the customers cheered and laughed at her,and an employee from another store repeated the herpes rumor when she spoke with him on the telephone for a business purpose.other groups of employees laughed about the herpes rumors.
the demands by garcia that fuentes display her body to customers as a means to increase sales,and the herpes rumors,distinguish this case from lyle warner brothers television productions cal th,lyle upon which autozone relies.in that case,a comedy writer assistant who worked on the production of the television show friends,sued for sexual harassment based on exposure to sexually coarse and vulgar language and conduct in the writers room.the court affirmed summary judgment for the defendants because most of the sexually coarse and vulgar language at issue did not involve and was not aimed at the plaintiff,or even other women in the workplace.id.at.the supreme court reasoned a hostile work environment sexual harassment claim is not established where a supervisor or coworker simply uses crude or inappropriate language in front of employees or draws a vulgar picture,without directing sexual innuendos or language toward a plaintiff or toward women in general.citations.id.at.here,the conduct of garcia and carrillo was specifically aimed at fuentes rather than toward women in general.unlike the plaintiff in lyle,fuentes was subjected to verbal abuse and harassment.id.at.
the work environment created by garcia and carrillo was objectively hostile and abusive,and thus unlawful.lyle,supra,cal th at.this case can be distinguished from the three cases which autozone contends raised the threshold for a showing of sexual harassment.the first of these is hughes,supra,cal th.
hughes involved a summary judgment motion based on sexual harassment under civil code section,which prohibits sexual harassment in certain business relationships outside the workplace.but it limits liability to harassing conduct that is pervasive or severe,the language used to define liability for sexual harassment in the workplace under feha.cal th at.the alleged sexual harassment was by a trustee of a trust in favor of a child and was directed at the child mother.the charge was based on comments made by the defendant in a single telephone conversation and in a brief statement the defendant made to the plaintiff in person later that day during a social event.id.at.during the telephone conversation,the defendant used terms of endearment and expressed his admiration and desire for plaintiff.at the social event,he told her he would get her on her knees eventually and i going to fuck you one way or another.id.at.the supreme court found this evidence insufficient to demonstrate either severe or pervasive harassment.it concluded that these isolated incidents in a single telephone call and one encounter were not pervasive.id.at.it also found the evidence was not sufficiently severe to qualify as sexual harassment.ibid.
