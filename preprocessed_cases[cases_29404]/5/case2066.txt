plaintiffs and appellants adel salawy and paul gerstley appellants appeal from the trial court orders awarding defendant and respondent ocean towers housing corporation respondent a total of in attorney fees against each of the appellants pursuant to civil code,subdivision f,which provides for reasonable attorney fees for the prevailing party in an action to enforce the governing documents of a common interest development.because the claims here were not such actions,we reverse the attorney fees awards.we hold that a defendant successful invocation of the governing documents as a defense does not entitle it to attorney fees if the claim was not brought to enforce those documents.
background 
appellants were residents and shareholders in respondent,a apartment cooperative in santa monica.because the apartment building was significantly damaged by the northridge earthquake,respondent shareholders undertook to renovate and repair the building.
in december,appellants each filed separate but identical complaints against respondent.in their complaints,appellants alleged that they were shareholders of respondent and holders of proprietary leases in the apartment cooperative operated by respondent as a common interest development within the meaning of section,subdivision c.appellants contended that respondent notified them in that all residents must vacate their units for approximately one year while repairs and renovations occurred respondent would pay for packing and relocation expenses insurance would cover homeowners dues and mortgage payments during the absence of the residents and units would be repaired and renovated using materials and workmanship of the same quality as that which existed before the earthquake.appellants alleged that they relied on respondent statements in vacating their units that their expenses were never reimbursed and that they incurred damages exceeding.appellants alleged that the promises were enforceable.appellants did not allege that they were seeking to enforce the terms of their proprietary leases or the bylaws or other governing documents of respondent.
respondent demurred to the complaints on the ground that appellants had not relied upon any promise but had merely done what was required of all shareholders during reconstruction of the building namely,move out.respondent also argued that the terms of respondent governing documents,which were binding on all shareholders,vested respondent board of directors with responsibility for renovation and repairs,and limited appellants remedies in the event of a dispute concerning the board maintenance and repair of the building.
respondent specifically relied on the following provisions of its bylaws concerning earthquake damage partial destruction.in the event that ocean towers is partially damaged or destroyed as a result of fire,earthquake,flood or other hazard and such damage is of such magnitude that it may reasonably be repaired or restored within one hundred twenty days after the occurrence of such damage or such damage is confined to not more than ten percent of the apartments or such damage does not substantially interfere with the use and occupancy of at least ten percent of the apartments,then the board shall cause such damage to be rebuilt and repaired and the cost thereof,net of any insurance proceeds,shall be assessed against all shareholders pro rata in the ratio set forth in section provided,however,in the case of the destruction of improvements which exceed the building standard,the board shall only be obligated to rebuild and repair such damage to the building standard.major damage or destruction.in the event of damage or destruction to the building which exceeds that set forth in but where the cost of restoration is less than sixty percent of the fair market value of ocean towers exclusive of value attributable to the land prior to such damage or destruction,then the decision as to the restoration of the building shall be placed before the shareholders at a meeting to be called by the board within thirty days after the occurrence of such destruction.if holders of a majority of the shares concur,then the building shall be restored and the cost of such restoration,net of insurance proceeds,shall be assessed against all shareholders pro rata respondent also relied on provisions of appellants proprietary leases that empowered respondent and its board with discretion concerning maintenance of the cooperative housing project limited tenants remedies to their rights as shareholders under respondent articles and bylaws and provided that no abatement of rent or other compensation be accorded tenants in connection with repairs or improvements to the project 
on february,appellants filed first amended complaints that were identical in all material respects to the original complaints,except that they alleged promissory estoppel as the basis for seeking to enforce the promises.the trial court sustained respondent demurrers to the amended complaints but granted appellants leave to amend within days.the record does not contain the trial court written ruling or order,nor does it show the ground for the trial court ruling sustaining the demurrers.appellants did not amend their respective amended complaints but instead sought to dismiss them without prejudice after the period had expired.respondent moved for dismissal of appellants actions with prejudice and for entry of judgment,which motions the trial court granted.the judgments were entered on october.
respondent filed motions for attorney fees pursuant to sections and,subdivision f.the trial court awarded respondent in attorney fees pursuant to section,subdivision f in each of appellants actions.appellants appealed the attorney fees awards,and the two appeals were consolidated.
discussion 
standard of review 
an order granting or denying an award of attorney fees is generally reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard of review however,the determination of whether the criteria for an award of attorney fees and costs have been met is a question of law.walker countrywide home loans,th,d,quoting ramos countrywide home loans,th,d.respondents entitlement to attorney fees under section,subdivision f is a question of law requiring a de novo standard of review.
attorney fees under section,subdivision f 
section is part of the act,which governs common interest developments in california.et subdivision f of section provides in any action specified in subdivision a to enforce the governing documents,the prevailing party shall be awarded reasonable attorneys fees and costs,subd.f.subdivision a of section states that the covenants and restrictions set forth in an associations governing documents are binding upon and enforceable by the association and all owners of separate interests the covenants and restrictions in the declaration shall be enforceable equitable servitudes,unless unreasonable,and shall inure to the benefit of and bind all owners of separate interests in the development.unless the declaration states otherwise,these servitudes may be enforced by any owner of a separate interest or by the association,or by both,subd.a.governing documents are defined in section,subdivision j as the declaration and any other documents,such as,operating rules of the association,articles of incorporation,or articles of association,which govern the operation of the common interest development or association,subd.j.
trial courts rulings 
although the record contains no statement by the trial court of its reason for sustaining the demurrers,the trial court expressly awarded attorney fees under section,subdivision f.thus,we may infer that its orders sustaining the demurrers were based on respondents governing documents.
the leases between appellants and respondent provided in the event of any action between the parties hereto seeking enforcement of any of the terms and conditions of this lease,the prevailing party in such action shall be awarded,in addition to damages,injunctive and other relief,its reasonable costs and expenses,not limited to costs and reasonable attorney fees.we may also infer that by not awarding fees under section,which provides for attorney fees pursuant to a contract,the trial court did not determine that there had been an action seeking enforcement of the lease.as this appeal only involves the application of section,subdivision f,we do not decide whether the leases and the attorney fees clauses in the leases may be applicable.we deal here only with a statute and not with a contract.
inapplicability of section,subdivision f 
section,subdivision f expressly limits the award of attorney fees to the prevailing party in an action to enforce the governing documents.appellants actions were not to enforce respondents governing documents because the complaints and the amended complaints contained no claim based on a right or remedy under the governing documents.instead,the claims were to enforce promises unrelated to the governing documents.demurrers or other defenses asserting the governing documents do not constitute action s to enforce the governing documents.
respondent argues that if a plaintiff attempts to frame an action as not enforcing the governing documents,but is in reality asserting a claim under the governing documents,a defendant who,in effect,enforces those documents by defeating the claim on the basis of the governing documents,may be deprived of attorney fees under section,subdivision f.respondent is correct that plaintiff can not avoid the attorney fees provisions if the essence of the claim falls within the enforcement of the governing documents.
thus,in kaplan fairway oaks homeowners th,d kaplan,the court affirmed an attorney fees award to a prevailing defendant pursuant to section,subdivision f,even though the amended complaint in that case did not purport to enforce the common interest developments governing documents.the plaintiffs in kaplan sought to enforce their proxy and cumulative voting rights to elect association board members by initially filing a complaint alleging violations of both the associations bylaws and the corporations code.when the association demurred on the ground that the plaintiffs had failed to pursue alternative dispute resolution as required by section,subdivision b,the plaintiffs amended their complaint to allege a breach of corporations code section as the sole cause of action.they specifically alleged that the articles and bylaws of the association provided for the right of the members to vote by proxy and attached those documents to the pleading.after the association prevailed at trial,the trial court granted the associations motion for attorney fees under section,subdivision f.the plaintiffs challenged the award on the ground that the sole theory of their amended complaint was a breach of the corporations code and that the action was not one to enforce the governing documents as required by section,subdivision f.the court of appeal affirmed the attorney fees award under section,subdivision f,reasoning that t he gist of the action,as revealed by the record,was to enforce the members proxy and cumulative voting rights under the bylaws it was an adversarial action to enforce the governing documents and was designed to protect the members from allegedly improper action by the association and preserve their rights to cumulative and proxy voting.kaplan,supra,th at,d.the court said that the are part of the governing documents.
here,however,the gist of appellants actions was not to enforce the governing documents.the actions,even if not meritorious,were based on an alleged promise unrelated to the governing documents.although respondents demurrer invoked the governing documents in order to defeat appellants claims,section,subdivision f does not authorize an award of attorney fees in this case.exxess electronixx heger realty th,d prevailing on tort claim does not result in award of attorney fees under a contract providing for such fees in an action to enforce a contract.
in palmer agee d,a tenant who successfully asserted section as a defense in an unlawful detainer action was awarded statutory attorney fees under former section which provided for the award for attorney fees to the prevailing party in an action arising out of sections to.in that case the court granted the tenants motion for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that the landlord had not complied with a written notice of termination requirement imposed by former section the court concluded that the action did arise out of civil code section,even though the tenant invoked the statute defensively.palmer agee,supra,d,is distinguishable from the instant case because the statutory language authorizing attorney fees in that case was broader than the language in the instant case.the statute in that case authorized an attorney fees award in an action arising out of the applicable statute.here,the applicable statute provides for attorney fees to the prevailing party in an action to enforce the governing documents,subd.f.even if a defensive contention arises out of the statute it does not constitute an action to enforce the governing documents.
the common understanding of an action to enforce is that it is a proceeding initiated by the filing of a claim.thus,an action not only encompasses the complaint but refers to the entire judicial proceeding at least through judgment and is generally considered synonymous with suit.nassif municipal court d.see exxess electronixx heger realty,supra,th at,fn,d.section of the code of civil procedure defines an action as follows an action is an ordinary proceeding in a court of justice by which one party prosecutes another for the declaration,enforcement,or protection of a right,the redress or prevention of a wrong,or the punishment of a public offense.section of the code of civil procedure provides a civil action is prosecuted by one party against another for the declaration,enforcement or protection of a right,or the redress or prevention of a wrong.
an action to enforce does not refer to specific pleadings or steps within the action or a defense.thus,a demurrer does not constitute an action to enforce a right.a demurrer is a pleading that challenges the legal sufficiency of another pleading.people hale d.the function of a demurrer is to test the sufficiency of a pleading by raising questions of law.holiday matinee,rambus,th,d salimi state comp.ins.fund th,d.a demurrer is not prosecuted against another code civ,and therefore is not an action to enforce.a defense is t hat which is offered and alleged by the party proceeded against in an action or suit,as a reason in law or fact why the plaintiff should not recover or establish what he seeks it is a response to the claims of the other party,setting forth reasons why the claims should not be granted.citation.exxess electronixx heger realty,supra,th at,fn,d.that the common meaning of action as in an action to enforce does not include procedural steps such as a demurrer or other defenses is illustrated by the following passage in an authoritative work the broad definition of action covers the following suits at law or in equity.citation.certain adversary proceedings that take place during a probate proceeding.citation.actions for declaratory relief.citations.actions for divorce dissolution of marriage.citation.witkin,cal.procedure ed.actions.there is nothing in this passage to suggest that a defensive matter raised by a demurrer is included in the term action.
as the court said in exxess electronixx heger realty,supra,th at page,d,which involved a lease provision,u nder any reasonable interpretation of the attorneys fee provision,we can not equate raising a defense with bringing an action or proceeding.by asserting a defense to the,heger realty did not bring an action or proceeding to enforce the lease or declare rights under it.similarly,here the defense of the governing documents by way of demurrer was not an action to enforce the governing documents.moreover,respondents position that a demurrer is an action,if carried to its logical conclusion,would have the anomalous consequence that if respondents demurrers had been overruled,respondent would be responsible for appellants attorney fees.treating a demurrer as an action could have unforeseen consequences in other
