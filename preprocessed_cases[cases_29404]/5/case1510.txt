matthew stephens and spectrum laboratories,collectively spectrum appeal the order of the united states district court for the district of nevada granting tech international,and laith haddad collectively tech motion for attorney fees under.stephens tech int l,section order.because the district court erred in finding the case exceptional,we reverse.
background 
spectrum is the owner of united states patent patent,which is directed to a method for removing unwanted substances from human urine samples using chromium trioxide in an aqueous solution while leaving unchanged one of certain other desired indicia,ph,nitrogen content,saccharide content,red blood cell count,or total solids content and color.the patent application contained two independent claims and sixteen dependent claims.the disputed method was initially represented by original independent claim and dependent claim 
a method to remove unwanted substances from urine samples comprising contacting the urine sample with an amount of a chemical oxidizing agent sufficient to oxidize at least of the unwanted substance in a volume of urine while leaving the various physical indicia characteristics of urine unaffected.
the method of claim wherein the oxidizing agent is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen peroxide,benzoyl peroxide,chromium trioxide,sodium permanganate,and potassium permanganate.
in the first office action,the united states patent and trademark office pto rejected all claims under,for lack of enablement because the specification neither described the unwanted substances to be removed nor enabled the removal of the unwanted substances while leaving the desired physical indicia unchanged.the pto rejected all claims under,for indefiniteness of,inter alia,the claim phrases the various physical indicia,the sample,the unwanted substance,and a volume of urine.the claims were also rejected under for obviousness in light of the schwarzhoff,adamczyk,and smith prior art references,which teach the use of bleach,vinegar,and lemon juice schwarzhoff hydrogen peroxide and peracids adamczyk and vinegar,lemon juice,and hydrogen peroxide smith as urine additives.
in response to this office action,stephens canceled claims and,and amended claim as follows 
a method to remove detectable amounts of an unwanted substance from a human urine sample comprising 
obtaining a human urine sample having detectable amounts of an unwanted substance selected from the group consissting sic of testosterone,estrogen,progesterone,anabolic steroids,ibuprohpan sic,acetaminophen,acetosalicylic acid,benzedrine,tetrahydrocannabinol,cocaine,morphine,codeine,nicotine,ethyl alcohol,and acetaldehyde 
contacting the human urine sample with an amount of a chemical oxidizing agent selected from the group consisting of chromium trioxide,sodium permanganate,and potassium permanganate sufficient to oxidize at least of the unwanted substance in a volume of urine while leaving the various physical indicia characteristic of the urine sample unaffected.
emphases added.
in its final rejection,the pto issued an indefiniteness rejection for,inter alia,the claim phrases the various physical indicia and a volume of urine sample.the pto also issued an obviousness rejection for the claims based on nebinger,which teaches using sodium dichromate as an oxidant to reduce the amount of cannabinoid or opiate in a urine sample.the examiner stated that it would have been obvious to optimize the concentration of sodium bichromate for the elimination of unwanted substances and with respect to chromium trioxide,it would have been obvious to use the acid in place of the salt sodium dichromate for its known chemical similarity.the examiner also rejected the claims as obvious based on nebinger in light of johnston,which teaches the use of potassium dichromate and potassium permanganate to remove interfering substances from urine samples.
in response to the final rejection,stephens canceled claim and amended claim,naming only chromium trioxide as an oxidizing agent and specifying that at least one physical indicium and color were to remain unchanged.claim in issued form reads 
a method to remove detectable amounts of an unwanted substance from a human urine sample comprising 
obtaining a human urine sample having detectable amounts of an unwanted substance selected from the group consisting of testosterone,estrogen,progesterone,anabolic steroids,ibuprofen,acetaminophen,acetylsalicylic acid,amphetamine,tetrahydrocannabinol,cocaine,morphine,codeine,nicotine,ethyl alcohol,and acetaldehyde 
contacting the human urine sample with an amount of chromium trioxide,sufficient to oxidize at least of the unwanted substance in a volume of urine while leaving at least one physical indicia selected from the group consisting of ph,nitrogen content,saccharide content,red blood cell count,and total solids content characteristic of the urine sample unaffected,while leaving the color of the resulting solution substantially unaffected.
patent,ll.emphasis added.stephens specifically cited the fact that his invention differed from nebinger in teaching the maintenance of color and one physical indicium after application of the oxidizer,while nebinger taught color change.this amendment was accepted,and the patent issued.
spectrum sued tech in the district court for patent infringement and cybersquatting in violation of d.tech counterclaimed for,inter alia,summary judgment of noninfringement and invalidity.the district court granted partial summary judgment of noninfringement to tech,holding no literal infringement because claim,which only claimed chromium trioxide,did not read on tech accused product,which used sodium dichromate.stephens tech int l.may,summary judgment order.it also held that the prosecution history of the patent estopped spectrum from claiming infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.tech moved in camera for section attorney fees,which the trial court denied as premature because tech stood to recover additional attorney fees if its remaining counterclaims survived trial.a subsequent settlement agreement was reached between the parties whereby all claims except for tech claim for section attorney fees were dismissed with prejudice.after supplemental briefing,the trial court granted tech motion for attorney fees,finding the case exceptional upon deciding that spectrum infringement suit was frivolous and in bad faith spectrum d notification regarding a separate patent application was litigation misconduct and spectrum background investigation and credit check on haddad conducted after summary judgment of noninfringement was vexatious behavior.spectrum appeals the court finding the case exceptional under section.we have jurisdiction under a.
discussion 
the determination whether to award attorney fees under section involves a process.first,the district court must determine whether tech proved by clear and convincing evidence that this case is exceptional.cybor fas,en banc.we review de novo whether the district court applied the proper legal standard under section,and we review the court factual findings,including whether the case is exceptional,for clear error.forest,abbott.we will hold the district court finding clearly erroneous when,despite some supporting evidence,we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.id.at quoting united states united states gypsum.second,if the court finds the case to be exceptional,it must then determine whether an award of attorney fees is appropriate,a determination we review for an abuse of discretion.cybor,at.
on appeal,spectrum argues that the district court found this case exceptional under section based upon three erroneous factual findings that spectrum had engaged in bad faith litigation by suing tech for infringement that spectrum had committed litigation misconduct by giving tech section notice of potential infringement regarding an unrelated patent application and that spectrum background investigation and credit check on haddad constituted vexatious behavior and evidence of litigation misconduct.
we agree with spectrum that the district court erred in finding this
