this case involves litigation over private attorney general fees awarded pursuant to code of civil procedure section in an action which has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest here,plaintiff ward connerly successfully pursued litigation to invalidate several state statutes as unconstitutional under article i,section of the california constitution,enacted in as proposition,which outlawed governmental preferential treatment by race,sex,and other categories.the state agencies that were the respondents in this writ of mandate action for the most part opted not to defend the statutes,or to litigate only issues of standing and justiciability.it fell to various amici curiae advocacy groups that were in favor of affirmative action to defend the state programs and statutes on the merits.at some point in the litigation,as will be elaborated below,the amici curiae were redesignated real parties in interest.after the litigation concluded,the trial court awarded section attorney fees,to be paid both by the state agencies and the advocacy groups as real parties.the award was upheld by the court of appeal.
the advocacy groups contend that they were in essence amici curiae,and were not liable for attorney fees in litigation to declare unconstitutional statutes they were not responsible for enacting or enforcing.connerly,on the other hand,contends that the advocacy groups should be liable for such fees because they were authentic real parties in interest,inasmuch as they had a direct interest in the litigation and were active participants that often shaped the defense of the statutes.we conclude that the advocacy groups were not opposing parties within the meaning of section,and therefore reverse the court of appeal judgment.
statement of facts 
the underlying litigation involved state and federal constitutional challenges to five statutory programs that fall within the general rubric of affirmative action.connerly state personnel bd.th,d.the litigation challenged the programs of six state agencies and officials the state personnel board,the state treasurer,the california community colleges,the department of general services,the state controller,and the lottery commission.pete wilson,in his capacity as the governor of california,commenced the litigation by filing,in the court of appeal,a petition for writ of mandate against these agencies and their officials.
a group of organizations and associations who were generally in favor of the challenged programs,the california business council for equal opportunity,california coalition of hispanic organizations,california hispanic chamber of commerce,california teachers association,hispanic contractors association,and society of hispanic professional engineers,greater los angeles chapter obtained permission from the court of appeal to appear as amicus curiae.amicus curiae asserted,among other things,that there was no justiciable controversy because the action was between the governor and his subordinate executive officers and agencies,and because no real parties in interest had been named.in response,the governor filed an amended petition for writ of mandate naming the amici curiae as real parties in interest.the california business council argued that such designation did not cure the justiciability problem because it was not an authentic real party in interest,with a direct interest in litigation,but rather an amicus curiae that disagreed with the governor policies and positions on affirmative action.
the court of appeal summarily denied the petition,and this court denied review without prejudice to filing in superior court.governor wilson then filed his petition for a writ of mandate in the superior court.in so doing,he again named the california business council as real party in interest.later,plaintiff ward connerly was permitted to join the litigation as a taxpayer litigant.connerly state personnel,supra,th at,d.connerly continued the litigation after governor wilson left office.ibid.
the california business council actively participated in the litigation.it initially sought to remove the case to federal court,an action in which the state defendants did not join,and which was rejected because of the state defendants lack of concurrence.once back in superior court,the california business council filed a motion to peremptorily challenge the trial judge,thomas cecil,which ultimately was successful.see california business council superior court th,d.it sought discovery regarding the affirmative action policies and practices of the various state agencies named in the litigation,and filed a successful motion to compel discovery when the governor was not forthcoming.
shortly after the case was returned to the superior court,the voters passed proposition,adding article i,section to the california constitution,prohibiting the state,inter alia,from granting preferential treatment to any individual or group on the basis of race three of the six state agencies and officials that were sued,the state personnel board,the department of general services,and the state controller,took no position on the litigation,claiming only that they were compelled to enforce existing statutes under article iii,section of the california constitution.the state treasurer and the lottery commission opposed the lawsuit on grounds of standing,justiciability,and lack of adversity,but did not otherwise defend on the merits any affirmative action program or statute.the board of governors of the california community colleges is the only state agency that appears to have defended its programs and the pertinent statutes on the merits as well as on issues of standing and justiciability.
eventually,the trial court entered a judgment invalidating one of the statutory schemes,as well as a portion of another,but otherwise upholding them.connerly state personnel,supra,th at,d.connerly appealed and the california business council those portions of the judgment at variance with its members respective positions.id.at,d.
the court of appeal held that the statutory schemes were unconstitutional for the most part,but that certain portions of three of those schemes could be severed and upheld.connerly state personnel,supra,th at,d.after judgment was entered,connerly moved for an award of attorney fees pursuant to section.the trial court determined that this was an appropriate case in which to make an award of attorney fees pursuant to section,a ruling that was not challenged on appeal.the total attorney fee award was eventually calculated at.the trial court ordered that the state personnel board,the california community colleges,the state treasurer,the lottery commission,the department of general services,and the california business council each pay of the total amount of attorney fees,rejecting the california business council contention that it should not be liable for such fees.the california business council appealed,and plaintiff connerly to challenge the disallowance of a portion of the fees claimed by his attorneys.
the court of appeal affirmed the trial court attorney fee award.it reviewed various court of appeal cases,discussed below,holding that real parties in interest that actively participate in litigation may be assessed attorney fees,even though they were not responsible for initiating or enforcing the policies that were the subject of the underlying litigation.the court of appeal focused on the trial court finding that the california business council groups participated in the litigation as parties,distinguishing themselves from the typical amicus curiae.the court of appeal also rejected connerly.we granted the california business council petition for review 
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
the court of appeal reviewed the trial court award of fees under an abuse of discretion standard.the parties argue about the proper standard,with the california business council contending that the issue before us should be reviewed de novo,and connerly arguing in favor of the abuse of discretion standard.
the proper standard of review was set forth in carver chevron usa,th,d on review of an award of attorney fees after trial,the normal standard of review is abuse of discretion.however,de novo review of such a trial court order is warranted where the determination of whether the criteria for an award of attorney fees and costs in this context have been satisfied amounts to statutory construction and a question of law.
here,the question is whether the california business council can be assessed attorney fees under section as an opposing party within the meaning of that statute.under some circumstances,this may be a mixed question of law and fact and,if factual questions predominate,may warrant a deferential standard of review.see crocker national bank city and county of san francisco cal d.as will become clear below,however,the material facts in the present case are largely undisputed.the controversy is over whether a litigant in the california business council somewhat unusual position can be considered an opposing party.this is a question of law and is reviewed by us de novo.see ibid.
b.the merits 
section provides in pertinent part upon motion,a court may award attorneys fees to a successful party against one or more opposing parties in any action which has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest italics added.thus,only an opposing party can be liable for attorney fees under section.
whether the california business council was an opposing party within the meaning of section is ultimately a question of statutory construction.the fundamental purpose of statutory construction is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the law in order to determine this intent,we begin by examining the language of the statute.in re marriage of harris cal th,d.because the term opposing parties is not defined,it can be assumed that the legislature was referring to the conventional definition of that term.as we have recognized,the edition of black law dictionary current at the time that section was drafted states that p arty is a technical term having a precise meaning in legal parlance it refers to those by or against whom a suit is brought,the party plaintiff or defendant graham daimlerchrysler cal th,d,citing black law dict.ed.
generally speaking,the opposing party liable for attorney fees under section has been the defendant person or agency sued,which is responsible for initiating and maintaining actions or policies that are deemed harmful to the public interest and that gave rise to the litigation.see,graham daimlerchrysler,supra,cal th,d,city of los angeles cal th,d,maria riles cal d.by this standard,the california business council clearly is not an opposing party because it was responsible neither for enacting nor enforcing the statutes that were judged to be unconstitutional in the underlying litigation.
moreover,amici curiae traditionally have not been considered parties liable for attorney fees.see,choudhry free cal d,attorney fees and costs assessed against the real party under federal statute awarding attorney fees to prevailing parties in voting rights cases even though amicus curiae,rather than the respondent or the real party in interest,litigated the case.amici curiae,literally friends of the court,perform a valuable role for the judiciary precisely because they are nonparties who often have a different perspective from the principal litigants.amicus curiae presentations assist the court by broadening its perspective on the issues raised by the parties.among other services,they facilitate informed judicial consideration of a wide variety of information and points of view that may bear on important legal questions.bily arthur young cal th,fn,d.
the california rules of court formalize the distinct role of amici curiae by making separate provisions for receipt of amicus curiae briefs.see cal.rules of court,rules c,f.the range of groups that may be granted amicus curiae status is well illustrated by the participants in the present case.the california business council and the other advocacy groups initially appearing as amici curiae in this case are groups generally interested in the protection of minority and civil rights.appearing on their behalf as amicus curiae before this court is the product liability advisory council,which seeks to reform product liability law,and counts among its members chevron corporation,the dow chemical company,and general motors corporation.the law firm representing connerly,the pacific legal foundation,has often appeared in this court as amicus curiae to advocate for individual property rights and limited government.see,marine forests society california coastal com.cal th,d.the availability of such diverse views through amicus curiae participation enriches the judicial decisionmaking process.
connerly does not dispute that a conventional amicus curiae that files briefs on behalf of one of the parties and may participate in oral argument is not an opposing party within the meaning of section.nor does he argue that the mere designation of an amicus curiae by one of the parties to litigation as a real party in interest necessarily makes that amicus an opposing party.he contends,however,that real parties in interest may be considered opposing parties,and that the california business council was a real party in the present case.the california business council for its part does not argue against the general proposition that real parties can be held liable for attorney fees,but contends that they were not authentic real parties.
to address this issue,we begin by examining the meaning of real party in interest.as was stated in sonoma county nuclear free zone superior court d.sonoma county nuclear free zone real party in interest has been generally defined as any person or entity whose interest will be directly affected by the proceeding citation.while the real party in interest is usually the other party to the lawsuit or proceeding being challenged citation,it may be the person or entity in whose favor the acts complained of operate or anyone having a direct interest in the result citation,or the real adverse party in whose favor the act complained of has been done.
connerly cites sonoma county nuclear free zone in support of his position that the california business council had an interest that was directly affected by the litigation.in that case,involving the sonoma county nuclear free zone initiative on the november ballot,the opponent of the initiative dubbed by the court of appeal had requested that the county clerk accept its ballot argument after the clerk deadline,and was refused.then filed a petition for writ of mandate in superior court to compel the county clerk to accept the late filing,but failed to notify the initiative proponent.the superior court granted the writ petition.subsequently filed a petition for writ of mandate of its own,claiming the superior court erred,in part because was a real party in interest in the previous mandate action and should have received notice of petition for writ of mandate.
the court of appeal agreed.stating,as discussed above,that a real party is defined as any person or entity whose interest will be directly affected by the proceeding sonoma county nuclear free zone,supra,d at,the court concluded that met that definition.and were two cognizable groups contesting the merits of a county initiative.as the group who had authored and filed a direct pro argument for the november ballot,had a clear,direct interest in the question whether should be permitted a late filing.writ petition sought relief from deadlines set to ensure reasonable time for distribution of sample ballots.even though the trial court happened to find that the late filing would not jeopardize the printing process,had a direct interest in litigating the question and participating in the hearing.id.at.
also made the related argument that was not beneficially interested in the litigation and could not bring the writ of mandate action pursuant to section,which requires such interest.the court of appeal observed that u nder the circumstances of this case,whether had a direct interest sufficient to make it a real party below,and whether it has a benefi
