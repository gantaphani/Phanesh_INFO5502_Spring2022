facts and procedural history 
the instant action arises from a reversal of the trial court final judgment awarding the petitioners the prices attorneys fees.see tyler,so d at.this action involves four parcels of property.see id.at.parcel a is a marina presently owned by the respondents the tylers.see id.parcel b is a mobile home park presently owned by the prices.see id.over the northwest portion of parcel b is a roadway easement granted to parcel a the easement.see id.to the east of this easement exists a parcel of land the trapezoid parcel,which leads to the marina basin.see id.prior to,charles and ruth snyder owned all of the property involved in this action.see id.in,the snyders sold parcel b to ravenswood,and the parties executed an agreement reserving the easement in favor of parcel see id.at.the parties agreed that parcel a could not be used in a way that would create a nuisance to parcel see id.in addition,the agreement provided that the snyders would convey the trapezoid parcel to ravenswood if they ever sold parcel see id.in,ravenswood sold parcel b to stanley and maria klosinski.as a result of stanley death,maria klosinski obtained sole ownership of the property.see id.
in,the snyders executed a lease and option to purchase parcel a,excluding the trapezoid parcel,to the tylers.see id.in,the tylers exercised this option and purchased the property.see id.notwithstanding that the recorded agreement required the snyders to convey the trapezoid parcel to ravenswood,or its assigns,in the event that parcel a was sold,no such conveyance was made.see id.thus,title to the trapezoid parcel remained with the snyders.see id.
in,gustavo passerelli purchased parcel b from klosinski,subject to the easement and a purchase money mortgage.see id.the same year passerelli also purchased parcel a,the legal description for which included the trapezoid parcel,from the tylers,also subject to a purchase money mortgage.see id.passerelli failed to make payments on both mortgages,and both klosinski and the tylers foreclosed on their mortgages,securing judgments of foreclosure.see id.the certificate of title issued by the court to the tylers included parcel a and the trapezoid parcel.see id.the certificate of title to klosinski included parcel see id.klosinski then sold parcel b to the petitioners,dallas and angela price.see id.
in,the prices filed an action against the tylers seeking termination of the easement,alleging that it was personal to the snyders,and also requesting the entry of a judgment declaring that they had exclusive use and possession of the trapezoid parcel pursuant to the agreement.see id.the prices subsequently amended their complaint to seek damages,alleging that the marina located on parcel a was a nuisance to parcel see id.the tylers answered and counterclaimed for declaratory relief,requesting that the court declare the easement to be perpetual and running with the land.see id.the tylers also requested that the court either declare a prescriptive easement in both the easement and the trapezoid parcel,or quiet title to the trapezoid parcel in them based upon the certificate of title they acquired when they foreclosed passerelli mortgage.see id.after the action was filed,charles snyder,as surviving owner,transferred his interest in the trapezoid parcel to the prices.see id.at.
in the final judgment quieting title,the trial court determined that the easement had been extinguished in when passarelli acquired both parcel a and parcel regarding the trapezoid parcel,the trial court found that when the snyders sold parcel a to the tylers in,the agreement obligated the snyders to convey the trapezoid parcel to the prices predecessor in title.therefore,the prices predecessors had obtained equitable title,which the snyders held in trust.when the snyders transferred legal title in,combining it with the equitable title,the prices acquired sole title to the trapezoid parcel.based on this reasoning,the trial court quieted title in the prices and ejected and ousted the tylers from the easement and the trapezoid parcel.the trial court awarded costs and attorneys fees to the prices pursuant to the final judgment quieting title.
on appeal,the fourth district reversed the trial court determination that the easement had been extinguished,but affirmed the judgment insofar as it quieted title to the trapezoid parcel of land in the prices.see tyler,so d at.in addition,the fourth district reversed the award of attorneys fees granted to the prices in their quiet title action.see id.in reversing the award of attorneys fees,the fourth district stated 
the prices did not request attorney fees in their pleadings.see stockman downs,so d.while the prices claim that they did not have to plead attorney fees based upon glusman lieberman,so d,dca,in which this court held that attorney fees were considered part of the damages in a slander of title case,the prices did not allege a slander of title claim.instead,they sued for declaratory judgment,and the court entered a judgment quieting title.neither type of action permits the recovery of attorney fees absent a contractual provision or a statute authorizing the same.moreover,attorney fees in slander of title cases are considered special damages.see bloom weiser,so d,dca.florida rule of civil procedure g states,w hen items of special damage are claimed,they shall be specifically stated.thus,the prices are not entitled to attorney fees.
tyler,so d at emphasis added.
the prices sought review of the fourth district decision with regard to the extinguishment of the easement and the award of attorneys fees.on april,this court granted review of the fourth district decision.see price tyler,so d,table 
the primary issue in the instant action is whether the prices are entitled to recover attorneys fees as the prevailing party in the quiet title action.our legal precedent in this area of the law is reasonably clear.as this court has determined,a ttorney fees incurred while prosecuting or defending a claim are not recoverable in the absence of a statute or contractual agreement authorizing their recovery.bidon dep t of prof l regulation,so d.in addition,this court in pepper steel alloys,united states,so d,reaffirmed the general rule that u nder florida law,each party generally bears its own attorneys fees unless a contract or statute provides otherwise.id.at see also state farm fire cas.palma,so d,this court has followed the american rule that attorney fees may be awarded by a court only when authorized by statute or by agreement of the parties.florida patient comp.fund rowe,so d,recognizing that this court has adopted the american rule that attorney fees may be awarded by a court only when authorized by statute or by agreement of the parties kittel kittel,so d,it is an elemental principle of law in this state that attorney fees may be awarded a prevailing party where authorized by contract and where authorized by a constitutional legislative enactment.therefore,pursuant to controlling authority,the prices are only entitled to attorneys fees if a statute or contract provides for such fees.
in the decision below,the fourth district pursuant to our precedent correctly determined that attorneys fees are not recoverable in declaratory relief or quiet title actions,absent an independent statutory or contractual basis.see tyler,so d at.the prices rely,however,on the fifth district decision in saporito in asserting their entitlement to attorneys fees.in saporito,the district court affirmed the award of attorneys fees stating it was following the trend of decisions upholding an award of attorney fees as damages in suits to quiet title or remove a cloud from title.saporito,so d at emphasis added citing susman schuyler,so d dca and glusman lieberman,so d dca.howev
