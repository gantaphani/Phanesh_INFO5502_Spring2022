a.the standards of proof and review 
under the applicable fee recovery statute,a prevailing party may be entitled to recover the attorney fees incurred during his appeal to the board.this section provides that 
t he board,or an administrative law judge or other employee of the board designated to hear a case,may require payment by the agency involved of reasonable attorney fees incurred by an employee or applicant for employment if the employee or applicant is the prevailing party and the board,administrative law judge,or other employee as the case may be determines that payment by the agency is warranted in the interest of justice,including any case in which a prohibited personnel practice was engaged in by the agency or any case in which the agency action was clearly without merit.
g emphasis added.under board decisions,in order to establish reasonableness,the applicant must provide specific evidence of the prevailing rate for similar work.mitchell dep t of health and human.
at the time of willis motion,moreover,the board regulations required that a fee applicant submit evidence of the prevailing community rate for similar services that will establish a market value for the attorney services.a.although not defined in this regulation,the board has construed community as the geographical area where the board hearing is scheduled to occur.manley dep t of the air force.willis has urged this court to overrule manley on this point,arguing that neither nor the regulation provides support for such a construction of the word community.we review the board interpretation of its own regulations with deference.while we are not bound by board decisions such as manley,we hereby adopt its holding that community should be interpreted as the locality where the board hearing is scheduled,because the board construction has not been shown to be unreasonable or inconsistent with the regulation.thus,under board case law,willis had to submit specific evidence that the requested billing rates were consistent with those prevailing in the community where her board hearing was,west virginia.mitchell,at 
our standard of review on appeal from a decision of the board is largely deferential.pursuant to c supp.iv,where there has been no allegation of procedural error,we reverse the board decision only if we find it to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.we,of course,are not bound by board decisions,although,as noted above,we are respectful of the board interpretation of its own regulations.we review the board interpretation of the statutory law without deference,however.here,we reverse the board decision because it improperly denied recovery of fees at the requested rates by imposing an evidentiary burden on willis based upon case law that is not applicable to this case.

the evidence submitted by willis 
in support of her motion for attorney fees,willis submitted the lopez and gamlin affidavits,her representation contract with the difalco firm,and the three board decisions awarding fees for work done by difalco lawyers in unrelated appeals,at their customary rates.in her affidavit,lopez asserted that her contract rate was average in comparison to rates charged by lawyers in complex employment cases in the charleston,west virginia area.gamlin asserted likewise in his affidavit,using substantially identical language.contrary to the administrative judge conclusion that willis submitted no relevant evidence,affidavits are themselves evidence.we discuss below whether the assertions they contain are too conclusory.
