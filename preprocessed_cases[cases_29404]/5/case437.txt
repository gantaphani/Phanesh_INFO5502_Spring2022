the question in this appeal is whether the equal access to justice act the eaja,contains an unequivocal expression of congressional intent to waive sovereign immunity to authorize the assessment of an award of attorneys fees against the united states in a habeas corpus proceeding.the eaja provides that a court shall award reasonable attorneys fees to a prevailing party other than the united states in any civil action other than cases sounding in tort,including proceedings for judicial review or agency action,brought by or against the united states unless the court finds that the position of the united states was substantially justified.d a emphasis added.applying this provision,the district court entered an order awarding joseph in attorneys fees incurred in connection with his successful prosecution of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus,which he filed against the federal bureau of prisons under.
appealing the district court order,the government contends that congress did not waive sovereign immunity as to such an award because,in waiving sovereign immunity as to an award of attorneys fees to a prevailing party in a civil action,congress did not unequivocally express an intent to waive sovereign immunity as to an award of attorneys fees to a prevailing party in a habeas corpus proceeding.the government also contends that its position in this habeas corpus proceeding was substantially justified.
because the eaja does not expressly authorize an award of attorneys fees to a prevailing party in a habeas corpus proceeding and because the term civil action does not unambiguously encompass habeas actions,we conclude that the eaja does not contain the unequivocal expression of congressional intent necessary to amount to a waiver of sovereign immunity and thereby permit the assessment of attorneys fees against the united states in a habeas corpus proceeding.accordingly,we reverse and vacate the district court order without reaching the government argument that its litigating position was substantially justified.
after joseph pleaded guilty to bank fraud in the eastern district of pennsylvania,the district judge sentenced him,on february,to months imprisonment and recommended that,when he became eligible,be designated to serve his sentence at the mcleod community corrections center,a halfway house in charlotte,north carolina.instead of sending to prison,the federal bureau of prisons designated to serve his entire sentence at the mcleod center.
on december,the office of legal counsel of the united states department of justice rendered a memorandum opinion for the deputy attorney general,which concluded that the bureau of prisons practice of placing offenders sentenced to specified prison sentences in halfway houses at the outset of their sentence or transferring them from prisons to halfway houses at any time the bureau of prisons chose was unlawful under the sentencing guidelines and under and.the opinion applied to offenders sentenced to terms of imprisonment within either zone c of the sentencing guidelines sentencing table providing for to months imprisonment or zone d providing for months to life imprisonment.
consistent with the justice department position,was notified on december,that he would be redesignated to serve the remainder of his sentence in a federal prison.in january,he was formally redesignated to a federal prison camp,to be transferred there on or about january.
and three other inmates commenced this habeas action on january,by filing a joint petition for a writ of habeas corpus under by prisoners in federal custody.they requested a temporary restraining order,pending a hearing on their motion for a preliminary injunction,that they not be transferred from the mcleod center to a federal prison camp.following oral argument,the district court issued a temporary restraining order on january,to expire on february.the court also scheduled a hearing on that date on the motion for a preliminary injunction.when filed a motion before the scheduled hearing date to postpone the hearing until february,the district court,over the government objection,extended the temporary restraining order until that date.the court also rescheduled the hearing on the motion for a preliminary injunction to take place on that same date.shortly before the newly scheduled hearing date,when had not yet filed his memorandum of law in support of his motion for a preliminary injunction,the district court,sua sponte,extended the temporary restraining order a second time,until march.in its order,the court ruled that the limit imposed by federal rule of civil procedure b did not apply because the temporary restraining order was entered with notice.
the government moved to dissolve the second extension of the temporary restraining order,arguing that the district court was without authority to extend the temporary restraining order beyond days.in support of its position,the government cited three cases and a passage from wright miller federal practice and procedure,which states that days is the longest that a temporary restraining order can be operative.charles alan wright,arthur miller,mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure ed.in response to this motion,the court scheduled a hearing on february,following which it entered an order dated march,granting motion for stay of any redesignation or transfer which was made and orally granted at the february hearing and his motion for a preliminary injunction.
during the february hearing,the district court stated that it thought the government had misrepresented the law when arguing that there was a time limit for temporary restraining orders 
you misrepresented the import of the cases to the court.you overstated it and you done so in a way that in a civil case,if the other side moved for sanctions,i would have to seriously consider it.
i think the case law is clear in the fourth circuit that only a temporary restraining order issued for an indeterminate period of time becomes a preliminary injunction.
the court then received argument from the parties on the merits of the habeas petition.
on may,the government mooted habeas petition and agreed that he would not be redesignated to a federal prison camp,but would continue to serve the remainder of his sentence,which was scheduled to expire in february,at the mcleod center.the district court confirmed the government agreement in an order dated june.
having thus prevailed on his habeas petition,moved the district court for an award of attorneys fees and costs pursuant to the eaja,arguing that the government position in the litigation was not substantially justified.the government opposed this motion,alleging that its position on the proper facility in which to serve a sentence of imprisonment of over months was substantially justified,based on a series of successes in similar cases in other federal courts.while the district court recognized the government other successes,it concluded that they were merely one factor that the court should consider in deciding whether to make an award under the eaja.noting that it was also to consider the reasonableness of the government stance in the litigation,the court referred to the government position with respect to the viability of a temporary restraining order beyond days,noting 
for instance,in the hearing for the preliminary injunction in this matter,this court considered imposing sanctions on the government for its clearly erroneous representations of the law.
the court concluded 
therefore,in the totality of the circumstances,tak ing into account objective indicia of substantial justification,such as the alleged string of successes as well as the specific facts of the instant litigation,the court finds that the government was not substantially justified in the position it took in this specific case.furthermore,and in the alternative,based on the stances taken by respondents in the hearing,as well as their pleadings to this court,the court finds that respondent has undermined any substantial justification that might have existed.
the court then awarded attorneys fees,costs,and expenses under the eaja in the amount of.
the government filed a motion for reconsideration,raising for the first time the issue of sovereign immunity and arguing that under the eaja the united states waived its sovereign immunity only with respect to attorneys fees in civil actions and that a habeas corpus proceeding was not a civil action for purposes of the eaja.the district court rejected the government argument,and,distinguishing circuit court cases that had concluded that a habeas proceeding was not a civil action for purposes of the eaja,the court stated that petitioner claim was not merely a vindication of his own personal rights,but a challenge to a regulatory policy that had a sweeping effect on a large class of actual and potential inmates quoting in re hill,cir.the court continued,despite its name or label,the action in this case is precisely the type of civil action congress sought to encourage by enacting the eaja.emphasis in original.
from the district court order,the government filed this appeal,contending that habeas action was not a civil action with respect to which the united states waived its sovereign immunity through the eaja,and that the government position in this litigation was,in any event,substantially justified,precluding an award of attorneys fees to.
it is that a ttorneys fees may be assessed against the united states only when it has waived its sovereign immunity by statute.united states dawkins,cir emphasis added see also ardestani ins,d a forbidding a fee award against the united states except as otherwise specifically provided by statute.and such a waiver may not be implied.see lehman nakshian,d.to the contrary,sovereign immunity is presumed and can not be overcome without an express and unequivocal statutory waiver,and all ambiguities must be resolved in favor of the sovereign.research triangle inst.bd.of governors of the fed.reserve,cir citing lane pena,d.thus,t o sustain a claim that the government is liable for awards of monetary damages,the waiver of sovereign immunity must extend unambiguously to such monetary claims.lane,at.emphasis added.
accordingly,in deciding whether,through the eaja,congress waived the government sovereign immunity for an award of attorneys fees in habeas actions,o ur task is to discern the unequivocally expressed intent of congress,construing ambiguities in favor of immunity.united states williams,d quoting united states nordic village,d.more specifically,we must determine whether a statutory waiver of sovereign immunity for awards of attorneys fees in civil actions unambiguously covers habeas corpus proceedings.
contends that the district court correctly determined that his habeas corpus petition was a civil action for purposes of the eaja.following the rationale of the district court,notes that the eaja includes within the scope of the term civil action any proceedings for judicial review of agency action,d a,and he argues that his habeas corpus petition was such a proceeding to review agency action regardless of the procedural vehicle used to present the claim.thus,contends that despite the fact that his action was styled as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus,it was in fact directed at challenging the bureau of prisons policy,and as such,it was a civil action for purposes of the eaja.for authority,relies principally on language from the ninth circuit opinion in in re hill,which notes 
w e must look to the substance of the remedy sought,not the labels attached to the claim,in determining whether a proceeding falls within the term any civil action of the eaja.in contrast to the challenge of unlawful criminal custody in boudin thomas,cir,hill sought to gain admission into this country and,in essence,sought to secure a declaratory judgment that the government policy of excluding homosexual aliens without a medical certificate was improper.hill claim was not merely a vindication of his own personal rights,but a challenge to a regulatory policy that had a sweeping effect on homosexual aliens seeking to enter the united states.
at the outset,we point out that the eaja does not provide a definition of the term civil action,and its terms do not explicitly include or exclude habeas corpus proceedings.success,therefore,depends on whether civil action,as used in the eaja,unequivocally or unambiguously includes a habeas proceeding.
we begin by recognizing that courts have,for a long time,categorized habeas cases as civil in nature.see,hilton braunskill,d ex parte tom tong.while such a categorization might have been for the convenience of choosing between the criminal and civil labels,see,fisher baker.noting that a habeas proceeding is a civil,and not a criminal,proceeding tom tong,at.noting that p roceedings to enforce civil rights are civil proceedings,and proceedings for the punishment of crimes are criminal proceedings boudin thomas,cir same,such a gross classification could also be justified by the fact that habeas proceedings employ to some degree the federal rules of civil procedure,see.a.but any such classification involving only two and always been an uncomfortable one,and there can be no doubt that labeling habeas as either civil or criminal is gross and inexact.harris nelson,d.
the appropriate classification of habeas actions becomes even more ambiguous when habeas characteristics are closely reviewed against the characteristics of,and distinctions between,civil and criminal actions,which are themselves not clear.see indus.of,kelco disposal,d.when examining the differences between civil and criminal actions for purposes of applying the excessive fines clause of the eighth amendment to a punitive damages award,the court in described a civil action as one involving a dispute between private parties and damages paid to a private party or other remedies for a private wrong,and a criminal action as one involving the prosecution of conduct by a sovereign to exact punishment.id.at.id.at.stevens,concurring in part and dissenting in part.while that distinction might not be universally true and therefore is likely to be imperfect,it nonetheless serves to highlight the reality that a habeas corpus proceeding is neither a wholly criminal nor a wholly civil action,but rather a hybrid action that is unique,a category unto itself.see walker,cir.
the habeas corpus proceeding is specifically designed to protect individual liberty and redress unlawful detention.t he essence of habeas corpus is an attack by a person in custody upon the legality of that custody,and the traditional function of the writ is to secure release from illegal custody.preiser rodriguez,d see also fay noia,d explaining that the jurisdictional prerequisite of a habeas proceeding is detention simpliciter.thus,to the extent that a habeas proceeding reviews a criminal punishment with the potential of overturning it,the habeas proceeding necessarily assumes part of the underlying case criminal nature in the same sense,for instance,that a declaratory judgment action takes on aspects of an underlying case.this criminal aspect was fully recognized by the supreme court in mcaninch,d,where the court applied a criminal standard of review to habeas proceedings,rather than a civil standard.see also murray giarratano,d,concurring noting that habeas corpus is a civil proceeding designed to overturn a presumptively valid criminal judgment the federalist,at alexander hamilton george carey james mcclellan,noting that habeas corpus serves as a bulwark against arbitrary methods of prosecuting pretended offenses,and arbitrary punishments upon arbitrary convictions.insofar as a habeas proceeding seeks to vindicate a civil right,however,it also has a civil aspect.see tom tong,at.and this aspect is reinforced by the fact that the procedure for resolving habeas petitions uses civil rules,albeit a streamlined collection of them.see.a rule governing cases.
because habeas actions have both criminal and civil aspects,courts have routinely regarded them as hybrid actions.see,sloan pugh,cir concluding that habeas proceedings are unique or hybrid types of cases united states johnston,cir noting that a motion is a hybrid,with characteristics indicative of both civil and criminal proceedings parrott v
