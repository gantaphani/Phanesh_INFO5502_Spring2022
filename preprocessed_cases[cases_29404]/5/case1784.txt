background 
lockwood is an inventor.in the past three decades,he has obtained a dozen patents in the fields of multimedia search systems,interactive video computing terminals,as well as and computerized financial services.two of those patents are involved in the present case patent the patent,entitled automated sales and services system,and patent the patent,entitled automatic business and financial transaction processing system.lockwood applied for both patents in the patent issued in,and the patent issued in.
lockwood believed that companies using systems that included interactive,searchable computerized systems for finding,selecting,and ordering information,goods,or services infringed his patents.therefore,in he through his company,panip,llc instituted a patent enforcement program in which he offered licenses to companies he believed were infringing his patents if a company declined,he filed a patent infringement lawsuit against it.he had some initial success,obtaining license agreements in just over a year,but the program also resulted in dozens of patent infringement lawsuits filed in federal district court.sheppard mullin,through attorney hangartner,represented at least of the defendants in those lawsuits.
in response to the lawsuits,on may,sheppard mullin filed with the united states patent and trademark office uspto requests for reexamination of the and patents.the requests challenged the validity of the patents on the ground that the claims of the patents were anticipated by prior patents or publications,prior art.
under the patent laws,any person may file a request for reexamination.within three months after a request is filed,the uspto must determine whether the request raises a substantial new question of patentability affecting any claim of the patent.the patent owner is not permitted to file a statement or response to the request within this three month period.if the uspto determines that a substantial new question of patentability has been raised,it conducts a reexamination of the patent.at the conclusion of the reexamination,the uspto issues a certificate canceling any claim of the patent determined to be unpatentable,confirming any claim determined to be patentable,and incorporating in the patent any proposed amended or new claim determined to be patentable.
in the present case,the uspto determined that sheppard mullin requests for reexamination each raised a substantial new question of patentability,and granted the requests on july,for the patent and july,for the patent.it then conducted the reexamination over the next several years.
once the uspto granted the requests for reexamination,lockwood patent infringement lawsuits were stayed,and his enforcement program was ineffective because potential licensees refused to pay any licensing fees until the uspto determined the validity of the patents.lockwood ultimately agreed to settle the patent infringement lawsuits in the spring of and ended his enforcement program.
on june,the uspto issued a notice of intent to issue ex parte reexamination certificate that indicated the certificate would confirm the patentability of all claims of the patent.that certificate was issued on july.the uspto issued a similar notice of intent with regard to the patent on september.
meanwhile,on june,lockwood,acting in propria persona,filed the instant lawsuit.he alleged that sheppard mullin made false representations in the requests for reexamination,by misrepresenting the date of one of the alleged publications and misrepresenting what the other publications actually disclosed.he also alleged that sheppard mullin intended that the uspto would rely upon those misrepresentations to grant the requests,and that sheppard mullin was aware that lockwood would be unable to enforce his patents during the pendency of the reexamination proceedings,which typically last for several years.although the complaint does not set forth specific causes of action,it includes the following allegation defendants conduct was wrongful,and constituted willful and negligent interference with plaintiff economic and prospective economic advantages.defendant sic wrongful conduct also constitutes common law and statutory unfair competition under the common and statutory law of california,including california business and professions code,sections sic et.
sheppard mullin filed a demurrer and a special motion to strike the complaint under section.among other arguments,sheppard mullin asserted that all of lockwood causes of action were barred by the california litigation privilege,civil code section,subdivision b hereafter,section b.before his opposition was due,lockwood retained counsel and filed an amended complaint.the amended complaint alleged causes of action for malicious prosecution,intentional interference with prospective economic relations,and fraudulent misrepresentations,all of which were based upon the same facts alleged in the original complaint.
lockwood subsequently filed an opposition to sheppard mullin special motion to strike.he argued that section did not apply because the conduct upon which the causes of action are based was unprotected activity,and that federal law preempted section b and section because application of those statutes conflicted with federal interests in enforcing patent laws.he also contended he presented sufficient evidence to support his causes of action 
the trial court granted sheppard mullin special motion to strike.addressing only the original complaint,the court found that the lawsuit arose from protected activity,that the section b litigation privilege was not preempted by federal law,and that all of lockwood claims were barred by that privilege.when questioned about whether the court ruling applied to both the original and amended complaint,the court stated that it did not address whether lockwood had a right to amend his complaint and concluded the hearing.the written order does not address the amended complaint 
sheppard mullin filed a motion for attorney fees under section,subdivision c,as well as a demurrer and a special motion to strike the amended complaint.in its special motion to strike,sheppard mullin argued that the amended complaint could not be considered in light of the granting of the first special motion to strike.it also argued that,in any event,lockwood could not prevail on his interference and fraud claims because section b provided absolute immunity as the trial court previously ruled,and he could not prevail on his malicious prosecution claim because the uspto conducted an independent investigation before initiating the reexamination proceedings,and the statute of limitation barred that claim.
in opposition to the special motion to strike,lockwood once again argued that section and section b were preempted by federal law,and that the evidence he submitted was sufficient to establish prima facie claims of malicious prosecution,fraud,and intentional interference with prospective economic relations.the trial court granted the special motion to strike,finding that the amended complaint arose from protected activity and that lockwood could not prevail on his malicious prosecution claim because it was barred by the statute of limitations.the court denied the motion for attorney fees on the ground that sheppard mullin and hangartner were and therefore were not entitled to attorney fees.
lockwood timely filed notices of appeal from the orders granting each special motion to strike and hangartner timely filed a notice of from the order denying attorney fees.
discussion 
lockwood opening brief on appeal raises issues of federal jurisdiction and preemption of state law,as well as issues regarding the trial court rulings on the merits of sheppard mullin section motions.because we hold that lockwood complaint is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts,we need not address any other issues,nor do we address hangartner.
preliminary matters 
at the outset,we must acknowledge the peculiar circumstances of this case.lockwood,the party who filed his complaint in state court,is the party arguing that the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction of his claims.moreover,he did not assert this argument until after the trial court dismissed his claims on the merits.in fact,it was sheppard mullin that first raised the issue,in its reply brief in support of its first special motion to strike.in response to lockwood contention that sections and b were preempted by federal law,sheppard mullin wrote,if anything,it is lockwood complaint that is preempted if defendants defense truly poses an obstacle to the accomplishment of the federal scheme of patent law and the regulation of the uspto,then it is only because lockwood complaint itself is based upon conduct exclusively governed by federal patent law.
the first time lockwood raised the issue was at the hearing on the first special motion.at that hearing,his counsel noted that two days earlier,the federal circuit court of appeals decided two cases,air measurement tech akin gump strauss hauer air measurement and immunocept,llc fulbright jaworski,llp immunocept,that,according to counsel,suggest the instant case might be within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts.counsel did not,however,pursue this argument until this appeal,in which lockwood argues that,in fact,under the reasoning of those two federal circuit decisions,this case is subject to exclusive federal jurisdiction and should have been dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
sheppard mullin argues that we should reject lockwood argument because he failed to show prejudicial error or an appealable issue,since the of lockwood be the same regardless whether his argument prevails.what sheppard mullin overlooks is the difference between a dismissal on the merits and a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction.a dismissal on the merits has res judicata effect goddard security title ins.guar.cal d,a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction does not nichols canoga industries d.moreover,a dismissal on the merits can not be affirmed on appeal if the trial court did not have jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action instead,the judgment of dismissal must be vacated.chromy lawrance d.
the dismissal in the instant case was on the merits.hence,if lockwood is correct that his claims should have been dismissed for lack of jurisdiction,he was prejudiced by the dismissal on the merits,and we must vacate that dismissal and direct the trial court to enter a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.we certainly understand sheppard mullin frustration that lockwood is challenging the jurisdiction of the court in which he chose to file his claims.but as the ninth circuit recently commented,in a case in which a defendant removed the matter to federal court on federal question grounds and then challenged the federal court jurisdiction on appeal after the court ruled against it,the county may be guilty of chutzpah,but we must consider the merits of its argument anyway.international union of operating engineers county of plumas cir,holding that federal court lacked jurisdiction.
b.the law governing federal jurisdiction 
section of title of the united states code section provides in relevant part the district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action arising under any act of congress relating to patents such jurisdiction shall be exclusive of the courts of the states in patent cases.the united states supreme court in christianson colt industries operating,d christianson set out a test to determine whether a case is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction described in section.the court held that section jurisdiction extends only to those cases in which a complaint establishes either that federal patent law creates the cause of action or that the plaintiff right to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal patent law,in that patent law is a necessary element of one of the claims.id.at.see also franchise tax bd.laborers vacation trust,d even though state law creates appellant causes of action,its case might still arise under the laws of the united states if a complaint established that its right to relief under state law requires resolution of a substantial question of federal law in dispute between the parties.the court later restated the test under the general jurisdictional statute for claims arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states,to address federalism concerns t he question is,does a claim necessarily raise a stated federal issue,actually disputed and substantial,which a federal forum may entertain without disturbing any congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities.grable sons metal products,darue engineering,d grable.
two decisions of the federal circuit,air measurement,supra,and immunocept,supra,are particularly instructive.there,the federal circuit applied the jurisdictional test set forth by the supreme court in christianson and grable to determine whether the federal courts had exclusive jurisdiction over two legal malpractice lawsuits involving patents.we note that the federal circuit is uniquely qualified to determine jurisdictional issues in cases involving patents,since it has exclusive jurisdiction over an appeal from a final decision of a district court of the united states if the jurisdiction of that court was based,in whole or in part,on section.a.although the ways in which the patent issues arose in air measurement and immunocept which were decided on the same day were different,the federal circuit analysis of the test was consistent in both cases.
in air measurement,the plaintiffs collectively,amt filed a legal malpractice lawsuit in state court against their attorneys.air measurement,supra,at.the attorneys had represented amt in prosecuting patent applications for a safety device and related technology amt had developed,and had filed patent infringement actions on amt behalf.id.at.amt alleged in the legal malpractice action that,after amt replaced the attorneys with new counsel in the infringement litigation,amt discovered various errors the attorneys had made in the patent prosecution and infringement litigation.according to amt,those errors forced them to settle the patent infringement litigation for significantly less than fair market value because,among other things,the attorneys errors allowed the alleged infringers to raise patent defenses such as invalidity and unenforceability that would not otherwise have been available.id.at.the attorneys removed the case to federal court on the ground that amt malpractice lawsuit required the resolution of a substantial question of patent law.ibid.three years later,the attorneys moved to remand the case,arguing that section subject matter jurisdiction was lacking.id.at.the district court denied the motion and certified the jurisdiction issue for interlocutory appeal.ibid.the federal circuit granted the attorneys petition for permission to appeal.ibid.
in immunocept,supra,immunocept retained the defendant attorneys to prosecute on its behalf a patent application for certain medical technology.id.at.after obtaining the patent,immunocept entered into negotiations with a potential financial partner,whose attorneys discovered a flaw in the drafting of claim of the patent,which they believed resulted in the patent providing inadequate protection from competing methods.ibid.immunocept filed in federal court a legal malpractice action under stat
