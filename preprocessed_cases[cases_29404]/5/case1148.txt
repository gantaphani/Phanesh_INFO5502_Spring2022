the issue before us is whether a plaintiff bringing suit under can assign her right to seek attorney fees to her attorney.we answer that she may not,and we affirm the judgment of the district court.
facts and procedural history 
on march,wilma pony,the legal guardian of paulette pony,a minor,filed suit against the county of los angeles the county and various employees of the los angeles juvenile alternative work program jaws in the united states district court for the central district of california.the complaint alleged that pony was a victim of various traditional torts and constitutional violations arising out of medical procedures she was subjected to by jaws employees on april.
on march,pony entered into a retainer agreement with attorneys michael mitchell and david margulies.the agreement contained the following provision 
client agrees to and hereby does irrevocably assign and transfer to attorneys all of client rights and powers,whether contingent or vested or both,a to waive prevailing party status,b to waive,apply for,obtain judgment upon,collect,receive any statutory attorney fee award,and c to make accept a lump sum,including all attorney fees settlement offer.client acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing assignment and transfer may make it more difficult for client to settle the case,because client will not possess the powers or rights to waive prevailing party status or the powers or rights to waive,apply for,obtain judgment upon,collect,receive any attorney fee award.client hereby authorizes and directs the court to make any such attorney fee award and judgment thereon in attorneys names only and not in client name.in the event that a right to apply for statutory attorney fees survives settlement or judgment respecting client claims,attorneys will negotiate and seek agreement from defendants upon the amount of statutory attorney fees to be paid by defendants otherwise attorneys will apply for statutory attorneys fees.
emphasis in original.the agreement also provided that the attorneys would receive the greater of of the gross amount of the award forty percent if settlement was reached within sixty days of trial,or statutory attorney fees.
mitchell began representing pony and continued to do so through discovery and motions.problems arose during the course of settlement negotiations,however.the county offered to settle pony claim for a lump sum,including all attorney fees figure.mitchell wrote a letter to the county attorneys stating that if the county made a lump sum,including all attorney fees offer which was acceptable to pony,it will perforce be in abrogation of my rights under the retainer agreement and i will be legally and ethically powerless to resist it.citing california business and professions code section b,which makes it a misdemeanor for an attorney to willfully delay his client suit with a view to his own gain,mitchell said that such a settlement offer will force me to resign as plaintiff counsel because of the conflict it creates.mitchell also advised the county that if such a settlement were reached,he intended to seek statutory attorney fees pursuant to his rights under his retainer agreement with pony.he also declared his intent to pursue other claims,such as a claim for intentional interference with contractual relations 
nonetheless,settlement negotiations continued,and a week later mitchell signed an attorney substitution making,david margulies,pony sole counsel of record.the substitution was filed two weeks later.the day before it was filed,pony and the county reached a tentative settlement agreement whereby pony received in exchange for release of all of her claims against the county and a waiver of her right to seek attorney fees.
the tentative settlement was disrupted by mitchell,who reiterated his intentions to pursue statutory attorney fees from the county despite the settlement.following mitchell formal request to the court for fees and a june,hearing on the issue of attorney fees,the district court concluded that the case had not yet been settled and scheduled the case for trial.
prior to trial,pony and the county reached a firm settlement,with pony releasing all of her claims against the county in exchange for.the settlement was inclusive of all attorney fees,notwithstanding any statutory or contractual rights which plaintiff present or former counsel may have or have had and notwithstanding any language in the retainer agreement between plaintiff and her present or former counsel.as part of the settlement,however,pony and margulies had to agree to indemnify the county against any fees or costs sought by mitchell.the court dismissed pony suit on account of settlement on july.
in response to the dismissal,mitchell filed two motions a motion for relief from order,alleging that the court dismissal of the suit was by mistake or inadvertence,and a motion for attorney fees.the district court ruled that mitchell lacked standing,and denied both motions.he now appeals.
ii.analysis 
mitchell standing to seek attorney fees 
successful plaintiffs in civil rights suits may seek attorney fees from the losing defendant.under b,i n any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of,the court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney fee as part of the costs 
the supreme court has held that section vests the right to seek attorney fees in the prevailing party,not her attorney,and that attorneys therefore lack standing to pursue them.evans jeff,d see also venegas mitchell,d churchill,cir united states ex rel.virani jerry lewis truck parts,cir willard city of los angeles,cir.once the prevailing party exercises her right to receive fees,the attorney right to collect them vests,and he may then pursue them on his own.virani,at.unless and until the party exercises this power,however,the attorney has no right to collect fees from the party,and the party has no duty to pay them.id.a prevailing party may waive her statutory eligibility for attorney fees as a condition of settlement.evans,at.concluding that does not create a general rule prohibiting settlements conditioned on the waiver of fees.
in this case,pony,the prevailing party,did not exercise her rights to pursue attorney fees.to the contrary,she waived them as a condition of settlement with the county.accordingly,under the court ruling in evans and our ruling in virani,mitchell has no standing to pursue attorney fees merely as a result of his position as pony former attorney.
mitchell argues that he need not rely on his status as pony former attorney.he contends that he has standing under his retainer agreement with pony,whereby she assigned her rights to apply for attorney fees to him.if the assignment is valid,mitchell argues,he stands in her shoes and may assert her rights to statutory attorney fees as if she had asserted them herself.however,pony putative assignment to mitchell is invalid because the right to seek attorney fees under is a substantive cause of action which can not be transferred contractually.
section establishes a prevailing plaintiff right to seek attorney fees,but it provides no direct guidance on whether plaintiffs have the ability to transfer this right.section also provides that courts should resolve ambiguities in the federal civil rights laws by looking to the common law,as modified by the laws of the state in which they sit.a i n all cases where federal laws are not adapted to protecting and vindicating civil rights,or are deficient in the ir provisions to do so,the common law,as modified and changed by the constitution and statutes of the state wherein the court sits shall govern,so far as it is not inconsistent with the constitution and laws of the united states chardon fumero soto,d see also town of newton rumery,d we resolve a question regarding by reference to traditional principles,as we have resolved other questions about the principles governing actions.wilson garcia,d,superseded by statute,judicial improvements act of,title iii,a,stat,as recognized in jones donnelley sons,d.we must therefore turn to california state law for guidance.
the supreme court has construed claims brought under section as tort claims for personal injury.city of monterey del monte dunes at monterey,d t here can be no doubt that claims brought pursuant to sound in tort.heck humphrey,d memphis cmty.sch.dist.stachura,d we have repeatedly noted that creates a species of tort liability quotations omitted footnote omitted wilson,at.the right to apply for fees under section is only granted to a prevailing party,and is therefore fundamentally derivative of the underlying substantive claim itself.thus,california tort law is the appropriate source from which to obtain the rules of decision for the instant case.heck,at.memphis cmty.sch,at.wilson,at.
the right to sue in tort for personal injury is under california law.pac.gas nakano,cal d,it is well settled in this jurisdiction that a purely tort claim is not assignable.curtis kellogg andelson,th,d,stating that causes of action which arise from a wrong done to the person are under california law hartford accident indem.gropman,i t is well established in california that an assignment of a cause of action for personal injuries is void citing lee state farm mut.auto.ins,d,block cal.physicians,d,i t is the established rule in california that an assignment of a cause of action for personal injuries is void.just as plaintiff can not assign her section action,she can not assign an action,such as section,that is derivative of it.erickson concepts,th,d,allowing the assignment of the right to collect attorney fees on actions under a contract when made with the assignment of other contractual rights,which are freely assignable under california law cal.wholesale material supply,norm wilson sons,th,d,same.accordingly,plaintiff right to seek statutory attorney fees is not transferrable in california,and the retainer agreement provisions to the contrary are void as a matter of law.
this application of california tort law is consistent with the purpose of the federal civil rights statutes.see felder casey,d any assessment of the applicability of a state law to federal civil rights litigation,therefore,must be made in light of the purpose and nature of the federal right.preventing civil rights plaintiffs from contractually transferring their rights to attorney fees furthers both the federal policy of protecting civil rights and the federal policy of encouraging settlement.see evans,at.w e believe that a general proscription against negotiated waiver of attorney fees in exchange for a settlement on the merits would itself impede vindication of civil rights,at least in some cases,by reducing the attractiveness of settlement.marek chesny,d there is no evidence that congress,in considering,had any thought that civil rights claims were to be on any different footing from other civil claims insofar as settlement is concerned.
mitchell strongest argument in favor of upholding the transfer under the retainer agreement comes from dicta in venegas mitchell,d.in that case,the court addressed the issue of whether statutory attorney fees operated as an upper bound on the compensation attorneys could receive from civil rights plaintiffs.the court concluded that the statute did not impose a ceiling on compensation,and that parties could contract for contingency fees or hourly rates in excess of the statutory level.id.at.mitchell relies on the court statement that 
i t is the party entitlement to receive the fees in the appropriate case and it is the party right to waive,settle,or negotiate that eligibility 
if plaintiffs may waive their causes of action entirely,there is little reason to believe that they may not assign part of their recovery to an attorney if they believe that the contingency arrangement will increase their likelihood of recovery.a contrary decision would place plaintiffs in the peculiar position of being freer to negotiate with their adversaries than with their own attorneys.
while at first glance,this may seem like a solid foundation for mitchell to rely on,it does not withstand careful scrutiny.in venegas,the court was writing in the context of contingency fees and was referring to a plaintiff ability to assign a portion of her recovery,not her substantive causes of action.generally,a party may freely assign the proceeds of his judgment or the value of his recovery.this is true under federal,california,and common law.see,id.at.we have never held that constrains the freedom of the civil rights plaintiff to become contractually and personally bound to pay an attorney a percentage of the recovery,if any emphasis added cal.bus.code west.this is also consistent with current section jurisprudence,which holds that an attorney is free to collect statutory attorney fees once a client has exercised his rights by demanding them,but not before.evans,at.virani,at.thus,while a plaintiff can transfer the right to collect attorney fees,she may not transfer the right to seek or waive them.
in summary,mitchell argument falls beyond the scope of the supreme court holding in venegas,and represents an extension that is unsupported by the court logic and analysis.accordingly,the assignments to mitchell under the retainer agreement are invalid as a matter of law.without his contractual rights,mitchell lacks standing to bring a claim for attorney fees.see evans,at.
supremacy clause challenge to the county settlement policy 
mitchell also asserts that the county has a custom,policy,or practice of settling civil rights cases only on a lump sum,including all attorney fees basis.he further asserts that this practice contradicts federal policy and congressional intent to provide attorney fees for civil rights victims,as manifested in,and that the county conduct therefore violates the supremacy clause of the united states constitution.see const.art.vi,cl.the county denies having such a policy,and maintains that its actions are consistent with the constitution.the county further argues that mitchell lacks standing to challenge the settlement on this basis mitchell counters by alleging that he has both direct and standing.we do not reach the substantive merits of mitchell claim,as we find that mitchell lacks standing to challenge the county policy under the supremacy clause 
mitchell does not have standing to challenge the legality of the county action merely by virtue of being a voter or a taxpayer.to satisfy this court jurisdictional standing requirement,a plaintiff must allege a distinct and palpable injury to himself,even if it is an injury shared by a large class of other possible litigants.warth seldin,d see also allen wright,d this court has repeatedly held that an asserted right to have the government act in accordance with law is not sufficient,standing alone,to confer jurisdiction on a federal court.in order to have direct standing under article iii,a plaintiff must demonstrate that 
he has suffered an injury in fact that is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.
friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d citing lujan defenders of wildlife,d.we find that mitchell is unable to satisfy the first two of these elements.
as we have discussed above,the right to seek attorney fees under belongs to clients,not to attorneys.evans,at.therefore,the county policy of settling claims only on a lump sum,including all attorney fees basis has not directly deprived mitchell of any right.bernhardt county of los angeles,cir holding that civil rights plaintiff who was unable to retain counsel because of the county policy does have standing to sue.mitchell must therefore argue that he has suffered a monetary injury,in that he would have received greater fees in this case than he actually did if the county had not had such a policy.
such a claim is inherently conjectural or hypothetical.in the absence of its policy,the county might have refused to settle pony civil rights case at all.this seems particularly likely given that the ultimate settlement amount,is less than the attorney fees mitchell seeks over moreover,mitchell was not pony
