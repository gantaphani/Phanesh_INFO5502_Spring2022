in the latest saga of this apparently battle between the parties over liability and damages for violating title vii of the civil rights act,the district court denied a motion of appellants trout,et,the trout class seeking,interest on backpay and attorneys fees awarded to them for being subject to sex discrimination in employment during the.the civil rights act of,which included a provision for the award of prejudgment interest,was enacted on november of that year.although this court previously held that the interest provision did not apply to conduct that preceded enactment of the civil rights act,trout secretary of the navy,trout iv,the trout class claims that a subsequent supreme court case,republic of austria altmann,d,is an intervening change in law that entitles them to interest on backpay and attorneys fees that accrued before the change in law.the district court also granted appellee navy motion for a refund of interim attorneys fees and costs paid to the trout class for litigating the interest issue.because altmann is inapposite and because the interest issue is distinct from the issue of sex discrimination,we affirm the district court rulings on the motions.
background 
in yvonne trout and other female employees of the department of the navy filed an employment discrimination lawsuit against the navy,alleging sex discrimination in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of the act,et.after twenty years of litigation the parties entered into a stipulation settling the case on its merits,which was approved by the district court on november,hereinafter consent decree.pursuant to the consent decree and other stipulations and orders,the navy paid the trout class backpay for the period to,as well as attorneys fees up until for litigating the sex discrimination matter.the doctrine of sovereign immunity shields the government from liability for such payments,except when waived by statute.see potter,d.subsections g and k of the act waive the government immunity from liability for backpay and attorneys fees,respectively,for violations of that act.because the act did not allow for the payment of interest on damages,and because any waiver of sovereign immunity must be strictly construed in favor of the government,see,library of congress shaw,d,and further because of the rule,the historical rule that interest is a separate element of damages and may be recovered only against a party that has agreed to be liable therefor,brown sec y of the army,under the act the trout class was not entitled to receive interest on the backpay and attorneys fee awards.on november,however,congress amended title vii.civil rights act of the act,stat.under section of that act the government is liable for the same interest to compensate for delay in payment as is available in cases involving nonpublic parties.d.the navy consequently agreed to pay interest on its liability for backpay and attorneys fees incurred after november.the navy argued,however,that section,d,was not retroactive and therefore it was not liable for interest on backpay and attorneys fee awards for periods prior to november.the trout class argued otherwise and litigated the issue,culminating in this court resolution of the matter in trout iv.in the meantime,pursuant to stipulations and orders in and,the navy paid the trout class in attorneys fees and expert fees for litigating the,interest issue.
in trout iv we addressed the question of whether section,d,has retroactive effect.in determining that it did not,we relied on our decision in brown,which also concerned the question of whether section,d,applies retroactively.see trout iv,at.brown in turn relied on the supreme court decision in landgraf usi film,d,in which the court declined to give retroactive effect to provisions of the act that would attach new monetary liability to conduct occurring before the statute enactment.see brown,at.guided by brown and landgraf,we held that section,d,does not apply to conduct that occurred before november,and therefore the navy was not liable for interest on backpay and attorneys fees awarded for conduct before that time.trout iv,at.we remanded the case to the district court for a final determination of costs and fees owed to the trout class.id.at.
on remand,the navy filed a motion seeking a refund from the trout class for,plus interest,that was paid by the navy to the trout class for attorneys fees for litigating the prejudgment interest issue.the trout class also filed a motion seeking,despite this court decision in trout iv,an entry of judgment for,interest on backpay and attorneys fees.the trout class claimed in the motion that the supreme court decision in altmann is an intervening and controlling decision that entitles them to,interest.the district court granted the navy motion and ordered the trout class to refund the navy the plus interest awarded to the trout class for litigating the interest issue the court denied the trout class motion to award it,interest in light of altmann.trout winter,d.
discussion 
the trout class now appeals the district court rulings on the motions,arguing,inter alia,that under altmann it is entitled to,interest on backpay and attorneys fees,and that as the prevailing party in the sex discrimination litigation it is entitled to attorneys fees incurred in litigating the interest issue.
despite this court holding in trout iv that section of the act does not apply to conduct that preceded its enactment,the trout class argues that altmann constitutes an intervening change in law that requires reversal of trout iv.altmann concerned a suit filed sometime after against the state of austria for conduct that occurred for the most part in.at.the foreign sovereign immunities act of fsia,et,grants foreign states immunity from suits in the united states subject to certain exemptions.the question for the court was whether the fsia,and therefore the exemptions thereunder,applied to claims based on conduct that occurred before the fsia enactment.altmann,at.as discussed in more detail below,the court held that the fsia does apply to conduct.id.at.attempting to analogize its case to altmann,the trout class argues that altmann now controls statutes that concern waivers of sovereign immunity,and consequently under altmann,section of the act,d,applies to conduct that preceded its enactment.the trout class therefore claims that it is entitled to interest on backpay and attorneys fees incurred prior to november.we disagree.
in altmann the plaintiff sued austria for expropriating,before and after world war ii,paintings owned by her family.austria asserted the defense of sovereign immunity.as noted above,the question addressed by the court was whether the fsia applied to conduct that occurred prior to the fsia enactment in.altmann,at.in answering this question the court first looked to the default rule of no retroactive effect of congressional enactments announced in landgraf,at.altmann,at.the court noted that under landgraf there is a presumption against retroactivity if congress has not expressly stated that the statute is to have retroactive effect and the statute affects rights,liabilities,or duties with respect to past conduct.id.at.citing landgraf,at.on the other hand,the court noted that the application of a statute to future as well as pending cases would be sanctioned if the statute merely confers or ousts jurisdiction.id.at.the court noted that although these principles seemed comprehensive,they did not provide a clear answer in the case before it because the fsia could not be categorized as exclusively affecting either substantive rights or procedural matters.id.at.the court then noted that the purpose of the antiretroactivity presumption is to avoid unnecessary post hoc changes to legal rules on which parties relied in shaping their primary conduct,and that this had never been the purpose of foreign sovereign immunity.id.at.rather,stated the court,foreign sovereign immunity aims to protect foreign states from the inconvenience of suit as a gesture of comity.id.quoting dole food patrickson,d.the court consequently looked to the fsia and the circumstances surrounding its enactment fo
