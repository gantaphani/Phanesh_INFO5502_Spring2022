in,bart mcqueary challenged the validity of a kentucky law placing limits on protests at military funerals,claiming that the law violated his rights under the first and fourteenth amendments.the district court granted mcqueary motion to enjoin enforcement of the law on a preliminary basis,soon after which kentucky repealed the relevant provisions of the statute.the commonwealth voluntary repeal of the law,the parties now agree,mooted mcqueary action.yet the parties take sides over whether,in the aftermath of the commonwealth repeal of the law,mcqueary is a prevailing party eligible for attorney fees under.
in march,the kentucky legislature added three misdemeanors to its criminal code,all designed to discourage protests by the westboro baptist church,whose members have become known for staging protests at military practice that mcqueary attorney acknowledges is controversial and offensive to many,at.see.laws ch.snyder phelps,cir,cert.granted.in full,the three new misdemeanors read as follows 
a person is guilty of disorderly conduct in the first degree when he or she 
a in a public place and with intent to cause public inconvenience,annoyance,or alarm,or wantonly creating a risk thereof 
engages in fighting or in violent,tumultuous,or threatening behavior 
makes unreasonable noise or 
creates a hazardous or physically offensive condition by any act that serves no legitimate purpose and 
b acts in a way described in paragraph a of this subsection within three hundred feet of a 
cemetery during a funeral or burial 
funeral home during the viewing of a deceased person 
funeral procession 
funeral or memorial service and 
c knows that he or she is within three hundred feet of an occasion described in paragraph b of this subsection.
laws ch,codified as amended at.
a person is guilty of disrupting meetings and processions in the first degree when,with intent to prevent or disrupt a funeral or burial,funeral home viewing of a deceased person,funeral procession,or funeral or memorial service for a deceased person,he or she does any act tending to obstruct or interfere with it physically or makes any utterance,gesture,or display designed to outrage the sensibilities of the group attending the occasion.
laws ch,codified at.
a person is guilty of interference with a funeral when he or she at any time on any day 
a blocks,impedes,inhibits,or in any other manner obstructs or interferes with access into or from any building or parking lot of a building in which a funeral,wake,memorial service,or burial is being conducted,or any burial plot or the parking lot of the cemetery in which a funeral,wake,memorial service,or burial is being conducted 
b congregates,pickets,patrols,demonstrates,or enters on that portion of a public or private property that is within three hundred feet of an event specified in paragraph a of this subsection or 
c without authorization from the family of the deceased or person conducting the service,during a funeral,wake,memorial service,or burial 
sings,chants,whistles,shouts,yells,or uses a bullhorn,auto horn,sound amplification equipment,or other sounds or images observable to or within earshot of participants in the funeral,wake,memorial service,or burial or 
distributes literature or any other item.
roughly one month after the passage of these laws,bart mcqueary,a kentucky resident who had joined these protests in the past and wanted to do so again,filed a lawsuit against kentucky attorney general in federal court.see.mcqueary claimed that b and c of the march act,located in the third of the new laws,violated his first and fourteenth amendment rights in several ways.he wanted to congregate,picket and demonstrate in a way on public within feet of funerals,yet the act appeared to prevent him from doing so.laws ch.b.he wanted to make sounds and display images observable to or within earshot of funerals without permission from the family of the deceased and without disrupting the funeral,yet the act appeared to prevent him from doing so.laws ch.c.and he wished to distribute literature during his funeral protests,yet the act appeared to prohibit him from doing so.laws ch.c.mcqueary asked the district court to declare b and c unconstitutional on their face and to enjoin their enforcement.
in september,the district court preliminarily enjoined enforcement of b and c,finding it likely that the provisions were unconstitutionally overbroad.see mcqueary stumbo mcqueary i,d.six months later,in march,the kentucky legislature repealed these two subsections of the act.see.laws ch.
after kentucky repealed the challenged provisions,the district court dismissed the lawsuit as moot.see mcqueary conway mcqueary ii,d.in the same order,the court denied mcqueary request for attorney fees.the court reasoned that mcqueary did not directly benefit from the preliminary injunction because the central premise of its not necessarily establish that mcqueary could picket the way he wanted to.see id.at.and because mcqueary did not challenge other provisions of the act prohibiting violent,tumultuous,or threatening behavior near funerals.ann,the court thought it likely that,even after the court preliminary injunction and the legislature repeal of the challenged statutes,mcqueary would not be able to engage in the funeral protests,mcqueary ii,d at.mcqueary appeals the court rejection of his request for fees.
in trying to resolve the thorny questions raised by mcqueary or when the winner of a preliminary injunction may be treated as a prevailing party entitled to attorney few basics are in order.there is no common law right to attorney fees.under the american rule,the general practice is not to award fees to prevailing parties absent explicit statutory authority.buckhannon bd.care home.dep t of health and human.under,as under several other statutes,congress has explicitly empowered the courts to grant fees to parties who win actions,among other civil rights actions 
in any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of,the court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party,other than the united states,a reasonable attorney fee as part of the costs

p revailing party is a legal term of art,buckhannon,at,one that two recent decisions of the supreme court help to define.in buckhannon,the plaintiff sought an injunction barring enforcement of a west virginia statute and obtained a preliminary injunction,though one to which west virginia consented.see id.at.two months after the district court rejected the state sovereign immunity defense and one month after it denied the state motion for summary judgment,the state repealed the statute,after which the district court dismissed the case as moot and denied the plaintiff request for attorney fees.see id.the supreme court affirmed the denial of fees,rejecting the catalyst theory for awarding fees,under which a plaintiff prevailed if he achieve d the desired result because the lawsuit brought about a voluntary change in the defendant conduct,such as a legislative repeal of a challenged statutory provision.id.at.that theory,the court reasoned,overlooks the legal reality that prevailing party covers only parties in whose favor a judgment is rendered.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.a defendant voluntary change,even one precipitated by litigation,does not amount to a change in the legal relationship between the plaintiff and defendant,as required to establish status.id.at.
in sole wyner,the court established that the change in the legal relationship between a plaintiff and defendant must be enduring and irrevocable.id.that did not happen in sole because the trial court dissolved the preliminary injunction it entered in favor of the claimant.a preliminary injunction,the court held,does not establish status if it is reversed,dissolved,or otherwise undone by the final decision in the same case,because requires lasting relief,not the temporary,fleeting success such an injunction represents.id.at see also id.at.sole,however,reserved the question presented here whether,in the absence of a final decision on the merits,success in gaining a preliminary injunction may sometimes warrant an award of counsel fees.id.at.see also hewitt helms,rejecting fee request for interlocutory victory and explaining that r espect for ordinary language requires that a plaintiff receive at least some relief on the merits of his claim before he can be said to prevail.
after buckhannon but before sole,our court considered whether the winner of a preliminary injunction was a prevailing party.in dubuc green oak township,cir,a landowner filed a lawsuit against a township,charging the township with refusing to permit him to divide his lot in retaliation for his exercise of rights.early in the lawsuit,the claimant obtained a preliminary injunction ordering the township to issue him a temporary certificate of occupancy as long as he complied with seven conditions.id.at.the district court denied the request for interim fees,and we affirmed.see id.at.in the context of a preliminary injunction,we reasoned,there is only prevailing party status if the injunction represents an unambiguous indication of probable success on the merits,and not merely a maintenance of the status quo ordered because the balance of equities greatly favors the plaintiff.id.at quoting webster sowders,cir.because the injunction was not a clear victory for the claimant and was issued only in connection with several conditions imposed on the claimant,dubuc upheld the district court denial of fees.id.at.the claimant objective in the lawsuit,we concluded,was not to obtain a temporary certificate of occupancy,which is all that the preliminary injunction provided,but to obtain damages for alleged violations of his constitutional rights,which the court ultimately denied.id.because dubuc predates sole,the court never addressed a more basic reason for denying that particular fee request a claimant may not obtain interim attorney fees for a preliminary injunction that is later dissolved.see sole,u.at.
there are two more threads to the inquiry.one,to be a prevailing party,the plaintiff must obtain a material change in the legal relationship between himself and the defendant.sole,at,internal quotation marks and modifications omitted.a material change directly benefit s a plaintiff by modifying the defendant behavior toward him.farrar hobby,see also.state teachers ass garland indep.sch.absent a direct benefit,the plaintiff achieves only a symbolic victory,which b does not compensate.see farrar,at.state teachers ass n,at.
two,the idea behind is to award fees to deserving parties,not to generate satellite disputes over fees,city of burlington dague,see buckhannon,at,which prompt a second major litigation,hensley eckerhart.in assessing fee requests,the court thus tends to eschew and speculative inquiries into why government bodies altered their conduct because they tend to distract from,not further,goal of encouraging adequate representation for civil rights plaintiffs.state teachers ass n,at,and waste scarce judicial resources on questions which are almost impossible to answer,see dague,at.
that is all well and good.but none of this readily resolves today case mcqueary does not invoke the catalyst theory he did not ultimately lose on the merits the preliminary injunction,as we will explain shortly,materially changed the relationship between the parties and the preliminary injunction turned at least in part on the district court assessment of the merits.keeping in mind the court admonishment that fee inquiries should not generate satellite litigation,are there any other considerations that might clarify the inquiry several possibilities come to mind 
perhaps,in view of the nature of a preliminary injunction,success on this type of interim relief never suffices.the statute after all refers to the prevailing party,not a prevailing party,b,suggesting that the only change in the legal relationship between the parties that matters should be a lasting one,namely the change that culminates in a final judgment.otherwise,individuals and prevailing parties at times who may obtain seek fees for all manner of interim victories whenever for one reason or another the case does not proceed to final judgment.hewitt,at surviving a motion to dismiss is not the stuff of which legal victories are made.adding force to the idea that a preliminary victor is never a prevailing party is this reality our review of a preliminary injunction ruling,even one that turns on the merits and even one that is resolved through a published opinion,is not binding on the panel that reviews the ultimate final injunction decision.see of camenisch,certified restoration dry cleaning network,tenke,cir smith wholesale,reynolds tobacco,cir.
but this approach,clear as it might be,fails to account for fact patterns in which the claimant receives everything it asked for in the lawsuit,and all that moots the case is success and the passage of time.when protesters seek an injunction to exercise their first amendment rights at a specific time and to demonstrate at a saturday preliminary injunction will give them all the relief they need and the end of the parade will moot the case.in what way are such claimants not prevailing parties we think they are.see young.city of chicago,cir awarding fees to protestors who obtained a preliminary injunction to protest at the democratic national convention,which was the only relief sought.the same is true of a government employee who seeks to exclude an unconstitutionally obtained report from an administrative hearing and obtains a preliminary injunction that irrevocably excludes the report.see watson county of riverside,cir.so also for a plaintiff who seeks to delay enforcement of a statute until a certain event a scheduled public the preliminary injunction brings about that result.thomas sci.
not all preliminary injunctions,as these examples show,have merely a catalytic effect.the defendants in these cases did not voluntarily change their conduct.an immediately enforceable preliminary injunction compelled them to.and in each instance,the plaintiffs obtained all of the relief they requested once the preliminary injunction served its purpose.see cheyenne tribe jackson,cir watson,at.
the plaintiffs in all of these cases,it is true,might have avoided the preliminary label attached to their victories by asking the courts to convert their motions for a preliminary injunction into motions for a final injunction.see.a.yet rule is not the rosetta stone to inquiries.a district court may,but it does not have to,grant rule requests,and nothing about the nature of the inquiry suggests that it should turn on whether a district court happens to embrace this administrative streamlining device.in the final analysis,the preliminary nature of the relief does not by itself provide a ground for never granting fees.
perhaps winners are never eligible for fees for a different reason.in sole,the court held that a preliminary injunction does not establish status if it is reversed,dissolved,or otherwise undone by the final decision in the same case.at.when a case becomes moot,courts often vacate their earlier rulings on the theory that a ruling should not stand when the party opposing it is deprived of a chance to obtain a final ruling on the issue or to seek appellate review of to events outside of the party control,such as the defendant voluntary cessation of conduct.see alvarez smith,united states munsingwear,philips kbc bank,cir collecting cases holding that preliminary injunctions automatically dissolve upon final judgment.
the munsingwear doctrine suggests a potentially straightforward approach to the fees question sole says that dissolved or otherwise undone preliminary injunctions do not warrant fees mootness generally requires a court to vacate its earlier rulings,including any preliminary injunction granted in the case fees for preliminary injunctions therefore are not permitted under sole.but this approach again fails to account for the instances in which a party has prevailed by every measure of victory,as illustrated above.the munsingwear ru
