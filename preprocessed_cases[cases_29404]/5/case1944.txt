the california department of fish and game dfg through the california wildlife conservation board wcb together,the state agencies propose to convert an area of agricultural land in colusa county into wildlife habitat.the state agencies actions relating to this project were challenged in court as violating the california environmental quality act ceqa pub.resources code,et,the williamson act,et seq and colusa county general plan and zoning ordinances.in this appeal we consider the state agencies appeal from a judgment for attorney fees in favor of colusa county county pursuant to code of civil procedure section on the county williamson act claims.we shall affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
leroy traynham traynham is the owner of acres of farmland the property located in colusa county.the property is located in the land use designation of the county general plan and is zoned exclusive agriculture.in traynham and the county entered into a williamson act contract limiting use of the property to agriculture and compatible uses.et a short time later,traynham entered into a farmland security zone contract super williamson act contract with the county for the property.et the super williamson act contract specifically limited use of the property to production of food and fiber for commercial purposes and uses compatible thereto.the contract listed all such compatible uses in an attached exhibit,which list did not include use of the property as a wildlife refuge or managed wetlands.
in,the dfg through the wcb negotiated with traynham for the purchase of a conservation easement easement on traynham property to create a managed wildlife habitat on the property as the first project under the north central valley,conservation reserve enhancement program.the easement agreement prohibited in perpetuity the cultivation on the property of agricultural crops for commercial gain as a generally inconsistent use of the property.
on january,the wcb sent a letter to the county board of supervisors informing the county it was involved in a conservation easement and restoration program that is focused on the protection and restoration of habitat for fish and wildlife.as part of this program,the wcb was considering acquisition of an easement over traynham property and that it proposed to restore the property to approximately acres of seasonal wetlands,acres of brood ponds and acres of uplands.labeled the traynham ranch project,it was scheduled to be considered at the february,meeting of the wcb.
on january,the wcb sent a memo to the california department of conservation describing the traynham ranch project.as relevant here,the memo took the position section of the williamson act,which requires specific findings before a public agency can locate a public improvement on land covered by a williamson act contract did not apply to this project because the project came within one of the exceptions to section provided in section.the memo also took the position the project was exempt from environmental review under ceqa.the department of conservation forwarded the memo to the california department of food and agriculture.
at its public meeting held on february,the wcb approved the easement agreement and accompanying site specific waterfowl habitat management plan management plan,which identified the measures needed to convert the property from agriculture to habitat.a notice of exemption was filed asserting the traynham ranch project was exempt from ceqa under class of the ceqa guidelines,tit.
the department of food and agriculture responded to the department of conservation regarding the wcb traynham ranch project on february.the department of food and agriculture took the position the project was not exempt either from the findings requirement of section,as the statutory exception relied upon by the wcb was inapplicable,or from ceqa.
at the end of march,the wcb met with the county to discuss the traynham ranch project.the wcb expressed its opinion that the traynham ranch project would be a compatible use under the super williamson act contract on the property.the county disagreed and,in turn,expressed its ceqa and williamson act compatible use concerns.
on march,the california farm bureau federation and the colusa county farm bureau together the farm bureau filed a petition for writ of mandamus and injunctive relief against the wcb and the dfg alleging violations of ceqa and the williamson act the petition named as real parties in interest the county,traynham,and the california waterfowl association the organization responsible for much of the actual work necessary to convert the property into habitat.with respect to the williamson act,the farm bureau petition alleged the state agencies failed to give notice to the county in compliance with section,the state agencies did not and could not make the findings required under section,and the traynham ranch property was not eligible for conversion to wildlife habitat while encumbered with the super williamson act contract.the petition alleged the easement agreement was not a compatible use with the super williamson act contract on the property.
within a few days of the meeting with the county and the farm bureau filing of the lawsuit,the dfg and the wcb exchanged regarding whether the easement could be amended to allow some limited grazing of livestock on the property as a type of agricultural use.apparently referencing some written studies and articles about grazing benefits on wetlands,the wcb suggested allowing grazing on wetland easements,including on traynham property,might be good business for us,regardless of the lawsuit.however,the record does not contain any evidence the dfg and the wcb pursued the matter further at this point.
on july,the county filed a for writ of mandate and a against the dfg,the wcb and traynham.the first cause of action alleged traynham acted inconsistently with and in breach of the super williamson act contract by granting the easement to the state.the county sought an order entitling the county to reassess the property at full cash value and an order requiring specific performance of the contract or an injunction preventing traynham from using his property as an easement.the second cause of action alleged the state agencies failed to follow the notice procedures of the williamson act and failed to make the findings required by section prior to approving the acquisition of the easement on traynham property for a public use.the county sought a writ of mandate compelling the dfg and the wcb to rescind their approval of the acquisition of traynham property and to comply with the procedural requirements of the williamson act.in its third cause of action,the county alleged traynham was required and failed to seek a general plan amendment and rezone for his proposed use of the property under the easement.the county sought injunctive relief.in its fourth cause of action,the county alleged the state agencies acted arbitrarily and capriciously by approving the acquisition of traynham property for uses inconsistent with the county general plan and zoning ordinances.the county sought rescission of the state agencies approval and a prohibition of incompatible uses of the property.
the farm bureau and the county together filed a motion for preliminary injunction seeking a stay of the state agencies underlying administrative decision and an injunction enjoining the state agencies,traynham and the california waterfowl association from any site preparation and earth movement,development of habitat water infrastructure,and establishment of habitat vegetation on traynham property.in their accompanying points and authorities,the farm bureau and the county argued,as to the dfg and the wcb,that the state agencies violated ceqa by exempting the project from any environmental review,violated the williamson act by failing to provide appropriate notice to the county and by failing to make the findings required by section,and that the state agencies approval of the project was inconsistent with the county general plan and zoning ordinance.the state agencies opposed the motion,but did not address or contest the claims of their procedural violations of the williamson act 
on november,the trial court stayed the underlying administrative decision and issued an injunction as requested.the trial court expressly found the farm bureau and the county had demonstrated that they have a reasonable probability of success on the merits of their claims,that they will suffer irreparable harm if preliminary injunctive relief was not granted,that the balance of equities favored issuance of the preliminary injunction and the stay would not be against the public interest.
on december,traynham wrote to the dfg regarding the numerous problems the county lawsuit was causing him.he suggested many of these problems,including the county allegations of his violation of the williamson act,could be solved by an amendment to the easement and adjustment to the management plan to allow livestock grazing on the property.he proposed specific language for an amendment to the easement.traynham subsequently presented his proposed amendment,with the apparent agreement of the dfg,to the county.the county rejected traynham proposed language,but expressed its willingness to continue to discuss the issue.
at the end of january,the county proposed bifurcation of its first breach of contract and third violation of the county general plan and zoning ordinance causes of action against traynham.on february,the trial court ordered bifurcation and a limited stay of the entire and of the county to allow settlement discussions.
the state agencies became directly involved in negotiating with the county regarding the amendment of the easement in march and april.in early may,the state agencies accepted the county proposed amendment language and agreed to execute the amendment with traynham.the amendment to the easement was executed on may.
on november,the county dismissed without prejudice the first and second causes of action related to the williamson act in its and.
on december,the county filed a motion for attorneys fees pursuant to code of civil procedure section section.the county claimed it had successfully obtained the relief it sought with respect to the williamson act and the first and second causes of action,that its lawsuit enforced important public rights benefiting the residents of the county and the state by forcing the state agencies to honor the williamson act mandates,and that the necessity and financial burden of enforcement made an award of fees appropriate.the trial court dismissed the county motion without prejudice pending the conclusion of the case.
the county and the state agencies settled the remaining claims of the county and.the county agreed to dismiss its third and fourth causes of action related to general plan and zoning violations against traynham and the state agencies.each party agreed to bear its own fees and costs on the third and fourth causes of action.the county resubmitted its motion for attorney fees with respect to its first and second causes of action.over the opposition of the state agencies,the trial court granted the county motion and judgment was entered awarding the county in fees against the state agencies.the state agencies appeal.
discussion 
section is a codification of the private attorney general doctrine adopted by the california supreme court in serrano priest cal d,serrano iii.press lucky stores cal d,press woodland hills residents,city council cal d,woodland hills ii.t he fundamental objective of the private attorney general doctrine of attorney fees is to encourage suits effectuating a strong public policy by awarding substantial attorney fees to those who successfully bring such suits and thereby bring about benefits to a broad class of citizens.citation.the doctrine rests upon the recognition that privately initiated lawsuits are often essential to the effectuation of the fundamental public policies embodied in constitutional or statutory provisions,and that,without some mechanism authorizing the award of attorney fees,private actions to enforce such important public policies will as a practical matter frequently be infeasible.woodland hills ii,supra,at.since a amendment,section has also allowed fees for enforcement of important rights affecting the public interest by one public entity against another public entity.stats.
section provides in relevant part upon motion,a court may award attorneys fees to a successful party against one or more opposing parties in any action which has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest if a a significant benefit,whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary,has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons,b the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement,or of enforcement by one public entity against another public entity,are such as to make the award appropriate,and c such fees should not in the interest of justice be paid out of the recovery,if any.
the decision whether to award attorney fees under section rests initially with the trial court.baggett gates cal d,baggett.using its traditional equitable discretion,the trial court must realistically assess the litigation and determine,from a practical perspective citation whether or not the statutory criteria have been met.see families unafraid to uphold rural el dorado county bd.of supervisors th,d families unafraid.as section states the criteria in the conjunctive,each of the statutory criteria must be met to justify a fee award.punsly ho th,d see arnold california exposition and state fair th,d court may deny a section fee request if one of the criteria is not met.
on appeal,we review the trial court decision for abuse of discretion.baggett,supra,cal d at.the trial court determination may not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing that there is no reasonable basis in the record for the award.feminist women health center blythe th,d.particularly in a case such as this,fully briefed and argued before the same trial court which heard the merits,this is not an insignificant point.williams san francisco bd.of permit appeals th,d.
on appeal,we must pay particular attention to the trial court stated reasons in denying or awarding fees and see whether it applied the proper standards of law in reaching its decision.families unafraid,supra,th at,d.the pertinent question is whether the grounds given by the court for its grant of an award are consistent with the substantive law of section and,if so,whether their application to the facts of this case is within the range of discretion conferred upon the trial courts under section,read in light of the purposes and policy of the statute.city of sacramento drew d.
the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding the county its attorney feesa.the county was the successful party on its second cause of action against the state agencies 
a threshold requirement for a fee award under section is the party seeking fees must be a successful party against one or more opposing parties in any action.see schmier supreme court th,d schmier.the terms prevailing party and successful party,as used in section,are synonymous.graham daimlerchrysler cal th,d,graham.
in assessing whether a party is a successful party,a broad,pragmatic view is applied.graham,supra,cal th at,d.it is not necessary that the party seeking fees have obtained a final favorable judgment.ibid.the critical fact is the impact of the action,not the manner of its resolution.if the impact has been the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest and a consequent conferral of a significant benefit on the general public or a large class of persons a section award is not barred because the case was won on a preliminary issue citation or because it was settled before trial.citation.folsom butte county of governments cal d,fns.omitted.plaintiffs may be awarded fees under section if they achieved the relief they sought through a preliminary injunction,even though their action may have become moot.press,supra,cal d,noted with approval in graham,supra,at,d,and maria riles cal d.the trial court must,in its discretion,realistically assess the litigation and determine,from a practical perspective,whether or not the action served to vindicate an important right so as to justify an attorney fee award.woodland hills ii,supra,cal d at.
the trial court in this case ruled the county was the successful party in this action because a lthough the county did not compel the state agencies to comply with government code,the state agencies and traynham modified the conservation easement to permit agricultural uses.the county legal actions are responsible for transforming the agricultural prohibition into the current agreement between traynham and the state agencies allowing grazing on the property,in perpetuity.the trial court did not abuse its discretion in so ruling.
the county second cause of action against the state agencies claimed procedural violations of the williamson act,both failure to make findings required under section and lack of appropriate notice under section.the county asserted,among other claims,the merits of such cause of action in its motion for preliminary injunction.although the wcb had previously taken the position in its memo to the department of conservation that it did not need to make findings under section because of an exception in section,the state agencies did not assert such position in their opposition to the county motion for preliminary injunction.the state agencies did not address the county claim of procedural violations of the williamson act at all,apparently conceding the county procedural allegations had merit.in ruling on the motion for preliminary injunction,the trial court found the county and farm bureau had demonstrated a reasonable probability of success on the merits of their claims.as such ruling did not separate out the claims on which the court was making this finding,it necessarily included all of the county claims,including the county procedural claims in its second cause of action against the state agencies.thus,the county obtained a judicial ruling in its favor against the state agencies on its second cause of action the relief sought by the county second cause of action was a writ of mandate compelling the state agencies to rescind their approval of the acquisition of traynham property and to comply with the procedural requirements of the williamson act.
in addition to the ruling against the state agencies on the second cause of action,the preliminary injunction granted by the trial court also found a reasonable probability of success in the county substantive claims of incompatibility of the easement with traynham super williamson act contract the county first cause of action for breach of contract against traynham.after the granting of the preliminary injunction,traynham became very interested in finding a way to settle the county williamson act claims.within a couple of weeks of the order granting the preliminary injunction and stay,traynham contacted the dfg regarding an amendment to the easement and adjustment to the management plan to allow livestock grazing on the property.traynham sought the county agreement to his proposed language for such an amendment.when the county did not agree,the state agencies stepped in and actively and directly negotiated an amendment that was satisfactory to the county,resulting in an amendment to the easement allowing livestock grazing to continue on the property.
the state agencies point out they had considered such an amendment as early as april and suggest this shows the county was not a motivating factor in their decision to amend the easement.the record,however,supports an inference the state agencies early consideration of a grazing amendment was in response to the filing of the farm bureau petition,although they thought an amendment might also be good business regardless of the lawsuit.critically,despite this early consideration of an amendment,the record reflects the state agencies did not further pursue the idea until after they were sued by the county and the county obtained the preliminary injunction and stay.contrary to the state agencies characterization of their injunction actions as simply responding to traynham requests and as merely assisting traynham in resolving the county breach of contract claim against him,the trial court could reasonably have found that the state agencies were acting under compulsion of the preliminary injunction.and to protect their project and acquisition of traynham property,which risked being rescinded as a result of the county second cause of action,the state agencies took action.the timing and nature of the state agencies actions support such an inference.thus,although the state agencies were never ultimately compelled to renotice their action to the county or to make findings under section because of the county dismissal of its second cause of action,the county lawsuit against the state agencies brought the state agencies to the table regarding the county williamson act concerns.the practical result was an agreement regarding the easement,which agreement excused the findings requirement of section,subd.a and apparently satisfied the county notice concerns.
at bottom,the inquiry regarding whether a party is successful is an intensely factual,pragmatic one that frequently requires courts to go outside the merits of the precise underlying dispute and focus on the condition that the fee claimant sought to change.citation.using that condition as a benchmark,the court asks if the outcome of the litigation is one to which the fee claimant efforts contributed in a significant way,and which does involve an actual conferral of benefit or relief from burden when measured against the benchmark condition.citation.schmier,supra,th at,d.
the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding the county was a successful party against the state agencies on its second cause of action.
b.the county action enforced an important right affecting the public interest 
the trial court in this case ruled as follows the county lawsuit enforced important public rights.the williamson act,et recognizes the importance of agriculture to the economy of the state of california and seeks to maintain agricultural use on the agricultural land.the state agencies failed to comply with the requirements of government code section which requires public agencies to make certain findings prior to public improvements in an agricultural preserve.prior to the filing of the lawsuit,the conservation easement prohibited agricultural use of the land.the county success in the injunction in this case and the amendment to the conservation easement served to enforce the spirit of the statewide goals of the williamson act,ensuring sustainable agricultural resources within the state.we reject the state agencies contention that this ruling was an abuse of discretion.
the principles applicable to a determination of whether an action enforced an important right affecting the public interest have been explained by the california supreme court in woodland hills ii,supra,cal d.we repeat a portion of those comments.
although section provides no concrete standard or test against which a court may determine whether the right vindicated in a particular case is sufficiently important to justify a private attorney general fee award,the statutory language and the pertinent federal authorities provide at least some guidance in this area.first,the broad statutory language and the federal precedents indicate that a right need not be constitutional in nature to justify the application of the private attorney general doctrine the federal cases have applied the doctrine to the vindication of both constitutional and statutory rights.second,the legislature obviously intended that there be some selectivity,on a qualitative basis,in the award of attorney fees under the statute,for section specifically alludes to litigation which vindicates important rights and does not encompass the enforcement of any or all statutory rights.thus,again like the federal cases,the statute directs the judiciary to exercise judgment in attempting to ascertain the strength or societal importance of the right involved.of course,important rights are not necessarily confined to any one subject or field.as the variety of federal cases attests,the private attorney doctrine may find proper application in litigation involving,for example,racial discrimination,the rights of mental patients,legislative reapportionment and,most significantly for the instant case,environmental protection.in litigation concerning the application of statutorily based rights in these various fields,past decisions suggest that in determining the importance of the particular vindicated right,courts should generally realistically assess the significance of that right in terms of its relationship to the achievement of fundamental legislative goals.woodland hills ii,supra,cal d at,fns.omitted.
in this case the legislature itself has declared the williamson act is necessary for the promotion of the general welfare and the protection of the public interest in agricultural land,subd.f.the legislature express findings include t hat the preservation of a maximum amount of the limited supply of agricultural land is necessary to the conservation of the state economic resources,and is necessary not only to the maintenance of the agricultural economy of the state,but also for the assurance of adequate,healthful and nutritious food for future residents of this state and nation,subd.a,italics added and t hat in a rapidly urbanizing society agricultural lands have a definite public value as open space,and the preservation in agricultural production of such lands,the use of which may be limited under the provisions of this chapter,constitutes an important physical,social,esthetic and economic asset to existing or pending urban or metropolitan developments,subd.d,italics added.
the state agencies argue the williamson act also protects habitat and wetlands as open space areas and that such open space areas are compatible uses within the meaning of the act.according to the state agencies,since the original easement was intended to establish habitat and wetlands consistent with the williamson act,the county action did not vindicate an important right under the act.we disagree.
the focus of the williamson act is on agricultural land,including agricultural land as open space.see,subd.d.a city or county may choose to also include within an agricultural preserve other open spaces as defined in the williamson act,subd.o,but the act does not contemplate another public agency converting agricultural land in a city or county agricultural preserve into an open space use,even wildlife habitat or managed wetlands,without compliance with the requirements of the williamson act.moreover,even if a city or county itself places an open space use of land within its agricultural preserve,the open space use still must be consistent with the compatibility principles provided in section,generally requiring the use will not significantly compromise the productive agricultural capability of the land,subd.a and that the use will not significantly displace or impair current or reasonably foreseeable agricultural operations on the land,subd.a.
the state agencies take the position section and section do not apply to wildlife habitat and wetlands because the legislature has already determined that land devoted to habitat and wetlands may be included in an agricultural preserve,and that the term agricultural land includes habitat and wetlands.italics omitted.as we have noted,a city or county may include wetlands or habitat in an agricultural preserve and section does provide the term agricultural land as used in the williamson act includes habitat and wetlands.but we fail to see how this leads to a conclusion that the compatibility principles embodied in sections and do not apply to habitat and wetlands.sections and do not use the term agricultural land and nowhere is their application limited as the state agencies contend.
the county in its agricultural preserve did not include traynham property as an open space use.the county super williamson act contract with traynham specifically limited use of his property to production of food and fiber for commercial purposes and uses compatible thereto.the list of compatible uses in the super williamson act contract did not include use of the property as a wildlife refuge or managed wetlands.the easement,on the other hand,prohibited in perpetuity the cultivation on the property of agricultural crops for commercial gain as a generally inconsistent use of the property.
in these circumstances,the county action against the state agencies significantly promoted the williamson act legislative goals of allowing local governmental input and control over the preservation of agricultural land and open spaces see,by seeking to compel the state agencies to comply with the procedural requirements of the williamson act.as a consequence of the county action and the preliminary injunction and stay,the state agencies were forced to consult with the county regarding its williamson act concerns,resulting in an amendment to the easement to allow continued agricultural use of the property through livestock grazing.the amendment fostered the public interest in maintaining agricultural production on lands covered by williamson act contracts,an interest which the legislature has itself declared to be an important one,subd.d,subd.f.
the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding the county action enforced an important right affecting the public interest.
c.the county action conferred a significant benefit on the general public or a large class of persons 
the trial court found the state agencies had actively interfered with the county contractual arrangement with traynham.had the county remained on the sidelines and not taken action,the state may very well have felt that this was a green light to continue to convert agricultural land into wildlife preserves by failing to make the requisite findings which are mandated by government code section.over time,such an action would have an adverse effect on agriculture within the state,thereby benefiting a large group of people within the state.
the state agencies complain the trial court never found a significant benefit stemming from the county action,and citing woodland hills ii,t o the extent the trial court could be said to have found a benefit in the county enforcement of the provisions of section,such a benefit is too generalized to constitute a substantial benefit for the purposes of an attorney fee award.the state agencies also complain the county advanced at most the interests of its own constituents.the state agencies repeat their contentions that the easement was consistent with the williamson act and that they were not required to make findings pursuant to section.we reject these contentions.
t he significant benefit that will justify an attorney fee award need not represent a tangible asset or a concrete gain but,in some cases,may be recognized simply from the effectuation of a fundamental constitutional or statutory policy.woodland hills ii,supra,cal d at.of course,the public always has a significant interest in seeing that legal strictures are properly enforced and thus,in a real sense,the public always derives a benefit when illegal private or public conduct is rectified.both the statutory language significant benefit and prior case law,however,indicate that the legislature did not intend to authorize an award of attorney fees in every case involving a statutory violation.we believe rather that the legislature contemplated that in adjudicating a motion for attorney fees under section,a trial court would determine the significance of the benefit,as well as the size of the class receiving benefit,from a realistic assessment,in light of all the pertinent circumstances,of the gains which have resulted in a particular case.id.at.
here the ruling of the trial court makes clear the court found a significant benefit in the county action,despite the trial court failure to include the word significant in its findings.moreover,the record supports the trial court finding of significant benefit to the general public or a large class of persons from the county action.the record describes this project as the first project un
