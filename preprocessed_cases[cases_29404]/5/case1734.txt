introduction 
our supreme court has held that attorneys may state retaliatory discharge claims against their employers as long as such claims can be established without breaching the privilege or unduly endangering the values lying at the heart of the professional relationship.general dynamics superior court cal th,general dynamics.it has also held that attorneys come within the rubric of the attorney fee award provisions of civil code section plcm group,drexler cal th plcm 
today we face the related question of whether attorneys come within the mandatory relief from default or dismissal provision of section of the code of civil procedure the question is,as far as we are aware,one of first impression in california.however,based on what the supreme court said in general dynamics and in plcm about the role of attorneys,there can be no doubt about the answer yes.
there is a wrinkle in this case,however,that requires a little more explication.here,the attorney who negligently allowed a million default judgment to be taken against his company and his employer,a gas station chain,had the title of vice president and general counsel.thus,he was a corporate officer as well as being an attorney.should that make a difference 
we emphasize that we are,like the supreme court in trope katz cal th trope,dealing with the text of a statute.trope held that that attorneys representing themselves can not obtain attorney fees under civil code section because the language of section used words like fees and incurred.see id.at.such words revealed that the legislature did not intend to allow attorneys representing themselves to obtain fees under section.after all,attorneys representing themselves do incur any fees to enforce a contract.
in the present case,we follow suit and similarly look to the language of the relevant statute,in this case section.and there is nothing in section which suggests that attorneys who are also officers of a corporation are somehow exempt from the operation of the mandatory provisions of the statute.the statute speaks of an attorney sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake,etcetera,leading to a default,and makes no differentiation between attorneys who are corporate officers and those who are not.
accordingly,this court would thus have to read into section an implied exception for counsel who double as corporate officers.this case case of all particularly inappropriate for the judicial creation of such an implied exception there is a distinction between corporate counsel who provide strictly legal services to a corporation,and corporate counsel who step out of their role as legal advisor and provide services of a nonlegal business nature.see friedman,cal.practice guide corporations the rutter group,original italics omitted.in this case,the general counsel was only acting in his capacity as a lawyer,and providing only services of a legal nature,and was most certainly not acting in any role as a corporate officer.in in violation of his duty as a concealed the litigation from everybody else in the corporation.because he was a lawyer,acting as a lawyer,there is no need for us to carve out,in this case,any implied exception in section for counsel who are also corporate officers.here,because the attorney was acting in his role as attorney,it is clear the trial court correctly set aside the default.
ii.background 
in december,maria gutierrez filed a class action suit against g m oil company,an operator of a chain of gas stations throughout california.the chain stations include chevron,valero and shell stations in fact,g m is,according to its web site,one of the largest chevron dealers in the nation.the company was founded by george pearson who began by operating one gasoline station in seal beach in,and,at least by,remained very much a family enterprise,still managed by pearson and his family.according to points and authorities that would eventually be filed to obtain a default judgment,g m has more than gas stations,open all day and all night,and employs between four and seven cashiers at each station,who work shifts of eight hours.that works out,according to those points and authorities,to between and full time equivalents.the word equivalents was presumably chosen because some cashiers may work more than one shift we may thus presume that the company has upwards of employees.
gutierrez class action suit alleged that g m employment policies toward its cashiers violated wage and hour laws.in particular,she alleged that the cashiers were paid for the time they spent counting money and closing out registers,and were given meal breaks required by law.
michael gray is part of pearson family,related to pearson by pearson first marriage.gray father is,in fact,g m chief financial officer.gray himself was the gas station chain vice president and general counsel,and had been so since.at all times from march to january he was the registered agent for service of process for the company,and hence authorized to receive all pleadings and legal documents on its behalf.in fact,he had been the company only attorney since,and would continue to be until january.
in a conversation with gutierrez attorney,gregory karasik,on january,gray agreed to accept service of the complaint by regular mail.karasik mailed him a copy of the complaint that day.
after receiving the original summons and complaint,gray decided to handle the defense of the case himself.he did not send a copy of the pleadings to any other officer,director,manager,or employee of the company,never talked to,or otherwise let on to anyone else at the company that it had been sued for alleged wage and hour violations.he kept it from,according to his declaration when read in conjunction with the firm web site,the fellow members of the pearson clan who otherwise ran the company.nor did any of his fellow officers,managers or family members find out about it.the litigation was his little secret.
gray attended no less than two case management conferences over the next year,but gray took no action to otherwise defend the case.remarkably,the record contains no less than three separate requests for default one filed on the original complaint on june,then another default request on september,in the wake of a first amended complaint,and finally a third default request,based on a lack of a response to the second amended complaint,on january.
in may,default having been taken four months earlier,gutierrez successfully sought an order requiring the company to provide the name and home address of every employee in gutierrez served directly on in august successfully obtained an order holding g m in contempt for not providing the list.gray did nothing to oppose that order,nor did he show up at the hearing,despite service of notice.
in september,patience exhausted,gutierrez counsel requested entry of a default judgment.a judgment was obtained in early december,for around million 
the million class action default judgment was too much,even for gray,who,in december,finally brought it to the attention of george pearson,the company chief executive officer and founder.that was the first pearson ever heard of the case.pearson immediately removed gray from his position as general counsel and from his position as agent for service of process,and replaced him with an outside attorney.pearson then immediately retained a large law firm to defend the suit the same firm represents g m in this appeal,and authorized it to represent it in a mediation scheduled for march.
that firm filed,in march,a motion to vacate the default class action judgment,based on,among other things,gray declaration,relating many of the facts we have already recounted.the ninth paragraph of the declaration contains gray confession of neglect for letting the default judgment be taken the default judgment entered in this case was a result of my neglect alone.my actions and inactions in representing g m oil company,that lead to the entry of the default judgment in this lawsuit were taken without the knowledge or consent of defendant g m oil company,inc.and defendant g m oil company,is entirely blameless and without fault in this matter.in a reply declaration to gutierrez opposition to the set aside motion,pearson would note that gray never had any management responsibilities at the company his sole job was to advise pearson and act as agent for service of process.
the hearing was held in april,resulting in a formal order filed may vacating the default judgment and allowing g m to file an answer to gutierrez second amended complaint.gray was also ordered by the court,as a consequence of granting the motion to set aside the judgment based on his affidavit of fault,to pay about in attorney fees to gutierrez counsel.gutierrez filed a timely notice of appeal from the order granting the motion to vacate the default judgment 
iii.discussion 
do counsel come within section.the governing precedent 
some appellate cases,based on the not in fact caused by the attorney mistake,inadvertence,surprise or neglect clause in the mandatory relief provision of section,have restricted the statute only to cases where the party against whom the judgment is taken is totally innocent of any wrongdoing and the attorney was the sole cause of the default or dismissal,lang hochman th,original italics.
by contrast,other court of appeal decisions have indicated that the provision is available to clients who may be at some fault in allowing the dismissal or default,just as long as the client is not guilty of intentional misconduct in contributing to the adverse result,sjp limited partnership city of los angeles th,sjp limited partnership because the evidence does not support a finding of any intentional misconduct on on the client part,we find that the trial court erred in not granting the client mandatory relief from dismissal benedict danner press th,while client mistakes were an additional cause in fact of the entry of default,since those mistakes were not intentional,relief was properly granted 
the case before us,however,does not implicate this split among the appellate courts.the issue of whether some quanta of blameworthiness on the part of the client that might otherwise disqualify it from relief under the mandatory provision of section is not before us.there is nothing here to indicate that the client,g m,was anything less than totally innocent of the causes for the eventual default judgment.
that you impute gray misconduct,as attorney,to g m,on the theory that he was a corporate officer,agent,or otherwise a company employee.and that is,of course,the centerpiece of gutierrez appeal.gutierrez theory is that,as a matter of law,gray conduct was his client conduct,hence g m is stuck with it,no matter how innocent the company might otherwise be.
we are aware of no published opinion directly dealing with the issue of whether attorneys come within the mandatory relief provision of section.however,the supreme court has examined two closely related issues may an attorney sue a former employer for wrongful termination or retaliatory discharge general dynamics,supra,cal th.and does an counsel come within the attorney fee recovery provision of section plcm,supra,cal th at.
general dynamics,the wrongful termination and discharge case,is an extended and nuanced disquisition on the role of attorneys along the way the high court noted the marked rise in the number and professional stature of or corporate counsel,general dynamics,supra,cal th at,the unusual pressures they face to conform to their employer goals not shared by outside counsel id.at,their complete economic dependence on their one client see id.at,and the necessity of preserving the privilege if any claim for wrongful termination or retaliatory discharge were to be allowed id.at.thus,in crafting a decision that allows former attorneys to sue their erstwhile employers qua employers,the general dynamics court was very careful to formulate rules so the contours of the statutory privilege should continue to be strictly observed.id.at.
the important thing about general dynamics for our purposes is that there is no way one can read it without coming away with this basic thought attorneys employed as attorneys for their employer do indeed have an relationship with their employers.
the second of the two analogous decisions,plcm,bears extended discussion.there,an attorney requested a defense of a legal malpractice action against him from an insurance company the insurance company retained a defense firm that the attorney himself selected,and the case got settled.but a dispute arose over whether the attorney himself had to pay a certain amount of the defense firm fees as a deductible.for his part,the attorney paid nothing toward the fees incurred defending the malpractice action against him and contended he did not owe anything to the insurer.there was,however,a reimbursement provision in his malpractice policy,a provision which had an attorney fees provision just in case the insurer had to bring suit to recover any money advanced that should properly have been paid by the insured as part of the deductible.the insurance company paid off the defense firm,and then assigned out its claim under the reimbursement provision for collection,and the collection firm then sued the attorney.see plcm,supra,cal th at.
but then the attorney against the insurer for bad faith and related causes of action.the collection firm assigned the main claim back to the insurer,which became the plaintiff in the action,the attorney himself rejected any attempt to settle the case,and the case eventually went to trial,with the insurer represented by counsel employed by its parent company.see plcm,supra,cal th at.the high court noted that the insurer was charged annually by that parent company for a proportional share of the expenses of operating the parent company law division.id.at.
the insurance company,represented by its parent firm law division,won the trial,and returned a verdict for the full amount of the claim,about.then it sought an attorney fee award of about under the reimbursement provision.the figure was based on the market rate for attorneys of comparable experience.see plcm,supra,cal th at.the insured attorney argued against any award on the theory that attorney fees for counsel could not be recovered.id.at.the trial judge granted the fee request anyway the attorney repeated his argument to the appellate court,relying on trope,supra,cal th,a decision that had held that attorneys representing themselves in propria persona could not recover attorney fees under section.the appellate court rejected the argument,affirmed the award,and the supreme court granted review and affirmed as well.we will have more to say about trope in part.of this opinion anon.
we divine from plcm the following three reasons the high court included attorneys as a truly independent third party for purposes of whether a fee award could be made under section 
one,attorneys do not represent themselves,they represent third parties.hence,the high court distinguished trope on this very basis.the trope case,said the plcm court,was anchored in the theory that by definition,the term attorney fees implies the existence of an relationship,a party receiving professional services from a lawyer.plcm,supra,cal th at.a lawyer representing himself,by contrast besides having a fool for a for the court,justice mosk quoted trope endorsement of the adage by noting it was the product of years of experience,does not have such a relationship.id.at.the point was that the attorney does not represent himself,but has an agency relationship with the corporation he or she represents.id.at a corporation represented by counsel is in an agency relationship,it has hired an attorney to provide professional legal services on its behalf.
two,treating attorneys differently from outside attorneys for purposes of section would create an unfair differentiation in the law.the plcm court observed that in the case of an attorney in pro se,the court rationale in trope was animated by the unfairness of allowing an attorney in pro per to recover counsel fees when litigants in pro per could not.see id.at,quoting and citing trope,supra,cal th at.the underlying point again was that attorneys,unlike attorneys in pro se,do not represent their own interests there is no problem of disparate treatment attorneys,like private counsel but unlike pro se litigants,do not represent their own personal interests and are not seeking remuneration simply for lost opportunity costs that could not be recouped by a nonlawyer.plcm,supra,cal th at.
three,the analogy between attorneys to outside attorneys on private retainers favors application of section to the attorneys the fact that counsel is employed by the corporation does not alter the fact of representation by an independent third party.instead,the payment of a salary to attorneys is analogous to hiring a private firm on a retainer.plcm,supra,cal th at.in that regard,the court stated that both counsel and outside counsel have the same duties to their clients both are bound by the same fiduciary and ethical duties to their clients.id.at.
each one of these reasons applies just as much to the mandatory provisions of section given the facts of this case.one here,the attorney gray was in an relationship with g m,and he was acting as an attorney in being the person responsible for handling gutierrez suit.two there is nothing in section that suggests corporations or other business entities who elect to have an lawyer represent them in litigation should be at some disadvantage the negligence of their attorneys that would not apply when they elect to retain outside counsel.and three here,as in plcm,both and outside attorneys on retainer have the same duties to this is plcm and general dynamics word clients.see plcm,supra,cal th at both and outside counsel are bound by the same fiduciary and ethical duties to their clients general dynamics,supra,cal th at emphasizing importance of preserving privilege in context of wrongful discharge litigation.
does it make any difference that the attorney was also a corporate officer not under these facts 
counsel for gutierrez lays great stress that here gray held the title of vice president of g m.as he sees it,an attorney and an are,legally speaking,one flesh when the attorney is also a corporate officer.
not so,for a number of reasons.
first,we must remember we are dealing with a statute,not common law.trope,supra,cal th at moreover,trope trope has again framed its contention as if its claim for attorney fees were governed by common law and not by statute.the mandatory relief provision of section is notwithstanding any other requirements of this section,the court shall,whenever an application for relief is made no more than six months after entry of judgment,is in proper form,and is accompanied by an attorney sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or neglect,vacate any resulting default entered by the clerk against his or her client,and which will result in entry of a default judgment,or resulting default judgment or dismissal entered against his or her client,unless the court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the attorney mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or neglect.italics added.
the italicized words show two things.one,the statute does not differentiate between attorneys who are,or are not,officers of a corporate employer rather,the core idea is that an attorney be the one responsible resulting caused by for the default or default judgment.two,it does require that there be a client,an relationship.
in this regard,there is one salient,dispositive point of law only attorneys may represent clients in court.bus,no person shall practice law in california unless the person is an active member of the state bar.thus,if an attorney is responsible for a default,by definition that responsibility implicates the attorney services as an attorney,and not as a corporate officer.there is thus nothing in the substance of section that suggests that courts should treat counsel who are not officers any differently from attorneys who are corporate officers.to do so,a court would have to read into section an exception not present in the language.code civ.proc.in the construction of a statute is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or substance contained therein,not to insert what has been omitted.this we decline to do.
in this regard,we find trope instructive.trope,like this case,was a statutory interpretation case.and it certainly did not conflate attorneys with their clients.the case is a sustained meditation on the language of section,california reciprocal attorney fee statute.hence,the high court began its analysis,after quoting the pertinent language of section,by declaring our resolution of this issue turns on how we construe section,and particularly on how we define the words reasonable attorney fees in subdivision a of that statute.trope,supra,cal th at.
the trope court went on to emphasize the importance of the word incurred in the statute trope,supra,cal th at,original italics,quote from a legal dictionary on the meaning of the word fee ibid,augment that definition with case law on the meaning of reasonable attorney fees id.at,address seemingly contrary case law by noting that the legislature has now spoken on the subject id.at,return to the theme of legislative intent by noting that nonattorney professionals were never intended to recover for their time under section see id.at it is clear that when it enacted section the legislature did not intend to allow doctors,architects,painters or any other nonattorneys to receive compensation for the valuable time they spend litigating a contract matter,and finish up by making the point that treating attorneys differently than such nonattorney professionals would conflict with the legislative purpose of section id.at.
and,in fact,the trope court was quite unmoved by the policy arguments presented by the attorneys there the court stuck to the plain meaning of the statutory language in light of the foregoing,we do not find trope trope public policy arguments sufficiently compelling to support a conclusion that the legislature must have intended the words reasonable attorney fees in section to carry some special significance other than their usual and ordinary meaning or their established legal definition because it wished to facilitate or encourage by attorney litigants.trope,supra,cal th at,italics added.
what we have noted about trope applies just as much to this case there is no differentiation in the statutory text between attorneys and attorneys,or between attorneys who are corporate officers and those who are not,and there is nothing in the language or structure of section to require an implied differentiation.as we have seen from general dynamics and plcm,counsel do have an relationship with their corporations,and as we have seen from plcm,attorneys do represent their employers.it therefore follows that the legislative intent in enacting the mandatory provision of section was to protect corporations represented by counsel as much as any other class of litigants represented by counsel.
two more points,however,must be noted.first,unlike an attorney who represents himself as in trope or as in esther city of los angeles th attorney who was her own client,representing herself,her daughter and,ostensibly,the taxpayers,bungled her own fee request and could not receive relief under section,a corporation must be represented in court by an attorney.paradise nowlin d,a corporation can not appear in court by an officer who is not an attorney and it can not appear in propria persona.the very corporate form then,in the context of litigation,treats attorneys,whether they be officers or not,as agents separate from the corporation itself.
second,the case law distinguishes between corporate counsel who perform strictly legal services to a corporation so that,for example,in performing those services there is an privilege and services of a nonlegal business nature.see friedman,cal.practice guide corporations the rutter group,original italics.acting as a contract negotiator with a third party outside of a labor an example of such nonlegal business.see montebello rose,agricultural relations bd.d.
as we have noted,representing clients in court is the quintessential legal service performed by an attorney,or outside.obviously some defalcation on an attorne
