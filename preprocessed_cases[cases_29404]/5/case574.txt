leslie warthman filed a complaint in the court of common pleas for delaware county,ohio,arguing that the genoa township board of trustees violated the ohio open meetings law when it terminated her employment without allowing her to respond to the allegations against her at a public hearing.the township removed the case to the federal district court on the basis that a reference in the complaint to the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution created federal question jurisdiction.holding that the complaint did not state a federal cause of action,the district court remanded warthman lawsuit to the state court.the district court declined,however,to award warthman the costs and attorney fees associated with the removal and subsequent remand.for the reasons set forth below,we vacate the portion of the district court judgment that denied warthman her request for costs and attorney fees and remand the case for reconsideration of that issue.
background 
warthman worked as a zoning inspector for the genoa township board of trustees in westerville,ohio.the genoa township zoning commission a separate entity held a meeting on march,in which sharp differences of opinion were expressed regarding a parcel of property in the township.warthman sent an email to the board of trustees the following day.according to her complaint in this case,the email contained harsh and unflattering criticism of some zoning commission members.
at a board of trustees meeting on march,a zoning commission member requested an executive session between the zoning commission and the board of trustees.the board adopted a motion to hold such an executive session to consider taking action against warthman,unless she requested a public hearing.warthman responded to the board action by requesting a public hearing,but no such hearing on the matter was held.the board of trustees instead met in four separate executive sessions and subsequently terminated warthman employment on the ground that she had admitted to having violated township policies.
after warthman was terminated,she filed a complaint in the court of common pleas for delaware county,ohio.her complaint alleged in count one that the township had violated the ohio open meetings law by adopting the resolution to fire her in a meeting not open to the public.in count two,the complaint asserted that defendant is estopped to deny plaintiff right to a public name clearing hearing.this estoppel claim arose from warthman contention that members of the board of trustees and the zoning commission agreed that plaintiff was entitled to a public hearing but at a later date,and that they had made that representation to her.paragraph of warthman complaint contained the sole reference to federal law,stating that,p ursuant to the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution and article i section of the ohio constitution,she was entitled to a name clearing hearing.
the township removed the case to the united states district court for the southern district of ohio.in its notice of removal,the township cited paragraph of the complaint and count two,the estoppel claim,asserting that these portions of the complaint state d a federal question pursuant to.warthman moved to remand the case back to state court and requested an award of costs and any actual expenses,including attorney fees,incurred as a result of the removal.see c.the motion to remand explained that paragraph of the complaint referenced the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment simply to satisfy the ohio supreme court interpretation of the ohio open meetings law.see matheny frontier local bd.of,ohio,explaining that the law guarantees the right to a public hearing only if that right is elsewhere provided by law.
ruling on the motion to remand the case to state court,the district court conclude d that the complaint,fairly read,invoke d only claims under state law.the district court noted that the complaint made no reference to or any other federal statute,that the first count expressly invoked only ohio law,and that the second count asserted only a common law estoppel claim.as a result,the district court granted the motion to remand the case to the state court.regarding warthman request for an award of costs and attorney fees,however,the district court said because removal of the action was based upon plaintiff reference in the complaint to federal law,the court concludes that an award of fees or costs to plaintiff would be unjust and is unwarranted.
the district court decision to grant the motion to remand the case to state court is not subject to review by this court.see d powerex reliant energy,d noting that remands based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction are shielded from appellate review by d.this leaves only the denial of costs and attorney fees to warthman as an issue on appeal.see stallworth greater cleveland reg l transit,cir holding that this court has jurisdiction to review the award or denial of attorney fees under c.

standard of review 
district courts have considerable discretion to award or deny costs and attorney fees under c,and we will overrule whatever decision is reached only where such discretion has been abused.bartholomew town of collierville,cir.an abuse of discretion occurs where a district court relies on clearly erroneous findings of fact,or when it improperly applies the law or uses an erroneous legal standard.christian schmidt brewing heileman brewing,cir citation omitted.
costs and awards upon remand 
a civil case that is filed in state court may be removed by the defendant to federal district court if the plaintiff could have chosen to file there originally.if the district court later determines that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction,however,the case must be remanded.c.the remand statute provides that a n order remanding the case may require payment of just costs and any actual expenses,including attorney fees,incurred as a result of the removal.id.this language places an award of costs and attorney fees hereinafter sometimes collectively referred to simply as fees or fee awards squarely within the discretion of the district court,but subject to the guidance set forth by the supreme court in martin franklin capital,d.
absent unusual circumstances,the supreme court instructs that fee awards are appropriate only where the removing party lacked an objectively reasonable basis for seeking removal.id.at.this court has similarly instructed that an award of costs,including attorney fees,is inappropriate where the defendant attempt to remove the action was fairly supportable,or where there has not been at least some finding of fault with the defendant decision to remove.bartholomew,at quoting ahearn charter twp.of bloomfield,wl at cir.june,unpublished emphasis in original.
warthman asserts in her brief that w hen a district court denies attorney fees it abuses its discretion where the defendant argument for removal was devoid of even fair support.she takes this statement of the rule from bartholomew,at,an opinion that quoted from the unpublished ahearn decision.wl at.this language suggests that the district court discretion under c is basically a binary determination if the defendant argument for removal was objectively reasonable,the court may not award fees to the plaintiff if it was not,the district court must award such fees.this court applied that rule in ahearn.following a finding that the removal to federal court in ahearn lacked fair support,the court remanded the case with an instruction to make an evidentiary determination as to the fees actually incurred in conjunction with the removal petition.id.at.
bartholomew quoted the rule as it was stated in ahearn,but did not apply it in the same way because the defendant removal in bartholomew was fairly supportable.bartholomew,at.in bartholomew,we accordingly affirmed the district court denial of fees to the plaintiff.id.at.just eight months after bartholomew,however,the supreme court decided martin,which is now the leading case on discretionary fee awards pursuant to c.
