appellant brought separate appeals challenging the reduction of his attorney fee award and seeking sanctions against appellees for misconduct during trial.those issues have been consolidated on appeal.
appellant prevailed in his civil rights action against the city of boynton beach and its police officer.the action arose from an encounter appellant had in.out of uniform and driving an unmarked car,officer bateson had followed appellant car in a way that caused appellant to believe he was in danger of being robbed.while stopped at an intersection,appellant saw the unidentified pursuer approaching him with a drawn gun.in a defensive act,he backed into the officer vehicle and drove away to seek police protection.when stopped by a fort lauderdale officer,appellant relayed his belief that someone was trying to rob him.officer bateson then arrived and identified himself as a police officer from boynton beach.he claimed to have stopped appellant after observing him commit a burglary on a van and explained that appellant had slammed into his vehicle and fled the scene.appellant was arrested and charged with burglary of a vehicle and aggravated assault on a police officer.the charges were eventually dropped.in a separate matter,officer bateson was convicted of robbery.
after the charges were dropped,appellant brought a civil rights claim under,alleging false arrest and malicious prosecution.in addition to the individual officers,appellant sued the city of boynton beach on the theory that the city had a custom or policy of failing to properly train or supervise its police officers.there were other named defendants that were dismissed or severed from the case before the final disposition.from the outset,the core of the litigation was the city failure to train its officers and the officer unconstitutional conduct toward appellant.
after a trial,a jury determined that both the city of boynton beach and officer bateson had violated appellant fourth and fourteenth amendment rights.several of appellant original claims were either severed or dismissed before the case was submitted to the jury,but the jury found for appellant on all claims submitted.the jury awarded only of the requested in compensatory damages.additionally,appellant received a punitive damages award against officer bateson.
having obtained a favorable verdict,appellant filed a motion for attorney fees and costs under.the district court expressed the opinion that it would not have found for appellant on his claim against the city,but acknowledged that the jury verdict entitled appellant to an award of fees and costs.the court referred the fee petition to a magistrate judge with direction to reduce the award on the ground that counsel had spent many hours on unsuccessful claims.the magistrate judge conducted an evidentiary hearing and entered a report and recommendation reducing the amount as directed.over appellant objection,the district court entered an order affirming the magistrate judge report.this appeal followed.
award of attorney fees and costs under 
the parties understand our standard of review.this court reviews an award of attorney fees for abuse of discretion nevertheless,that standard of review still allows us to closely scrutinize questions of law decided by the district court in reaching a fee award.clark hous.auth.of alma,cir.it is undisputed that appellant is a prevailing party entitled to a reasonable award of fees and costs under.the current dispute is about the size of the award only.
ultimately,the computation of a fee award is necessarily an exercise of judgment,because t here is no precise rule or formula for making these determinations.hensley eckerhart,d.extending deference to the district court factual findings,our review concentrates on the application of the legal standards that have been developed to guide the discretionary nature of fee determinations.see clark,at.
the district court concluded that appellant obtained only limited success and spent many hours on unsuccessful claims.appellant argues that he obtained substantial relief and deserves full compensation for vindicating an important public interest.he asserts that the time invested was necessary to the outcome achieved.appellees defend the district court reduction of the fee award,arguing that the size of the compensatory damage award evidences that the success appellant obtained was patently limited.
among the many considerations a court must entertain when calculating a award,the most critical factor is the degree of success obtained.hensley,at.this appeal presents squarely the question of what constitutes success in a complex civil rights case.we turn to that first,relying on prior cases that have addressed that issue.
the thrust of appellant argument is that,in a complex civil rights case,a jury verdict that a plaintiff constitutional rights have been violated,by itself,represents success on a significant issue in the litigation.aplt.brief at.therefore,appellant argues,the verdict alone justifies a full award of fees and costs.appellant elaborates that the public as a whole benefits from civil rights litigation,as distinguished from a private tort suit where only the individual plaintiff benefits.see city of riverside rivera,d see also blum stenson,d.based on that distinction between private and public benefit,he concludes that the amount of damages awarded do not reflect the degree of success,w hether the damage award is or.aplt.brief at.his ultimate assertion is that i n this case,the amount of the award is irrelevant in justifying the limited success argument.reply brief at.
appellant states the law correctly to the extent that success in a civil rights claim is measured differently than success in a private tort claim.indeed congress has elected to encourage meritorious civil rights claims because of the benefits of such litigation for the named plaintiff and for society at large,irrespective of whether the action seeks monetary damages.blanchard bergeron,d.moreover,the supreme court has articulated the distinction advanced by appellant unlike most private tort litigants,a civil rights plaintiff seeks to vindicate important civil and constitutional rights that can not be valued solely in monetary terms.riverside,at.that distinction,however,does not lead to appellant conclusion that monetary damages are,as a matter of law,irrelevant in determining the degree of success obtained in a civil rights action.
taken to its logical limit,appellant argument would make awards full and automatic for plaintiffs who obtain a jury verdict that a constitutional right was violated.that argument does not withstand analysis under existing case law.it is well established that where a plaintiff has achieved only partial or limited success,the product of hours reasonably expended on the litigation as a whole times a reasonable hourly rate may be an excessive amount.hensley,at.that principle is routinely applied in cases where plaintiffs have proven a violation of a constitutional right but failed to achieve the full measure of success sought.see popham city of kennesaw,cir foster bd.of sch.comm rs,cir.there is no room to doubt that a court may reduce a award when the degree of success obtained is limited,even when a plaintiff obtains a favorable jury verdict that a constitutional right was violated.the amount of damages a plaintiff recovers is certainly relevant to the amount of attorney fees to be awarded under.riverside,at.without further discussion,we reject the arguments that the size of an award is irrelevant as a matter of law and that a jury verdict alone proves success to have been complete.
although we reject appellant categorical argument,it is true that success in a civil rights case can not be valued solely in monetary terms.see riverside,at.furthermore,when determining the degree of success obtained by a civil rights plaintiff,a court must be careful not to place undue emphasis on the modest money damages that were found by the jury because successful civil rights actions vindicate a public interest.williams thomas,cir.in this circuit,we have previously explained that a court that reduced a award would have erred had it ignored the fact that the plaintiff in a civil rights action benefitted the public interest by vindicating his constitutional rights.popham,at.appellant asserts that the district court committed that error here.
after acknowledging that appellant was entitled to an award,the district court directed the magistrate judge to reduce the award in light of the many hours villano counsel spent litigating his multitudinous unsuccessful claims.record,vol,doc,at.the magistrate judge did not independently evaluate whether appellant was entitled to a full award.see record,vol,doc,at.concerned that the judges were ignoring a fundamental aspect of his success,appellant repeatedly asserted that his entitlement to fees derived from the fact that he created a public benefit by prevailing against a municipal defendant.see plaintiff motion for clarification re court omnibus order and order of reference,record,vol,doc,at plaintiff reply to defendant city of boynton beach response in opposition to plaintiff motion for attorney fees and costs,record,vol,doc,at.because appellant assertion accurately states the law governing awards,we have carefully reviewed the record to ascertain whether the district court considered that a public benefit inures when a plaintiff prevails against a public body in civil rights litigation.
neither the district court nor the magistrate judge directly addressed the public benefit principle.the judges may have contemplated it,as suggested by the following citation to riverside in the district court order of reference,at.a rule that limits attorney fees in civil rights cases to a portion of the damages awarded would seriously undermine congress purpose in enacting.record,vol,doc,at.however,for the following reason,we conclude that the district court and magistrate judge failed to account for public benefit when determining the actual extent of appellant success.
the district court framed appellant success by comparing it to the success obtained by the plaintiff in popham,at.record,vol,doc,at.this comparison belies the fact that appellant received a greater measure of success than the popham plaintiff.although a reduction of a award was upheld in popham,the reasons cited therein do not justify a reduction in this case.there,the plaintiff prevailed on only one of eight claims submitted to the jury and received a compensatory damage award of after requesting.popham,at.in comparison,appellant obtained money damages closer to the amount requested and prevailed on every claim submitted to the jury.we clarify that,although those differences are relevant,they are not individually determinative and,if those were the only comparisons to be made,we would defer to the judgment of the district court.see,perkins mobile hous,cir upholding reduction of lodestar fee amount where plaintiff did not prove constitutional violation,did not prevail on every claim,and obtained only of the monetary recovery sought.
however,there is an additional factual distinction between this case and popham.although both plaintiffs sued a municipal defendant,only appellant prevailed on that difficult and important claim.see popham,at.that distinction carries legal significance because vindicating a constitutional right against a municipal defendant heightens the public benefit created by a lawsuit.see riverside,at.discussing the public benefit that inures from lawsuits that affect institutional behavior popham,at deterrence of unconstitutional conduct by public officials benefits citizens rights in the future.public benefit is a distinct measure of success in civil rights actions and was a central aim of appellant litigation.
to avoid undermining the purpose of,a court must account for that distinct measure of success when calculating an award of fees and costs.see riverside,at.the district court erred by relying on popham where a party failed to prevail against a municipal defendant.as this circuit forecasted,we now hold that the district court erred in reducing the fee award while ignoring public benefit,which is an important measure of success.see popham,at.appellant is entitled to an award of fees and costs commensurate with the extent of success obtained.that success exceeds the degree recognized by the appealed award.
on appeal,appellees argument has focused primarily on the size of the compensatory damages that the jury awarded appellant.although we hold that the district court erred in reducing the fee award without considering a distinct measure of success,we clarify that the court did not err by considering the damage award as an indicator of success.
the relative importance of a money damage award must be determined on a basis.for example,monetary damages will be wholly immaterial when a plaintiff seeks purely equitable relief.see hensley,at.citing stanford daily zurcher,aff,cir,rev on other grounds,d.on the other hand,where compensatory damages constitute the primary relief sought and become the only relief obtained,a court is not beyond its discretion in considering the damages awarded as a relevant factor.see corder brown,cir.in any event,a court remains obligated to account for all distinct measures of success when determining whether success was limited.
before turning our analysis to the actual computation of appellant award,we return to the reason for reduction articulated by the district court.the district court directed the magistrate judge to reduce fees because hours were spent litigating unsuccessful claims.see record,vol,doc,at.the magistrate judge did not independently evaluate whether fees should be reduced.see record,vol,doc,at.appellant contends that his petition for fees and costs included only hours spent on successful claims or on claims that were interrelated to the litigation as a whole.
for purposes of awards,the supreme court places primacy on the results obtained.see hensley,at.when the results achieved are excellent,the fee award should not be reduced simply because the plaintiff failed to prevail on every contention raised in the lawsuit.id.acknowledging that parties in good faith may raise alternative legal grounds for a desired outcome,the supreme court has instructed that the district court should focus on the significance of the overall relief obtained by the plaintiff.hensley,at.the conclusion follows where a plaintiff has obtained excellent results,his attorney should recover a fully compensatory fee.id.
review of the record makes apparent that neither the district court nor the magistrate judge evaluated whether plaintiff actual success constituted an excellent result,notwithstanding the fact that some claims were severed or dismissed.moreover,given that neither judge acknowledged the public benefit that occurred from prevailing against a public body,their analysis would have been incomplete even if undertaken.determining whether a plaintiff obtained excellent results is a required element of a legal analysis.we direct the court to conduct that analysis on remand.hensley,at.
appellant prevailed against both officer bateson individually and the city of boynton beach as a public body.by prevailing against the city,appellant obtained a more excellent result than the district court expected,the court having commented that it would not have found for appellant on his claim against the city.on remand,the district court must examine the qualitative value of those successes.see jane bangerter,cir.in doing so,the court needs to account for the vital role private litigation plays in the enforcement of civil rights,the difficulties involved in sustaining those lawsuits,the heightened importance of such lawsuits when the defendant is a public body,and the public benefit that occurs when those lawsuits ultimately vindicate a constitutional right.
if the court determines that the result obtained was an excellent result,then the award of fees will encompass all hours reasonably expended on the litigation,and indeed in some cases of exceptional success an enhanced award may be justified.hensley,at.whether hours were reasonably expended on litigation is a different question than whether hours were necessary to the litigat
