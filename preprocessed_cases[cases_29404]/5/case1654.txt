in this case,we must determine whether california rules of court,rule permits a trial court to award attorney fees as sanctions for a rules violation.rule b authorizes the court to impose reasonable monetary sanctions for violating a rule of court.rule d also provides in addition to the sanctions awardable under b,the court may order the person who has violated the applicable rule to pay to the party aggrieved by the violation that party reasonable expenses,including reasonable attorney fees and costs,incurred in connection with the motion for sanctions or the order to show cause.the court imposed in sanctions on appellants david farley and his counsel,menke menke,llp menke and declared a mistrial because appellants violated a rule of court that required notification of the automatic stay imposed by a filing in the bankruptcy court these monetary sanctions included attorney fees incurred by the aggrieved party as a result of the rules violation.
we conclude that rule does not authorize full compensation of all attorney fees incurred as a result of a rules violation,but only authorizes the court to award reasonable attorney fees incurred in connection with the proceedings in which the aggrieved party seeks sanctions.we therefore reverse the trial court order awarding attorney fees and remand to the trial court to reconsider the reasonable attorney fees incurred in connection with the motion for sanctions and the order to show cause.in all other respects,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
events leading to motion for sanctions and order to show cause 
sino century development limited and sinomax polyurethanes shanghai,collectively,sinomax sold urethane foam for bed mattresses to anatomic global anatomic global.sinomax sued anatomic global and farley to collect almost million in unpaid invoices.
in january,before farley was dismissed as a defendant in this action,he filed for bankruptcy,which triggered a stay of judicial proceedings against him a.farley,however,did not notify sinomax or the trial court that he had filed for bankruptcy protection as required under rule.
during the bankruptcy proceedings,one of farley creditors filed an adversary complaint against him and anatomic global.as part of the settlement of the adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court,the creditor obtained anatomic global assets.
in late april,months after farley had declared bankruptcy,sinomax and menke discussed dismissing farley from this action.despite entering into these discussions and negotiating the dismissal,menke later told the court that it mistakenly believed farley had been dismissed one year before the bankruptcy filing.upon learning that farley had not been dismissed from this action,menke failed to inform the court of the automatic bankruptcy stay.while the stay was in effect,the trial court entered farley dismissal.
on june,the day before trial,menke informed sinomax that farley had filed for bankruptcy.menke proposed that the parties avoid a costly trial because anatomic global had no assets.
the parties did not reach a settlement,and the jury trial commenced.meanwhile,sinomax attempted to obtain farley bankruptcy file.
the trial court imposes monetary sanctions 
sinomax informed the court that farley had filed for bankruptcy and asked the court to issue an order to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed for failing to notify the court of the automatic bankruptcy stay.the court issued the order to show cause,declared a mistrial,and dismissed the jury.the court also set a hearing for the limited purpose of permitting sinomax witnesses,who had traveled from china for the trial,to testify regarding their expenses.following the hearing,the parties filed and responded to a motion for sanctions.
sinomax filed a sanctions motion seeking against farley,anatomic global,and menke pursuant to rule,code of civil procedure section government code section,and section of title of the united states code.the requested sanctions represented attorney fees incurred in preparing the sanctions motion along with the expenses and attorney fees incurred in preparation for and during trial.
the trial court imposed the requested in sanctions pursuant to rule against farley and menke the court concluded that rule d gave it the authority to impose reasonable monetary sanctions for failure to comply with the applicable rule of court,and rule b gave the court authority to order the person who had violated the rule of court to pay the party aggrieved by the violation,its reasonable expenses,including reasonable attorney fees and costs,incurred in connection with the motion for sanctions or the order to show cause.italics omitted.because rule authorized sanctions,the trial court distinguished bauguess paine cal d,bauguess,holding that a trial court could not rely on its inherent supervisory authority to impose attorney fees as sanctions for attorney misconduct.according to the trial court,it was not relying on its inherent authority because rule d authorized awarding attorney fees in connection with the instant motion.italics in original.
this timely appeal followed.
discussion 
we must determine whether rule authorizes the trial court to impose attorney fees as sanctions for violating a rule of court,and whether rule is a lawful exercise of the judicial council constitutional rulemaking authority.on issues addressing the interpretation of the california rules of court,our review is de novo.in re daniel th,d.
attorney fees are not authorized as sanctions for a rule of court violation 
appellants contend that rule does not authorize the court to impose attorney fees as reasonable monetary sanctions for a rule violation.the rules applicable to interpretation of the rules of court are similar to those governing statutory construction.citation.under those rules of construction,our primary objective is to determine the drafters intent.citation.citation.rossa falk construction,cal th,d.if the rule language is clear and unambiguous,it governs.citation.experience teaches,however,that unforeseen ambiguities can and do come to light despite the drafters considered efforts to avoid them.in such cases,courts may consult appropriate extrinsic sources to clarify the drafters intent.citation.citation.id.at,d.as shall be discussed,based on the plain language of rule and extrinsic materials from the judicial council that clarify its intent,appellants correctly interpret rule.
reasonable monetary sanctions do not include attorney fees 
appellants contend that rule b authorizes reasonable monetary sanctions,which do not include attorney fees as sanctions.a broad construction of that phrase might include attorney fees as sanctions,while a narrow construction would not because attorney fees are not specifically authorized.in light of this ambiguity,we may consider a variety of extrinsic sources in order to identify the interpretation that best effectuates the judicial council intent.citation.citation.rossa falk construction,supra,cal th at,d.
attorney fees can not be imposed as a monetary sanction for attorney misconduct without specific statutory authorization or an agreement of the parties.bauguess,supra,cal d at,clark optical coating laboratory,th,d.rejecting the use of the court inherent supervisory authority to impose attorney fees as a monetary sanction,the bauguess court stated,it would be unnecessary and unwise to permit trial courts to use fee awards as sanctions apart from those situations authorized by statute.bauguess,supra,at.
noting that the bauguess court was concerned with the absence of procedural safeguards that permitted sanctions exceeding the fine for contempt,the court in trans action commercial investors,firmaterr,th,d trans action,addressed whether a sanction imposed under former rule,the predecessor to rule,was valid under the judicial council rulemaking authority.trans action,supra,at,d.the judicial council has authority to,among other things,adopt rules for court administration,practice and procedure,and perform other functions prescribed by statute.cal,art.vi,subd.d.these rules shall not be inconsistent with statute.ibid.the test for determining whether a rule that the judicial council has adopted exceeds statutory authority is whether the rule conflicts with any statute or legislative intent.see people hall cal th,d,in re robin cal d.a rule may be broader than the literal terms of the statute,provided it reasonably furthers the statutory purpose.trans action,supra,at,d.
former rule stated a court may order the person at fault for failure to comply with a court order,local rules,or rules of court to pay the opposing party reasonable expenses and counsel fees.trans action,supra,th at,d.because the rule of court did not have procedural safeguards or a monetary limit on sanctions,the trans action court analyzed other sanctions statutes that might have covered the offending attorney conduct for violating court orders,to determine if former rule was consistent with the legislative intent regarding attorney fee awards as sanctions for disobedience of a court order.trans action,supra,at,d.
the trans action court concluded that former rule did not conflict with any sanctions statute,but it conflict ed with the legislative intent manifested in the sanctions statutes,to the extent the rule purport ed to allow sanctions inconsistent with the limits and conditions provided in an applicable statute.trans action,supra,th at,d.when the legislature authorized courts to award attorney fees as a result of an attorney misconduct,it required finding that the conduct was in bad faith and was either frivolous or intended to cause unnecessary delay or limited recoverable fees to the amount necessary for effective deterrence,subd.d.moreover,while attorney fees are recoverable as additional punishment for contemptuous violation of a court order,the legislature limited recovery to those incurred in the contempt proceedings,subd.a.sanctions payable to the court also are limited.see.there were no such limits or procedural safeguards in former rule.trans action,supra,at,d.thus,former rule was invalid,and the sanctions imposed on an attorney for causing a mistrial could not stand.
sinomax contends that this court disregarded trans action,supra,th,d when,two years later,we decided datig dove books,th,d.they also maintain the judicial council ignored trans action,arguing that subsequent to trans action,the judicial council and the rules of court,but it did not modify the text of former rule,new rule to reflect the overbroad holding of trans action.sinomax misreads datig,and overlooks the judicial council response to trans action.
in datig dove books,supra,th,d,we recognized that the judicial council has authority to enforce its own rules.we acknowledged there was no legislative enactment that was contrary to former rule provision for an award of attorney fees as sanctions for a violation of a rule of court.datig dove books,supra,at fn,d.we did not address whether the broad authorization of attorney fees as sanctions conflicted with readily determinable statutory intent in the sanctions statutes.cases are not authority for propositions not decided.santisas goodin cal th,d.more to the point,contrary to sinomax misstatement in its brief,the judicial council rewrote former rule following the trans action decision.those amendments took effect after we decided datig.see vidrio hernandez th,d.
in response to trans action,supra,th,d,the judicial council civil and small claims advisory committee committee recommended amending former rule judicial council of,advisory com,sanctions for violations of the rules of court,advisory committee report see also vidrio hernandez,supra,th at,d.the committee proposed amendments to former rule that included authority for trial courts to award sanctions,additional procedural safeguards,and revisions that deleted as sanctions the opposing party reasonable expenses and counsel fees and replaced that phrase with reasonable monetary sanctions.advisory committee report,at.
the committee report explained that the amended rule would be similar to the sanctions provided for violations of local rules,and would contain the same procedural safeguards as the statute authorizing monetary sanctions for violations of court orders.advisory committee report,at.additionally,like section,the revised rule would authorize courts to order persons who violated a rule of court to pay to aggrieved parties their reasonable expenses,including reasonable attorney fees and costs,incurred in connection with the sanctions motion.as amended,the rule of court would not be inconsistent with any sanctions statute.advisory committee report,at.
the judicial council response to trans action clearly and unambiguously expresses its intent to rewrite former rule.the judicial council eliminated attorney fees as sanctions by replacing reasonable expenses and counsel fees in former rule with reasonable monetary sanctions.this revision eliminated a specific authorization of attorney fees as sanctions and limited attorney fees to those expenses incurred in connection with the motion for sanctions and order to show cause.see gikas zolin cal th,d,the expression of some things in a statute necessarily means the exclusion of other things not expressed.
two additional points raised in the committee report support our conclusion that the judicial council amendments eliminated attorney fees as sanctions for violating a rule of court.first,the committee intended that the amended rule would be similar to section,the sanctions statute for a violation of a local rule.section limits attorney fees to those incurred in making the sanctions motion.second,the judicial council stated the amended rule would not be inconsistent with any sanctions statute.as previously discussed,attorney fees may not be awarded as a sanction absent specific authorization or agreement of the parties.bauguess,supra,cal d at.we presume the judicial council knew the bauguess case.accordingly,the trial court here had no authority under rule b to award attorney fees as sanctions for violating a rule of court.
rule d limits attorney fees to those incurred in the proceedings seeking sanctions for violating a rule of court 
sinomax contends,however,its attorney fees incurred as a result of the rule violation are recoverable under rule d because the plain language in the rule does not limit attorney fees to those incurred in bringing the motion.rule d states,in addition to sanctions awarded under rule b,the court may order the person who violated the rule to pay reasonable expenses,including reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred in connection with the motion for sanctions or the order to show cause.the trial court,like sinomax,adopted a broad interpretation of rule d,which is contrary to the plain language in the rule of court,and also contrary to the intent of the judicial council.
rule d authorizes the court to award reasonable attorney fees incurred in connection with the motion for sanctions,not attorney fees incurred as a result of the rule violation.section,subdivision a,the contempt statute,contains similar language authorizing attorney fees incurred in connection with the contempt proceeding.w hen the legislature enacted fee sanctions as additional punishment for contemptuous violation of a court order,it did not allow the recovery of all fees resulting from the violation,but only those incurred in connection with the contempt proceeding itself,subd.a.trans action,supra,th at,d see also luckett keylee th,d.
if rule d had been intended by the judicial council to fully compensate an aggrieved party for attorney fees incurred as a result of a rule violation,rule d would not have limited recoverable attorney fees to the sanctions motion or order to show cause.sanctions statutes awarding attorney fees as a result of misconduct contain broader language than rule d.section,for example,authorizes sanctions for filing papers for an improper purpose,and states sanctions may include some or all of the reasonable attorney fees and other expenses incurred as a direct result of the violation,subd.d,italics added.the sanctions awarded under section include attorney fees incurred by another party as a result of actions or tactics that are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnec
