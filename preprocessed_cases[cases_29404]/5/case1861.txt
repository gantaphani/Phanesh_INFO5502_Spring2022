after becoming a defendant,respondent served requests for admission on appellants.the gist of the requests asked appellants to admit the accident was not related to magdaleno job.respondent further demanded that if appellants denied any of the requests for admission,appellants must answer respondent interrogatories asking for the facts supporting their denial.among the requests for admission were the following

defendant american greetings was the employer,principal,of defendant christopher magdaleno at the time this accident happened.magdaleno was within the course and scope of his employment at the time the accident happened.magdaleno was engaged in business that benefited american greetings at the time this accident happened.magdaleno was directly or indirectly supervising other american greetings employees,agents in work that directly or indirectly benefitted american greetings at the time this accident happened american greetings is liable because their enterprise creates inevitable risks as part of doing business,one of those risks inherent in or created by the enterprise is that magdaleno would have an automobile accident while driving his vehicle and conducting work either directly or indirectly on the cell phone.
respondent moved for summary judgment.the motion argued appellants had no evidence magdaleno was acting within the course and scope of his employment when he injured miller.opposing the motion,appellants asserted magdaleno lied during his deposition about taking the day off to meet an attorney and was in fact talking on his cell phone discussing work with his crew chief,esteban elizalde,when he ran into miller.in support,appellants submitted magdaleno cell phone records from the day of the accident,which showed a call to elizalde cell phone lasting as long as seconds at appellants argued it was therefore a triable issue of fact whether magdaleno was acting within the course and scope of his employment when he caused the accident.
responding to appellants assertion that magdaleno had lied about his activities before the accident,respondent submitted with its reply papers the traffic collision report from the south pasadena police department.the report stated the accident occurred at,nine minutes after magdaleno call to elizalde.respondent also submitted logs showing the operator started receiving the first of multiple calls reporting the accident at 
at the hearing on the motion for summary judgment,the court sustained respondent objection to magdaleno cell phone records as lacking authentication by the cell phone company.having dispatched with the phone records,the court bore in on the evidence about magdaleno destination before the accident.the court noted appellants had no evidence to contradict magdaleno testimony that the accident happened when he averted his gaze from the road to look down at a piece of paper on his way to meet a lawyer on a personal matter.appellants only course and scope evidence were entries which had been crossed out in magdaleno calendar showing he had been scheduled to work the day of the accident in the cities of south gate and culver city,which were in the opposite direction from magdaleno alhambra home as he headed toward pasadena.accordingly,the court found appellants had no evidence magdaleno caused the accident within the course and scope of his employment.the court therefore entered summary judgment for respondent 
respondent thereafter moved to recover its costs of proof for appellants denial of respondent requests for admission that magdaleno had not caused the accident in the course and scope of his employment.barnett penske truck leasing th,d party may recover costs of proof after summary judgment.appellants opposed the motion,arguing they had held a good faith belief they could prove magdaleno caused the accident while working.
the court granted the motion to award costs because it concluded appellants denials of the requests for admission were unreasonable.the court found appellants had no ground at all,to believe that they would prevail with proof that the defendant magdaleno was acting within the scope and course of his employment at the time of the accident.they only had the hope that they would in some way disprove magdaleno testimony that he had taken the day off from work and was on the way to visit a probate attorney.the court awarded respondent in legal fees incurred in securing summary judgment.the millers appeal from the summary judgment and the fee award.
discussion

appellants observe that magdaleno did not work in an office,but instead worked from his home and car,driving to stores to supervise installation of respondent greeting card stands and relying on his cell phone to conduct business.they contend magdaleno ran into miller while talking on his cell phone with his crew chief,elizalde.therefore,appellants conclude,resp
