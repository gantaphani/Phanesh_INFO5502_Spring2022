in,plaintiffs obtained a permanent injunction requiring that the california department of health services dhs provide certain restricted benefits to undocumented aliens.a judgment incorporating the injunction major elements became final in,following dhs appeal.in and,dhs moved unsuccessfully for orders dissolving or modifying portions of the injunction.in,plaintiffs applied for and were awarded attorney fees and expenses under the private attorney general statute for successfully defending the permanent injunction.dhs challenges the award,contending that plaintiffs fee motion was untimely under california rules of court,rule.we find the rule inapplicable in the special circumstances of this case,and affirm the trial court order awarding fees.
background 
plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in march.the lawsuit challenged the state process for determining the eligibility of undocumented aliens for certain restricted benefits they may receive under the program.eventually,plaintiffs were granted a preliminary injunction preventing dhs from denying coverage under to undocumented aliens needing care or dialysis and requiring aliens applying for benefits to disclose certain information concerning their immigration status or that of other family or household members.the early history of the litigation is described in crespin kizer d,in which this court affirmed the preliminary injunction.id.at.
on remand following the decision in crespin kizer,the trial court granted plaintiffs a permanent injunction preventing dhs from denying program coverage to undocumented aliens for care and dialysis.in february,the trial court entered judgment on the permanent injunction.the judgment was affirmed in substantial part in crespin coye th,d.plaintiffs never sought attorney fees in connection with any of the litigation that occurred from through.
in march,dhs moved to dissolve or modify portions of the permanent injunction,arguing that under federal welfare legislation,undocumented aliens in california would not be eligible for care and dialysis benefits unless california reenacted a state statute permitting such benefits.judge richard hodge heard the motion in may,but postponed a decision pending the outcome of proposed state legislation that might make it moot.dhs renewed its motion in march.in august,judge hodge denied the motion after oral argument,and dhs appealed.while the matter was pending on appeal,the legislature enacted welfare and institutions code section,which reauthorized care and dialysis benefits for undocumented aliens.due to the legislature action,the parties stipulated to the dismissal of dhs appeal in september.a remittitur was issued in november.
the newly enacted statute,section,provided that aliens receiving care services as of the effective date of the statute would continue to receive those services,but that applicants after that date shall be eligible to receive care services to the extent that funding is made available for this purpose in the annual budget act.welf,subds.a b.in february,dhs filed a new motion to modify the permanent injunction on the ground that its language should reflect the limitation on the eligibility of new applicants contained in the new statute so that dhs would not be placed under potentially conflicting legal obligations.in april,judge hodge denied the motion without prejudice,finding that judicial intervention was not required at that time.dhs filed no appeal from the ruling.
there were no further proceedings in the case until october,when plaintiffs counsel initiated settlement discussions with dhs over plaintiffs entitlement to an award of attorney fees for successfully defending against dhs postjudgment motions to modify the preliminary injunction.after settlement discussions failed,plaintiffs filed a motion for fees and expenses on may.the motion covered time spent and expenses incurred beginning in and continuing through the prosecution of the fee motion itself.
rejecting dhs contention that the fee motion was untimely under california rules of court,rule the trial court awarded plaintiffs in attorney fees and expenses.this appeal followed.
discussion 
plaintiffs fee motion was not untimely under rule rule does not address postjudgment fees 
the primary issue in this case is whether california rules of court,rule sets a time limit for seeking attorney fees under code of civil procedure section for fees incurred in successfully litigating postjudgment motions in the trial court.there appears to be no dispute that plaintiffs attorney fee claims satisfied the substantive requirements of section and plaintiffs fee motion was untimely under rule b,if the time limit determined under that subdivision applies to motions to obtain statutory fees for postjudgment trial court litigation over the modification of a permanent injunction.
rule reads in pertinent part as follows a applicability except as otherwise provided by statute,this rule applies in civil cases to claims for statutory attorney fees and claims for attorney fees provided for in a contract.subdivisions b and c apply when the court determines entitlement to the fees,the amount of the fees,or both,whether the court makes that determination because the statute or contract refers to reasonable fees,because it requires a determination of the prevailing party,or for other reasons.b attorney fees before trial court judgment a notice of motion to claim attorney fees for services up to and including the rendition of judgment in the trial attorney fees on an appeal before the rendition of judgment in the trial be served and filed within the time for filing a notice of appeal under rules and.c attorney fees on appeal a notice of motion to claim attorney fees on than the attorney fees on appeal claimed under subdivision b under a statute or contract requiring the court to determine entitlement to the fees,the amount of the fees,or both,shall be served and filed within the time for serving and filing the memorandum of costs under rule d 
dhs would have us analyze the intended scope of rule as follows the word judgment in subdivision b unambiguously includes any appealable order,whether entered before or after judgment this flows from the fact that the subdivision references rules and,and from the definition of judgment found in rule.rule a states that a notice of appeal must be filed on or before the earliest of days after the notice of entry of judgment is served or days after entry of judgment.subdivision f of rule specifies that as used in subdivision a,judgment includes an appealable order if the appeal is from an appealable order.rule,addressing trial court motions that extend the time to appeal,also applies by its express terms to appeals from appealable orders as well as judgments.further,the definitions section of the appellate rules of court,rule,provides that i n these rules,unless the context or subject matter otherwise requires j udgment includes any judgment,order or decree from which an appeal lies.rule g.based on the reference to rules and in rule,and the definition of judgment found in rule,dhs argues that the deadline set by rule b unambiguously applies to any motion to obtain statutory fees for trial court activities regardless of whether the legal services for which fees are sought resulted in a judgment or an appealable order.and,in the case of an appealable order,dhs contends the subdivision applies regardless of whether the services were rendered before or after a final judgment.
dhs has also requested that we take judicial notice of documents contained in the files of the administrative office of the courts aoc reflecting the drafting history of rule.we have done so.according to dhs,these documents confirm its interpretation that judgment encompasses all appealable orders and that the rule,as reenacted effective january,was intended to set time limits for bringing any motion for statutory attorney fees,whether the motion pertained to activities taking place before or after the original judgment became final 
as discussed in detail below,our own analysis of the text and drafting history of rule fails to support dhs interpretation.in our view,the rule was not intended to govern the time for bringing motions for fees arising from,judgment activities,such as litigation over modifications to a permanent injunction.the rule drafters either did not consider such postjudgment fee motions or decided not to address them in the rule.
the usual rules of statutory construction are applicable to the interpretation of the california rules of court.volkswagen of america,superior court th,d.our objective is to determine the drafters intent using the words of the rule as our starting point.kahn lasorda dugout,th,d.if the language of the rule is clear and unambiguous,it is unnecessary to probe the rule drafting history in order to ascertain its meaning.ibid.if possible,we attribute significance to every word,phrase,sentence and part of a court rule.lammers superior court th,d.we accord a challenged rule a reasonable and commonsense interpretation consistent with its apparent purpose,practical rather than technical in nature,which upon application will result in wise policy rather than mischief or absurdity.ibid.
we note first of all that the term appealable order does not appear in rule.it is true that subdivision b of rule makes reference to other and do define the word judgment to include appealable orders under certain circumstances.but that reference,by its express terms,merely borrows the time limits for filing a notice of appeal set forth in rules and.it does not purport to incorporate any of the special definitions rules and employ.those definitions are specific to the subject matter of rules and setting a readily determinable time limit for filing a notice of appeal.it makes perfect sense in that context to have a single time limit applicable to both judgments and appealable orders.in fact,rule f states expressly that its definition of judgment to include an appealable order only applies if the appeal is from an appealable order rather than a judgment.rule addresses an entirely different subject setting a time limit for seeking attorney fees.for that purpose,there is no obvious reason to impose the same time limit for bringing fee motions after entry of appealable orders and judgments.if anything,as further discussed below,such an equation would promote piecemeal litigation over fees,which the drafters of rule wanted to avoid.
rule also does not advance dhs position.rule appears in the context of appellate rules.almost all of its definitions refer specifically to appellate procedures and terminology.rule makes no reference to rule.if anything,the fact that rules and contain special definitions of the word judgment merely confirms that,outside of the rules of appellate procedure,an appealable order is something entirely different than a judgment.precisely because rule is not a rule of appellate procedure,one would have expected its drafters to state explicitly that the time limits established under it would apply to appealable orders as well as judgments,if that is in fact what they intended.courts,counsel,and litigants are entitled to rely on the plain language of a rule of court.commercial investors,firmaterr,th,d.they should not have to go through the convoluted analysis that dhs resorts to in order to determine when a rule applies.
an intent to borrow rule special definition of judgment is therefore anything but clear or unambiguous in the text of rule.at dhs request,we have also examined the rule drafting history for evidence of such an intent.no document of which we have been asked to take judicial notice refers to the special definition of judgment found in rules and.we have found no sign in the drafting history of rule that the effect of incorporating or not incorporating that specific definition into the rule by reference was ever considered or discussed.
dhs interpretation of the rule is also not practical or consistent with wise policy.reasonably construed,subdivision b permits a public interest litigant to file a single fee motion covering all services rendered in litigating the case to a judgment in the trial court.it does so by setting a time limit for bringing a fee motion for services up to and including the rendition of judgment in the trial court.rule b,italics added.dhs interpretation focuses narrowly on the word judgment and entirely ignores the italicized words that immediately precede it.giving effect to the entire phrase,dhs construction of the word judgment in rule leads to an absurdity.each time an appealable order was entered,the public interest plaintiff would be compelled to promptly apply for fees for all services up to and including the rendition of the appealable order.such a reading would compel premature and piecemeal litigation over fees.for example,absent a stipulation between the parties or a court order,public interest litigants would have to file protective fee motions under code of civil procedure section before the court could even determine which side had been successful in the litigation or whether the litigation had resulted in the enforcement of a public right.a plaintiff who guessed wrong as to which prejudgment orders were appealable,would lose the right to recover for the time spent in litigating them.in addition,the fee applicant would have to claim fees not only for services resulting in the appealable order but also for all unrelated services that occurred before its rendition.at least as applied to prejudgment appealable orders,dhs interpretation of the rule does not seem sensible,practical,or consistent with either the language of the rule or the dictates of wise policy.
to prevail in this fee litigation,dhs must also show that rule applies equally to postjudgment and prejudgment appealable orders.in our view,the text and drafting history of the rule show that it was never intended to cover services rendered on trial court matters arising after final judgment.in construing a statute,it is well established that section headings may properly be considered in determining intent,and are entitled to considerable weight.people hull cal th,d.dhs interpretation directly conflicts with the heading of subdivision b.that heading reads attorney fees before trial court judgment.italics added.dhs fails to explain why a provision it claims was intended to cover postjudgment as well as prejudgment fee claims carries a heading negating such an intent.the drafting history of that language in fact confirms that rule was not intended to address postjudgment appealable orders such as those at issue in this case.
an early draft of subdivision b of rule circulated for comment in june read in pertinent part as follows b prejudgment attorney fees a notice of motion to claim statutory prejudgment attorney fees shall be served and filed before or at the same time the memorandum of costs is served and filed one of the comments received on that draft,as summarized by aoc staff,was that it is misleading to call fees prejudgment when they cover the period down to judgment and that such term should be reserved for interim fees before judgment.as discussed below,the rendition of judgment language in the current rule appears to have been drafted to address this concern.
in october,the board of governors of the state bar wrote to the aoc reporting that the proposed rule had generated substantial comment from the bar standing committees on appellate courts and on administration of justice,as well as from the bar environmental law,legal services,and litigation sections.based on that extensive input from practitioners,the board proposed that the time for filing a claim for prejudgment fees be extended until days after service of notice of entry of a judgment or dismissal.the letter repeatedly referred to proposed rule as covering claims for prejudgment fees.there is no suggestion in it that the board of any of the state bar members whose comments it had taken into the rule as covering anything other than prejudgment fees,or that it viewed the word judgment as encompassing appealable orders.
later in october of,after noting the comments just discussed,among others,aoc staff proposed a revised version of the rule which included the following new heading and language for sub
