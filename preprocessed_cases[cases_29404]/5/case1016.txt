on september,rbca filed a citizen enforcement suit alleging that the city of seward the city was discharging toxic pollutants from the seward small boat harbor small boat harbor and a boat repair yard,the seward marine industrial center smic,into resurrection bay in violation of the cwa,et rbca sought a declaration that the city had violated and was violating the cwa by discharging pollutants without a national pollution discharge elimination system npdes permit from both the small boat harbor and the smic temporary and permanent injunctions prohibiting the city from discharging pollutants from its facilities without an npdes permit,temporary and permanent injunctions requiring the city to restore waters damaged by its illegal discharges of pollutants,civil penalties for the violations,and an award of rbca fees and costs as authorized by the cwa.rbca request for civil penalties included per day per violation for violations occurring between april,and march,and per day per violation for violations occurring after march.
on june,rbca and the city filed for summary judgment.the district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of rbca and denied the city motion for summary judgment.it held that,for purposes of the cwa,the city is an operator of industrial facilities that discharges stormwater into waters of the united states.
accordingly,it is required to apply for an npdes permit.the district court ordered the city to apply for an npdes permit for both the small boat harbor and the smic.the district court declined,however,to award civil penalties for violations of the cwa,and directed each party to bear its own fees and costs.
rbca filed a motion to amend the judgment.it challenged the denial of civil penalties and the refusal to award fees and costs.the city filed a motion to amend findings,in which it requested that the district court correct or amend its finding that vessel repair and maintenance activities occur at the small boat harbor facility.the district court granted rbca motion in part,noting that it had erred in failing to assess any civil penalty after concluding that an npdes permit was required.the district court assessed a nominal civil penalty of,but declined to permit briefing on the issue of an award of litigation costs.in the same order,the district court denied the city motion to amend findings,explaining that the evidence at summary judgment referred to both the smic and the small boat harbor.
the parties filed cross appeals to this court.while the were pending,the epa issued a letter dated september,stating that,on may,the epa had inspected the small boat harbor and did not observe any industrial activity at the site.the epa concluded that the city need not obtain an npdes permit for the small boat harbor.
on october,this court issued a memorandum disposition in which it remanded this matter to the district court with instructions to determine whether rbca is a prevailing party and,if so,whether an award of attorney fees is appropriate under saint john organic farm gem county mosquito abatement district,cir and whether to vacate its summary judgment ruling with respect to the permit requirement for the small boat harbor.resurrection bay conservation alliance city of seward,app x,cir unpublished.
in an order dated april,the district court acknowledged the epa determination that an npdes permit was not required for the small boat harbor and vacated that portion of its order.additionally,the district court concluded that rbca was a prevailing party because,although the epa declined to issue a permit for the small boat harbor,the district court had ordered the city to apply for a permit for both locations and to pay a nominal civil penalty.the district court concluded,however,that an award of fees would be unjust because special circumstances existed,explaining 
previously,this court found that although there was a legal basis for rbca claim,and the court ultimately ordered the city to apply for an npdes permit,the court declined to grant in full the relief sought by plaintiffs.the city successfully avoided potential liability exceeding million,and because the city had no clear reason to believe it must apply for an npdes permit,the court could not conclude that it would be appropriate to assess the costs requested.
while saint john did not define special circumstances,it did note that a defendant good faith belief that it was following the law does not qualify as a special circumstance.at.however,the court still concludes that special circumstances exist in this matter.specifically,despite the court findings and a judgment requiring the city to seek a permit from the epa,the epa ultimately declined to issue a permit for one of two locations,thus casting doubt on the court reasoning in its prior order.at best,rbca prevailed on only a small portion of their case.
furthermore,as the court reasoned previously,there was a lack of evidence of actual pollution and a lack of evidence of an economic benefit by the city.as detailed in the opposition to the motion for attorney fees at docket,rbca sought relief that was not granted by the court.ultimately,the city has not changed any behavior that existed prior to the lawsuit.all that was accomplished was the application for and issuance of one permit to allow activities that were legitimately taking place.finally,the court notes that if the epa had issued an advisory opinion when the city originally requested it,this litigation could have been avoided completely.
the court accordingly finds that this case has unique and special circumstances and an award of attorney fees in these circumstances would be unjust.

rbca asks this court to hold that the district court erred in denying it an award of attorney fees,vacate the portions of the district court judgment and subsequent orders that decline to award fees,and award reasonable attorney fees in this case.the city counters that the district court set forth myriad factual findings that,viewed together,support its decision that special circumstances preclude an award of attorney fees in this case.
