message,posted by exampex,read in part well,let me tell you something.i was an employee with inextv for a while.guess what they did market research after we launched the websites,not before.they spent millions before they even looked for a market.then the geniuses got about people in a room and asked questions like,how would you like to see exciting videos on your computer that will help you make millions of dollars and become fabulously famous i just wonder how the crooks fooled everyone for so long.the websites rarely worked.the content was so boring and stale that no one even noticed we existed.the production values sucked because the equipment was cheap my son has better tv equipment at his high school and the majority of the production staff were interns all in all,it was the most miserable,sleazy,cheap operation i have ever worked for the production department bought studio equipment that could be used because it was bought on the gray market somewhere and all the operating manuals were in french,for crying out loud no one could read them during a shoot one day,the vp of programming stole a razor scooter from the company who was marketing the toy he has triplets and tried to steal cheap is that.

procedural history 
respondents bramson and ampex filed a libel suit against doe aka exampex on in california.the gist of the complaint was that exampex posted defamatory messages about ampex on the message board for that company.cargle filed a section motion,coupled with a request for attorney fees and costs.
upon learning cargle identity in the proceedings,respondents dismissed their complaint.at the subsequent hearing on the motion to strike and for attorney fees,the court ruled that the voluntary dismissal aborted its jurisdiction to consider the motion.thus the court made no determination as to whether cargle was the prevailing party entitled to section attorney fees.cargle appealed the order and we reversed.on remand,the trial court denied cargle motion to strike and for attorney fees,determining that had the lawsuit not been dismissed,it would have denied the motion on the merits even assuming,arguendo,that defendant challenged statements were made in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest within the scope and meaning of section e,plaintiffs have demonstrated a probability they will prevail on their claims sufficient to defeat the motion to strike plaintiffs have established each element of libel per se.plaintiffs are not required to show actual damages as there is evidence from which constitutional malice may reasonably be inferred.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
introduction burdens of proof 
section applies to causes of action arising from an act in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the federal or state constitution in connection with a public issue,subd.b.such acts include any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest,subd.e.claims based on these acts are subject to a special motion to strike unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability of prevailing on the merits,subd.b.we construe section broadly in order to encourage participation in matters of public significance,subd.a.
section thus invites a analysis first,did the challenged cause of action arise from protected activity within the meaning of the statute the moving defendant bears this threshold burden.second,if the defendant makes the threshold showing,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to make a prima facie showing of facts which,if credited by the trier of fact,would sustain a favorable judgment.computerxpress,jackson th,d.in opposing an motion,the plaintiff can not rely on allegations in the complaint,but must bring forth evidence that would be admissible at trial.hms capital,lawyers title th,d.we do not weigh credibility or evaluate the weight of the evidence.rather,we accept as true the evidence favorable to the plaintiff and assess the defendant evidence only to determine if it has defeated plaintiff submission as a matter of law.ibid.
cargle has met his burden 
when cargle decided in august to join the conversation about the fortunes of ampex,he did so by posting messages on the message board for ampex.the question here is whether such postings were made in a public forum,traditionally defined as a place that is open to the public where information is freely exchanged.computerxpress,jackson,supra,th at,d.the term public forum includes forms of public communication other than those occurring in a physical setting.thus the electronic communication media may constitute public forums.web sites that are accessible free of charge to any member of the public where members of the public may read the views and information posted,and post their own opinions,meet the definition of a public forum for purposes of section.computerxpress,jackson,supra,at,d.thus the message board maintained for ampex was a public forum.
but were cargle postings made in connection with a matter of public interest contrary to ampex assertions,they were.courts have held that internet postings about corporate activity constitute an issue of public importance upon considering the following pertinent factors whether the company is publicly traded the number of investors and whether the company has promoted itself by means of numerous press releases.see global telemedia,doe d,computerxpress,jackson,supra,th at,d.
