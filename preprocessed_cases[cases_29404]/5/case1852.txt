introduction 
after fire destroyed an office building known as the olivewood medical arts center,the four owners of the building contracted with a builder interiors,to rebuild the basic structure or shell of the building.the contract called for five separate installment payments or draws of percent of the contract price approximately each plus a retention of percent to be paid days after completion of the project.when the owners failed to pay the third draw after the builder claimed it was due,the builder walked off the job.the owners eventually hired someone else to finish the project.one of the four owners,omer brawley,sued the builder for lost rents brawley contended he would have earned if the project had been completed by the deadline set forth in the contract.the builder sued the owners and their owners association for nonpayment of the third draw.three of the owners and the association paid a settlement to the builder.brawley suit against the builder,and the builder suit now only against the fourth owner,brawley went to trial.
the trial included detailed testimony and documentary evidence of the progress and occasional setbacks of the construction project,of the owners dealings with the builder,and of the owners squabbles with each other.the results of the trial were perhaps best described by brawley counsel,chartrand,who stated at a hearing the jury socked it to both sides here.the jury found that both sides breached the contract.the jury awarded brawley in damages for breach,and awarded for brawley breach the court offset brawley obligation to with the settlement received by from the other three owners and the association,thus reducing brawley obligation to to zero.the court entered judgment for brawley in the amount of.
the court found to be the prevailing party under code of civil procedure section and awarded costs to in the amount of.the court denied motion for attorney fees and refused to add any prejudgment interest to recovery of zero.
in the published portions of our opinion,we address issues pertaining to code of civil procedure section and civil code section.
code of civil procedure section provides in pertinent part that when some of the on a contract settle with a plaintiff in good faith before verdict or judgment and obtain a release,the release shall reduce the claims against the others in the amount of the consideration paid for it.code civ,subd.a.how does a court determine the value of the claims against the others,the value of the plaintiff claims against the when the others also sue the plaintiff for breach of the same contract and the jury finds that both sides breached the contract and both sides were damaged in the case before us,the only obligor or other was brawley.the court valued claim against brawley at,then reduced this claim to zero by virtue of the settlement received by from brawley,then entered judgment for brawley in the amount of his damages caused by breach.we hold in part i of our opinion,however,that the value of a plaintiff claims against the others is the amount the plaintiff would have recovered in a judgment against the others if there had been no settlement prior to the verdict or judgment.thus the court should have valued claim at minus,reduced this to zero,and entered a judgment awarding no damages to either side.
subdivision g of civil code section allows a court to award attorney fees to a prevailing party in an action brought under circumstances specified in the statute.in part iii of our opinion we hold that this statute,like similar statutes,gives the court discretion to determine whether there is a prevailing party for purposes of an award of attorney fees.
the appeals and the parties contentions 
presently before us are four appeals.both brawley and have appealed from the judgment.this is case no.in case no,appeals from the trial court postjudgment order denying request for attorney fees,and brawley appeals from what he describes as a order awarding interiors in prejudgment interest,even though the court in fact awarded no prejudgment interest to interiors.
the appeals from the judgment 
brawley contends in his appeal that the court erred in finding to be the prevailing party for purposes of the award of costs to.he also contends that the court erred in a prejudgment ruling finding the settlement between the three other owners and have been made in good faith.this contention too is in that although the court finding of a good faith settlement served to cut off certain rights of brawley to seek indemnity from the other owners code civ,there is nothing to indemnify because obtained no monetary judgment against brawley.furthermore,credit for the settlement turned what would have been a judgment in favor of and against brawley in damages for brawley breach minus in brawley damages for breach into a judgment in favor of brawley and against 
contends in its appeal from the judgment that the court erred in awarding brawley the judgment.contends that the court should have offset in damages with brawley in damages,leaving with a net award of,which then should have been reduced to zero due to credit for the settlement.under calculation,the correct judgment would have awarded nothing to and nothing to brawley.
the appeals from the postjudgment order 
the court judgment included a determination that is the prevailing party pursuant to california code of civil procedure section.a later,postjudgment order fixed the amount of costs awarded to at.the same postjudgment order also denied request for prejudgment interest and motion for attorney fees.
as aforementioned,appeal from the postjudgment order contends that the court erred in refusing to award any attorney fees.brawley appeal from the postjudgment order contends that the court erred in awarding interiors in interest even though the court did not in fact award any prejudgment interest.
in part i of this opinion we will address appeal from the judgment.in part ii we will address brawley appeal from the judgment.in part iii we will address appeal from the postjudgment order denying attorney fees.in part iv we will address brawley appeal from the postjudgment order.as we shall explain in part i,we agree with that the trial court erred in entering the judgment for brawley.the court should have offset brawley in damages caused by with in damages caused by brawley.the judgment therefore should have awarded brawley zero,not.we find the remaining contentions made by both parties addressed in parts ii,iii iv to be without merit.on appeal no.we will remand the matter to the trial court and direct that court to amend the judgment so that it awards each party zero.the trial court may also reconsider whether it wishes to make an award of costs to one of the parties.on appeal no.we will affirm the court postjudgment order denying motion for attorney fees.
appeal from the judgment 
after the jury determined that brawley breach caused in unmitigable damages to,and that breach caused in damages to brawley,the court gave brawley credit for the settlement paid to by brawley former codefendants.the court determined that brawley therefore owed nothing,and it then entered judgment in favor of brawley for.contends that the court erred in that the court should have offset in unmitigable damages caused by brawley with brawley in damages caused by,should have viewed the net result of the jury verdict to be that brawley owed,minus,should have given brawley settlement credit for the net amount of he otherwise would have been obligated to pay to,thereby reducing brawley obligation to to zero,and should have entered a judgment awarding nothing to either party.we agree with 
both sides rely on the language of code of civil procedure section itself,which states that a settlement made in good faith by one shall reduce the claims against the others in the amount stipulated by the release,the dismissal or the covenant,or in the amount of the consideration paid for it whichever is the greater.code civ,subd.a.brawley contends,and the trial judge apparently agreed,that the value of claim against brawley was in unmitigable damages.the jury verdict,however,determined the actual
