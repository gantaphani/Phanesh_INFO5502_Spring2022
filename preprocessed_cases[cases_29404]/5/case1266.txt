this suit concerns the city response to the summer of mercy renewal,plaintiffs planned protests in july,which commemorated the anniversary of similar protests in.plaintiffs donna lippoldt,osa,and philip benham challenge the city denial of their parade permits and the municipal court bond order.osa is an unincorporated association consisting of a group of volunteers who oppose abortion.benham is osa director,and lippoldt volunteers for.the named defendants include the city,as well as stephen cole,deputy chief of police for the city,and elizabeth harlenske,an assistant city attorney.
denial of osa application for parade permits 
as part of the summer of mercy renewal,on july,lippoldt applied for eleven parade permits on osa behalf.lippoldt requested permits for two parades per day from july,through july,with a proposed route that included bleckley street and east kellogg drive,where george tiller abortion clinic is located lippoldt requested an additional parade permit for a parade in the downtown area.
under the city parade ordinance,the city treasurer shall issue a parade permit,unless one of six enumerated exceptions applies.wichita city code emphasis added.the parties agree that none of the exceptions listed in section provide grounds for denying plaintiffs parade permits.
deputy chief of police cole reviewed plaintiffs parade applications.cole explained,it was my belief that the situation that we were dealing with out there warranted a denial,and i asked the law department for an opinion on that and for assistance.app.vol.iv,at.assistant city attorney harlenske researched the law regarding applications for parade permits and drafted a letter denying plaintiffs applications.after the city attorney revised it,harlenske read the final version of the letter aloud to the police chief over the phone.with the police chief approval,cole signed the denial letter in his name on behalf of the police chief.cole did not suggest any alternative to plaintiffs for accommodating the parades for a shorter period of time at the bleckley street location because that location was not an acceptable location.app.vol.iv,at.
on july,one day before the city issued its decision on the plaintiffs parade applications,the police chief signed a temporary regulation closing bleckley street to all vehicles,except those of residents or people conducting business in the area.the city closed bleckley street as part of a plan known as operation safe protest,which the city had developed specifically in anticipation of the summer of mercy renewal.
on july,the city issued one parade permit to osa for a downtown parade,but denied osa ten applications for parade permits near tiller clinic.defendants denied plaintiffs parade applications for two reasons bleckley street was closed and the parades would interfere with local businesses in violation of wichita city code.defendants claimed that once bleckley street was closed,it was no longer a street that fell within the parade ordinance.as to interference with businesses,harlenske acknowledged that the parade ordinance did not allow the city to deny a parade permit merely because the planned parade would interfere with business.see wichita city code.deputy chief cole has approved other parades,knowing that the parades would interfere with local businesses.
municipal court bond order 
plaintiffs also challenge a municipal court bond order.the bond order was effective from july,through july,during the summer of mercy renewal.the municipal court order set bond amounts for specific offenses,including assault,battery,disorderly conduct,unlawful assembly,or rioting near tiller clinic.the order set different bond amounts for first arrests and subsequent arrests,and for residents and of sedgwick county where wichita,kansas is located.
procedural history 
on july,plaintiffs filed suit against the city,deputy chief cole,and assistant city attorney harlenske pursuant to and,alleging violations of the first and fourteenth amendments of the united states constitution and state constitutional claims.in their complaint,plaintiffs requested declaratory relief,compensatory damages,injunctive relief,and attorney fees.
on july,the district court granted plaintiffs request for a temporary restraining order so that plaintiffs could hold parades during the summer of mercy renewal.plaintiffs held parades from july,through july,in downtown and along the bleckley street route past tiller clinic.
after the parades were held,the parties pursued discovery and filed various motions.on may,the district court granted in part and denied in part defendants motion for summary judgment.specifically,the district court determined that osa,as an unincorporated association,was a person under and,therefore,was entitled to seek relief under the same.the district court further held that plaintiffs had standing to challenge the parade ordinance,which it held to be constitutional on its face,but lacked standing to challenge the municipal court bond order.the district court also dismissed the city as a party to the litigation based upon plaintiffs failure to present evidence that the city had a permanent and practice of denying parade permits.
thereafter,the district court held a bench trial on may,to resolve plaintiffs remaining claims.ultimately,the district court concluded that defendants had no basis for denying plaintiffs parade applications under the city parade ordinance.the district court also concluded that defendants harlenske and cole violated plaintiffs constitutional rights,but it denied plaintiffs requests for compensatory damages and a permanent injunction.the district court awarded nominal damages to plaintiffs in the amount of.
in considering plaintiffs motion for attorney fees,the district court granted the motion in part and denied it in part.specifically,the district court found that plaintiffs had prevailed in the first part of the litigation when the court issued the temporary restraining order on july,but that they had only formally prevailed at trial.the district court awarded attorney fees only for hours expended to obtain the temporary restraining order,and it also reduced counsels requested rate.

unincorporated association as a section plaintiff 
in their,defendants claim that osa,as an unincorporated association,is not a person under.we agree.
as an initial matter,we note that,notwithstanding plaintiffs arguments to the contrary,this is a matter of first impression.none of our cases specifically address whether an unincorporated association is a person for the purposes of section.likewise,the cases cited by the district court and plaintiffs simply permit,with little or no analysis,unincorporated associations to bring suit under section.consequently,such cases have limited bearing on our analysis.
we review issues of statutory interpretation de novo,hill smithkline beecham,cir,and begin with the language of the statute itself,united states of treasury fabe,d.in relevant part,states 
every person who,under color of any statute,ordinance,regulation,custom,or usage,of any state subjects,or causes to be subjected,any citizen of the united states or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws,shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law,suit in equity,or other proper proceeding for redress 
emphasis added.osa,therefore,can only be a section plaintiff if it is a person within the jurisdiction of the united states.
while section itself is silent as to this issue,the supreme court,beginning with monell new york city department of social services,d,has had a number of occasions to consider whether a particular entity is a person under section.see,monell,at.holding that municipalities are subject to suit as persons under section will michigan of state police,d holding that a state is not a person amenable to suit under section ngiraingas sanchez,d holding that neither the territory of guam nor an officer thereof acting in his official capacity is a person under section inyo county,cal.indians of the bishop colony,d holding that a tribe is not a person who may sue under section to vindicate its rights as a sovereign.consequently,we are not without guidance in this area.
to determine whether an entity constitutes a person within the meaning of,we examine the statute language and purpose,ngiraingas,at,while keeping in mind the legislative environment in which the word person appears,inyo county,at.citations omitted.essentially,this requires that we seek an indicia of congressional intent at the time the statute was enacted.ngiraingas,at.in monell,the supreme court considered three factors in holding that congress intended that municipalities be considered persons potentially liable under section legislative history,the general treatment of corporations in,and the act of,stat.the dictionary act of.see monell,at.see also ngiraingas,at.characterizing monell as turning on the legislative history,the general treatment of corporations including municipal corporations and on the version of the dictionary act.
although monell dealt only with municipal liability under section,we have relied upon it to conclude that a municipality may also bring suit under section.rural water dist,ellsworth county,city of wilson,cir i n light of monell,it would be a strained analysis to hold,as a matter of statutory construction,that a municipal corporation was a person within one clause of section,but not a person within another clause of the same statute.quoting south macomb disposal auth.township of washington,cir.while there is no per se rule of statutory interpretation that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning,there is a presumption that this is so.see united states cleveland indians baseball,d.as such,monell also guides our determination of whether an unincorporated association is a person and,thus,a proper claimant under section.
in light of monell and its progeny,therefore,we consider the legislative history of section,the general understanding,as of,regarding the legal personality of unincorporated associations,and the dictionary act of.first,there is no indication within the legislative history of section that congress considered the term persons to include unincorporated associations.rather,the history cited in monell illustrates that municipalities,unlike unincorporated associations,were targeted as entities to whom section of the civil rights act,and therefore section,applied.see monell,at.representative bingham further remarks clearly indicate his view that takings by cities would be redressable under of the bill.in fact,comments made by several members of congress indicate a restricted view of who could qualify as a proper section plaintiff.see monell,at.section provides a civil remedy to all people where,under color of state law,they or any of them may be deprived of rights to which they are entitled under the constitution by reason and virtue of their national citizenship.emphasis added quoting cong.globe,app.id.at.representative bingham,the author of of the fourteenth amendment declared the bill purpose to be the enforcement of the constitution on behalf of every individual citizen of the republic to the extent of the rights guarantied to him by the constitution.emphasis added quoting cong.globe,app.
next,there was no general understanding in,when the precursor to section was passed,that unincorporated associations should be treated as natural persons.instead,the common law essentially held that unincorporated associations lacked the capacity to sue or be sued.see united mine workers of am.coronado coal.undoubtedly at common law an unincorporated association of persons could only sue or be sued in the names of its members,and their liability had to be enforced against each member.see also moffat tunnel league united states.these unincorporated association plaintiffs are not corporations,quasi corporations,or organized pursuant to,or recognized by,any law.neither is a person in law,and,unless authorized by statute,they have no capacity to sue.will,at.i n enacting,congress did not intend to override immunities or defenses under the common law.one important assumption underlying the court decisions in this area is that members of the congress were familiar with principles and that they likely intended these principles to remain,absent specific provisions to the contrary.citations omitted.
thus,unlike corporations,it was not,when section of the civil rights act was enacted,that unincorporated associations should be treated as natural persons.see,united states amedy,wheat.that corporations are,in law,for civil purposes,deemed persons,is unquestionable.louisville,letson,how.a corporation created by and doing business in a particular state,is to be deemed to all intents and purposes as a person,capable of being treated as a citizen of that state,as much as a natural person.monell,at.quoting the statement of a sponsor of section that counties,cities,and corporations of all sorts have become thoroughly established to be an individual or person or entity of the personal existence,of which the united states constitution does take note and endow with faculty to sue and be sued in the courts of the united states emphasis added.in fact,unincorporated associations lacked the capacity to bring suit when section of the civil rights act was enacted.
last,the language of the dictionary act of also shows that unincorporated associations were not intended to be persons for section purposes.as the supreme court has previously noted,the dictionary act of,as it read when section of the civil rights act was enacted,stated that in all acts hereafter passed the word person may extend and be applied to bodies politic and corporate.will,at.citations omitted.the supreme court has further observed that an examination of the authorities of the era suggests that the phrase bodies politic and corporate was used to mean corporations,both private and public municipal.id.at.emphasis added.because an unincorporated association is,by definition,not a corporation,it is therefore also not a body politic or corporate.thus,while the dictionary act of extended the meaning of person to include corporations and municipalities,it did not do the same for unincorporated associations.
we do not read the current enactment of the dictionary act in to require a contrary result.that text clearly states,and has since,see,stat,that the word person include s corporations,companies,associations,firms,partnerships,societies,and joint stock companies,as well as individuals,emphasis added.nonetheless,the current text of the dictionary act does not control,because,beginning with monell,in each instance where the supreme court has addressed whether a particular entity is a person for the purposes of suing or being sued under section,it has principally considered the dictionary act of.see,monell,at.noting that the usual meaning of the word person would extend to municipal corporations is also evidenced by the dictionary act of which had been passed only months before the civil rights act was passed will,at.noting that the dictionary act of did not counsel a contrary conclusion that a state was not a person amenable to suit under section and focusing on deciphering congressional intent as to the scope of ngiraingas,at.noting that w e seek indicia of congressional intent at the time the statute was enacted and that a review of history uncovers no sign that congress was thinking of territories when it enacted the statute over a century ago in inyo county,at.the dictionary act of,which was passed just two months before and was designed to supply rules of construction for all legislation,provided that the word person may extend and be applied to bodies politic and corporate.in other words,in attempting to discern the meaning of person as used in section,we look not to how the words are defined now,but rather at how they were defined at the time the statute was enacted.
this approach is also consistent with the supreme court general use of the dictionary act as a tool of statutory construction.see,rowland california men colony,unit ii men advisory,d using expanded definition of person from the version of the dictionary act in addressing whether an association is a person for the purposes of,because the former was enacted prior to the latter united states v.a p trucking,d it is significant that the definition of whoever in was first enacted into law as part of the very same statute which enacted into positive law the revised criminal code.the connection between and the criminal code,which includes the statute at issue,is thus more than a token one,the very same statute which creates the crime admonishing whoever is to be liberally interpreted.additionally,at least one other circuit has held that the current version of the dictionary act only applies prospectively.see yousuf samantar,holding that the current definition of person in the dictionary act does not apply to a rule promulgated before the current version of the act was passed.as the expanded definition of person in the current text of was added more than seventy years after the enactment of section of the civil rights act,it is not an indicia of congress intent to deem an unincorporated association a person under section.in sum,none of the aforementioned factors,legislative history,general understanding,or the dictionary act of,suggest congress intent to entitle unincorporated associations to seek redress under section.
the district court,in contrast,did not rely on any of these factors in reaching the opposite conclusion.instead,in addition to case law which did not adequately address the issue,the district court relied heavily upon analogy to other entities permitted to sue under section,such as corporations,indian tribes and unions.we conclude that these analogies are ultimately unconvincing,particularly in light of our analysis of the abovementioned monell factors.specifically,both and corporations clearly fall into the category of bodies corporate within the meaning of the dictionary act and,thus,could properly be considered persons under section.see will,at.the analogy between tribes and unincorporated associations is also dubious,having been called into question by the supreme court recent decision holding that a tribe does not qualify as a person who may sue under section to vindicate its rights as a sovereign.see inyo county,at.as for labor unions,it is true that they have been permitted to bring suit under section.allee medrano,d noting that u nions may sue under as persons deprived of their rights secured by the constitution and laws.however,this is likely based on the similarities between unions and corporations,rather than an implicit recognition of the right of unincorporated associations to sue under section.see united mine workers of america coronado coal.holding that labor union could be sued for antitrust violations and describing the affirmative legal recognition of their existence and usefulness and provisions for their protection.
we conclude,therefore,that the dictionary act of,the common understanding regarding unincorporated associations in,and the legislative history of section of the civil rights act of fail to indicate a congressional intent to include unincorporated associations within the ambit of the term person as set forth in.as such,we reverse the district court ruling that osa is a person entitled to bring a claim under section,and we remand with direction to dismiss osa claims.
standing and mootness 
both plaintiffs and defendants raise standing issues.defendants contend that plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the parade ordinance.plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in concluding they did not have standing to challenge the municipal court order.
whether a plaintiff has standing is a legal question,which we review de novo.ward utah,cir.to show article iii standing,a plaintiff must establish three elements injury in fact that is concrete and particularized and actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical traceability and redressability.lujan defenders of wildlife,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted.plaintiffs have the burden to demonstrate standing for each form of relief sought.friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl,d tandy city of wichita,cir.although we first determine whether a plaintiff has standing as of the time the action is brought,utah ass of counties bush,cir tandy,at,the plaintiff must continue to have standing throughout the litigation.a plaintiff must maintain standing at all times throughout the litigation for a court to retain jurisdiction.phelps hamilton,cir internal quotation marks omitted yellow cab coop.ass metro taxi in re yellow cab coop.ass n,cir.
although the parties do not raise mootness as an issue on appeal,given the progression of events since this litigation was filed,we must also consider whether the case is moot.see citizens for responsible gov t state political action comm.davidson,cir.a n actual controversy must be extant at all stages of review,not merely at the time the complaint is filed.arizonans for official english arizona,d internal quotation marks omitted.p ast exposure to alleged illegal conduct does not establish a present live controversy if unaccompanied by any continuing present effects.mcclendon city of albuquerque,cir.
the district court held that plaintiffs had standing to challenge the parade ordinance,but it did not analyze standing for each form of relief sought.applying de novo review,we ask whether plaintiffs have standing to pursue their claims for compensatory damages,declaratory relief,and injunctive relief,and further,whether their claims are now moot.
parade ordinance 
compensatory damages 
we conclude that lippoldt and benham have standing to seek compensatory damages for the denial of the parade permits.
defendants contend that the individual plaintiffs lack standing because they did not apply for the parade permits.we disagree.although the permits were in osa name,lippoldt and benham participated in the parades as osa volunteers.they suffered injury by the alleged abridgement of their first amendment rights when the city denied the parade permits.a favorable decision in this case would redress their injury by ordering the defendants to allow the parades and compensating them for any damages sustained.lippoldt and benham have standing to seek damages for the denial of the parade permits.
moreover,plaintiffs claim for compensatory damages is not moot.even though the district court granted the temporary restraining order and the plaintiffs held the parades,plaintiffs may still contest the district court denial of compensatory damages.b y definition claims for past damages can not be deemed moot.see taxpayers for the plata referendum plata water conservancy,cir.at trial,the district court awarded only nominal damages,and plaintiffs argue on appeal that they should have received compensatory damages.under these circumstances,plaintiffs claim for compensatory damages remains a live case or controversy on appeal.plaintiffs claim for past damages is not moot.
declaratory relief 
similarly,plaintiffs have standing to seek declaratory relief.a claim for declaratory judgment is generally prospective,but we treat declaratory relief as retrospective to the extent that it is intertwined with a claim for monetary damages that requires us to declare whether a past constitutional violation occurred.peta rasmussen,cir faustin city county of denver,cir.moreover,plaintiffs claim for declaratory relief is not moot where the district court must determine whether a past constitutional violation occurred which will in turn affect the parties current rights or future behavior.green branson,cir.
just as plaintiffs have standing to seek damages,they have standing to seek declaratory relief,and their claim is not moot.throughout the entire litigation,the parties have disagreed whether the defendants violated the first amendment in denying plaintiffs parade permits,and plaintiffs sought damages for the city denial of the parade permits.at the bench trial,the district court had to determine whether a past constitutional violation occurred when defendants denied the parade permits.even on appeal,a live controversy remains.plaintiffs challenge the district court denial of compensatory damages.defendants challenge the district court determination that cole and harlenske are liable pursuant to.thus,plaintiffs have standing to seek declaratory relief concerning denial of their parade permits in july,and their claim is not moot.
injunctive relief 
although plaintiffs have standing to seek compensatory damages and declaratory relief,they have no standing to seek a permanent injunction.see faustin,at holding that plaintiffs had standing to seek declaratory relief and nominal damages,but lacked standing to pursue injunctive relief.
plaintiffs seeking prospective relief must show more than past harm or speculative future harm.riggs city of albuquerque,cir.in tandy city of wichita,we concluded that the plaintiff had standing to seek prospective relief by alleging an intent to use the city bus several times per year because this suggested a concrete,present plan to use it each year.at.a claimed injury that is contingent upon speculation or conjecture is beyond the bounds of a federal court jurisdiction.id.at.
although plaintiffs had standing to seek a permanent injunction on the day that they filed the complaint,circumstances changed when the district court granted plaintiffs motion for a temporary restraining order on july,and ordered the city to allow the parades.once plaintiffs held the parades in july,they lacked standing to seek a permanent injunction because plaintiffs can not demonstrate injury in fact.
further,plaintiffs have failed to allege a concrete,present plan to apply for another parade permit in the future.of the plaintiffs,lippoldt has the strongest argument that she intends to apply for another parade permit,but she did not specify a concrete plan to do so.she lives in wichita,and she even applied for a parade permit in october,which the city granted.aside from past harm,lippoldt alleges only speculative future harm,which is insufficient for standing to seek injunctive relief.see riggs,at.lippoldt testified that it is very likely that both and she personally will apply for parade permits in the future.app.vol.v at.as to whether she had specific plans for filing a parade permit in wichita,lippoldt responded n ot dates but there has been talk of plans.id.at.in responding to a question whether she had any current plans to submit parade permit requests,she responded y es,probably.has been confirmed but there talk of another one.i mean,we do have a date we are talking about it but we have not chosen a date.id.at.lippoldt averred intent does not confer standing to seek injunctive relief because she has not alleged a concrete,present plan to apply for another parade permit.
lippoldt alleges precisely the sort of speculative future harm that did not confer standing in lujan defenders of wildlife.in lujan,the supreme court held that the plaintiff lacked standing to seek prospective relief because plaintiff alleged that i intend to go back to sri lanka,but admitted that she had no current plans by testifying that i do know when not next year,i will say.in the future.at.lippoldt allegations are equally deficient.like lippoldt,benham also lacks standing to seek injunctive relief because he fails to allege a concrete future injury.benham stated that neither he nor osa intended to parade in wichita in the future.
plaintiffs fail to demonstrate standing to seek prospective relief,including a permanent injunction,since they held the parades in the summer of mercy renewal and have not alleged a concrete plan to hold a parade in wichita in the future because plaintiffs lack standing to seek injunctive relief,we do not consider their claim that the district court erred in denying their request for injunctive relief.
municipal court bond order 
plaintiffs maintain that the district court erred in concluding that they lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the bond order.even if plaintiffs had standing to challenge the bond order,their challenge is moot because they were not arrested during the parades in july,and the bond order expired by its own terms on july.
we may affirm the district court on any grounds for which there is a record sufficient to permit conclusions of law,even grounds not relied upon by the district court.griess colorado,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
plaintiffs challenge to the bond order is moot because any relief they seek would have no legal effect.plaintiffs presented no evidence that the city has threatened to renew the bond order.the bond order was in effect from july,through july.neither of the named plaintiffs were arrested while the bond order was in place.plaintiffs have not presented evidence that any osa volunteers were subjected to the bond order.moreover,the exception to mootness does not apply because plaintiffs have failed to show a reasonable expectation that the controversy regarding the bond order will recur.honig doe,d.even if plaintiffs had standing to challenge the order at the outset of this litigation,the controversy regarding the bond order became moot when the order expired on july.
causation under section 
defendants argue that the district court erred by concluding that harlenske and cole caused plaintiffs deprivation of their first amendment rights.we disagree.
section requires plaintiffs to show causation,imposing liability on a defendant who subjects,or causes to be subjected,any citizen to the deprivation of any rights.we have explained section causation requirement a defendant may not be held liable under unless he or she subjected a citizen to the deprivation,or caused a citizen to be subjected to the deprivation.tonkovich.bd.of regents,cir.a plaintiff must allege factual but for order to state a claim under.scott hern,cir.where multiple forces are actively operating,as in this case,plaintiffs may demonstrate that each defendant is a concurrent cause by showing that his or her conduct was a substantial factor in bringing the injury about.northington marin,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in a case of concurrent causation,the burden of proof shifts to the defendants in that a tortfeasor who can not prove the extent to which the harm resulted from other concurrent causes is liable for the whole harm because multiple tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable.id.at.defendants argue that neither cole nor harlenske caused the deprivation because they were subordinate to the causative actors who actually made the decision to deny the parade permits aple.br.at.
we address harlenske conduct first.defendants argue that the causal connection between harlenske conduct and the ultimate denial is too tenuous,and too heavily interrupted by the acts and decisions of others.aple.br.at.we disagree.the record supports the district court conclusion that harlenske conduct caused the violation of plaintiffs first amendment rights.her conduct was a direct cause of the denial of the parade permits,and violation of plaintiffs first amendment rights was foreseeable.harlenske drafted the letter denying the parade permits.after the plaintiffs filed their parade applications,she researched the law on parade applications and learned that the government must have clear guidelines to restrict parades.despite discovering that denying the parade permits for the reasons offered by the city was most likely unconstitutional,harlenske advised cole to sign the denial letter.we agree with the district court that harlenske conduct was a substantial factor in denying the parade permits and violating plaintiffs first amendment rights.
we next review the evidence of cole conduct.defendants maintain that cole was no more than a reluctant scrivener,whose actual participation in the permit denial was negligible because he merely signed the letter on behalf of his superior,the police chief.aple.br.at.defendants contend that cole did not make the denial decision,and that he took pains to divorce himself from the act,by signing for chief norman williams instead of using his own name.aple.br.at.but cole admitted that he did not want plaintiffs to parade near bleckley street or tiller clinic,and he agreed with the contents of the letter.cole personally participated in the denial of the parade permits.like harlenske,cole conduct was a substantial factor in the denial of plaintiffs parade permits.defendants fail to show that the district court erred in concluding that cole conduct caused the deprivation of plaintiffs constitutional rights.
essentially,defendants complain that plaintiffs sued the wrong defendants.that conduct of other people may have concurrently caused the harm does not change the outcome as to harlenske and cole.see northington,at.harlenske and cole failed to show that the harm should be apportioned to other wrongdoers who are not before the court.
the district court did not err in its conclusion that harlenske and cole caused the deprivation of plaintiffs first amendment rights.
denial of compensatory damages 
plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in denying their request for compensatory damages.we conclude that the district court decision awarding nominal damages of is not clearly erroneous.
because the amount of damages is a finding of fact,we review the district court award of damages in a bench trial under the clearly erroneous standard.deasy united states,cir dill city of edmond,cir.
the deprivation of constitutional rights,standing alone,does not entitle a plaintiff to general damages.taxpayers for the plata referendum,at.plaintiffs must demonstrate actual injury to recover damages under section for violation of their constitutional rights.see dill,at.in dill,we reversed a district court decision awarding in nominal damages,reasoning that the evidence supported an award of compensatory damages where plaintiff demonstrated that he lost in overtime and special duty pay from the unconstitutional transfer.id.at.
when denying plaintiffs claim for compensatory damages in the present case,the district court found that plaintiffs damages claims were based on assumptions only.lippoldt,d at.we agree.
plaintiffs failed to present evidence of compensable injury caused by the denial of the parade permits.although the city denied plaintiffs parade permits,the district court ordered the city to allow the parades,and the district court order was publicized in the media.thus,plaintiffs were ultimately able to hold the parades as requested in their applications.plaintiffs presented no evidence of damages caused by the initial denial of the parade permits.
plaintiffs merely speculated about the amount of damages based upon an alleged potential decrease in offerings received from the july evening rallies.benham claimed that the denial of the parade permits affected public perception of the summer of mercy renewal events,causing people to not attend and thereby reducing donations.but the record indicates these offerings were voluntary and were only collected at the evening rallies and not at the parades.we agree with the district court that plaintiffs presented no evidence that the city initial denial of the parade permits somehow decreased voluntary offerings collected at evening rallies.
plaintiffs complained about the city other conduct apart from the denial of the parade permits,but this conduct is not relevant to determining whether plaintiffs demonstrated compensable injury for the denial of parade permits.for example,lippoldt testified that the mayor and police chief asked local churches to withdraw their participation in the summer of mercy renewal,apparently because the mayor was concerned that some of osa volunteers may be extremists who could harm the message.pastor wright of the central christian church previously had agreed to allow plaintiffs to use church facilities for the evening rallies,but later reneged after meeting with the mayor.plaintiffs may only seek damages for conduct that violated the constitution.because plaintiffs did not demonstrate that the city other conduct was a constitutional violation,they can not seek damages for it.while the district court allowed plaintiffs to introduce this evidence to show the city attitude toward osa and the summer of mercy renewal events,it is not probative of the amount of damages to which plaintiffs are entitled for the denial of the parade permits.
although the district court found that plaintiffs failed to prove compensable injury,it awarded nominal damages in the amount of.the district court reasoned that the deprivation of first amendment rights constitutes injury.we agree.n ominal damages,and not damages based on some undefinable value of infringed rights,are the appropriate means of vindicating rights whose deprivation has not caused actual,provable injury.memphis cmty.sch.dist.stachura,d internal quotation marks omitted makin.dep t of,cir city county of denver,cir.plaintiffs were unable to prove that the denial of the parade permits caused them to suffer compensable injury,but they nevertheless sustained injury from the deprivation of their first amendment rights.the district court finding that plaintiffs should receive in nominal damages was not clearly erroneous.
having concluded that plaintiffs can not obtain compensatory damages,a permanent injunction,or prospective declaratory relief,we must also conclude that,even if we were to assume the dismissal of the city was erroneous,that error is harmless.see.fleming.ne,cir.moreover,since the district court declared that assistant city attorney harlenske and deputy chief of police cole acted unconstitutionally in denying plaintiffs parade permits in july,plaintiffs succeeded in putting the city on notice about its employees conduct,even if the declaration did not directly apply to the city.plaintiffs have not shown how the outcome of the case would differ if the city were a party.
attorney fees 
plaintiffs challenge the district court decision awarding attorney fees,arguing that the court erred in holding that they were successful only in the first phase of litigation when they obtained a temporary restraining order.plaintiffs also contest the district court determination of a reasonable rate.
a reasonable fee is the product of a reasonable rate in the relevant community multiplied by the number of hours reasonably spent on the litigation,blum stenson,d hensley eckerhart,d.we review the district court determination of reasonable hourly rate and reasonable hours for abuse of discretion,jane bangerter,cir.
reasonable hours 
plaintiffs argue that the district court abused its discretion in concluding that plaintiffs achieved success only in the first part of the litigation where they obtained a temporary restraining order.we agree.
the district court reduced the lodestar by refusing to award attorney fees for fees incurred after the temporary restraining order was entered.the district court concluded that plaintiffs prevailed from the filing of the complaint until they obtained a temporary restraining order,but that they only formally prevailed in the rest of the litigation.
to be a prevailing party,the plaintiff must obtain at least some relief on the merits of his claim.farrar hobby,d.where a plaintiff seeks compensatory damages but recovers only nominal damage
