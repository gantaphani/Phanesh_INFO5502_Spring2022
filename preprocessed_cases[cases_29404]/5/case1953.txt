a celebrity sued distributors of a video game alleging that,in creating a character in the video game,the distributors misappropriated her likeness and identity in violation of state and federal law.the distributors moved for summary judgment asserting the first amendment provided a complete defense to each of the celebrity plaintiff claims.the trial court agreed,granted the motions,and subsequently awarded the distributors mandatory attorney fees,as prevailing parties under civil code section,subdivision a.we affirm the judgment and remand for a determination regarding the amount of attorney fees.
factual and procedural background 
from to approximately,appellant keirin kirby,professionally known as lady miss kier,miss kier or lady kier hereafter,kirby was the lead singer of a musical group known as which was popular in the early.made five albums which were distributed and sold throughout the world.the band was best known for its song groove is in the heart from its first album released in.the song music video,which received extensive airplay on mtv,features band members clad in funky retro outfits,vivid graphics,groovy dance moves,a futuristic setting and an overall party feel.
in addition to being a musician,kirby is a dancer,artist,choreographer and fashion designer.kirby insists that,as lady kier,she developed a specific,distinctive look,of a fashionable,provocative,and funky artistic character.kirby claims her unique public identity,which combines retro and futuristic visual and musical styles,results from her signature costumes and lyrical expression.kirby costumes included platform shoes,clothes and unitards,short pleated or skirts,bare midriffs,cropped tops with words or a numeral written on the chest,space or other helmets,a blue backpack,and hair worn in a flip held back by a headband,pigtails and other styles.kirby alleges her signature lyrical expression,with which she introduces herself in the opening of the music video for groove is in the heart,and which is included in three of her songs,is ooh la la.kirby claims substantial,commercially valuable goodwill in her sound,appearance,persona and likeness.
disbanded by the.since then,kirby has been involved in has not album of her own,and does not pursue publicity or grant press interviews.she alleges she has been and is regularly approached by advertisers and manufacturers interested in licensing her name and likeness to sell products.kirby declines most offers,but derives some income from commercial endorsements.
respondents are distributors of a videogame called space channel,or the game.was created from by takashi yuda,an employee of sega japan,and was released in japan in december.yuda originally conceived the main character as a male,but changed the character to a female in order to develop a video game to appeal to girls.yuda testified the name ulala was a derivative of a japanese name urara,modified to make it easier for to pronounce.yuda claims he developed the ulala character based on the anime style of japanese cartoon characters,and denied using kirby as a reference.ulala has six main dance moves up,down,right,left,forward and backward.the character dance moves were created by nahoko nezu,a japanese choreographer and dancer.nezu dance moves were hers alone.at the time she created the moves,nezu did not know kirby,and had not ever heard of her.nezu created and performed dance moves for ulala at yuda direction.he videotaped the moves and used the tapes to create ulala dance moves in the game.the musical theme song for is mexican flyer.that song,written in the,is performed by composer ken woodman.the music is not based on,or used in reference to,any music by or kirby.
the game,set in outer space in the century,features the image of a young,fictional elongated and extremely thin female reporter named ulala who works for a news channel called space channel.in the game,ulala wears a few different costumes,but is primarily seen in an almost entirely orange outfit which includes a top bearing the numeral,a,gloves,and,platform boots.her hot pink hair is always worn in short pigtails placed high on the back of her head,and she wears a blue headset and jet pack and a blue gun holster strapped to her right thigh.orange and blue were chosen as the primary colors for ulala costume because orange is the official color of dreamcast,and the corporate color of sega japan is blue.
in the game,ulala is dispatched to investigate an invasion of earth by aliens who shoot earthlings with ray guns,causing them to dance uncontrollably.during her investigation,ulala encounters the aliens and competitor reporters.the player attempts to have ulala match the dance moves of the other characters.if successful,the player acquires points,eliminates certain characters,and causes others to become part of ulala dance troupe.the player moves to higher levels of more difficult play until he or she reaches a final level and a surprise ending to ulala story.one character at the final level is known as space michael.it was created to resemble the celebrity michael jackson,who performed the character voice and receives credit in the game.
several promotional products are associated with the game.sega produced a promotional video with samples of music from.sega also the sale of three products in the united states a strategy guide for playing a lunch box displaying characters from the game,including ulala and a hot wheels car containing a picture of ulala.
respondent sega of america,sega released a localized version of the game in north america in june.the localized north american version differs from the japanese version in that voices are different,and the language is changed to english.
in july,kirby was contacted by pd tully,a firm retained by a subsidiary of sega japan,in connection with its effort to launch a version of in england.was considering using one of several music videos or songs,including groove is in the heart,to promote the game.contacted kirby to determine if she was interested in promoting the in england and,possibly,europe.kirby was not.
under a license granted by sega japan,respondent thq,thq was authorized to release and market a version of in june for use on the nintendo gameboy advance platform.later that year,respondent agetec,agetec received sega authorization to market a special edition of the game for the playstation platform 
kirby initiated this action in april.the operative second amended complaint alleges causes of action for common law infringement of the right of publicity misappropriation of likeness,violation of the lanham act a unfair competition bus,interference with prospective business advantage and unjust enrichment.kirby alleged respondents wrongfully used her name,likeness and identity in developing and marketing the game and,specifically,its ulala character.
sega,agetec and thq each moved for summary judgment asserting kirby could not establish all elements of her claims and,even if she could,the first amendment provided a complete defense to the entire action the motions were granted after the trial court found all claims constitutionally foreclosed.
respondents subsequently moved for a mandatory award of attorneys fees in the amount of approximately,collectively,subd.a.kirby opposed the motion,arguing the mandatory fee provision of civil code section created public policy concerns.she also asserted the amount of fees sought was unreasonable,any fees awarded must be apportioned among the state claims,and no fees should be awarded on the federal claim.the trial court declined to award fees on the lanham act claim and reduced the fee award to approximately,but granted the remainder of the motion.this appeal followed.
discussion 
standard of review.
the standard of review articulated by the supreme court applies in this case.in aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,the supreme court described a party burdens on summary judgment.f rom commencement to conclusion,the party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.at,d.that is because of the general principle that a party who seeks a court action in his favor bears the burden of persuasion thereon.citation.there is a triable issue of material fact if,and only if,the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof citation.trafficschoolonline,clarke th,d.a defendant moving for summary judgment satisfies its burden of showing a claim lacks merit if the defendant can show one or more elements of a cause of action can not be established because the plaintiff does not possess and can not reasonably obtain the evidence necessary to establish the claim,or a complete defense to that cause of action exists.code civ,subds.o,p.aguilar,supra,cal th at,d.if this burden of production is met,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to set forth specific facts sufficient to establish a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable material issue of fact.code civ,subds.o,p aguilar,supra,cal th at,d.
in cases involving free speech,a speedy resolution is desirable because protracted litigation may chill the exercise of first amendment rights.for that reason,summary judgment is a favored remedy in free speech cases.winter dc comics cal th,d,winter shulman group w productions,cal th,d.indeed,in an appropriation case not dissimilar from this one,the supreme court instructed that courts can often resolve the question as a matter of law simply by viewing the work in question and,if necessary,comparing it to an actual likeness of the person or persons portrayed.because of these circumstances,an action presenting this issue is often properly resolved on summary judgment winter,supra,cal th at,d.the trial court decision to enter summary judgment is reviewed de novo.however,if the decision is correct on any ground,the judgment must be upheld regardless of the reasons given by the trial court.trafficschoolonline,clarke,supra,th at,d.
material issues of fact exist as to whether kirby likeness or identity was appropriated.
a.the state statutory and common law claims of appropriation.
kirby alleges both a common law and statutory appropriation claim,a claim for violation of the lanham act,and several claims related to unfair competition.her claims are predicated on the same underlying misconduct,respondents alleged misappropriation and exploitation of kirby likeness or identity as depicted by the game ulala character.
in the context of a celebrity,the invasion of privacy tort for appropriation turns on a right of publicity arising from commercially exploitable opportunities embodied in the plaintiff likeness.baugh cbs.the cause of action may be both common law and statutory.the elements of a common law action are the unauthorized use of the plaintiff identity to the defendant advantage by appropriating the plaintiff name,voice,likeness,commercially or otherwise,and resulting injury.eastwood superior court d,fn.
the statutory claim provides any person who knowingly uses another name,voice,signature,photograph,or likeness,in any manner,on or in products,merchandise,or goods,or for purposes of advertising or selling,or soliciting purchases of,products,merchandise,goods or services,without such person prior consent,shall be liable for any damages sustained by the person or persons injured as a result thereof,subd.a section,subdivision a.the legislative prohibition against the unauthorized appropriation of one likeness was intended to complement,not supplant,common law claims for right of publicity.comedy iii productions,gary saderup,cal th,d,comedy iii eastwood superior court,supra,d at.the common law and statutory claims are similar but not identical,but both are involved here.a statutory cause of action for appropriation not only encompasses the common law elements,it requires a knowing use of the plaintiff name,likeness.eastwood superior court,supra,d at,subd.a.the privacy invasion is actionable under either the statute or common law regardless of whether the purpose is commercial.see knb enterprises matthews th,fn,d.
kirby repeatedly insists the trial court found,as a matter of law,that her likeness and identity had been misappropriated.her insistence is not supported by the record.the trial court found only the existence of material factual issues as to whether,by creating ulala,respondents misappropriated kirby likeness and identity.our review of the record reveals the court conclusion was correct.
the misappropriation of one likeness refers to a person visual image.midler ford motor cir.ulala resembles kirby in certain respects.certain of ulala characteristics and features resemble kirby.both images are thin,and have similarly shaped eyes and faces,red lips and red or pink hair.both wear,clothing,including short skirts and platform shoes in a retro style.in addition,ulala name is a phonetic variant of ooh la la,a phrase often used by kirby and associated with kirby.finally,as the trial court pointed out,both kirby and ulala used the phrases groove,meow,and i wo give up.these similarities support kirby contention her identity was misappropriated.
however,ulala and kirby also differ in significant respects.although ulala dons assorted costumes in the game,she is seen most often with her hair in short,high pigtails,wearing an orange bearing the numeral and orange miniskirt,orange gloves and boots with stiletto heels,a blue holster strapped to her thigh,and a blue headset and jetpack.kirby asserts she often wears short skirts,crop tops with numbers,gloves,pigtails and space helmets.kirby,as the record reflects,is found more frequently in body suits,with her hair shaped into a flip,held back with a head band.and,unlike ulala,when kirby wears her hair in pigtails,the pigtails not only are longer than ulala,but kirby has tendrils of hair draping over her forehead which she holds back with clips.kirby concedes she has no singular identity,her appearance and visual style are continually moving,and she is not the type of artist that wants to do the same thing every time.this lack of stasis is inconsistent with a claim of appropriation.moreover,unlike the game,which is set in outer space several centuries in the future,kirby fashion approach harkens back to a retro style,and neither her videos nor photographs relate to outer space.
notwithstanding the differences between kirby and ulala,we agree with the trial court that a material factual issue exists as to whether respondents misappropriated kirby likeness.ulala facial features,her clothing,hair color and style,and use of certain catch phrases are sufficiently reminiscent enough of kirby features and personal style to suggest imitation.in addition,although no evidence indicates kirby likeness was actually used to create ulala,kirby was specifically asked by a sega affiliate in to endorse.this solicitation suggests sega knew of kirby and believed her celebrity association would benefit the release of the european version of the game.
the differences also give rise to a factual issue on the common law claim of misappropriation of kirby identity.again,kirby admission that she possesses no singular identity militates against a successful claim of appropriation.compare white samsung electronics america,cir,nonconsensual use of robotic image of celebrity vanna white,dressed in wig,gown and jewelry regularly worn by white,turning letters on a game show set designed to look like the wheel of fortune,constitutes common law appropriation of celebrity singular identity.in addition,we agree with the trial court that ulala limited and consistently short and choppy dance movement and style differ markedly from kirby,a finding consistent with sega claim that ulala dance moves were created by a dancer who knew nothing of kirby.nevertheless,the differences are sufficient to give rise to a triable factual issue on the common law claim as well 
b.the lanham act.
the lanham act is the federal equivalent of a right of publicity claim.it protects against use of a celebrity image or persona in connection with a product in a manner likely to falsely imply a celebrity product endorsement.etw jireh,cir,etw.critical to a lanham act claim is the likelihood reasonable consumers will be confused about the celebrity endorsement.id.at.for reasons discussed above,we agree with the trial court finding that t he same issues of fact concerning likeness and identity which support kirby appropriation claims also support her lanham act claim.there is a question of fact that kirby identity,though constantly evolving,has been appropriated for.
the first amendment affords a complete defense to kirby claims.
respondents contend here,as they did below,that their right of free expression under the first amendment of the united states constitution and the even greater speech protections afforded by the california constitution,article i,section,provide a complete defense to kirby claims.see robins pruneyard shopping center cal d,cal.const.provides broader speech protection than does const.the trial court agreed,as do we.
the freedom of expression protected by the first amendment exists to preserve an uninhibited marketplace of ideas and to further individual rights of self expression.winter,supra,cal th at,d.the protections may extend to all forms of expression,including written and spoken words fact or fiction,music,films,paintings,and entertainment,whether or not sold for a profit comedy iii,supra,cal th at,d,winter,supra,cal th at,d,etw,supra,at.video games are expressive works entitled to as much first amendment protection as the most profound literature.interactive digital software louis county cir,video software dealers ass maleng d.
as this case illustrates,a tension frequently exists between the first amendment goal of fostering a marketplace of ideas and respect for individual expression,and a celebrity right of publicity.in comedy iii and again in winter,the supreme court addressed the balance between a celebrity right to control the commercial exploitation of his or her likeness or identity and the first amendment right of free expression.see comedy iii,supra,cal th at,d,winter,supra,cal th at,d.in comedy iii,the court held a defendant may raise the first amendment as an affirmative defense to an allegation of appropriation if the defendant work adds something new,with a further purpose or different character,altering the first with new expression,meaning,or message citation.comedy iii,supra,cal th at,d.in other words,the new work must contain significant transformative elements.id.at,d.the transformative test protects the right of publicity.it continues to shield celebrities from literal depictions or imitations for commercial gain by works which do not add significant new expression.moreover,a work which has been transformed is less likely to interfere with the economic interests protected by the right of publicity,because a distorted image of a celebrity is a poor substitute for more conventional forms of celebrity depictions,and thus less likely to threaten the market for celebrity memorabilia.comedy iii,supra,cal th at,d.
the transformative test is straightforward the inquiry is whether the celebrity likeness is one of the raw materials from which an original work is synthesized,or whether the depiction or imitation of the celebrity is the very sum and substance of the work in question.comedy iii,supra,cal th at,d.if the product containing the celebrity likeness is so transformed that it has become primarily the defendant own expression of what he or she is trying to create or portray,rather than the celebrity likeness,it is protected.id.at,d.applying this test in comedy iii,which involved drawings depicting the three stooges,and made from those drawings,the court concluded the drawings and were not entitled to first amendment protection.the artist who created them,while highly skilled,contributed nothing other than a trivial variation that transformed the drawings from literal likenesses of the three actors.id.at,d.
the supreme court applied the transformative test again two years later in winter.in that case,the defendant published a series of comics featuring two,characters based on singers edgar and johnny winter.both characters had long white hair and albino features similar to the winter brothers,while one wore a hat similar to one often worn by johnny winter.winter,supra,cal th at,d.
the winter brothers sued for statutory appropriation and lost.applying the transformative test,the court found the comic depictions contained significant expressive content beyond the winters mere likenesses.winter,supra,cal th at,d.the winters were merely part of the raw material from which the comics plot and characters were fashioned.in addition,the characters were distorted pictures of the winters for the purpose of lampoon,parody or caricature.in short,and in stark contrast to the near literal depictions of the three stooges in comedy iii,the comic book characters depicted were fanciful,creative characters,not pictures of the winter brothers.id.at,d.
applying the comparison required by comedy iii and winter to the evidence in the record,we agree with the trial court that,notwithstanding certain similarities,ulala is more than a mere likeness or literal depiction of kirby.ulala contains sufficient expressive content to constitute a transformative work under the test articulated by the supreme court.first,ulala is not a literal depiction of kirby.as discussed above,the two share similarities.however,they also differ quite a bit ulala extremely tall,slender physique is dissimilar from kirby.evidence also indicated ulala was based,at least in part,on the japanese style of anime.ulala typical hairstyle and primary costume differ from those worn by kirby who varied her costumes and outfits,and wore her hair in several styles.moreover,the setting for the game that features a reporter in the unlike any public depiction of kirby.finally,we agree with the trial court that the dance moves performed by short,quick movements of the arms,legs and unlike kirby movements in any of her music videos.taken together,these differences demonstrate ulala is transformative,and respondents added creative elements to create a new expression.
conceding the game adds new expression,kirby nevertheless contends respondents violated her right of privacy because,unlike the comics in winter which were intended to poke fun,the game lacks any element of caricature,lampoon,or parody.notwithstanding the added expression,kirby insists ulala is no more than a,an imitation or emulation or of lady kier entire persona,by respondents with the commercial objective to us e lady kier likeness and identity and to capitalize in the game and its affiliated products on the commercial value attached to her persona.kirby insists ulala is nothing other than a mere emulation of lady kier with minor digital enhancements and manipulations.it is not entitled to first amendment protection because the character fails to say anything whether factual or critical or a public figure.neither contention has merit.
first,for the reasons discussed above,we reject the claim that ulala merely emulates kirby.sufficient similarities preclude a conclusion that,as a matter of law,ulala was not based in part on kirby.however,we are similarly unable to conclude,as a matter of law,that ulala is nothing other than an imitative character contrived of minor digital enhancements and manipulations.respondents have added new expression,and the differences are not trivial.ulala is not a mere imitation of kirby.
second,and more importantly,the transformative test specifically does not require the elements kirby seeks to impose.the law does not require ulala to say factual or critical or comedic about kirby the public figure in order to receive first amendment protection.this argument has been soundly rejected by the supreme court.in winter,the court made clear the pivotal issue is whether the work is transformative,not the form of literary expression it does not matter what precise literary category the work falls into.what matters is whether the work is transformative,not whether it is parody or satire or caricature or serious social commentary or any other specific form of expression.winter,supra,cal th at,d.whether the ulala character conveys any expre
