the litigation between these parties began some four years ago,in march,when kevin filed a petition to be declared the father of lauren son under the uniform parentage act upa,et the trial court entered a paternity judgment in kevin favor,which we reversed.kevin lauren th.
in this appeal,lauren challenges the court denial of her motion for a court order requiring kevin to pay lauren outstanding attorney fees lauren contends the court denial of her fee request was erroneous under sections and,the attorney fee statutes that expressly apply to upa cases.she also argues the court erred by relying,at least in part,on section,an attorney fee statute applicable to marital dissolution cases.we affirm the court order.
in december,lauren moved the court to order kevin to pay her outstanding attorney fees incurred in the two consolidated cases between them.in a supporting declaration,lauren counsel,debra opri,declared prior to an april,court hearing on attorney fees the hearing,lauren had owed opri associates for fees and costs incurred for lauren defense in the action at the hearing,the court ordered kevin to pay of the then balance,leaving an unpaid balance at that time of stage one fees.subsequent to the hearing,lauren incurred in fees and costs and paid opri firm,leaving an unpaid balance of stage two fees.lauren sought a court order for kevin to pay a total of in attorney fees,comprised of and.according to opri,kevin had forced lauren to fight for her child and defend herself in kevin unmeritorious paternity battle,with kevin knowledge that lauren would be outspent and without legal representation had she not had opri office representing her for these many years.opri normal hourly billing rate was and her law clerk was.
in lauren own declaration,she declared opri had been working basically for free on her behalf.lauren had paid opri associates a total of,which included a payment of made by lauren father.lauren owed her father tens of thousands of dollars.her father had extended lauren loans to pay her living expenses,but lauren was now severely limited in her ability to borrow any more significant funds from her father due to his own financial limitations.
lauren filed an income and expense declaration,showing she had last filed an income tax return in,had not been employed since august,and had no income.she also filed copies of opri itemized billing statements.
kevin responded lauren request for fees on appeal was untimely the april court order that kevin pay of lauren stage one fees had rendered res judicata the issue of those fees and lauren request for for stage two fees not including fees on appeal was unreasonable because,inter alia,the parties fees were disproportionate,with lauren incurring in fees for the entire case,compared to kevin,and lauren incurring in stage two fees compared to kevin.kevin noted that lauren attorney had billed lauren a total of for driving time from beverly hills for court appearances in orange county.
in kevin declaration,he declared that his trial and appellate attorneys had billed him a total of approximately,and that one attorney,as a professional courtesy,had charged him a reduced fee of an hour discounted from the lawyer usual rate of an hour.
on kevin income and expense declaration,he listed his stocks,bonds,and other readily saleable assets as undetermined,and checked boxes for real and personal property but specified no fair market value for them.his expenses included monthly installment payments of on a loan made to him by certain relatives for litigation costs.
lauren filed an amended income and expense declaration,declaring,inter alia,she had no income and that her father had loaned her the money to pay her living expenses.
the parties submitted the matter on the pleadings.the court denied lauren motion for attorney fees,after identifying the issue to be decided as whether attorney fees should be paid to lauren,based on need and ability to pay,as set forth in sections,and.
the court made the following findings based on the parties income and expense declarations.kevin average monthly income was.lauren had no income from employment and had not worked since august,although she has a master degree in psychology and is a certified chemical dependency counselor.lauren received per month from others.these payments to lauren were not loans rather,they were funds on which she relies in order to maintain her lifestyle and therefore constituted support to her.kevin average monthly living expenses were,while lauren were.kevin had a monthly deficit of,compared to lauren shortfall of.the parties had incurred substantial attorney fees kevin resulting in more than in loans,and lauren with only paid.
the court appreciated that lauren counsel had expended time and talent to the case without substantial payment in advance.nonetheless,the court stated it had to apply section,subdivision b,and consider the practicality of the expense of litigation consistent with the parties overall financial resources.the court stated n ot all cases are able to be litigated without consideration of the parties overall financial picture.only the wealthiest of our citizens can afford to expend more than on their family law disputes.the fact that an attorney voluntarily takes on the lower earner does not mean that the law gives him or her carte blanche to litigate the case without limitation regardless of the parties ability to pay.the court continued s ection,subdivision d provides for a mechanism where a party may apply for the court assistance regarding fees where the case involves complex or substantial issues.section,subdivision d offers the parties and their counsel,in advance of going forward with litigation,the opportunity to implement a case management plan for the purpose of allocating attorney fees and costs in an amount and to the extent the circumstances practicably allow.the court notes that lauren did not avail herself of this opportunity and forged ahead,incurring attorney fees far in excess of either party reasonable ability to pay.the court concluded that neither party ha d a substantially greater ability to pay the other fees and therefore denied lauren motion for attorney fees.
the parties did not request a statement of decision.
discussion 
lauren contends the court failed to conduct a proper inquiry under the upa attorney fee provisions,sections and.she claims the court wrongly took into account her father financial support and made no determination that her fees incurred were unfair,unreasonable or not necessarily incurred.she further argues the court erred by applying section to this case 
the statutory framework 
we review the family code statutes that govern attorney fee awards and are potentially relevant to this case.we start with the upa,which is the part of the family code that provides a procedural vehicle by which unmarried parents establish their rights each other and their children erika brett th,and establishes the framework by which california courts make paternity determinations in re kiana th.sections and of the upa govern attorney fee awards in upa cases.section predates section section was enacted in,over a decade prior to the legislature adoption of section in 
section gives a court the discretion to order reasonable attorney fees to be paid by the parties in proportions and at times determined by the court.contained in chapter,article of the upa on paternal relationships,section arguably applies only to paternity determinations.rather than being the result of deliberate drafting by the california legislature,section was simply california adoption of the corresponding provision in the national upa.robert catherine th,robert.
besides section,other potentially pertinent family code attorney fee statutes that existed prior to the enactment of section were section,which provides that,for any fee award under the family code,the court must first determine that the party to be charged with payment has or is reasonably likely to have the ability to pay section,which authorizes fee awards in marital dissolution cases and section,which prescribes additional requirements for fee awards under section.in march,when the court issued its ruling here,sections,and remained unchanged from their original versions first enacted as part of the then new family code,effective january,
section,on the other hand,was amended by the legislature in,as part of assembly bill,the same legislation that adopted then new section.previously,section had given a court the discretion to award reasonably necessary attorney fees in marital proceedings,so long as the court determin ed an ability to pay and consider ed the respective incomes and needs of the parties.former,subd.a.as relevant here,assembly bill addressed the legislature concerns that existing attorney fee provisions were discretionary assem.com.on juduciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.april,and although the upa provided for attorney fees in paternity cases,it did not specifically do so for custody and visitation proceedings com.on judiciary,on assem.bill reg.sess.june.
the passage of assembly bill resulted,inter alia,in two virtually identical statutes new section applicable to upa cases and amended section applying to marital dissolution proceedings,both effective january,both statutes provide in relevant part t he court shall ensure that each party has access to legal representation to preserve each party rights by ordering,if necessary based on the income and needs assessments,one party to pay to the other party,or to the other party attorney,whatever amount is reasonably necessary for attorney fees and for the cost of maintaining or defending the proceeding during the pendency of the proceeding,subd.a,italics added,subd.a,italics added.in determining whether to award attorney fees and costs,and the amount of any such fees and costs,a court must consider the respective incomes and needs of the parties,and any factors affecting the parties respective abilities to pay,subd.b,subd.a.the court must augment or modify an award as may be reasonably necessary for the prosecution or defense of the proceeding,or any proceeding related thereto,including after any appeal has been concluded,subd.d,subd.c.
despite their virtually identical language,section diverged in one major respect from section section is and always has been controlled and supplemented by section.under section,t he court may make an award of attorney fees and costs under section where the making of the award,and the amount of the award,are just and reasonable under the relative circumstances of the respective parties,subd.a.section further provides in determining what is just and reasonable under the relative circumstances,the court shall take into consideration the need for the award to enable each party,to the extent practical,to have sufficient financial resources to present the party case adequately,taking into consideration,to the extent relevant,the circumstances of the respective parties described in section.the fact that the party requesting an award of attorney fees and costs has resources from which the party could pay the party own attorney fees and costs is not itself a bar to an order that the other party pay part or all of the fees and costs requested.financial resources are only one factor for the court to consider in determining how to apportion the overall cost of the litigation equitably between the parties under their relative circumstances,subd.b,italics added.in addition,at the time of the court ruling in,subdivision d of section provided that if a court finds the case involves complex or substantial issues of fact or law related to property rights,visitation,custody,or support,the court has discretion to direct the implementation of a case management plan for the purpose of allocating attorney fees and other fees and costs equitably between the parties.former,subd.d.
section referenced in,subd.b sets forth the circumstances to be considered by a court in ordering spousal support.those circumstances include the earning capacity of each party taking into account their marketable skills and any impairment of earning capacity of the supported spouse due to periods of unemployment necessitated by domestic duties,subd.a the obligations and assets of the parties the supported party ability to be employed without unduly interfering with the interests of dependent children,subds.e,g the age and health of the parties,subd.h the balance of hardships to the parties,subd.k and the goal that the supported party shall be within a reasonable period of time,subd.l.
thus,sections,and where relevant form a statutory package.a fee award under section must comport with section and potentially with section as well.section is expressly applicable only to marital proceedings.in contrast,sections and appear in the upa which deals with the parent and child relationship.
standard of review 
our threshold task is to determine the appropriate standard of review.we have found no published cases interpreting or applying section and only four cases involving section or its predecessor statute.those four cases are robert,supra,th,banning,supra,th,alicia timothy th alicia,and city and county of san francisco ragland d concerning predecessor statute.
robert and banning applied the de novo standard of review to questions of law concerning the interpretation of section and the constitutionality of that statute,respectively.robert,supra,th at banning,supra,th at.aside from questions of law,robert,alicia,and ragland applied an abuse of discretion standard to the trial court award of attorney fees under section or its predecessor statute.robert,at alicia,supra,th at ragland,supra,d at.this conclusion is not surprising because section grants a court the discretion to award fees.
section,subdivision a,in contrast,requires the court to ensure each party has access to legal representation by ordering,if necessary based on the income and needs assessments,one party to pay to the other party whatever amount is reasonably necessary for attorney fees italics added.in sum,the court must first assess whether a fee award is necessary to ensure access to legal representation and then,based on that assessment,award that amount which is reasonably necessary to ensure each party has access to legal representation.the findings of the court regarding the actual income and needs of the parties are necessarily subject to a substantial evidence standard of review.the determination of the amount which is reasonably necessary to ensure each party has access to legal representation is a decision necessarily committed to the sound judgment of the trial court,and is,accordingly,subject to review under an abuse of discretion standard.
accordingly,we will apply the abuse of discretion standard of review here,except to the extent we must determine the relevance of section to a upa case,an issue we review de novo,and whether the court express and implied factual findings regarding the parties respective income and needs are supported by substantial evidence.because the parties did not request a statement of decision from the trial court,we will infer findings in favor of the judgment on controverted issues.in re marriage of dancy th,superseded by statute on another point as stated in in re marriage of fellows cal th,fn.
the court reliance on section 
we next decide whether the court erred by relying,at least in part,on section.robert cast light on this issue with respect to section,concluding that section should not be interpreted with reference to section because section is not the result of deliberate drafting by the california legislature and is entirely dissimilar to section.robert,supra,th at,see also id.at,fn.of course,the opposite is true as to section,which was deliberately drafted by the legislature to be identical to section.
here,the trial court was clearly aware of the applicability of sections and to this case,having mentioned them in its articulation of the issue to be decided.yet,the court looked to the more detailed provisions of section for guidance.
this reliance was warranted for several reasons.first,as we noted above,there is no published case law on section.second,lauren directed the trial court attention to sections and in her memorandum of points and authorities below and in her opening and reply briefs on appeal,she contended that the fundamental requirement of fee awards under sections and is that the making of the award,and its amount,be just and reasonable under the relative circumstances of the respective parties.the source of lauren quoted phrase although she does not acknowledge it is section,subdivision a.furthermore,on appeal,lauren directs our attention to this court opinion in a marital dissolution case for the proper standard for a fee award.in re marriage of dietz th,court must determine how to apportion the overall cost of the litigation equitably between the parties under their relative circumstances.
third,in,the legislature drafted section and amended section to be identical statutes,without changing section which supplemented and controlled section.these statutes require a comparative analysis of the parties circumstances needs and serve the common purpose shared by all the family code statutes that authorize attorney fee awards of ensuring,to the extent possible,that the litigating parties are on an equal footing in their ability to present their cases hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law the rutter group.thus,sections and focus on the parties respective incomes and needs and respective abilities to pay,subd.a,subd.a,italics added.section asks whether the award is just and reasonable under the relative circumstances of the respective parties,subd.a,italics added.of these three statutes,section is the only one that instructs the court in detail how to make a comparative analysis it requires the court to take into consideration the need for the award to enable each party,to the extent practical,to have sufficient financial resources to present the party case adequately,taking into consideration,to the extent relevant,the circumstances specified in section,subd.b.although some of the factors listed in section relate only to marriage cases for example,the duration of the marriage,most of the enunciated circumstances are equally relevant to upa cases for example,each party marketable skills and earning capacity,subds.a,b,f alan,supra,th at not all section factors will be relevant all the time hence the to the extent relevant language in section.
we conclude the court did not err by taking into account standards and circumstances pertinent under a section comparative analysis.by doing so,the court was able to perform a more thorough evaluation of the parties respective abilities to pay 
the court did not abuse its discretion by denying lauren fee request 
lauren bears the burden of showing the court abused its discretion by failing to award her any attorney fees.in re marriage of lopez d,disapproved on a different point in in re marriage of morrison cal d,dissolution attorney fees.she argues the court erred by treating her father payments to her as income,asserting her father made loans to her,not gifts,and that no evidence suggested his financial support is an infinite obligation,regular or steady lauren also contends the court did not find her attorney fees were unreasonable.finally,lauren claims kevin understated his income and overstated his expenses on his income and expense declaration.
we address this last contention first.in lauren view,the court erred by failing to properly scrutinize kevin income and expense declaration so as to detect his sham accounting.but she raises this argument on appeal,and never apprised the trial court or kevin below of the alleged deficiencies in kevin declaration.as a result,kevin had no chance to amend,correct,expand,or explain his declaration nor did the trial court have an opportunity to consider lauren allegations.lauren argument implies that a court bears a sua sponte duty to uncover any omissions,inconsistencies,or falsehoods in the parties income and expense declarations,but she cites no authority for this proposition.alicia suggests a party waives objections to an opposing party income and expense declaration by failing to object below.alicia,supra,th at no abuse of discretion where court awarded fees based on mother income and expense declaration averring biological father income exceeded,because father did not counter evidence and argue otherwise at the hearing.we decline to consider lauren contention raised on appeal.in re marriage of falcone fyke th at.
on the issue of the reasonableness of opri fees,section,subdivision a authorizes awards only for reasonably necessary fees.lauren contends the court did not find the fees charged by her attorney to be unreasonable.but in the absence of a statement of decision,we must infer a finding in favor of the judgment on this controverted issue.this is particularly appropriate in light of the court statement that the law does not give an attorney carte blanche to litigate the case without limitation and the disparity between the fees charged by kevin counsel and those charged by opri.given that we must infer findings in favor of the judgment,we interpret the court observation that lauren counsel forged ahead,incurring attorney fees far in excess of either party reasonable ability to pay,as referring to the unreasonableness of the fees charged,not as lauren interprets the statement to lauren choice to defend herself against kevin paternity claim.the court,in denying lauren request for fee sanctions,found that neither party acted in bad faith or unreasonably in prosecuting or defending the matter.contrary to lauren view,this latter finding was not an affirmation that the fees charged by her attorney were reasonable.
finally,lauren argues the court improperly found that the payments made by lauren father constituted support to her and therefore lauren and kevin had a roughly equal ability to pay fees.she relies on this court opinion in in re marriage of schulze th,where a noncustodial father challenged an order requiring him to pay spousal and child support.id.at.there,the trial court ordered the father to pay immediately and in full a sum of for his former wife attorney fees.id.at.it was clear the trial judge presumed the father would be able to obtain the from his parents because they had previously lent him about to pay his own fees.id.at.schulze found that presumption to be erroneous,stating,charity,once extended,is still not an entitlement.id.at.but that statement related to a loan made by the parents for a particular purpose,as opposed to regular,recurrent monetary gifts intended as support for living expenses on this subject of gifts,schulze declined to explore the nature of parental gifts to adult children who themselves have their own support obligations.the really tough case which may be safely left for another day would be that of the scion of a wealthy family whose parents are not his or her employers and who still manages to live quite well even on a low annual gross income as defined by section computation of annual gross income for purposes of child support because of bona fide nontaxable gifts from his or her parents id.at,fn.
the nature of a parent recurrent gifts to an adult child was subsequently examined in in re marriage of alter th.there,the appellate court stated that where a party receives recurring gifts of money,the trial court has discretion to consider that money as income for purposes of child support.id.at.the former husband in alter,who sought reduction of an existing child support order id.at,had received regular monthly payments from his mother for many years id.at.he claimed the payments were loans,produced promissory notes as evidence,and averred his mother loans to him would not continue.id.at.the appellate court found substantial evidence the payments were gifts,noting,inter alia,that no evidence showed the former husband ever repaid any of the money.id.at.the court of appeal then addressed whether recurring,monetary gifts may be characterized as income under the relevant child support statute.id.at.it concluded that nothing in the law prohibits considering gifts to be income for purposes of child support so long as the gifts bear a reasonable relationship to the traditional meaning of income as a recurrent monetary benefit.id.at.in reach
