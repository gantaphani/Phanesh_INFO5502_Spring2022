in this case,we conclude that the reporting requirement in civil code section violates the free speech rights of prescription drug claims processors.we also conclude the court properly granted respondents special motion to strike and did not abuse its discretion in the award of attorney fees.
factual and procedural summary 
section,subdivision b defines a prescription drug claims processor as any nongovernmental entity which has a contractual relationship with purchasers of prepaid or insured prescription drug benefits,and which processes,consults,advises on,or otherwise assists in the processing of prepaid or insured prescription drug benefit claims submitted by a licensed california pharmacy or patron thereof.

section provides the legal consequences for violation of the statute s tatutory damages of not less than one thousand dollars or more than ten thousand dollars depending on the severity or gravity of the violation may be imposed,plus reasonable attorney fees and costs,declaratory and injunctive relief,and any other relief which the court deems proper.any owner of a licensed california pharmacy shall have standing to bring an action seeking a civil remedy pursuant to this section so long as his or her pharmacy has a contractual relationship with,or renders pharmaceutical services to,a beneficiary of a client of the prescription drug claims processor,against whom the action is brought 
in this action,appellant,a licensed california pharmacy,sued respondents as drug claims processors according to the allegations of the complaint,respondents repeatedly violated section by failing to provide the fee studies required by subdivision c.appellant alleged this conduct also constituted an unfair business practice within the meaning of business and professions code section.appellant sought statutory damages for these violations,and disgorgement of profits.
the court sustained respondents demurrer to the third cause of action for unjust enrichment,without leave to amend.respondents moved for judgment on the pleadings directed at the remaining causes of action,on the ground that the reporting requirement was compelled speech which violated the federal and state constitutions respondents also brought a special motion to strike the complaint as a strategic lawsuit against public participation slapp pursuant to code of civil procedure section.the court granted judgment on the pleadings,finding the reporting requirement in section violated the free speech clause of the california constitution.cal,art.i.to avoid the necessity of a remand in the event the judgment on the pleadings was reversed on appeal,the trial court also granted the special motion to strike as an alternative ruling and awarded fees to respondents.the two appeals before us,no.from the judgment,and no.from the award of attorney fees,have been consolidated for oral argument and decision.
discussion 
the trial court based its decision solely on the free speech clause of the state constitution.article i,section of the california constitution provides a every person may freely speak,write and publish his or her sentiments on all subjects,being responsible for the abuse of this right.a law may not restrain or abridge liberty of speech or press.article i free speech clause enjoys existence and force independent of the first amendment to the federal constitution.gerawan i,supra,cal th at,d.the state constitution free speech clause is at least as broad,and in some ways broader,than the comparable provision of the federal constitution.kasky nike,cal th,d.
because speech results from what a speaker chooses to say and what he chooses not to say,the right in question comprises both a right to speak freely and also a right to refrain from doing so at all,and is therefore put at risk both by prohibiting a speaker from saying what he otherwise would say and also by compelling him to say what he otherwise would not say.gerawan i,supra,cal th,d,see also riley national federation of blind,d.the prohibition against compelled speech encompasses compelled access,where a speaker is required to disseminate the speech of another,even if not required to endorse the content.see pacific gas public util.comm,d miami herald publishing tornillo,d.for corporations as for individuals,the choice to speak includes within it the choice of what not to say.pacific gas public util.comm n,supra,d.t his general rule,that the speaker has the right to tailor the speech,applies not only to expressions of value,opinion,or endorsement,but equally to statements of fact the speaker would rather avoid.hurley gay,lesbian and bisexual group of boston,d.
the united states supreme court has upheld constitutional challenges to compelled expression in two categories of cases true compelled speech cases,in which an individual is obliged personally to express a message he disagrees with,imposed by the government and compelled subsidy cases,in which an individual is required by the government to subsidize a message he disagrees with,expressed by a private entity.johanns livestock marketing ass,d.under this definition,section,which requires drug claims processors to obtain and transmit drug processing cost reports to its clients,is properly classified as true compelled speech,since it requires the processors to express specific content which they do not wish to present,rather than asking them to subsidize expression by another.
the attorney general,appearing as amicus curiae pursuant to california rules of court,rule c,argues that the compelled speech doctrine has no application to section because the statute is not in any constitutional sense a regulation of speech seeking to advance or retard the expression of any viewpoint.in deciding whether,under the first amendment,a given regulation of speech or expressive activity is content based,and hence subject to strict scrutiny,or instead is content neutral,and hence subject to intermediate scrutiny,time,place,and manner analysis,the high court has stated that a restriction is content neutral if it is justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech.citations.los angeles alliance for survival city of los angeles cal th,d.
in a case such as this one,where the issue is compelled speech rather than prohibited speech,the inquiry is whether the regulation requires transmission of specific content.section requires drug claims processors to transmit specific processing the processors do not wish to send to their clients.the fact that it is essentially statistical information does not make it less entitled to first amendment scrutiny.an analogous reporting requirement of statistical information was challenged in riley national federation of blind,supra,d.in that case,professional charitable solicitors were required by north carolina law to disclose to potential donors the average percentage of gross receipts actually turned over to charities by the fundraiser for all charitable solicitations conducted in the state during the previous months.at.the supreme court explained,mandating speech that a speaker would not otherwise make necessarily alters the content of the speech.we therefore consider the act as a regulation of speech.id.at.for the same reasons,section is a regulation of speech.
relying on statements in the legislative history indicating that third party reimbursement policies are unfair and inequitable to participating pharmacists,appellant argues that the cost report required by section is outside the realm of constitutional protection because it is intended to correct inaccurate and misleading speech by the drug claims processors.the government may ban forms of communication which are likely to deceive the public or are related to illegal activity.see central hudson gas public serv.comm,d gerawan i,supra,cal th at,d.there is no claim of illegal activity in this case.and we find no indication in the cited legislative history that the claimed marketplace inequities,if they exist,result from inaccurate,false,or misleading speech or silence by drug claims processors.the speech compelled by section is protected speech.
relying on johanns livestock marketing ass n,supra,d,appellant argues the processors free speech rights are not burdened by section,since the statistical reports need not be attributed to the processors.johanns is factually and analytically distinguishable.it involved a challenge by beef producers to the compelled subsidy of the beef board promotional campaigns for beef and products.johanns expressly distinguished compelled speech,which was not involved in that case,from compelled subsidy,which was involved.it also distinguished private speech,which was not involved,from government speech,which was citizens may challenge compelled support of private speech,but have no first amendment right not to fund government speech.johanns,supra.at.the challengers argued the speech should not be deemed government speech because the message could appear attributable to them.the court discussed attribution of speech as a possible theory,but declined to express a view on the point.id.at.in this case,the issue is compelled speech by drug processors,not compelled subsidy of government speech.the discussion of attribution in johanns does not affect this case.
having concluded that section is a regulation which implicates the drug claims processors right to freedom of speech,we must next consider whether that right has been violated.see gerawan i,supra,cal th at,d.for noncommercial speech entitled to full constitutional protection,a regulation is valid only if it can withstand strict scrutiny,which requires that the regulation be narrowly tailored that is,the least restrictive means to promote a compelling government interest.kasky nike,supra,cal th at,d.commercial speech is entitled to less protection.ibid.the constitutional validity of the regulation of commercial speech is tested under an intermediate standard,articulated by the united states supreme court in central hudson gas public serv.comm n,supra,d,and adopted by the california supreme court.this intermediate scrutiny considers whether the expression is protected by the first amendment,which means that the expression at least must concern lawful activity and not be misleading whether the asserted governmental interest is substantial if yes to both,then whether the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted and whether it is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.gerawan farming,kawamura cal th,d,gerawan ii,quoting central hudson gas public serv.comm n,supra,at,d.
commercial speech was described in central hudson as expression related solely to the economic interests of the speaker and its audience.central hudson gas public serv.comm n,supra,d.the core notion of commercial speech is speech which does no more than propose a commercial transaction.bolger youngs drug products,d see also registry,state of california th,d.factors such as an advertising format,product references,and economic motivation may support characterizing written materials as commercial speech.bolger,supra,at.inclusion of important public issues will not,by itself,change the characterization from commercial to noncommercial speech.id.at.commercial speech generally is directed to an audience of persons who may be influenced by that speech to engage in a commercial transaction with the speaker or the person on whose behalf the speaker is acting.kasky nike,supra,cal th,d.commercial speech typically involves statements about a product or service,or about the operations or qualifications of the person offering the product or service.kasky,at,d.
the speech compelled by section is a report by drug claims processors to third party insurers on the average fees pharmacies charge for dispensing pharmaceutical drugs to private customers.nothing about the content of this report proposes a commercial transaction between the speaker the drug claims processor and its audience insurers,health plans,and other drug benefit providers.nor does it promote the processors business,which involves processing insured or prepaid claims for drug benefit providers.while the report may relate to the economic interests of the pharmacies by highlighting the dispensing fees charged to uninsured individuals,it does not affect the economic interests of the required speakers,who process insured drug claims for drug benefit providers.the speech compelled by section is not commercial speech.
a regulation of noncommercial speech is valid under the first amendment only if it can withstand strict scrutiny,which requires that the regulation be narrowly tailored that is,the least restrictive means to promote a compelling government interest.kasky nike,supra,cal th at,d.we examine the governmental interest to be furthered by the statute.
appellant suggests the fee study was necessary because drug claims processors arbitrarily set pharmacy dispensing fees.the record citation for the assertion that the fees are arbitrary is a statement by proponents of the bill,in support of its passage proponents point out that currently such reimbursements are arbitrarily determined,being usually based on substandard fees.that statement does not support appellant claim.
the record also does not support appellant claim that processors provided false or misleading processing fee information which necessitated corrective legislative action.the information required by section is not necessary to protect the public health or safety,or even the public fisc it is not aimed at protecting consumers,or insurers,from being misled.see united states united foods,d.nor is section aimed at eliminating possible unfair economic practices of drug claims processors by requiring them to disclose their own conflicts of interest and financial arrangements with third parties,as in pharmaceutical care management ass rowe cir.
in a related argument,the attorney general likens section to disclosure statutes aimed at protecting the general public.he argues that if we subject this simple statistical reporting statute to the most exacting standard applied to the suppression or coerced utterance of ideas and beliefs,then a host of disclosure and reporting statutes would become immediately suspect,such as the required disclosure of financial information by corporations to shareholders or by condominium associations to its homeowners the required disclosure of the contents of packaged foods the requirement that car dealers and repair facilities provide information about where to lodge official complaints and the requirement that creditors advise defaulting debtors of their legal rights.each of these examples involves the dissemination of information necessary for the protection of the general public.section is not in that category.contrary to the apprehension expressed in the amicus curiae brief,nothing in this opinion places these sorts of consumer protection statutes at risk.
