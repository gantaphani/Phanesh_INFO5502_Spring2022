we must decide various challenges to a settlement of these suits against the manufacturer of consumer dishwashers.
between and,general electric ge manufactured and sold approximately three million ge and dishwashers equipped with a sliding energy saver switch.although some were sold to individual consumers,the dishwashers were considered low end products and were primarily marketed to contractors,builders,and owners of commercial or rental properties.the switch,which allows a user to select either a heated drying cycle or drip drying,deteriorates over time and may melt or ignite.
reports of fires caused by the allegedly defective switch eventually prompted an investigation by the consumer product safety commission cpsc.although the investigation found that no consumers had been physically injured,it determined that approximately fires could be attributed to the switch,three of which damaged property other than the dishwasher itself.under the terms of a formal settlement agreement between ge and the cpsc,ge announced a recall of the dishwashers in october.ge advised consumers to stop using the dishwashers immediately,and offered a choice between a cash rebate toward the purchase of a dishwasher or a cash refund toward the purchase of a dishwasher,along with a free service agreement with ge.ge also agreed to replace dishwashers still under extended service agreements.the agreement also permitted ge to reach a separate agreement with owners and operators of commercial and residential properties that could include discounted bulk pricing and instructions to repair the switch by rewiring.dissatisfied with the rebate program,some consumers turned to the courts.
the first of the two underlying actions consolidated in this appeal was filed in november.churchill village,churchill,an oregon corporation and owner of an apartment building in eugene,oregon,sued ge both individually and on behalf of the general public in the northern district of california,asserting claims under california unfair competition and false advertising laws and seeking injunctive relief and restitution.churchill asserted federal jurisdiction against ge a new york corporation headquartered in connecticut based on diversity of citizenship,contending that injunctive relief as measured by the cost to the defendant exceeded the requirement.see.jurisdiction over the claims was asserted on the principles of supplemental jurisdiction in.the complaint was later amended to add two individual plaintiffs,al and barbara dorsett,citizens of california.churchill and the dorsetts then sought a preliminary injunction,which the district court denied on may.churchill village,d.
also in may,seymour lazar,a california citizen,sued ge in the northern district of california on behalf of himself,the general public,and a putative class of consumer owners.lazar general electric,no.c.in addition to violations of california unfair competition and false advertising laws,the complaint alleged counts of fraud and violations of federal law.federal jurisdiction was thus asserted on the existence of a federal question under,with supplemental jurisdiction over the claims under.
contemporaneously with the churchill and lazar suits in california,beckwith place limited partnership beckwith,a michigan property owner,sued ge in illinois state court in december,seeking to represent a nationwide class of.other consumers filed class actions in connecticut state court in march.
still other consumers sued ge in both state and federal court in florida in december and february respectively.the florida plaintiffs were represented by james,hoyer,newcomer smiljanich,levin,tannenbaum,wolff and cauley,geller,bowman coates,collectively florida counsel,who allege entitlement to attorneys fees in this litigation.
finally,the new york attorney general brought suit in new york state court in march,challenging ge initial dishwasher recall as deceptive.the action resulted in an award of restitution for new york consumers who purchased new dishwashers in reliance on ge statements that repair of the recalled dishwashers was impracticable.new york consumers were therefore excluded from the nationwide class approved by the district court.
following motions and discovery,the churchill plaintiffs reached a settlement agreement with ge.churchill agreed to file and did so on august,a consolidated amended complaint seeking certification of a class under.b under the terms of the settlement agreement,ge agreed to provide each class member with either a cash rebate or a service contract.
after churchill moved the district court for preliminary approval of the proposed settlement,representing the two sets of plaintiffs pursuing class actions against ge in state court in illinois and to intervene to object.the beckwith objectors were permitted to present their objections to the proposed settlement in writing and participated in the preliminary approval and fairness hearings.the district court denied the intervention motion and preliminarily approved the proposed settlement.
on january,the district court issued a final order approving the settlement,dismissing with prejudice all claims by members of the settlement class,awarding fees to churchill counsel,and denying fees to florida counsel.the beckwith objectors now appeal the district court approval of the settlement and florida counsel appeal the denial of attorneys fees,claiming that they were responsible for catalyzing churchill successful result.recognizing that florida counsel claim shared a common progenitor with churchill settlement,we consolidated these appeals.
as a threshold matter,churchill disputes whether the beckwith objectors have any right to appeal.churchill points out that the district court certified the settlement class under.b,thereby permitting objecting class members like beckwith to exclude themselves from the settlement.because the objectors can opt out,churchill contends that they suffer no injury and thus lack standing to appeal.
but the issue is not precisely one of standing.as the supreme court has noted,neither article iii nor prudential standing is implicated by the efforts of objectors to appeal settlements.see devlin scardelletti,d.instead,the inquiry is best characterized as concerning the definition of a party for purposes of appeal.id.and the devlin court made clear that objectors should be considered parties,holding that class members who have objected in a timely manner to approval of the settlement at the fairness hearing have the power to bring an appeal without first intervening.id.at.
churchill urges that we read devlin narrowly.there,the court relied on the fact that devlin was unable to opt out of the rule b class.here,by contrast,the beckwith objectors may exclude themselves from the settlement and thus preserve their right to seek relief from ge.yet this ostensible independence is belied by an essential impracticability.because each objector claim is too small to justify individual litigation,a class action is the only feasible means of obtaining relief.by terminating all class actions relating to the dishwasher recall,the settlement will effectively bind the objectors.they therefore occupy precisely the status the devlin court sought to protect.see id.at.what is most important to this case is that nonnamed class members are parties to the proceedings in the sense of being bound by the settlement.it is this feature of class action litigation that requires that class members be allowed to appeal the approval of a settlement when they have objected at the fairness hearing.
we are satisfied that devlin applies here sufficiently to permit the beckwith objectors to challenge the settlement approved by the district court.such a reading of devlin is consistent,moreover,with our longstanding practice of permitting objecting class members to appeal settlements.see marshall holiday magic,cir allowing class members who had not opted out to appeal settlement dosier miami valley broad,cir noting that unnamed class member who was represented by counsel at settlement conference could have challenged it by direct appeal in re cement antitrust,cir a class member may appeal from an order approving a settlement to which the member objects.see also moore federal practice ed arguing for a broad reading of devlin.
because we conclude that beckwith may appeal the approval of the settlement,we now turn to the merits.
beckwith first contends that the district court lacked jurisdiction.churchill counters that either federal question or diversity jurisdiction prevailed.
was there federal question jurisdiction both the may lazar complaint and the consolidated complaint alleged that ge operation of the dishwasher recall program violated the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico.both complaints named ge as the rico person under and the recall program as the rico enterprise under.both alleged that ge committed numerous violations of federal mail and wire fraud statutes as it engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity relating to the recall program.in telephone calls and correspondence,according to the complaints,ge misled the cpsc about the defective nature of the dishwashers.the complaints also alleged that ge deceived affected customers by downplaying the seriousness of the dishwashers defects attempting to reduce ge costs to remedy the defects and fraudulently inducing customers to purchase other ge products.
more specifically,the complaints alleged that ge violated a by using income derived from its pattern of racketeering activity to establish or operate the recall program the complaints further alleged that ge violated b when it used its pattern of racketeering activity to acquire or to maintain an interest in or control of the recall program and violated c by conducting the recall program through a pattern of racketeering activity the complaints added a conspiracy count under d churchill now contends that these recitals are enough to confer federal question jurisdiction under 
beckwith succinct response is that the rico claims are wholly without merit and incapable of supporting federal jurisdiction.pointing to our decision in rae union bank,cir,they argue that it is that c requires that the person and enterprise be distinct,and that ge and the recall program are here insufficiently distinct to trigger rico liability.beckwith contends that the rico claims are terminally flawed,and thus the district court should not have entertained the action.
let us remember that the standard for establishing federal jurisdiction is even less stringent than that required to state a claim under.b.as we have explained,any assertion of a federal claim suffices to establish federal question jurisdiction,even if that claim is later dismissed on the merits.bollard.province of the soc y of jesus,cir see also cement masons health and welfare trust fund for stone,cir.
although the claim under c indeed appears entirely foreclosed by our decision in rae,we need not evaluate the merits or probability of success of that claim,for churchill has pleaded sufficiently claims under a and b.we have not required that the rico person and enterprise be distinct in actions under these subsections.see wilcox first interstate bank of,cir see also schreiber distrib.furniture,cir w here a corporation engages in racketeering activities and is the direct or indirect beneficiary of the pattern of racketeering activity,it can be both the person and the enterprise under section a.churchill sufficiently alleged that income derived indirectly from acts of mail and wire fraud forming a pattern of racketeering activity was used in the establishment and operation of the injurious recall enterprise,as required by a.see nugget hydroelectric,pac.gas and,cir plaintiff under a must allege facts tending to show that he or she was injured by the use or investment of racketeering income.and the complaints also alleged that ge maintained control of the recall program through acts of mail and wire fraud comprising a pattern of racketeering,as required by b.see wagh metris direct,cir explaining that,in order to survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,the plaintiff must allege an injury stemming from defendant control over a rico enterprise.
we express no opinion regarding the likelihood of success on these claims,noting only that our cases have permitted rico plaintiffs to amend inadequately pleaded claims to avoid dismissal under the more stringent standard mandated by.b.see kempe monitor intermediaries,cir.but we can not say that churchill claims under subsections a and b are so untenable in light of their conformity to the plain language of the statute and the absence of a distinctiveness requirement as to prohibit federal jurisdiction under the assertion standard announced in bollard.the district court therefore properly exercised jurisdiction over the settlement.
because we are satisfied that the district court possessed federal question jurisdiction,we need not reach the question of whether it had diversity jurisdiction as well.
beckwith next contends that the notice of settlement was defective because it failed adequately to inform class members about the status of other litigation arising from the dishwasher recall 
c prescribes the best notice practicable under the circumstances.notice is satisfactory if it generally describes the terms of the settlement in sufficient detail to alert those with adverse viewpoints to investigate and to come forward and be heard.mendoza tucson sch.dist,cir.the notice approved by the district court met this standard.apart from informing class members of the settlement terms,the notice also listed the names,case numbers,and courts of pending actions in illinois,florida,new york,and connecticut.the district court ordered that this information be included in the notice in response to concerns expressed by the beckwith objectors at the preliminary approval hearing.under the circumstances,we are satisfied that the notice approved by the district court provided absent class members with the opportunity to and individually pursue any state law remedies that might provide a better opportunity for recovery.hanlon chrysler,cir.
finally,beckwith challenges the fairness and adequacy of the settlement approved by the district court.we are required to determine whether the district court abused its discretion in balancing the following factors the strength of the plaintiffs case the risk,expense,complexity,and likely duration of further litigation the risk of maintaining class action status throughout the trial the amount offered in settlement the extent of discovery completed and the stage of the proceedings the experience and views of counsel the presence of a governmental participant and the reaction of the class members to the proposed settlement.see hanlon,at in addition,although strong judicial policy favors settlements,see class plaintiffs city of seattle,cir,the settlement may not be the product of collusion among the negotiating parties.id.at.
in this case,churchill presented the district court with a memorandum of points and authorities that referred to the correct standard the district court examined the memorandum and considered the relevant factors in concluding that the settlement was fair,adequate,and reasonable.although beckwith faults the district court for not producing written findings of fact,we have not required a formal written response where the district court provide s a reasoned response elsewhere in the record.in re pac.enters.sec,cir.here,the record reveals that the district court appropriately considered the relevant factors,which we now analyze in turn 
the strength of the plaintiffs case.the settlement was approved in september,almost two years after litigation commenced.in rejecting churchill request for a preliminary injunction,the district court concluded that the plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on the merits.see churchill,d at.moreover,ge three summary judgment motions were pending before the court.the court also considered the merits of the case in the preliminary approval and fairness hearings,at which the beckwith objectors were permitted to present their objections to the proposed settlement the objectors were also allowed to offer written objections.in sum,the d
