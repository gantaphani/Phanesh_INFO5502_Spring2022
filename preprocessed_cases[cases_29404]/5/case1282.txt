the two issues before us spring from a dispute between rival water providers attempting to connect service to a dona ana county,new mexico resident.that rivalry spilled into federal court when moongate water company sought a declaratory judgment that its competitor,butterfield park mutual domestic water association,could not dampen competition by invoking the territorial protections provided by b.in two separate orders,the district court disagreed,first,deciding that butterfield outstanding indebtedness and continuing service to the area prohibited moongate encroachment and,second,that butterfield redress of its rights warranted attorney fees under b.moongate water,butterfield park mutual domestic water association,d this appeal challenges both decisions.we affirm,in part,and reverse,in part.
background 
butterfield park is a association incorporated in under new mexico law,the sanitary projects act of the law of,to provide water and sewer service to a specified territory.under its promulgated rules and regulations,residents apply for water service,sign a membership agreement,show proof of property ownership,pay certain fees,and agree to an easement on their property for butterfield to construct and maintain water and sewer service.
since,butterfield provided water to berry patch lane,a property which was sold in to frances hutson,a medically disabled woman.butterfield then contacted hutson,advising her of its rules and regulations and requesting she provide a membership application and proof of ownership as well as an easement for a water line over her property.after repeatedly explaining the consequences of her noncompliance,butterfield terminated service to hutson property.
the following week,moongate,a public utility incorporated under the new mexico public utility act,stat.ann.through,and regulated by the new mexico public regulatory commission nmprc,connected hutson to its water system.prior to running the line,moongate asked the nmprc whether it could connect hutson property without a formal order.the nmprc responded in a letter,it does not appear to staff that moongate would be required to get an order from the nmprc in compliance with the final order in nmprc case,to extend service to this customer.moongate also contacted other customers in the butterfield service area offering water service at lower cost.
to plug this leak to its service area,butterfield demanded moongate disconnect the hutson water line because it encroached upon territory protected by b.that protection was afforded by a provision of the consolidated farm and rural development act,et the act,which authorized the farmers home administration fmha to make loans and grants to designated associations to develop and operate water distribution and sewer service facilities in rural areas.in and,the fmha had loaned butterfield the money to construct its facilities.however,in,driven by budgetary concerns,congress authorized the secretary of agriculture to sell the fmha loans extended under the act.butterfield notes were then transferred to the community property trust,and general electric credit corporation became the servicing agent for the trustee.ten years later,gmac financial services gmac was substituted as agent for the trustee.butterfield informed moongate these outstanding loans prohibited moongate from extending service into its territory.
moongate then filed the underlying action in federal court seeking a declaratory judgment that b monopoly protection is unavailable to butterfield.in support,it alleged butterfield fmha indebtedness did not transfer to assignees of the notes and butterfield was not serving hutson at the time moongate extended service.
relying on sequoyah county rural water dist.town of muldrow,cir,which sets forth the requisite elements to muster b protection,a qualified water association must,first,have a continuing indebtedness to the fmha,and,second,have provided or made available service to the disputed area,the district court concluded butterfield is entitled to b protection to its service area.the court found,butterfield ability to repay its federal loan and to provide a low per user cost to its customers depends in part on the economic and territorial integrity of its service area.moongate,d at.
in a second unpublished order,the district court concluded moongate,though a private company,is,in fact,substantially regulated by the nmprc and possesses powers,especially to condemn property,which typically belong to a state actor.under this analysis,moongate action in extending a water line to the disputed property was done under color of state law.though recognizing its discretion to award fees,especially in light of moongate representation it relied on nmprc advice and in good faith provided water to a woman with serious health problems whom butterfield ignored when it terminated service,the court concluded attorney fees were available as a matter of law but should nonetheless be reasonable to avoid proliferating the litigation.moongate challenges both orders.
ii.application of b 
section b is a component in a federal statutory scheme to extend loans and grants to certain associations providing soil conservation practices,water service or management,waste facilities,or essential community facilities to farmers,ranchers,and other rural residents.glenpool util.servs.auth.creek county rural water dist,cir.in return for such indebtedness,congress tied protection from competition,providing 
the service provided or made available through any such association shall not be curtailed or limited by inclusion of the area served by such association within the boundaries of any municipal corporation or other public body,or by the granting of any private franchise for similar service within such area during the term of such loan nor shall the happening of any such event be the basis of requiring such association to secure any franchise,license,or permit as a condition to continuing to serve the area served by the association at the time of the occurrence of such event.
b.in sequoyah,we acknowledged congress express intent to assist in protecting the territory served by such an association facility against competitive facilities,which might otherwise be developed with the expansion of the boundaries of municipal and other public bodies into an area served by the rural system.at quoting,reprinted in.
in challenging the district court conclusion butterfield is entitled to b protection against its competitive service,moongate contends butterfield indebtedness was extinguished when congress required the transfer of its fmha loans to private lenders under the omnibus budget reconciliation act of,a,stat.obra,without specifically attaching the antitrust provision.although congress later amended obra to carry over the monopoly protection of b,moongate maintains that amendment represents a change to existing law,not a clarification as the district court found thus,the amendment is presumed to apply prospectively.moongate faults the district court masking this error in statutory construction by too broadly applying sequoyah proviso that doubts over whether a water association is entitled to protection from competition under b should be resolved in favor of the party seeking protection for its territory.moongate,d at quoting sequoyah,at citation omitted.
at the time butterfield transferred its fmha loans to a private lender,congress did not intend to extend monopoly protection,moongate asserts.it advocates we should distinguish this case from sequoyah and bell arthur water greenville utils.comm n,cir,by constructing a moat around this perceived statutory lapse which,it asserts,neither this precedent nor legislative history can bridge.the confluence of this statutory interpretation with important policy concerns disfavoring monopolies mandates reversal,moongate urges.we disagree.
in the fourth circuit case,bell arthur,a water service corporation,sought protection under b against a city and its utilities commission which,it alleged,encroached upon its service area.bell arthur,however,had repurchased and cancelled all of its outstanding notes to the fmha but contende
