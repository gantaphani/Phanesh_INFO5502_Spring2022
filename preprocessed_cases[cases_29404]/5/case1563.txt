we granted review in this case to address whether code of civil procedure section as amended in,authorizes trial courts to award sanctions,including attorney fees,for bad faith litigation actions or tactics that arise from a claim initiated after december.we conclude that the statutory language of section and related statutes,and other indicia of legislative intent,establish that section does not apply to conduct arising from a claim initiated after december.to the extent the court of appeal reached a contrary result,its judgment must be reversed.
facts and procedural history 
as the result of a september auto accident,olmstead and cheri gallagher company gallagher,an insurance broker,and vicki sundgren,a gallagher recover underinsured motorist benefits allegedly due under an insurance policy.following a trial,the jury returned a defense verdict on all claims.after entry of the judgment,defendants moved,under sections and to recover attorney fees and expenses they allegedly incurred as a result of misconduct by plaintiffs during discovery and trial.defendants claimed plaintiffs lied about the existence of a critical document and concealed information about other insurance policies.
the trial court denied sanctions under section because defendants failed to comply with the statute notice requirement the trial court refused sanctions under section because it determined that section is entirely inapplicable to lawsuits initiated after december.
after the trial court entered its order,defendants sought reconsideration.in their reconsideration motion,defendants stated they had discovered new evidence that during discovery,plaintiffs submitted a false no answer to a defense interrogatory inquiring whether they were pursuing any other lawsuit related to the accident.defendants urged this conduct was sanctionable under section,which prohibits misuse of the discovery process by,among other things,m aking an evasive response to discovery,subd.a see also,subd.b.the trial court granted reconsideration but denied sanctions on the merits.the court reasoned that an unequivocal,though false,answer is not evasive within the meaning of section.
defendants appealed from the order denying sanctions they urged that section authorized sanctions for plaintiffs false interrogatory response,that sanctions for plaintiffs other deceptive conduct was available under both sections and,and that the trial court had inherent authority to award sanctions in any event.
the court of appeal reversed and remanded.the appellate court concluded that section applies,even in lawsuits,to bad faith litigation tactics except those related to the filing of complaints or,or the making or opposing of motions.the court expressly disagreed with consistent statements or assumptions in the case law see text discussion,post that section,as amended in,and section create two mutually exclusive sanctions schemes,with the former statute applicable only to actions commenced before,and the latter only to suits begun on or after,january.
the court of appeal also determined that section authorizes sanctions for discovery misuses beyond those,such as evasive responses,that are specifically enumerated in the statute.the court of appeal concluded that a blatantly false interrogatory response,even if not technically evasive,must qualify as a sanctionable misuse of the discovery process.
plaintiffs sought review on both the section and section issues.we granted review,but we limited the issues to whether section authorizes sanctions for bad faith conduct or litigation abuses that occurred after december,or whether the imposition of sanctions for such conduct is governed solely by section.we now conclude that section does not apply to actions and proceedings.
discussion 
in bauguess paine cal d,bauguess,we held that trial courts may not award attorney fees as a sanction for misconduct unless they do so pursuant to statutory authority or an agreement of the parties.id.at.although bauguess acknowledged that trial courts possess inherent powers to supervise judicial proceedings,our decision placed limits on these powers to avoid the serious due process problems that would arise if trial courts had unfettered authority to award fees as sanctions.id.at.hence,bauguess prohibited a trial court from using fee awards to punish misconduct unless the legislature,or the parties,authorized the court to impose fees as a sanction.
the legislature enacted section in response to our decision in bauguess.stats,ch,it is the intent of this legislation to broaden the powers of trial courts by authorizing monetary sanctions not presently authorized by the interpretation of the law in bauguess.originally,section authorized e very trial court to order payment of reasonable expenses,including attorney fees,incurred as a result of a litigation opponent tactics or actions not based on good faith which are frivolous or which cause unnecessary delay.former,subd.a,as added by stats,ch.in its original form,section further provided that f rivolous actions or delaying tactics include,but are not limited to,making or opposing motions without good faith.ibid.
in,the legislature amended section to authorize trial courts to award reasonable expenses,including attorney fees,as a sanction for actions or tactics that are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay,subd.a section a,as amended by stats,ch,italics added.the amendment also added subdivision b to section,providing,inter alia,that a ctions or tactics include,but are not limited to,the making or opposing of motions or the filing and service of a complaint or,former subd.b,as added by stats,ch.
in,the legislature amended section again.stats,ch.subdivision b was modified to provide that sanctionable a ctions or tactics include,but are not limited to,the making or opposing of motions or the filing and service of a complaint or only if the actions or tactics arise from a complaint filed,or a proceeding initiated,on or before december,subd.b section b,as amended by stats,ch,italics added.
when the legislature made this change,it simultaneously enacted sections and.stats,ch.section is modeled on rule of the federal rules of civil procedure crowley katleman cal th,d,fn.crowley,and sets requirements for every pleading,petition,written notice of motion,or other similar paper presented to a court,subds.a,b.under section,every such document must be signed by counsel,or personally by an unrepresented party,subd.a.the signer thereby certifies that to the best of his knowledge,information,and belief,and after reasonable inquiry,the document is not presented for an improper purpose such as harassment,delay,or needless increase in litigation costs and contains no allegations,factual or legal contentions,claims,defenses,or denials that lack colorable support,subd.b.section authorizes monetary sanctions for violations,including reasonable resulting expenses and attorney fees,but only after the alleged violator has received notice and a specified time to correct or withdraw the challenged pleading,subd.c.
as enacted in and thereafter in effect,section applies only to a complaint or petition filed on or after january,and any other pleading,written notice of motion,or other similar paper filed in such a proceeding,subd.i,italics added.section originally had a sunset date,a date on which it would automatically expire unless january,former subd.j,as enacted by stats,ch.that date has twice been extended,first to january,former subd.j,as amended by stats,ch,and then to january,subd.j,as amended by stats,ch.
section,adopted concurrently with section and the amendment to section stats,ch,originally provided that it would take effect on january,unless section remained in effect beyond that date,former subd.f,as enacted by stats,ch.in,when section.sunset date was extended to january,section was amended accordingly to reflect that it would take effect on that later date unless section was further extended as has since occurred,subd.f,as amended by stats,ch.thus,section will become operative only if and when section is no longer in effect.subject to this contingency,section reenacts the exact sanctions scheme currently set forth in section,deleting only section limitation to actions.
plaintiffs contend that the legislature amendment to section,and its simultaneous enactment of section,established two mutually exclusive sanctions regimes,with section solely applicable in proceedings initiated on or before december,and section solely applicable in proceedings initiated after that date.defendants,like the court of appeal,insist that the statutes overlap in proceedings initiated after,and that while the amendment to section eliminated its application to certain pleadings and motions abuses committed in proceedings,the amendments did not affect the statute application,in such proceedings,to other forms of litigation misconduct it had previously covered.for the reasons that follow,we agree with plaintiffs reading.
our fundamental task in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute.citation.day city of fontana cal th,d.to accomplish this task,we look first to the words of the statute,because they generally provide the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.diamond multimedia systems,superior court cal th,d,quoting hsu abbara cal th,d.of course,the language of a specific section must be construed in the context of the larger statutory scheme of which it is a part,renee superior court cal th,d,phelps stostad cal th,d,see robert superior court cal th,d.
section a provides,in relevant part,that e very trial court may order a party,the party attorney,or both to pay any reasonable expenses,including attorney fees,incurred by another party as a result of actions or tactics that are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay.hence,section a only permits a trial court to award attorney fees as a sanction if it finds that a party engaged in certain bad faith actions or tactics.
section b defines the actions or tactics that are subject to sanction under section a.as amended in,section b provides that these include,but are not limited to,the making or opposing of motions or the filing and service of a complaint or only if the actions or tactics arise from a complaint filed,or a proceeding initiated,on or before december.italics added.
most reasonably read,this language suggests the following sanctionable actions or tactics are confined to behavior that arises from a complaint filed,or a proceeding initiated,prior to.conduct that arises from a suit commenced after december,does not qualify as actions or tactics within the meaning of section b,so it furnishes no basis for an award of sanctions under section a.
the court of appeal determined that the time limitation set forth in section b extends only to pleadings and motions abuses.as a result,the court concluded,section a continues to authorize fee awards in proceedings for litigation abuses unrelated to pleadings or motions,such as those at issue here.
for several reasons,we find this interpretation unpersuasive.in the first place,it contradicts the most plausible import of section words,particularly the way in which the statute repeats the crucial phrase actions or tactics.
as indicated above,section a limits its reach to actions or tactics italics added.section b then defines actions or tactics as includ ing,but not limited to misconduct related to pleadings and motions.italics added.this definition obviously encompasses both misconduct in the described category and other misconduct.section b then further provides that the actions or tactics are included only if they arise in a action or proceeding.the court of appeal construction fails to explain why this second reference to actions and tactics does not,like the first,include both kinds of misconduct,and thus limit all misconduct otherwise covered by section to that arising in actions.
the court of appeal appears to have understood amended section b as follows actions or tactics shall include misconduct related to pleadings and motions only in cases filed before.in later cases,by contrast,actions or tactics shall have a more limited scope,but will still encompass some kinds of litigation abuse.that is,they shall exclude misconduct related to pleadings and motions,but not the other forms of misconduct that were also included for purposes of actions.
however,this strains the language of section b by overlooking that the word include is followed by the phrase but are not limited to.italics added.this latter phrase seems an integral part of the definition of actions or tactics for all purposes.thus,the most natural reading of the subdivision is that actions or tactics include,but are not limited to both kinds of misconduct in actions filed both on or before,and after,december.
the court of appeal observed that it would have been simpler for the legislature to have added a separate subdivision to section if it wished to limit a for all purposes.yet the usual and ordinary meaning dafonte,cal th,d,of the language the legislature did use in the amendment to section b most strongly supports the conclusion that the date limitation therein set forth applies to all forms of sanctionable actions or tactics.
this interpretation is confirmed by viewing the language of section b in the context of the larger statutory scheme.as noted above,the bill that amended section assem.bill reg.sess.assembly bill also provided for the enactment of sections and.under the scheme adopted at that time,section,which provides a separate,sanctions system applicable to motions and pleadings abuses,took effect the day after december,subd.i.section,which mimics the sanctions scheme set forth in section,only takes effect if section is repealed,subd.f.the dates chosen for the operation of each of these statutes suggest that the legislature did not intend for them to apply concurrently.rather,they appear to establish a tripartite scheme,with section governing in claims filed on or before december,section governing in claims filed after that date,and section governing in the event that section is repealed.
we may also test our construction against those extrinsic aids that bear on the enactors intent.powers city of richmond cal th,d.both the structure of the legislature regulation of misconduct in litigation,and the legislative history of section,support our conclusion that section a does not reach litigation abuses in proceedings commenced after december.
in particular,the legislature would not have enacted section,and made its operation contingent upon the repeal of section,if section a was meant to apply concurrently with section.as noted above,section mirrors section,except its definition of sanctionable actions or tactics is not limited to conduct that stems from an action initiated on or before december,subd.b.section expressly states that it does not operate concurrently with section,subd.f.it is highly unlikely the legislature would duplicate section,word for word,in a statute that expressly does not overlap with section if it intended sections and to apply in tandem.if sections and did operate concurrently,and section became inoperative because the legislature chose not to extend its sunset date,sections and would apply at the same time,a result the legislature can not reasonably have intended.
indeed,the legislative history of the amendments to section makes it clear that the legislature intended sections,and to apply independently,during different time frames.early drafts of assembly bill would have repealed current section in its entirety,then enacted a new section to mirror current section.assem.amend.to assem.bill,see assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill,as amended,this bill r epeals code of civil procedure section and r section to,essentially,replicate the recently revised federal rule.
later,the assembly decided to amend,rather than repeal,section,and to enact a separate statute,current section.assem.amend.to assem.bill,may.this amendment limited section b definition of actions or tactics to those that arise from a complaint filed or proceeding initiated on or before december,and specified that section would only apply to actions filed on,or after,january.assem.amend.to assem.
