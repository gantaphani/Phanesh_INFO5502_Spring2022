background 
the parties 
plaintiffs are former students who enrolled in a culinary school owned operated by defendants california school of culinary arts,and career education corporation.in their amended consolidated complaint,plaintiffs allege that defendants defrauded them into enrolling in culinary school by numerous misrepresentations about graduation rates,employment prospects after graduation,and anticipated income levels.plaintiffs asserted claims for fraud,breach of contract,and violations of the unfair competition law,consumer legal remedies act,and the private postsecondary and vocational education reform act.
sallie mae services student loans obtained by some of the plaintiffs for the purpose of attending defendants culinary program 
the business records subpoenas 
plaintiffs issued a business records subpoena to sallie mae on july,the first subpoena seeking production of their loan files.sallie mae responded with an august,letter offering to comply with the first subpoena if plaintiffs agreed to pay sallie mae processing fees,including,as authorized by evidence code section,subdivision b,per page for photocopies and per hour for clerical time.the letter explained that the average borrower file consists of approximately pages and requires between two and three hours of clerical time to process and that some borrowers may have multiple loans and multiple loan files.obtaining the requested documents could thus have cost the plaintiffs with sallie mae loans more than.
because the cost of obtaining hard copies of their loan files was prohibitive,plaintiffs revised their document request by serving a second subpoena on september,the second subpoena.the second subpoena sought electronically stored information consisting of specific data fields on student loans for plaintiffs and requested that the information be produced on digital data disk s in a reasonably usable form,in a format that is electronically searchable and sortable.the second subpoena also requested a cost estimate for complying with the subpoena before sallie mae produced the electronically stored information.
upon sallie mae receipt of the second subpoena,counsel engaged in an email exchange in which plaintiffs repeatedly asked sallie mae for a revised cost estimate for producing the requested electronically stored information.sallie mae counsel initially refused to comply with the subpoena,stating that sallie mae has no obligation to do research on the loans and to prepare a spreadsheet.sallie mae counsel also expressed doubt that plaintiff revised request would significantly reduce the cost,given the research involved.plaintiffs counsel explained that the second subpoena was not a request for research,but a request for data sallie mae maintains in its database.sallie mae counsel refused to provide a cost estimate and referred plaintiff counsel to the cost statute.salle mae then filed a motion to quash the business records subpoena on october.
motion to quash 
in its motion to quash,sallie mae argued that the business records subpoena was improper because it sought information that was irrelevant and unrelated to the underlying lawsuit it sought information that plaintiffs already had it improperly imposed on sallie mae an affirmative duty to do something other than produce existing documents and records and it shifted the cost and burden of plaintiffs litigation efforts to sallie mae.sallie mae also filed objections to the business records subpoena on various grounds,including that it was unduly burdensome,that the information sought was not relevant or was already in plaintiffs possession,and was outside the proper scope of discovery,in that it would require sallie mae to perform research,implement information technology programming,and create a spreadsheet.
plaintiffs opposed the motion to quash,arguing that the requested information was relevant to their action against defendants and that they did not have that information.plaintiffs further argued that they were entitled,under code of civil procedure section to require sallie mae to produce the requested electronically stored information on digital data disks in a format that is electronically searchable and sortable.plaintiffs acknowledged their obligation to pay the reasonable costs sallie mae would incur in complying with the second subpoena,but argued that they were not required to pay for the cost of producing paper records they were not seeking.plaintiffs claimed sallie mae lacked substantial justification for its motion to quash and asked the trial court to award them reasonable attorney fees and expenses incurred in opposing the motion.in reply to plaintiffs opposition,sallie mae continued to argue that the subpoena improperly sought to have sallie mae undertake electronic data research for free.
the trial court denied sallie mae motion to quash,finding that the information sought by plaintiffs was relevant and not already in their possession.the court concluded that sallie mae was obligated,under section,subdivision b,to provide the requested information in accordance with plaintiffs specifications.the trial court further found that sallie mae objections to the subpoena,including the objection that plaintiffs were seeking to avoid paying the reasonable cost of complying with the subpoena,to be without merit.the trial court stated that although the court can not conclude that the motion was made in bad faith,many of the objections appear to be without substantial justification,particularly in view of the fact that sallie mae,continues to make arguments such as costs which plaintiffs have already agreed to pay.the trial court ordered plaintiffs and sallie mae to meet and confer regarding compliance with the subpoena and scheduled a further hearing on plaintiffs request for attorney fees.
request for attorney fees 
plaintiffs and sallie mae submitted a joint status report in connection with the hearing on plaintiffs request for attorney fees.plaintiffs reported that sallie mae had estimated the cost of complying with the business records subpoena at and had provided a declaration explaining its estimate.plaintiffs stated they were willing to pay sallie mae estimated price subject to a credit of for the costs incurred in opposing sallie mae motion to quash.plaintiffs further stated they had requested ownership of the computer code sallie mae would write in order to comply with the subpoena to avoid incurring the same programming costs for future productions.
sallie mae stated that complying with the subpoena would require a complex computer programming and data extraction project that would cost.the cost estimate,and programming and data extraction tasks necessary to comply with the subpoena were explained in detail in a declaration by sallie mae senior director of systems development.sallie mae further stated that it had rejected plaintiffs proposal that they own any computer code sallie mae creates in order to comply with the subpoena.sallie mae urged the court to deny plaintiffs request for attorney fees,arguing that plaintiffs continued to unreasonably resist the costs associated with compliance.
