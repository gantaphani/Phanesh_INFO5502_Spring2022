agnes bernardo,pamela colip and saundra collectively,bernardo brought suit for injunctive relief against planned parenthood federation of america ppfa and planned parenthood of san diego and riverside counties ppsdrc together planned parenthood under california unfair competition law bus,et and false advertising law bus,et.bernardo alleged that ppfa and ppsdrc internet web sites and http,respectively contained unlawful,unfair,confusing,and misleading that caused women to make critical health care decisions without full,complete,and accurate information about the safety of abortion,the safety of abortion childbirth,and the literature that bernardo claims establishes a link between induced abortion and breast cancer hereafter sometimes referred to as the abc link.
bernardo sought two types of injunctive relief an injunction restraining planned parenthood from publishing its statements that abortion is safe or safer than childbirth and its position that the weight of credible medical research has failed to establish a link between induced abortion and breast cancer and a mandatory injunction requiring planned parenthood to provide to all of its former and prospective abortion patients information supporting bernardo position that medical research has established the existence of the claimed abc link.
planned parenthood filed a special motion to strike bernardo complaint under code of civil procedure section,california strategic lawsuits against public participation statute hereafter referred to as section or the statute,which was specifically enacted to provide both a summary disposition and mandatory attorney fees and costs to prevailing defendants in such actions planned parenthood argued that bernardo action was a strategic lawsuit against public participation slapp prohibited by california statute.
the court found that bernardo lawsuit was a slapp,granted planned parenthood motion,and dismissed the action.the court awarded reasonable attorney fees to planned parenthood in the amount of under the mandatory attorney fees provision of section,subdivision c hereafter section c.
bernardo has filed two appeals,which have been consolidated for purposes of disposition.in case no,bernardo appeals the court order dismissing her action as a slapp under section.bernardo contends that planned parenthood web site statements constitute commercial speech that may properly be regulated under business and professions code sections and and that the court erred when it granted planned parenthood section motion to strike because it failed to properly apply the minimal merit screening standard provided by the statute.in the alternative,bernardo contends that if the court correctly applied section,that statute is unconstitutional because it impermissibly chills bernardo first amendment right to petition the government for redress of grievances,which encompasses the right to access the courts by filing litigation,and it violates bernardo due process rights because the reasonable probability of success on the merits standard under section is meaningless in practice.
in her second appeal,case no,bernardo seeks reversal of the court order awarding attorney fees to planned parenthood in the amount of under section c.bernardo contends that section c is unconstitutional on its face and as applied,asserting the attorney fees award levied against her is a fine,a draconian penalty or strict liability penalty,and an item of damages that violates her constitutional rights to petition the government for redress of grievances and to access the courts by filing litigation,as well as her constitutional rights to due process and equal protection of the laws.we reject all of bernardo contentions.accordingly,we affirm the orders.

in the,ppfa reported total annual revenues of around to million.for the year ending june,total revenues were million,with clinic revenue accounting for percent.
ppfa web site and fact sheets 
ppfa maintains an internet web site ppfa web site at.ppfa assists the public in contacting its affiliates health centers by providing on its web site an interactive dialogue box in which visitors can type in their zip codes and be linked to the web sites of the health centers closest to them.once the visitor to ppfa web site has been linked to the web site of a ppfa affiliate,such as ppsdrc,he or she may access a wide array of information on public affairs and health issues,as well as information about specific services the affiliate provides.ppfa web site also provides a telephone number that the web site visitor may call to ask medical questions or to schedule an appointment with the nearest planned parenthood center.
ppfa publishes on its web site various fact sheets on reproductive health and public affairs issues,including four containing statements that bernardo sought to enjoin in this matter claims about abortion and breast cancer the claims web page choosing and answers the choosing abortion web page surgical answers the surgical abortion web page and medical and social health benefits since abortion was made legal in the the medical and social health benefits web page.
ppfa claims web page stated ppfa position that the abc link is a theory that has not been borne out by research,and the principal promoters of this theory oppose abortion.it also explained that t he theory linking pregnancy termination and breast cancer is based on the hormonal disruption that occurs when a woman pregnancy is interrupted.pregnancy initiates a surge of sex hormones estrogen,progesterone,and prolactin,which leads to differentiation of the cells in the breast glands in preparation for lactation adherents of this theory claim that interruption of the first trimester of a first pregnancy causes a cessation of cell differentiation that may result in a subsequent increase in the risk of cancerous growth in these tissues.the web page also explained the role of a first pregnancy in reducing the risk of breast cancer hereafter the protective effect 
while researchers do not know what causes breast cancer,reproductive factors have been associated with risk for the disease since the century,when breast cancer was noted to be more prevalent among nuns.it is known that having a pregnancy early in a woman childbearing years is protective against breast cancer italics added.
the claims web page also contained a review of some of the many studies of the alleged abc link published during the previous years,including studies that support bernardo position that such a link exists.for example,the page stated 
in,joel brind,and his colleagues published a of published reports describing studies on induced abortion and breast cancer.based on these studies,the authors calculated that induced abortion places women at a slightly increased risk for developing breast cancer.
the web page also noted that a published study of women in the state of washington found that among women who had been pregnant at least once,the risk of breast cancer in those who had experienced an induced abortion was percent higher than among other women.
the claims web page reviewed other studies that support ppfa position on the abc link issue,such as a study of million women,published in in the new england journal of medicine,which ppfa asserted found no overall connection between abortion and breast cancer it also cited a study of women in sweden,published in,which ppfa stated found no indication of an overall risk of breast cancer after an induced abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy 
ppfa claims web page also discussed research concerning various factors that can render a study of the abc link unreliable and asserted that c ancer researchers at the national cancer institute,the american cancer society,and major universities say that the most reliable studies show no increased risk,and they consider the entire body of research inconclusive.the web page concluded with a works cited bibliography that cited published studies on the abc link issue,including brind and others that support bernardo position on the abc link.
in its choosing abortion web page,ppfa answered the question does abortion cause breast cancer by stating,no.but abortion does not offer the same protection against breast cancer as a full term pregnancy.
on ppfa surgical abortion web page,a visitor could select the question what are the health risks of abortion,which would connect the visitor to another page that answered the question by stating,in the first weeks,abortion is much safer than giving birth.this statement,however,was followed by an explanation of eight c omplications from early abortion,including death.ppfa stated that death occurs in of abortions,and c hildbirth carries seven times more risk.
bernardo also tried to enjoin portions of ppfa medical and social health benefits web page.bernardo objected to both the use of the phrase safe,legal abortion and the following statement 
today,abortion is one of the most commonly performed clinical procedures,and the current death rate from abortion at all stages of gestation is per procedures.this is eleven times safer than carrying a pregnancy to term and nearly twice as safe as a penicillin injection citations.italics added.
ppsdrc web site and fact sheets 
ppsdrc internet web site ppsdrc web site is found at.like ppfa,ppsdrc publishes various web site pages that address reproductive health and public affairs issues,including some that bernardo tried to suppress in this matter.for example,ppsdrc web site contained a fact sheet titled abortion info q a future pregnancies the abortion info web page,which answered the question does abortion cause breast cancer by stating,no,but abortion does not offer the protection against breast cancer that having several pregnancies does.
terms of use of planned parenthood web sites 
both ppfa and ppsdrc included in their web sites a page notifying web site visitors that planned parenthood provided the web sites subject to the visitors agreement to comply with the terms of use.each page informed visitors that the information provided on the web sites was for the visitors personal education only and that nothing on the web sites constituted a recommendation for medical care.each page also advised visitors to a rm yourself with good information about sexual and reproductive health maintenance,and visit a qualified health care provider for personal medical evaluation,counseling,and services.italics added.
bernardo slapp complaint 
in august,bernardo filed her slapp complaint for injunctive relief against planned parenthood under california unfair competition law bus,et,hereafter the ucl and false advertising law bus,et,hereafter the fal.bernardo alleged that ppfa and ppsdrc internet web sites contained unlawful,unfair,confusing,and misleading that caused women to make critical health care decisions without full,complete,and accurate information about the safety of abortion,the safety of abortion childbirth,and the literature that bernardo believed established the existence of the abc link.
injunctive relief requested 
in her complaint,bernardo sought an injunction restraining planned parenthood from publishing statements that abortion is safe or safer than childbirth and that the weight of credible medical research has failed to establish a link between induced abortion and breast cancer.in effect,bernardo action thus sought to enjoin portions of ppfa claims,choosing abortion,surgical abortion and medical and social health benefits web pages,as well as ppsdrc abortion info web page all of which are discussed,ante.
bernardo also sought a mandatory injunction requiring planned parenthood to provide to all of its former and prospective abortion patients a series of statements drafted by bernardo and her counsel that support bernardo view that medical research has established the existence of the claimed abc link 
brind affidavit 
in support of these allegations,bernardo attached to her complaint an affidavit of joel brind,brind,a professor of biology in the department of natural sciences of baruch college of the city university of new york,and the author of a paper titled,induced abortion as an independent risk factor for breast cancer a comprehensive review and hereafter brind which was published in in the british medical association journal of epidemiology and community health.
in his affidavit,brind stated that of independent studies published worldwide that presented specific data on induced abortion and the incidence of breast cancer,had reported a statistically significant increase in the risk of breast cancer overall among women who have one or more induced abortions,and had reported a risk increase that did not achieve statistical significance.he also stated that three of the studies reported no tendency for increased or decreased risk,three reported a decrease in risk that did not achieve statistical significance,and three reported a statistically significant decrease in risk.he explained that,as he discussed in his,when he compiled the data for all studies,using either a weighted or unweighted average,he calculated that the risk of breast cancer among those women who had experienced an induced abortion was percent higher than among women who had not,independently of the effect due to abortion delay of first pregnancy,and since the lifetime risk of breast cancer for an average american woman is between and percent,this percent increase amounts in absolute terms to at least a three percent,or in,excess risk of developing breast cancer.
brind also opined in his affidavit that ppfa claims web page is a thoroughly biased and misleading presentation of the scientific literature on this subject,which creates the untrue misleading impression that the preponderance of the scientific analysis supports the assertion that there is no link between induced abortion and increased risk of breast cancer.he challenged numerous specific statements contained in the claims web page.
brind opined that planned parenthood answer of no to the question does abortion cause breast cancer was untrue misleading,because the overwhelming preponderance of the evidence indicates that abortion does cause breast cancer,both by removing the protection against breast cancer to be gained by completing the pregnancy already in progress,and by increasing the risk of breast cancer independently of the loss of this protective effect.he also opined that the planned parenthood web site statements he challenged were likely to mislead reasonable members of the public as to the safety of abortion,the safety of abortion childbirth,and the link between induced abortion and breast cancer.
planned parenthood special motion to strike under the statute 
planned parenthood filed a special motion under the statute to strike bernardo complaint.planned parenthood argued that the complaint was a meritless slapp intended to use california consumer protection statutes bus,et et to thwart planned parenthood from exercising its constitutional right to speak about abortion stop it from providing free information on the w orld w ide w eb regarding abortion,an issue of great public concern,and on the related issue of breast cancer and abortion force it to adopt bernardo view of medicine on planned parenthood own web sites and tell women that abortion causes breast cancer and frighten women into refraining from exercising a constitutional right to reproductive choice based on very questionable science and bernardo agenda.
planned parenthood also argued that bernardo could not meet her burden under the statute section,subd.b,hereafter b of showing a probability that she would prevail on any of her claims because planned parenthood advised all visitors to its web sites in the terms of use discussed,ante that the health information provided on the web sites was for the visitors personal education only the information did not concern any product or service within the meaning of the ucl,nor did it concern or advertise any product or service within the meaning of the fal,and thus did not fall within the ambit of these consumer protection statutes and even if it did,the web site health information was supported by ample scientific studies as shown by the supporting expert declarations of four health professionals.
in support of the motion to strike,planned parenthood submitted the declarations of david preskill,the chief of service for obstetrics and gynecology at southern california kaiser permanente in san diego georgia robbins sadler,associate clinical professor of surgery at the university of california,san diego ucsd school of medicine,and the associate director for outreach at the ucsd cancer center steven drosman,the former chief of the obstetrics and gynecology section of sharp memorial hospital and currently the chief of staff for sharp mary birch hospital for women at sharp memorial hospital,and polly newcomb,who is a member of the fred hutchinson cancer research center in seattle,washington,a professor of epidemiology at the university of washington school of public health,and an associate editor who provides editorial service to epidemiology journals,including the new england journal of medicine and the american journal of epidemiology.
planned parenthood filed a written request that the court take judicial notice of the fact that abortion is one of the most controversial political issues in our nation.
bernardo opposed the special motion to strike,asserting that this case is not about the right to abortion.bernardo contended the motion should be denied on two main grounds planned parenthood speech was false and misleading,such speech was not entitled to legal protection,and thus planned parenthood had failed to make the requisite prima facie showing that they were engaged in protected activity within the meaning of section and bernardo was able to make a prima facie showing of a probability of succeeding on the merits because planned parenthood web site statements were made in connection with their offer of abortion services so as to constitute advertising within the meaning of the ucl and fal,and bernardo had all but conclusive evidence that those statements misled the public about the safety of abortion,the safety of abortion childbirth,and the evidence showing that induced abortion increases the risk of breast cancer.
in support of her opposition,bernardo submitted the declarations of all three individual appellants brind declaration and the declaration of five medical doctors,one from each medical specialty required to address the increased risk of breast cancer caused by induced abortion over the life of the woman,who all opined that induced abortion causes increased risk of breast cancer elizabeth shadigian,a board certified engaged in clinical practice and teaching at the university of michigan school of medicine jane anderson,a board certified pediatrician teaching at the university of california,san francisco chris kahlenborn,a board certified physician of internal medicine engaged in clinical practice and epidemiological research who has published on the abc link jose bufill,bufill,who studied medicine at the university of navarre in spain,and is practicing oncology and hematology and teaching at the indiana university school of medicine and angela lanfranchi,a surgeon specializing in breast surgery and a clinical professor at robert wood johnson medical school.
order granting planned parenthood motion to strike 
the court granted planned parenthood motion to strike bernardo complaint under the statute on the ground that bernardo had failed to show the requisite probability of prevailing on the merits of the complaint and obtaining the injunctive relief she sought.specifically,the court found that the challenged statements in planned parenthood web pages could not be construed as pure commercial speech or pure advertisement and,even if they could be so construed,bernardo had failed to present sufficient evidence to show a probability of prevailing on the ucl and fal claims that planned parenthood web site statements were unlawful,that they constituted an unfair or fraudulent business practice,and that they also constituted false or deceptive advertising.the court noted that contrary to bernardo argument that planned parenthood web sites were deceptive by failing to recognize the protective effect against breast cancer that a pregnancy provides,bernardo had acknowledged planned parenthood statement in the choosing abortion and abortion info web pages that abortion does not offer the same protection against breast cancer as a full term pregnancy.the court also noted bernardo allegation that planned parenthood had made a false statement of fact by claiming that abortion is safer than childbirth,but found that this allegation was centered on bernardo position that abortion causes breast cancer and that her own evidence showed there were two camps of thought and an debate in the scientific community on the issue of whether there is link between induced abortion and breast cancer.the court further found that planned parenthood had not failed to disclose in its claims web page that numerous studies supported bernardo position that induced abortions increase a woman risk of breast cancer.in appeal no,bernardo has appealed the order granting planned parenthood section motion to strike.
order awarding attorney fees to planned parenthood 
planned parenthood brought a motion for a mandatory award of attorney fees under section c in the amount of.bernardo opposed the motion,claiming the lawsuit was not a sham that planned parenthood was seeking an improper enhancement on a contingency fee basis that would punish bernardo counsel in violation of his due process rights to notice and that an award of fees under section c would violate bernardo rights under the united states and california constitutions to petition the government for redress of grievances and exercise free speech in connection with a public issue,as well as bernardo due process right to meaningful notice as to when mandatory costs and fees will be levied,and the guarantee of equal protection in that section c functions as a penalty for certain suits and creates an invidious distinction between classes of litigants and causes which is not narrowly tailored to achieve any compelling governmental interest.
the court issued an order granting the attorney fees motion and awarding attorney fees to planned parenthood in the sum of.in appeal no,bernardo has appealed that order.
discussion 
appeal from the order granting planned parenthood motion to strike the complaint under the statute 
for reasons we shall explain,we independently conclude that planned parenthood was entitled to a judgment of dismissal under the statute because in opposing planned parenthood motion to strike under section,bernardo failed to state and substantiate a legally sufficient claim and thus failed to meet her statutory burden of showing a reasonable probability of prevailing on the claims for injunctive relief asserted in her complaint.
standard of review 
we review the trial court rulings on a slapp motion independently under a de novo standard of review.kajima engineering,city of los angeles th,d.
overview of section 
in dowling,supra,th at page,d,this court explained that a slapp lawsuit is generally defined as a meritless suit filed primarily to chill the defendant exercise of first amendment rights.citation.slapp suits are brought,not to vindicate a legal right,but rather to interfere with the defendant ability to pursue his or her interests.characteristically,the slapp suit lacks merit it will achieve its objective if it depletes defendant resources or energy.the aim is not to win the lawsuit but to detract the defendant from his or her objective,which is adverse to the plaintiff.citation.citation.
as we also observed in dowling,s ection was enacted in to deter and prevent slapp suits,and is designed to protect citizens in the exercise of their first amendment constitutional rights of free speech and petition.citation.the statute is california response to the problems created by meritless lawsuits brought to harass those who have exercised these rights.citation.california enacted section to provide a procedural remedy to resolve such a suit expeditiously.citation.dowling,supra,th at,d,italics omitted.
the legislature expressly set forth the intent and purpose underlying the statute in section,subdivision a,which provides 
the legislature finds and declares that there has been a disturbing increase in lawsuits brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances.the legislature finds and declares that it is in the public interest to encourage continued participation in matters of public significance,and that this participation should not be chilled through abuse of the judicial process.to this end,this section shall be construed broadly.
we further explained in dowling that the common features of slapp suits are their lack of merit and chilling of defendants valid exercise of free speech and the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances.citation.section was intended to address those features by providing a fast and inexpensive unmasking and dismissal of slapp.citations.citation.dowling,supra,th at,d.
special motion to strike slapp suits 
section b authorizes a special motion to strike a slapp suit,and expressly makes subject to such a motion a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.dowling,supra,th at,d,italics added by dowling.
in dowling,we noted that s ubdivision e of section expressly defines the first amendment activity from which a cause of action must arise within the meaning of section b in order to be the proper subject of a special motion to strike under the statute.citation.subdivision e,as amended in,provides that the phrase act in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue,as used in section,includes four categories of conduct,which are separately defined in the subdivision four clauses a ny written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative,executive,or judicial proceeding,or any other official proceeding authorized by law,subd.e a ny written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive,or judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law,subd.e a ny written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest,subd.e italics added by dowling or a ny other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest,subd.e.dowling,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted.
burdens of proof 
in navellier sletten cal th,d,navellier,the california supreme court explained the process that a court must follow in determining whether an action is a slapp within the meaning of section.first,the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity.b.a defendant meets this burden by demonstrating that the act underlying the plaintiff cause fits one of the categories spelled out in section,subdivision e citation.if the court finds that such a showing has been made,it must then determine whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.b see generally equilon enterprises consumer cause.cal th,d,equilon.navellier,supra,cal th at,d.
the navellier court also explained that in order to establish the requisite probability of prevailing b,the plaintiff need only have stated and substantiated a legally sufficient claim.citation.put another way,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.citation.only a cause of action that satisfies both prongs of the,that arises from protected speech or petitioning and lacks even minimal a slapp,subject to being stricken under the statute.navellier,supra,cal th at,d.
in making its determination,the court shall consider the pleadings,and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based,subd.b.t hough the court does not weigh the credibility or comparative probative strength of competing evidence,it should grant the motion if,as a matter of law,the defendant evidence supporting the motion defeats the plaintiff attempt to establish evidentiary support for the claim.citation.wilson parker,covert chidester cal th,d.
the record shows bernardo did not and can not meet her statutory burden under the statute of showing a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits of her claims for injunctive relief because bernardo own evidence shows that planned parenthood challenged statements about the claimed abc link were expressions of opinion about an issue of genuine scientific debate,and those statements were noncommercial speech fully protected under the first amendment to the united states constitution and not actionable under either the ucl or fal bernardo challenge to planned parenthood statements regarding the safety of abortion failed as a matter of law because her own evidence showed that this challenge was based on the unsupported premise that the claimed abc link was an established scientific fact and were we to assume planned parenthood web site statements were commercial speech that consisted of or were based on statements of fact,not opinion,bernardo failed to show a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits of her claims that the statements were unlawful,unfair or fraudulent within the meaning of business and professions code section or constituted false advertising within the meaning of business and professions code section.we reject bernardo contentions that the court improperly weighed the evidence and improperly applied section in violation of bernardo constitutional rights.
the challenged statements are fully protected noncommercial speech 
bernardo can not show a probability of prevailing on the merits of her claims because her own evidence shows planned parenthood challenged speech regarding the central disputed issue of whether induced abortion causes breast cancer was noncommercial speech entitled to full first amendment protection,and thus was not actionable under business and professions code sections or.
commercial speech is usually defined as speech that does no more than propose a commercial transaction.united states united foods,d,citing virginia bd.of pharmacy virginia citizens consumer council,d.the united states supreme court has held that the federal constitution accords less protection to commercial speech than to other constitutionally safeguarded forms of expression.bolger youngs drug products,d bolger.
in kasky nike,cal th,d,nike,the california supreme court explained that f or noncommercial speech entitled to full first amendment protection,a regulation is valid under the first amendment only if it can withstand strict scrutiny,which requires that the regulation be narrowly tailored that is,the least restrictive means to promote a compelling government interest.citations.we note that planned parenthood asserts,and the record shows,that bernardo does not claim that planned parenthood speech may be regulated under business and professions code sections or if it is noncommercial speech.
here,bernardo own evidence in opposition to planned parenthood motion to strike shows that planned parenthood speech on the claimed abc link is noncommercial speech entitled to full first amendment protection.bernardo complaint alleged that ppfa and ppsdrc internet web sites contained unlawful,unfair,confusing,and misleading in violation of business and professions code sections and that caused women to make critical health care decisions without full,complete,and accurate information about the safety of abortion in general,the safety of abortion childbirth,and the literature that bernardo claims establishes a link between induced abortion and breast cancer.
in opposing planned parenthood motion to strike the complaint under the statute,bernardo submitted photocopies of the various challenged documents that planned parenthood published on its web sites ppfa claims web page ppfa choosing abortion web page ppfa surgical abortion web page ppfa medical and social health benefits web page and ppsdrc abortion info web page.on appeal,bernardo maintains she met her burden of showing a probability of prevailing on her claim that planned parenthood made false statements of fact on those web pages by claiming that abortion is safer than childbirth and that induced abortion does not cause breast cancer.
the evidence submitted by bernardo shows,however,that none of planned parenthood challenged web pages proposed a commercial transaction in its contents.rather,they were all educational in nature and asserted planned parenthood positions on disputed scientific and medical issues of public interest with which bernardo strenuously disagreed for example,ppfa claims web page,which addressed the claimed abc link that was of central importance in bernardo action against planned parenthood,stated ppfa position that the abc link is a theory that has not been borne out by research explained the abc link theory and asserted that the principal promoters of that theory opposed abortion the web page also contained a review of some of the many studies of the alleged abc link published over the previous years,including some,such as brind see fn,ante,that support bernardo position that such a link exists,and others that supported ppfa position on the abc link issue,such as a study of million women,published in by the new england journal of medicine see fn,ante,which,according to ppfa,found no overall connection between abortion and breast cancer.the claims web page also discussed research regarding various factors that can render a study of the claimed abc link unreliable and concluded with a works cited bibliography that cited published studies on the abc link issue,including brind and others that support bernardo position on the abc link.the foregoing shows that ppfa claims web page was educational,not commercial,in nature.
in support of the contention that planned parenthood statements are commercial speech,bernardo points to the authenticated photocopies of planned parenthood web sites that she submitted in opposition to the motion to strike,which show that on v irtually every web page,ppfa provided health info,health centers and sexual health hyperlinks that provided web site visitors with access to sexual health information and the locations of affiliated health centers including ppsdrc,as well as a telephone number that visitors could call to schedule an appointment and that ppsdrc web pages provided visitors with an opportunity to obtain payment information and clinic locations and to make an appointment.the brief text of the hyperlinks such as health info,health centers and sexual health on the various web pages did not advertise or promote any services provided by clinics affiliated with planned parenthood.while the number provided to web site visitors a means for scheduling an appointment for medical services,it is significant that both ppfa and ppsdrc included in their web sites a page notifying visitors that planned parenthood was providing the web sites subject to the visitors agreement to comply with the terms of use.each page informed visitors that the information provided on planned parenthood web sites was for the visitors personal education,but nothing on this site constitutes a recommendation for medical care italics added.each page also advised visitors to a rm yourself with good information about sexual and reproductive health maintenance,and visit a qualified health care provider for personal medical evaluation,counseling,and services.
bernardo also relies on the fact that ppsdrc and other affiliates of ppfa provide abortion and other services from which ppfa and the affiliates derive revenue.however,any economic motivation that planned parenthood may have had in publishing the challenged web site speech regarding the claimed abc link and the safety of abortion would be insufficient by itself to turn the statements into commercial speech.in bolger,supra,d,a manufacturer and distributor of contraceptives brought an action for declaratory and injunctive relief challenging a federal statute that prohibited the unsolicited mailing of contraceptive advertisements.id.at.the manufacturer decided to undertake a campaign of mailing to the public on an unsolicited basis some informational pamphlets among other things that not only promoted its products,but also contained discussions of important public issues such as venereal disease and family planning.id.at.the supreme court found that most of the manufacturer mailings fell within the core notion of commercial speech speech which does no more than propose a commercial transaction.citations.id.at.although the bolger court held that the mailings constituted commercial speech,noting that the informational pamphlets were conceded to be advertisements ibid,the high court explained that the fact that the manufacturer ha d an economic motivation for mailing the pamphlets would clearly be insufficient by itself to turn the materials into commercial speech.citations.id.at.similarly here,any economic motivation planned parenthood may have had in publishing the web site speech that bernardo challenges in this case would be insufficient by itself to turn the statements into commercial speech actionable under the ucl and fal.
even were we to assume that the number and planned parenthood hyperlinks to information about specific clinics and services constituted commercial speech,the noncommercial speech published in the various web pages would still receive full first amendment protection.in pacific gas public util.comm,d,the united states supreme court held that a utility newsletter,which was distributed to ratepayers in the monthly billing envelopes and the contents of which ranged from political editorials to energy saving tips and billing information,extend ed well beyond speech that proposes a business transaction citations,and include d the kind of discussion of matters of public concern that the first amendment both fully protects and implicitly encourages.citation.under similar reasoning,planned parenthood noncommercial speech in the various web pages at issue here was fully protected under the first amendment despite any claimed contiguous commercial speech set forth directly or indirectly in the hyperlinks or in the text accompanying the telephone number,discussed,ante.
bernardo also relies on nike,supra,cal th,d,as supporting her contention that planned parenthood speech is commercial.bernardo reliance on nike,however,is misplaced.
in nike,the plaintiff,acting on behalf of the general public,brought suit under the ucl and fal alleging that the defendant corporation,nike,nike,responded to public criticism and induced consumers to continue to buy its products by making false statements of fact about its labor practices and about working conditions in factories that made its products.nike,supra,cal th at,d.specifically,the plaintiff alleged that nike made statements in press releases,in letters to newspapers,in a letter to university presidents and athletic directors,and in other documents distributed for public relations purposes to the effect that workers who made nike products were protected from physical and sexual abuse,that they were paid in accordance with applicable local laws and regulations governing wages and hours,that they were paid on average double the applicable local minimum wage,that they received a living wage,that they received free meals and health care,and that their working conditions were in compliance with applicable local laws and regulations governing occupational health and safety.id.at,d.the california supreme court reversed the court of appeal judgment affirming the trial court judgment of dismissal after the trial court sustained nike demurrer without leave to amend on the ground nike statements were constitutionally protected noncommercial speech.id.at,d.
in holding that nike speech was commercial,the supreme court articulated and applied a test the nike test,stating that when a court must decide whether particular speech may be subjected to laws aimed at preventing false advertising or other forms of commercial deception,categorizing a particular statement as commercial or noncommercial speech requires consideration of three elements the speaker,the intended audience,and the content of the message.nike,supra,cal th at,d,original italics.the nike court explained that i n typical commercial speech cases,the speaker is likely to be someone engaged in is,generally,the production,distribution,or sale of goods or someone acting on behalf of a person so engaged,and the intended audience is likely to be actual or potential buyers or customers of the speaker goods or services,or persons acting for actual or potential buyers or customers,or persons such as reporters or reviewers likely to repeat the message to or otherwise influence actual or potential buyers or customers,original italics.with respect to the element of the nike test,the high court stated that the factual content of the message should be commercial in character.in the context of regulation of false or misleading advertising,this typically means that the speech consists of representations of fact about the business operations,products,or services of the speaker or the individual or company that the speaker represents,made for the purpose of promoting sales of,or other commercial transactions in,the speaker products or services.id.at,d,italics added.the court rephrased its nike test by stating that in relation to regulations aimed at protecting consumers from false and misleading promotional practices,commercial speech must consist of factual representations about the business operations,products,or services of the speaker or the individual or company on whose behalf the speaker is speaking,made for the purpose of promoting sales of,or other commercial transactions in,the speaker products or services.id.at,d,italics added.thus,the three elements of the nike test are a commercial speaker,an intended commercial audience,and representations of fact of a commercial nature.see id.at,d.the high court stressed that the ucl and fal do not suppress points of view but instead suppress false and misleading statements of fact.nike,supra,cal th at,d.
applying the foregoing elements of the nike test to the record presented in this appeal,we conclude that bernardo failed to show a reasonable probability of prevailing on her contention that planned parenthood speech is commercial under that test.assuming without deciding that planned parenthood is a commercial speaker on the ground it receives revenue from affiliated health centers,bernardo has failed to show that planned parenthood web site statements regarding the claimed abc link and the safety of abortion constitute representations of fact of a commercial nature within the meaning of the nike test.in nike,the supreme court held that this third element of the nike test was satisfied because i n describing its own labor policies,and the practices and working conditions in factories where its products are made,nike was making factual representations about its own business operations.nike,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.the court further explained that i n speaking to consumers about working conditions and labor practices in the factories where its products are made,nike addressed matters within its own knowledge.the wages paid to the factories employees,the hours they work,the way they are treated,and whether the environmental conditions under which they work violate local health and safety laws,are all matters likely to be within the personal knowledge of nike executives,employees,or subcontractors.thus,nike was in a position to readily verify the truth of any factual assertions it made on these topics.ibid.
here,however,bernardo sought to enjoin not readily verifiable factual assertions about matters within planned parenthood own knowledge,but planned parenthood statements of opinion about the claimed abc link that one of bernardo own experts,bufill,conceded was the subject of t wo schools of scientific debate.see fn,ante.
bernardo does not claim,nor can she,that the claimed abc link,a matter of genuine scientific debate,is a matter that is within planned parenthood own knowledge within the meaning of the nike test.the evidence of the claims web page submitted by bernardo shows that ppfa stated therein under the subheading,the planned parenthood position is that abortion poses no demonstrated health risks original boldface,that t he link between induced abortion and breast cancer is a theory that has not been borne out by research.the reference to planned parenthood position indicates that planned parenthood was expressing its opinion about this disputed theory.bufill,in his declaration filed by bernardo in opposition to planned parenthood motion to strike the complaint under the statute,specifically discussed the school to which planned parenthood indisputably belongs that argues there is no causal association between induced abortion and breast cancer,and stated that t he arguments they offer in support of their opinion center on a critique of the statistical methods used in the epidemiologic studies specifically addressing the association italics added.thus,bernardo expert witness evidence shows that the position taken on the abc link issue by the school to which planned parenthood belongs constitutes an opinion,not a representation of fact.
bernardo has also failed to show that the intended audience of planned parenthood web site speech was likely to be actual or potential buyers or customers of the health services of the affiliated planned parenthood centers.see nike,supra,cal th at,d.the record shows that planned parenthood statements were published on the internet,on web sites accessible by the general public,and were not directed to any particular audience.because planned parenthood challenged statements about the claimed abc link were statements of opinion to the general public about matters not within its own personal knowledge,they were not actionable under business and professions code sections and.nike,supra,cal th at,d.
bernardo has also failed to show a probability of prevailing on her claim that planned parenthood speech concerning the safety of abortion constituted commercial speech that was actionable under the ucl and fal.in her complaint bernardo challenged ppfa statement in its surgical abortion web page that i n the first weeks,abortion is much safer than giving birth ppfa statements in its medical and social health benefits web page that the current death rate from abortion at all stages of gestation is per procedures,and t his is eleven times safer than carrying a pregnancy to term and nearly twice as safe as a penicillin injection and ppsdrc statement in its abortion info web page that abortion is about twice as safe as having your tonsils out and is safer than childbirth,and abortion is times safer than giving birth up to the week of pregnancy.
on appeal,bernardo contends her evidence shows that these statements about the safety of abortion are statements of fact,not opinion,and that they are false.this contention,however,is predicated on evidence she submitted in opposition to planned parenthood motion to strike,which she maintains established that induced abortion causes breast cancer.specifically,bernardo asserts in her opening brief that planned parenthood statements of fact are false because induced abortion does cause breast cancer and,as a result,abortion is not safer than childbirth.italics added.bernardo also states that planned parenthood comparison of mortality rates of abortion and childbirth is false and misleading because it does not factor in deaths resulting from the abrogation of the protective effect caused by termination of a pregnancy via induced abortion and resulting in breast cancer deaths.
in determining whether bernardo has established a probability of prevailing on her claims under business and professions code sections and regarding planned parenthood statements about the safety of abortion,our analysis thus necessarily focuses again on planned parenthood published opinion that credible scientific evidence has not established that induced abortion increases the risk of breast cancer.bernardo claim that planned parenthood statements about the safety of abortion are false is based solely upon her claims that the abc link is an established scientific fact,and planned parenthood has misrepresented the safety of abortion by failing to factor in deaths resulting from the abrogation of the protective effect caused by termination of pregnancy via induced abortion and resulting in breast cancer deaths.however,as already discussed,bernardo own evidence established that the abc link is not an established scientific fact because,according to one of her own expert witnesses bufill,it is the disputed subject of both a genuine scientific debate and of opposing opinions held by two schools see fn,ante.bernardo own evidence also shows that she belongs to the school that believes the abc link is an established scientific fact,and planned parenthood belongs to the school that is of the opinion that it is not an established scientific fact.
we conclude the court properly found that planned parenthood challenged web site speech is not commercial speech because planned parenthood statements are not made in connection with an offer to sell abortion services,are not promotional of abortion do not propose a commercial transaction.citations.rather,planned parenthood statements are educational informative in nature,as opposed to advocating and or advertising in the sense of inducing or offering a financial transaction abortion services.under any recognized test for commercial speech,including the nike test on which bernardo relies,bernardo has failed to show a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits of her claims that planned parenthood challenged web site speech is commercial or that its statements concerning the claimed abc link and the safety of abortion are false,misleading or deceptive representations of fact that are actionable under business and professions code sections and.
assuming planned parenthood statements were statements of fact,not opinion,and commercial speech,bernardo has failed to show a reasonable probability of prevailing on her claims that the statements violated the ucl or fal 
even if planned parenthood web site statements were deemed to be commercial speech as representations of fact rather than expressions of opinion concerning the claimed abc link,bernardo own evidence shows that she failed to establish a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits of her claims that the statements violated business and professions code sections and as alleged in her complaint.
california unfair competition law prohibits unfair competition,which is defined as any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice bus.because business and professions code section is written in the disjunctive,it establishes three varieties of unfair or practices which are unlawful,or unfair,or fraudulent.citation.shvarts budget group,th,d.citing business and professions code section the supreme court in the nike case explained that n ot only public prosecutors,but also any person acting for the interests of the general public,may bring an action for relief under the ucl.nike,supra,cal th at,d.the nike court also explained that u nder this provision,a private plaintiff may bring a ucl action even when the conduct alleged to constitute unfair competition violates a statute for the direct enforcement of which there is no private right of action.citation.id.at,d.
unlawful business practice or act 
an unlawful business practice or act within the meaning of the ucl is an act or practice,committed pursuant to business activity,that is at the same time forbidden by law.citation.klein earth elements,th,d.the california supreme court has explained that b y proscribing any unlawful business practice,business and professions code section borrows violations of other laws and treats them as unlawful practices that the unfair competition law makes independently actionable.citation.communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d.
here,as the court properly found,bernardo failed to state which statute,regulation or law whether federal,state or common law planned parenthood allegedly violated.on appeal,bernardo again fails to identify any statutory,regulatory or decisional law that planned parenthood allegedly violated.we thus conclude that bernardo failed to meet her burden of stating and substantiating a legally sufficient claim of unlawfulness.navellier,supra,cal th at,d.
ii.unfair business practice or act 
the court noted that w ith regard to the definition of unfair under the ucl the law is unclear as to which definition of unfair applies in consumer cases after supra,cal th d.one commentator has stated in reference to that t he california supreme court has apparently decided to leave for another day,or leave for the appellate courts,the task of formulating a definition of unfair in consumer cases.stern,bus.practice the rutter group.in gregory albertson,th,d gregory,a decision,the court of appeal recently stated that t he term unfair is not precisely defined in the statute,and the courts have struggled to come up with a workable definition.
referring to the term unfair as used in the ucl,the california supreme court in stated that a few courts of appeal have attempted a definition,people casa blanca convalescent homes,d.a n unfair business practice occurs when it offends an established public policy or when the practice is immoral,unethical,oppressive,unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers.state farm fire casualty superior court th,d the court must weigh the utility of the defendant conduct against the gravity of the harm to the alleged victim,supra,cal th at,d.
in,which in part involved an action under the ucl by sellers of cellular telephones against a direct competitor that allegedly sold such telephones below cost to gain subscribers for its cellular service,the supreme court adopted a new test for determining whether a business practice or act is unfair within the meaning of the ucl when a plaintiff who claims to have suffered injury from a direct competitor unfair act or practice invokes business and professions code section,the word unfair in that section means conduct that threatens an incipient violation of an antitrust law,or violates the policy or spirit of one of those laws because its effects are comparable to or the same as a violation of the law,or otherwise significantly threatens or harms competition,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.in a footnote,however the high court held that this new definition does not apply to consumer cases,stating in part this case involves an action by a competitor alleging anticompetitive practices.our discussion and this test are limited to that context.nothing we say relates to actions by consumers or by competitors alleging other kinds of violations of the unfair competition law such as fraudulent or unlawful business practices or unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising.id.at,fn,d.
nevertheless,some state appellate decisions have held that the new test applies even to consumer cases.in schnall hertz th,d,which involved a class action brought by a car renter under the ucl against a car rental corporation,the court of appeal noted that t he court required that any finding of unfairness to competitors under business and professions code section be tethered to some legislatively declared policy or proof of some actual or threatened impact on competition citation schnall,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted,and stated that the schnall plaintiff ucl claim,unlike that in,does not pertain to unfair competition between direct competitors.nonetheless,accepting the suggestion of that any claims of unfairness under the ucl should be defined in connection with a legislatively declared policy,we find such a test satisfied in this case.schnall,supra,at,d.
in gregory,supra,th at page,d,the court of appeal apparently agreed with the schnall court,stating that may signal a narrower interpretation of the prohibition of unfair acts or practices in all unfair competition actions second italics added.the gregory court also stated that where a claim of an unfair act or practice is predicated on public policy,we read to require that the public policy which is a predicate to the action must be tethered to specific constitutional,statutory or regulatory provisions.gregory,supra,at,d.
we need not decide which test or definition of the term unfair applies in the instant case.we conclude that,regardless of which applies,bernardo failed to substantiate her claim that planned parenthood web site speech constituted an unfair business practice or act within the meaning of the ucl.bernardo points to no legislative policy,or to any public policy tethered to any specific constitutional,statutory or regulatory provision,which was allegedly offended or violated by planned parenthood speech.in her reply brief,bernardo continues to argue that she has detailed a long list of specific factual representations by planned parenthood that are false.italics added.for reasons already discussed,we have rejected bernardo contention that planned parenthood web site statements concerning the claimed abc link were factual representations because her own evidence shows that those statements were expressions of opinion regarding a disputed issue that is the subject of an ongoing scientific debate between proponents of bernardo view that induced abortion increases the risk of breast cancer,and proponents of planned parenthood position that credible scientific evidence does not establish such a link.the court properly found that the very fact that bernardo experts recognize and discuss the contrary opinions in their declarations shows that the issue of whether induced abortions increase the risk of breast cancer is far from being a foregone scientific conclusion.
furthermore,the authenticated photocopies of planned parenthood web pages submitted by bernardo show that ppfa explained to visitors of the claims web page that there are two opposing views on the claimed abc link.that web page contained a review of some of the many studies of the alleged abc link published during the past years,including studies that support bernardo position that such a link exists,such as brind see fn,ante and daling study published in the journal of the national cancer institute see fn,ante.the web page included a works cited bibliography that cited published studies on the abc link issue,including brind,daling study,and others works that supported bernardo position on the abc link.in addition,the web page explained the abc link theory that bernardo advocates 
the theory linking pregnancy termination and breast cancer is based on the hormonal disruption that occurs when a woman pregnancy is interrupted.pregnancy initiates a surge of sex hormones estrogen,progesterone,and prolactin,which leads to differentiation of the cells in the breast glands in preparation for lactation adherents of this theory claim that interruption of the first trimester of a first pregnancy causes a cessation of cell differentiation that may result in a subsequent increase in the risk of cancerous growth in these tissues.
the unfairness prong of business and professions code section has been used to enjoin deceptive or sharp practices.citation.klein earth elements,supra,th at,d,italics added.based on the foregoing evidence submitted by bernardo regarding ppfa statements in its claims web page concerning the school of thought on the abc link issue to which bernardo subscribes and which ppfa strenuously rejects,we conclude she failed to show that ppfa engaged in deceptive or sharp practices that may be enjoined under the ucl,and she failed to meet her burden of showing a reasonable probability of prevailing on her claim that planned parenthood web site speech on the abc link issue was an unfair practice or act within the meaning of the ucl.
iii.fraudulent business practice or act 
to establish that planned parenthood speech constituted a fraudulent business act or practice within the meaning of business and professions code section,bernardo is required to show that members of the public are likely to be deceived.nike,supra,cal th at,d,shvarts budget group,supra,th at,d.
here,bernardo has not shown,and can not show,that members of the public are likely to be deceived into procuring an abortion or any other service provided by planned parenthood or one of its affiliates based on the web site speech that bernardo seeks to enjoin.regarding the abc link issue,ppfas claims web page informed visitors that there are two schools of scientific research with opposing points of view on the issue of whether an induced abortion increases the risk of breast cancer.that web page discussed bernardo point of view as well as planned parenthood position and provided citations to all published studies and articles referenced therein.including those that supported bernardo position,thereby providing all interested visitors the means to independently view both sides of the controversy for themselves.although bernardo claims that planned parenthood statements comparing mortality rates of abortion and childbirth were false and misleading because they did not factor in deaths resulting from the abrogation of the protective effect caused by termination of pregnancy via induced abortion and resulting in breast cancer deaths,bernardo own evidence shows that ppfa expressly acknowledged in its claims web page that i t is known that having a pregnancy early in a woman childbearing years is protective against breast cancer italics added ppfa stated in its choosing abortion web page that abortion does not offer the same protection against breast cancer as a full term pregnancy italics added and ppsdrc stated in its abortion info web page that abortion does not offer the protection against breast cancer that having several pregnancies does italics added.we conclude that bernardo failed to meet her burden of showing a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits of her claims that planned parenthood speech was likely to deceive members of the public and that it constituted a fraudulent business act or practice within the meaning of the ucl.
california false advertising law bus,et makes it unlawful for any person,corporation,or any employee thereof with intent directly or indirectly to dispose of real or personal property or to perform services or to induce the public to enter into any obligation relating thereto,to make or disseminate before the public in this state,in any newspaper or other publication or in any other manner or means whatever any statement,concerning that real or personal property or those services which is untrue or misleading,and which is known,or which by the exercise of reasonable care should be known,to be untrue or misleading bus.nike,supra,cal th at,d.
the nike court explained that to state a claim under either the ucl or the false advertising law,based on false advertising or promotional practices,it is necessary only to show that members of the public are likely to be deceived.citations.nike,supra,cal th at,d.
we have already concluded that bernardo failed to show a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits of her claims that planned parenthood challenged web site speech is commercial or that its statements concerning the claimed abc link and the safety of abortion are false,misleading or deceptive representations of fact that are actionable under business and professions code sections and.were we to assume that planned parenthood speech could properly be characterized as advertising actionable under business and professions code section,we would conclude that bernardo failed to show a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits of her fal claim,because for reasons discussed,ante,her own evidence established she failed to meet her burden of showing a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits of her claim that planned parenthood speech was likely to deceive members of the public.
claim that the court improperly evaluated bernardo evidence 
bernardo contends the court engaged in an improper evaluation of her prima facie showing by repeatedly weighing the credibility of her experts and the comparative probative strength of competing evidence when addressing her claims.bernardo also complains the court repeatedly viewed evidence in the light least favorable to her claims,rejected her evidence by characterizing planned parenthood statements as education,not advertising or statements made in connection with an offer of services,and as no more than statements of opinion.bernardo maintains that the court improper evaluation of her prima facie showing produced erroneous legal conclusions,such as the court conclusion that planned parenthood web site statements were not unlawful,unfair,or fraudulent.
bernardo contentions are moot.as already discussed,we independently review the order granting planned parenthood motion to strike the complaint under the statute under a de novo standard of review kajima engineering construction,city of los angeles,supra,th at,d.we thus independently decide whether the granting of that motion was correct,but we need not decide whether the court reasoning in granting that motion was proper.
for reasons already discussed,we have concluded that bernardo own evidence in opposition to planned parenthood motion to strike shows that she did not,and could not,state and substantiate a legally sufficient claim under either the ucl or fal,and thus she failed to demonstrate a probability of prevailing as required by section b and case law interpreting that subdivision.see navellier,supra,cal th at,d.accordingly,we need not,and do not,address the specifics of bernardo contention that the court improperly evaluated her prima facie showing.
claim that application of section violated bernardo constitutional rights 
last,bernardo contends that if the court application of section is correct,then the statute violates her first amendment and due process rights.bernardo apparently maintains that the court granting of planned parenthood motion to strike her complaint under the statute violated her first amendment right to petition the government for redress of grievances by filing her lawsuit under the ucl and fal.bernardo also asserts that due process is a concept which voids laws that are vague or overbroad as well as those that deprive citizens of their rights without adequate notice,and complains that the court employed a standard that could never be predicted in that essentially required her to predict with certainty the way in which the court would view her evidence and the way in which the court would resolve questions of fact and law.specifically,she maintains that section violates her due process rights because the reasonable probability of success on the merits standard is meaningless in practice,and she complains that she has been barred from the courts of california based on a standard that,if properly applied in this case,bars all litigants but those that can predict the future.
we reject bernardo contention that application of the statute violated her first amendment rights.the california supreme court has explained that t he right to petition is not absolute,providing little or no protection for baseless litigation citation.equilon,supra,cal th at,d.here,bernardo does not dispute that planned parenthood met its threshold burden under section b of showing that bernardo claims against planned parenthood for injunctive relief under the ucl and fal arose from protected activity.the court properly took judicial notice of the fact that abortion is one of the most controversial political issues in our nation.because bernardo complaint challenged planned parenthood web site speech concerning the claimed abc link and the risks involved in abortion procedures,as planned parenthood argued in its motion papers,planned parenthood met its burden of showing that bernardo suit arose from written statement s made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest within the meaning of section,subdivision e discussed,ante.for reasons already discussed,bernardo failed to meet her burden under section b of stating and substantiating a legally sufficient claim see navellier,supra,cal th at,d.by properly finding that bernardo lawsuit was a slapp and dismissing it under section,the court did not interfere with her first amendment free speech or petitioning rights.the california supreme court has explained that the statute subjects to potential dismissal only those causes of action as to which the plaintiff is unable to show a probability of prevailing on the merits,subd.b,a provision we have read as requiring the court to determine only if the plaintiff has stated and substantiated a legally sufficient claim citation.so construed,section provides an efficient means of dispatching,early on in a lawsuit,and discouraging,insofar as fees may be shifted,a plaintiff meritless claims.citation.equilon,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.the statute did not prevent bernardo from bringing a meritorious claim it properly prevented her from continuing to prosecute her meritless slapp suit.the application of section in this matter did not violate bernardo first amendment rights.
we also reject bernardo contention that the reasonable probability of success on the merits standard under section is both meaningless and a violation of her right to due process.as already discussed,the california supreme court has explained that in order to establish the requisite probability of prevailing required by section b a plaintiff need only have stated and substantiated a legally sufficient claim.citation.put another way,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.citation.navellier,supra,cal th at,d.this standard is sufficient for due process purposes to put a plaintiff like bernardo on adequate notice as to the burden that must be met under section b to defeat a motion to strike brought under the statute.
in sum,the gravamen of bernardo action against planned parenthood was her unsubstantiated assertion that the abc link is an established scientific fact,and her unsubstantiated claim that planned parenthood published on its web sites commercial of false and misleading statements of fact about the safety of abortion,the safety of abortion childbirth,and the scientific and medical literature that bernardo believes has established the existence of the abc should be enjoined under the ucl and fal and replaced by speech to be published on planned parenthood own web sites,pursuant to a mandatory injunction,that would have expressed her view that the claimed abc link is an established scientific fact.
we hold that the dismissal of bernardo action under the statute was proper on the ground she failed to meet her statutory burden under section of showing a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits of her claims for injunctive relief because her own evidence demonstrated that planned parenthood statements about the claimed abc link were noncommercial expressions of opinion about an issue of genuine scientific debate that were fully protected under the first amendment and thus not actionable under either the ucl or fal her challenge to planned parenthood statements regarding the safety of abortion failed as a matter of law because this challenge was based on the unsubstantiated premise that the claimed abc link is an established scientific fact and she failed to show a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits of her claims that planned parenthood speech,assuming it consisted of commercial statements of fact,was unlawful,unfair or fraudulent within the meaning of the ucl or constituted false advertising within the meaning of the fal.we also hold that the dismissal of her action under the statute did not violate her first amendment or due process rights.
because the claimed link between abortion and breast cancer is a public health issue about which scientific researchers and public health advocates in good faith have disagreed,the proper resolution of this appeal requires application of the fundamental public speech principle enunciated by the united states supreme court that u nder the first amendment there is no such thing as a false idea.however pernicious an opinion may seem,we depend for its correction not on the conscience of judges and juries but on the competition of other ideas.gertz robert welch,d,italics added,fn.omitted.here,planned parenthood web site speech interpreting,evaluating and discussing the content and weight of the scientific literature addressing the claimed abc link represents the kind of rigorous debate on issues of public concern that the first amendment was designed to promote and protect.
bernardo appeal from the mandatory attorney fees award under section c 
bernardo separately appeals the court order awarding attorney fees to planned parenthood in the amount of under the mandatory fees provision set forth in section c bernardo contends that section c is unconstitutional on its face and as applied,asserting the attorney fees award levied against her is a penalty that violates her constitutional right to petition the government for redress of grievances and access the courts by filing litigation due process and equal protection.we reject these contentions.
standard of review 
the interpretation of a statute and the determination of its constitutionality are questions of law.in such cases,appellate courts apply a de novo standard of review.citation.people health laboratories of north america,th,d health laboratories.
first amendment and right to petition 
claiming that the mandatory award of attorney fees levied against her under section c is a fine and a draconian penalty,and asserting that t he state of california can not penalize litigants for bringing suits regarded as unlikely to succeed,bernardo contends that section violates her first amendment rights to petition and access the courts because it imposes a penalty and liability for fees without requiring a showing that the suit is objectively frivolous.in support of this contention,bernardo cites several united states supreme court and california supreme court decisions for the proposition that,as a general first amendment principle,the law can not impose penalties or tort liability for filing a lawsuit absent a showing that the suit is objectively groundless 
bernardo arguments are based on the unsupported premise that the statute fee shifting provisions penalize or impose liability on plaintiffs whose complaints are dismissed under section.in equilon,supra,cal th,d,the california supreme court held that a defendant moving to strike a cause of action under section on the ground it is a slapp need not show that the plaintiff brought the action with the subjective intent of chilling the defendant exercise of constitutionally protected speech or petitioning activity.equilon,supra,cal th at,d.in arguing that an proof requirement was a constitutionally compelled element of the statutory scheme,the plaintiff in equilon asserted that the first amendment generally bars liability for filing lawsuits that are not shams.equilon,supra,at,d.noting that h undreds of california statutes provide for an award of attorney fees to the prevailing party citations equilon,supra,cal th at,d,the equilon court rejected that argument and stated that fee shifting under section c does not make a party liable for filing a lawsuit,but rather simply requires the party that creates the costs to bear them.equilon,supra,at,d.the high court also rejected the argument that the statute provisions unconstitutionally punish plaintiffs,explaining that p laintiffs as well as defendants may recover fees defendants only when the plaintiff burdens free speech with an unsubstantiated claim citation plaintiffs whenever a defendant motion to strike is frivolous or is solely intended to cause unnecessary delay c.equilon,supra,cal th at,d.
the supreme court reasoning in equilon is equally applicable here.by providing for a mandatory award of attorney fees in favor of a defendant who prevails on a motion to strike under the statute,section c does not punish,penalize,or impose liability on the slapp plaintiff.the fee shifting simply requires the plaintiff,as the party whose slapp suit caused the defendant to incur attorney fees and other costs,to bear those fees and costs.equilon,supra,cal th at,d.in this regard,bernardo correctly acknowledges in her appellant opening brief that the fee award under section c is designed to compensate defendants for the cost of defending the suit italics added.
our conclusion that the court award of attorney fees in favor of planned parenthood under section c did not violate bernardo constitutional right to petition the government for redress of grievances is also compelled by this court decision in schroeder irvine city council th,d schroeder.in schroeder,the plaintiff,a taxpayer,sued a city,its city council and several city council members,seeking injunctive relief and a declaration that the city program to increase voter registration was an illegal expenditure of public funds.id.at,d.the defendants moved to dismiss the action under the statute.the trial court granted the motion,finding that the plaintiff had failed to show a reasonable probability of success on the merits,and awarded attorney fees to the defendants as the prevailing parties under section c.schroeder,supra,th at,d.on appeal,the plaintiff challenged the dismissal of the lawsuit and also challenged the attorney fee award on the grounds that a mandatory attorney fee award against a taxpayer who has challenged a governmental program would unconstitutionally infringe upon his or her right to petition the government for redress of grievances.id.at,d.we rejected the plaintiff constitutional challenge to the fee award,and held that t he right to petition for redress of grievances includes the right to sue citation private as well as governmental entities.citation.however,the right to petition has never been absolute citation and baseless litigation is not immunized by the first amendment right to petition.citation.c onstitutional rights to petition have been subjected to reasonable restrictions to prevent abuse of the right,and narrowly drawn restrictions on that right can be valid.schroeder,supra,at,d.
in schroeder,we recognized that the government is injured by meritless suits,that the right to petition does not provide an absolute immunity to citizens who bring meritless suits,and the legislature may by statute grant governments the ability to recoup their attorney fees t he right to petition may be subject to legislatively imposed conditions and restrictions,provided the restrictions are narrowly drawn to achieve a substantial governmental interest that is content neutral and unrelated to the suppression of the exercise of first amendment rights t he legislature may provide for an award of attorney fees to governmental entities for defending against frivolous lawsuits without impermissibly infringing on the right of petition for redress of grievances.schroeder,supra,th at,d.we concluded that the mandatory attorney fee provision set forth in section c is valid because it seeks to achieve a substantial governmental interest that is content neutral and unrelated to the suppression of the exercise of first amendment rights and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.there is a substantial governmental interest in deterring unmeritorious lawsuits generally,and that interest assumes greater weight in the arena governed by section c unmeritorious lawsuits that can chill the defendant exercise of first amendment rights.although plaintiff argues that the statute is designed to suppress protected right to sue the conclude the statute is primarily designed to promote and encourage protected right of defendants to exercise their first amendment rights without fear of unmeritorious slapp lawsuits.schroeder,supra,th at,d,original italics.we further held that the attorney fee clause of section passes constitutional muster because it applies to all unmeritorious lawsuits premised on acts taken in furtherance of the defendant constitutional rights of petition or free speech,regardless of the point of view espoused by the plaintiff.it applies only to that narrow category of lawsuits that are premised on acts taken in furtherance of the defendant rights of speech,and leaves untouched any other type of lawsuit finally,it is closely tailored to achieve these substantial governmental interests because it has no application to most lawsuits but instead applies only to lawsuits in which two narrow conditions are satisfied first,the court must be satisfied that the lawsuit seeks recovery for acts taken in furtherance of the defendant rights of free speech or petition and second,the lawsuit must be so lacking in merit that,even when the evidence is viewed most favorably to the plaintiff,the plaintiff can not prevail as a matter of law.schroeder,supra,at,d.
due process 
bernardo also claims that section c violated her due process rights in two ways.first,she repeats her contentions that the reasonable probability of success on the merits language is unconstitutionally vague,this standard is meaningless in practice,and t he net result of the standard imposed by section is to require her to predict the inherently unpredictable under pain of penalty in the form of attorney fees.italics added.for the reasons discussed,ante,we have already concluded that the reasonable probability of success on the merits standard codified in section b see fn,ante,as interpreted by the california supreme court see navellier,supra,cal th at,d,is not unconstitutionally vague and thus the court application of that standard in this matter did not violate bernardo right to due process.as already discussed,the supreme court has held that the section c provision that bernardo challenges here does not unconstitutionally punish plaintiffs whose slapp causes of action are subject to dismissal for failure to show a probability of prevailing on the merits.equilon,supra,cal th at,d.the fee shifting under section c simply requires the party that creates the costs to bear them.equilon,supra,cal th at,d.
second,bernardo contends the mandatory provision of section c violates due process because it does not require a showing of fault,such as a reckless disregard for the truth,supported by a heightened evidentiary standard,such as clear and convincing evidence,that she claims is required to impose damages,liability,a fine,or a draconian penalty in the form of a fee award for activity that involves the exercise of fundamental first amendment rights,such as the right to pursue litigation.as already discussed,however,the california supreme court has held that t he right to petition is not absolute,providing little or no protection for baseless litigation citation.equilon,supra,cal th at,d.bernardo contention is based on the unsupported premise that she had a fundamental first amendment right to bring a slapp against planned parenthood.bernardo has cited no authority,and we are aware of none,that supports her implied assumption that a litigant has a fundamental constitutionally protected right to file a slapp suit.
equal protection 
last,bernardo contends that the mandatory provision of section c violates her right to equal protection of the law because it creates an unconstitutional penalty and imposes fee liability for the exercise of first amendment rights that discriminates between parties based on the nature of their first amendment activity and the nature of the plaintiff.specifically,bernardo maintains that the statutory language and purpose indicate that section c and its attorney fees provision are designed to favor a defendant first amendment rights to speech over a plaintiff first amendment right to petition and access courts and section,subdivision d hereafter section d,discussed,post creates impermissible classifications based upon the identity of the plaintiff as either a public or private attorney general.we reject these contentions.
the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment commands that no state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws,which is essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.citation.cleburne cleburne living center,d.
although most statutes differentiate somehow between classes of people,the equal protection clause does not forbid classifications.citation.so long as the classification is not arbitrary but is based on some difference in the classes having a substantial relation to a legitimate object to be accomplished,legislatures may make reasonable classifications of persons,businesses and activities.citation.the equal protection clause of the california constitution similarly states that a person may not be denied equal protection of laws cal,art.i,and statutory classifications challenged thereunder are analyzed by the same rules applicable to challenges to the fourteenth amendment.citations.health laboratories,supra,th at,d.
the health laboratories court further explained that l egislative classifications are presumed valid and will be sustained if the classification is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.most statutes challenged on equal protection grounds are tested by this rational
