a jury awarded plaintiff oakland raiders,a california limited partnership the raiders million in damages against defendant county coliseum,a california nonprofit corporation oacc on the raiders claim for negligent misrepresentation regarding the status of season ticket sales,representations that were allegedly made to induce the team to leave los angeles and sign a contract to play at their former home in oakland.the size of the jury award was only a fraction of the amount of compensatory damages the raiders had sought.the jury also found that oacc had breached its implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in negotiating its contract with the raiders,but that the raiders had suffered no damage as a result.the trial court denied the raiders posttrial motion for attorney fees.both sides appeal from the ensuing judgment and the raiders appeal from the order denying them attorney fees.
for the reasons that follow,we shall conclude that oacc motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict jnov on the fraud count was meritorious and should have been granted.
in an unpublished portion of this opinion,we also find without merit the raiders assignments of evidentiary and instructional error on.we shall reverse with directions,while dismissing as moot the raiders appeal from the order denying attorney fees.
factual background 
oacc is a nonprofit public benefit corporation that was formed in for the purpose of helping to finance and construct a multipurpose public recreation coliseum and stadium coliseum in the city of oakland.the raiders are a professional football team which,in,began its existence in oakland as a member of the american football league afl.when the coliseum was built,the raiders moved in as its first tenant.in,the raiders joined the national football league nfl when the afl merged with the nfl.the raiders won super bowls following the and seasons,and enjoyed fine attendance during that period.
until,the raiders played at the coliseum under a series of leases.in,the team relocated to los angeles.however,as the expiration of their stadium lease in los angeles drew near,the raiders entered into negotiations with the city of oakland city,county of alameda county and oacc to bring the team back to oakland.
these negotiations culminated in two letter agreements,both dated june.the first agreement set forth material terms for completion of documents to implement a contract that would commit the raiders to play in the coliseum for and for subsequent football seasons.a confidential side agreement described the first agreement as a letter of intent,described the parties rights and obligations for the upcoming season,and set forth certain contingencies that would allow the raiders to terminate the contemplated transaction 
oacc then launched a marketing campaign to sell personal seat licenses psl as well as club and luxury suites to the fans.by purchasing a psl,a fan acquired the right and assumed the obligation to buy season tickets in designated seats for the raiders games for the season and for the next seasons.because of strong demand,the accounting firm of arthur andersen llp was retained to conduct a lottery for psl seating assignments.to be included in the lottery,a fan had to submit a psl application and a percent deposit,by july.to complete the purchase,if accepted,the applicant had to put down an additional percent within days of the invoice date,and pay the remaining percent by march.
on july,oacc issued a press release,forwarded to the raiders,entitled games sell out in first phase of the raider s ticket drive.the release declared that psl were grabbed off rapidly in the first round of marketing which closed on july,and that seats were sold,including psl and seats to suite holders.it continued along with seats already committed to the nfl and the raiders,this represents a sellout for and of the seats for an expanded stadium in.the press release quoted marketing director ted ganis as saying luxury boxes were completely sold out for and applicants were being asked to share boxes for that season.said ganis the response is so strong and the enthusiasm so real that,not only did we sell out for,we expect to be fully sold out for the season by thanksgiving.
there was evidence that oacc repeated the substance of these representations to the raiders between july and august.
in fact,while some psl applications had been received,arthur andersen llp excluded about percent of them from the lottery due to credit card problems.additional applicants were disqualified after the lottery due to bounced checks and other reasons,such that psl seats finally ended up being assigned.
on august,the raiders executed a binding contract with oacc,the city,county and other entities collectively the east bay entities,committing the raiders to play in oakland for consecutive football seasons.the contract consisted of a master agreement and a series of incorporated collateral agreements collectively the august agreements,governing such matters as stadium operation,loans for improvements,marketing and revenue sharing.
the raiders presented testimony to the effect that they were not informed of the true state of psl and luxury seat sales prior to executing the august agreements.the raiders team is controlled by its general partner,football,a california corporation,and its president al davis,who signed all of the agreements on behalf of the raiders.davis testified that he relied on the sellout representations in entering into the august agreements and that,had he known the representations were false,he would have pursued overtures from representatives of the city of baltimore,who were trying to persuade the team to move there.
the raiders learned the true facts concerning the status of ticket sales during the football season.
on june,the raiders executed a new agreement with the east bay entities,which incorporated and supplemented the august agreements june supplement or supplement.the supplement reaffirmed and clarified certain provisions of the august agreements it also modified these agreements with respect to disposition of deposits on suite licenses,timetable for construction of additional suites,selection and use of loan proceeds for an alternate training facility,sharing of advertising revenue,interest rate payable on loans made to the raiders,and terms for prepayment of the loan and credit against the raiders loan balance upon acquisition of title to stadium improvements by the east bay entities.
the supplement concluded that e xcept as otherwise specifically supplemented,interpreted or modified by this supplement,all terms and provisions of the august a greements shall remain unmodified and in full force and effect.this supplement and the other agreements and schedules referred to herein,shall constitute the entire agreement among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and shall supersede any negotiations,understandings,or agreements,written or oral relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof,and shall not be changed or terminated orally.italics added.
although all psl and luxury suites had not been sold at the time the august agreements were executed,the raiders ultimately sold out the coliseum in the football season,and they made no claim of financial loss for that year.however,the raiders performance faltered at the end of and they fell below in winning percentage in.while gross ticket sales in remained about the same as the previous year,the raiders did not sell out,due to expansion of the stadium.attendance slipped further in,when the raiders won four and lost games.thus,the raiders failed to sell out in either or.
the raiders theory of damages was that a sellout of psl and luxury suites in would have created an excess demand for tickets that would have resulted in season sellouts for the next years.the raiders witnesses also testified that by contracting with oacc the team lost the opportunity to move to baltimore,where the team would have realized greater profits and enhanced franchise value.
procedural history 
this litigation commenced in september,when the east bay entities brought an action against the raiders seeking,inter alia,a declaratory judgment that the team had no right to rescind the august agreements and supplement or move the team from oakland.in june,after oacc was brought in as a party plaintiff,the complaint was amended to allege that the raiders management was claiming the team had the right to terminate or rescind the august agreements and supplement on grounds of fraudulent inducement,but that the claim was completely untrue,and in any event was barred by the doctrines of waiver,estoppel,laches,release and unclean hands.
the raiders countered with a setting forth causes of action for rescission,breach of contract,declaratory relief,and intentional and negligent misrepresentation.
in pretrial proceedings,the law and motion judge ruled that the raiders could not rescind the august agreements and supplement,thereby granting the east bay entities motion for summary judgment on the declaratory relief cause of action.in the same order,the judge granted the raiders leave to amend their to state a cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing with respect to the june letter agreements,based upon misrepresentations of material fact as to the status of ticket sales.the raiders amended their accordingly.
the court subsequently dismissed the raiders tort claims including misrepresentation against all of the east bay entities except oacc for failure to comply with the claims presentation requirements of the california tort claims act,et however,the court refused to dismiss oacc,finding that there were triable issues of fact as to whether oacc was a public agency to which the tort claims act applies.
eventually oacc was judicially deemed to be a private entity for purposes of this lawsuit as a discovery sanction for willful failure to comply with orders to produce documents and for evasive and incomplete answers to interrogatories pertaining to oacc status as a public or private entity 
the case submitted to the jury was pared down to the raiders claims for intentional misrepresentation,negligent misrepresentation and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
by special verdict the jury found that oacc had not committed the tort of intentional misrepresentation that oacc was liable to the raiders for negligent misrepresentation in the sum of and that oacc breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,but the raiders suffered no damage on account of the breach.
discussion 
oacc contends that the evidence established conclusively that the raiders had waived their claim of fraudulent inducement with respect to the august agreements by entering into the june supplement.oacc made the same argument to the trial court before the case went to the jury and by way of motion for jnov.each time,the court rejected oacc position.we conclude that jnov was compelled under the facts of this case.
negligent type of deceit 
the jury,by its verdict,found that the raiders were induced by oacc negligent misrepresentations to enter into the august agreements,which bound them to play in oakland for subsequent football seasons.
while intentional fraud requires the intent to deceive,negligent misrepresentation encompasses t he assertion,as a fact,of that which is not true,by one who has no reasonable ground for believing it to be true,subd,or t he positive assertion,in a manner not warranted by the information of the person making it,of that which is not true,though he believes it to be true,subd.
hence,the term fraud may be used to describe not just an intentional misrepresentation but as well certain misrepresentations that are merely negligent,as the separate and distinct tort of negligent misrepresentation is a species of the tort of deceit.kolodge boyd th,d,quoting bily arthur young cal th,d.
ii.the implied waiver rule 
california law has,for more than a century,recognized that a plaintiff claiming to have been induced into signing a contract by fraud or deceit is deemed to have waived a claim of damages arising therefrom if,after discovery of the alleged fraud,he enters into a new contract with the defendant regarding the same subject matter that supersedes the former agreement and confers upon him significant benefits.burne lee cal,burne schmidt mesmer cal,schmidt smith roach d.smith ball warner.
schmidt is the seminal california supreme court case on the subject and bears substantial similarity in fact pattern to ours.in schmidt,the defendant leased a hotel to plaintiffs for a term.the plaintiffs alleged that the defendant fraudulently misrepresented the amount of monthly income the hotel had generated.there was a conflict in the evidence as to whether the defendant made the misrepresentation and whether,prior to signing the contract,the plaintiffs were given access to records that accurately reflected the income of the hotel.schmidt,supra,cal.at.
the plaintiffs discovered the true facts almost immediately after taking possession of the hotel.several months later,they fell behind on the rent.without mentioning the fraud,they proceeded to negotiate an agreement with the defendant permitting them to execute a promissory note in lieu of rental payments,due in six months.schmidt,supra,cal.at.
the california supreme court found it unnecessary to reach any of the claims of evidentiary and instructional error,because the evidence showed conclusively that the plaintiffs,by their conduct,had waived their claim of fraudulent inducement.schmidt,supra,cal.at.declared the court it is no doubt the law,that while where a party seeks to rescind a contract into which he was induced to go by the fraudulent representations of another party,he must rescind at once upon the discovery of the fraud,and restore the other party,as near as may be,to his former condition,yet he may elect to go on with the contract,and sue to recover damages for the deceit,without giving any warning to the other party that he intends at some future time to charge him with fraud but this rule,which relieves a party when he chooses to sue for damages from many of the acts required of him when he elects to rescind,is subject to some just limitations.if,after his knowledge of what he claims to have been the fraud,he elects not to rescind,but to adopt the contract and sue for damages,he must stand toward the other party at arm length he must on his part comply with the terms of the contract he must not ask favors of the other party,or offer to perform the contract on conditions which he has no right to exact,and must not make any new agreement or engagement respecting it otherwise he waives the alleged fraud.id.at,italics added.concluding that the plaintiffs conduct clearly brings them within the principle declared in the authorities above cited,the court held that the fraud claim was waived.id.at.
fifty years later,the state high court modified the rule articulated in schmidt,but only slightly.in bagdasarian gragnon cal d,bagdasarian,the buyers had purchased a farm from the seller.in response to a foreclosure suit,the buyers filed a alleging they had been induced to purchase the farm through fraud,a claim that prevailed at trial.id.at.on appeal,the seller argued that the buyers mere request for an extension of time to make payments on their note constituted an estoppel or waiver of their fraud claim.the court disagreed stating,there appears to be no decision in california or elsewhere which squarely holds on its facts that the mere making of an unfulfilled request alone constitutes a waiver as a matter of law we think it unjust and unreasonable to hold as a matter of law that the mere asking of a favor should deprive an innocent person of rights arising from an unquestionably fraudulent act,and we therefore disapprove of the language in schmidt to the extent that it indicates that the making of a request that is not complied with in itself constitutes a waiver without regard to the circumstances under which it is made.id.at.
the core holding of schmidt bagdasarian is that one who,after discovery of an alleged fraud,ratifies the original contract by entering into a new agreement granting him substantial benefits with respect to the same subject matter,is deemed to have waived his right to claim damages for fraudulent inducement.while it has not recently been the central focus of judicial scrutiny in this state,the rule still stands as binding precedent 
the rule is universally recognized and is illustrated in cases from numerous other jurisdictions.see glenn dick equipment galey construction,idaho,quoting d fraud and deceit,if one induced by misrepresentations or fraud to enter into a contract for the use of property thereafter,with knowledge of the deception,receives from the party guilty of fraud some substantial concession or enters into a new contract in respect of the transaction,he thereby relinquishes all right to recover or recoup damages because of the misrepresentations dorr janssen or,see also,mikles,request and agreement to extend time for payment waived fraud claim as a matter of law harpold stock so d,purchaser of stock who negotiated a new contract with seller and received additional concessions waived claim of fraudulent inducement oleet pennsylvania exchange bank,borrowers who claimed bank fraudulently induced them to sign promissory notes negotiated subsequent agreement changing the timing and terms of payment complaint dismissed at the pleading stage marks stein,buyer,after discovery of allegedly defective goods,paid part of purchase price and signed a note for the balance reversed with directions to enter judgment for seller linda coal supply tasa coal,tenant who,after discovery of alleged fraud,reaches a new agreement with landlord granting him more favorable terms waives claim for damages timmerman gurnsey iowa,same.
the trial court determined that the implied waiver issue was a question of fact for the jury.the court also accepted the raiders argument that oacc had to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the raiders intended to waive their right to sue for fraud when they entered into the june supplement,and instructed the jury accordingly.emphasizing oacc lofty burden and citing the raiders witnesses denials that they intended to waive their fraud claim,counsel for the raiders urged the jurors to reject the waiver defense.not surprisingly,they did 
at the outset,we note that the trial court decision to submit the implied waiver question to the jury was influenced by,if not based on,a serious misreading of schmidt,supra,cal.in its written ruling,the court asserted that in schmidt,the jury had found that the plaintiffs waived any fraud in the inducement by requesting a reduction in rent and by requesting and obtaining an extension of time to pay the rent,all without any reference to the alleged fraud.italics added.the court went on to state that the plaintiffs intent to waive was not deemed as a matter of law,but was instead found as a matter of fact by the jury and affirmed by the supreme court having found no evidence in the record to support a contrary verdict.this is a profoundly inaccurate statement of the facts and holding of schmidt.
in schmidt,the plaintiffs sued for fraud in the inducement.the evidence was in conflict as to whether the plaintiffs were defrauded and the jury returned a verdict for the defendants.schmidt,supra,cal.at.plaintiffs appealed,alleging errors in the jury instructions and in certain evidentiary rulings made by the trial court.our supreme court swept all of these arguments aside,however,on the ground that the acts of the plaintiffs,as hereinafter stated,constituted a waiver of the alleged fraud,and prevent them from recovering in this action,without regard to said alleged errors.id.at,italics added.
thus,contrary to the trial court belief,the schmidt jury made no factual finding of supreme court found waiver as a matter of law from the plaintiffs conduct.the court makes this abundantly clear in the concluding sentence of the opinion this conduct of the plaintiffs clearly brings them within the principle declared in the authorities above cited,and,this being so,the alleged errors of the court,with respect to other matters,become immaterial.under no view of the case could a verdict in favor of plaintiffs be maintained.schmidt,supra,cal.at,italics added.
in bagdasarian,the supreme court did not overrule schmidt,but merely disapproved of dicta indicating that an ungranted request for a favor automatically brings down the curtain on the plaintiff case.bagdasarian,supra,cal d at.here,we have much more than an ungranted request.we have a new agreement negotiated and signed by the parties,which not only bestows substantial benefits on plaintiff the raiders,but also reaffirms the former agreement that plaintiff the raiders,after receiving such benefits,now claims was procured by fraud 
the bagdasarian court strongly indicated that the schmidt rule still applies under such circumstances there is serious doubt whether even a granted request of a favor,such as an extension of time,should be held to constitute a waiver in the absence of estoppel or the making of a new agreement supported by consideration,but we need not determine that question here because the facts established by the record are not as claimed by appellant.bagdasarian,supra,cal d at,italics added.
as the italicized language indicates,the implied waiver consequence recognized in schmidt and bagdasarian is better understood as an application of the doctrine of equitable estoppel than waiver in the traditional sense,which generally rests on a party intent.
the doctrine of equitable estoppel is founded on concepts of equity and fair dealing.it provides that a person may not deny the existence of a state of facts if he intentionally led another to believe a particular circumstance to be true and to rely upon such belief to his detriment.strong county of santa cruz cal d,citing city of long beach mansell cal d,mansell.the traditional elements of estoppel are the party to be estopped must be apprised of the facts he must intend that his conduct shall be acted upon,or must so act that the party asserting the estoppel had a right to believe it was so intended the other party must be ignorant of the true state of facts and he must rely upon the conduct to his injury.mansell,supra,cal d at.
the estoppel underpinnings of the implied waiver rule may be traced back to schmidt itself,where our supreme court observed it is true that one actually guilty of fraud is not entitled to much consideration but the real difficulty usually is to determine whether or not the alleged fraud actually existed,and the issue has generally to be determined upon conflicting testimony,and in accordance with the preponderance of evidence.in such a case it is evident that the party who keeps his intended charge of fraud secret for years has a great advantage in preparing for a future intended action,which he alone anticipates,over his adversary,who has had no intimation of such action or such charge of fraud,and has had no reason to preserve or discover evidence concerning it.schmidt,supra,cal.at,italics added.noting the injustice of permitting a party to gain new benefits without giving any warning to the other party that he intends at some future time to charge him with fraud,the court fashioned the rule that a party aware of the alleged fraud must stand at arm length from his adversary and not enter into a new agreement extracting concessions,lest he be deemed to have waived his claim of fraud.ibid.
while the question of waiver ordinarily turns on the intent of the party against whom it is asserted,estoppel focuses solely on the party conduct the term waiver is sometimes used indiscriminately to refer to the doctrine of waiver,and the distinct but similar doctrine of estoppel.citation.waiver refers to the act,or the consequences of the act,of one side.waiver is the intentional relinquishment of a known right after full knowledge of the facts and depends upon the intention of one party only.waiver does not require any act or conduct by the other party.citation.thus,t he pivotal issue in a claim of waiver is the intention of the party who allegedly relinquished the known legal right.citation.e stoppel is applicable where the conduct of one side has induced the other to take such a position that it would be injured if the first should be permitted to repudiate its acts.old republic ins.fsr brokerage,th,d old republic ins,citing and quoting hills,chopstix dim sum cafe takeout iii,th,d.
this form of estoppel is,for practical purposes,indistinguishable from the doctrine of implied waiver through conduct.see waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d,c alifornia courts will find waiver when a party intentionally relinquishes a right or when that party acts are so inconsistent with an intent to enforce the right as to induce a reasonable belief that such right has been relinquished,id.at,d,italics added.as one national treatise states,a person defrauded in a transaction may,by conduct inconsistent with an intention to sue for damages for the fraud,waive the right to sue.waiver in this sense may mean not only a consensual waiver,but a relinquishment of rights and powers akin to estoppel.d fraud and deceit.
iii.oacc may raise the estoppel defense 
iv.application of the rule 
in this case,the raiders admittedly discovered the falsity of the oacc sellout representations regarding psl and other ticket sales not later than the end of the football season in,without any mention of fraud,they negotiated and executed a new agreement concerning the same subject matter,which modified the rights of the parties,granted the raiders significant benefits and otherwise reaffirmed the validity and enforceability of the august agreements.under the principles set forth in schmidt and bagdasarian,these facts establish an implied waiver of the raiders claim for fraudulent inducement.
we acknowledge the existence of cases that stand for the truism that the existence of waiver is ordinarily a question of fact,french freeman cal,craig white cal,wilder beede cal,california southern hotel callender cal,russel amador cal.but this does not mean it can never be a question of law,as schmidt itself plainly demonstrates.implied waiver,especially where it is based on conduct manifestly inconsistent with the intention to enforce a known right,may be determined as a matter of law where the underlying facts are undisputed old republic,supra,th at,d,or the evidence is susceptible of only one reasonable conclusion see,guess,superior court th,d implied waiver of right to compel arbitration pine tiedt d.implied waiver of right to partition land.
the facts surrounding the execution of the june supplement satisfied all the elements of implied waiver,while the only evidence to the raiders undisclosed subjective intent to preserve their fraud entitled to no weight whatsoever.
cases cited by the raiders to support their claim that the implied waiver issue was a factual one are clearly distinguishable.for example,in clark equipment wheat d,the defendant compounded the original fraud by making a second misrepresentation.there,the seller,clark equipment,sold plaintiff wheat a reconditioned forklift called the york tm,which proved defective.when wheat complained that the tm did not perform as promised,clark equipment induced wheat to buy a more expensive forklift,the chy,promising wheat that such a purchase would relieve wheat of its obligation to make further payments on the tm.id.at.subsequently,clark equipment filed a lawsuit against wheat for default in payments on the tm and wheat for fraud,breach of warranty and breach of contract.in upholding a jury verdict in favor of wheat,the court found no indication of any express or implied relinquishment of wheat right to damages for clark equipment misrepresentations with respect to the tm.id.at.
lawson town country shops,d,friedberg weissbuch d,and lobdell miller d,all apply the bagdasarian dictum that the mere granting of a favor will not constitute waiver as a matter of law,but in none of the cases did the plaintiff enter into a new contract with the defendant that not only conferred new benefits on the plaintiff but ratified the very agreement purportedly induced by fraud.as the court in smith stated,a plaintiff claiming fraud in the inducement is deemed to have waived his claim of damages if,after he discovers the fraud,he makes a new agreement or engagement with the other party to the original contract the contract allegedly procured by the fraud of that party,and such new agreement or engagement results in a compromise and adjustment of the plaintiff rights under the original contract,thereby superseding that contract.smith,supra,d at,quoting burne,supra,cal.at,italics modified from original see also burne,at.
the raiders conduct in obtaining additional benefits and ratifying the earlier contract sets this case apart from all those relied on by the trial court and the raiders.in the words of schmidt we fully recognize and approve the rule that a party may retain what he receives,stand to his bargain,and recover for the loss caused him by the fraud but where a party,with full knowledge of all the material facts,does an act which indicates his intention to stand to the contract,and waive all right of action for fraud,he can not maintain an action for the original wrong practiced upon him.where the affirmance of the contract is equivalent to a ratification,all right of action is gone.thus where a party,with full knowledge,declines to repudiate a transaction known to him to be fraudulent,and fully and expressly ratifies it,he can neither rescind nor maintain an action for damages.schmidt,supra,cal.at,quoting john hendrickson,bonded adjustment anderson,when a party claiming to have been defrauded enters,after discovery of the fraud,into new arrangements or engagements concerning the subject matter of the contract to which the fraud applies,he is deemed to have waived any claim for damages on account of the fraud prosser keeton,torts ed,italics added defrauded party who,after discovery,enters into contract granting favors or concessions,will be held to have surrendered his claim in return for what is in effect a new agreement,replacing the old one.
the raiders try to avoid these consequences by citing evidence that both parties benefited by the june supplement,even suggesting that oacc may have benefited more.however,the rule contains no requirement that the party against whom it applies receive greater consideration than his adversary,or that the fact finder weigh and compare the benefits received by each party.the undisputed evidence that the raiders obtained significant monetary and nonmonetary concessions by virtue of the new contract see fn,ante is sufficient.in this case,the supplement reduction of the raiders interest rate on two loans by itself saved the team million in interest payments,or more than three times the amount of the compensatory damages the jury awarded in this case.
finally,application of the rule to the facts of this case vindicates the estoppel principles upon which it rests by signing the june supplement,the raiders reaffirmed the validity of the original contract and induced oacc to change its position,to oacc detriment.the vital principle is that he who by his language or conduct leads another to do what he would not otherwise have done shall not subject such person to loss or injury by disappointing the expectations upon which he acted.such a change of position is sternly forbidden.it involves fraud and falsehood,and the law abhors both.mansell,supra,cal d at,quoting seymour oelrichs cal.oacc should not have to defend itself against a multimillion dollar fraud claim of which the raiders were aware but concealed at the time they entered into a new agreement granting the raiders significant concessions.
our dissenting colleague declines to accept the rule we apply on the view that a fraud plaintiff should be able to negotiate an agreement for half a loaf while keeping the fraud charge a secret,and then be able to sue for the entire loaf in a subsequent lawsuit.dis,post,at.but it is precisely this sort of conduct that is condemned as impermissible by schmidt and the numerous authorities from around the nation that we have cited.thus,it is the dissent,not our decision,which advocates for a significant change in the law.
we also disagree with the dissent assertion that we have substitut ed estoppel for implied waiver,thereby denigrat ing the importance of intent.dis,post,at.whether denominated estoppel or implied waiver as a matter of law,the operative principle is exactly the a party conduct is so inconsistent with the intent to enforce a legal right,the intention to give up that right will be presumed,notwithstanding evidence that the party did not subjectively intend to relinquish it.dis,post,at.
denial of jnov was error 
an appellate court reviews the grant or denial of a motion for jnov de novo using the same standard as the trial court.mason lake dolores group th,d.a jnov must be granted where,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party securing the verdict,the evidence compels a verdict for the moving party as a matter of law.paykar construction,spilat construction th,d see,sukoff lemkin d.devault logan d.in general,t he purpose of a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is not to afford a review of the jury deliberation but to prevent a miscarriage of justice in those cases where the verdict rendered is without foundation.sukoff lemkin,supra,d at.
we conclude that the raiders conduct was so inconsistent with an intent to enforce the right as to induce a reasonable belief that such right has been relinquished old republic,supra,th at,d,and there was no substantial competent evidence to support a contrary conclusion.since implied waiver of the fraud claim was established as a matter of law,the trial court erred in denying oacc motion for jnov.
our conclusion renders it unnecessary for us to reach any of the other assignments of error raised by oacc.it also moots the raiders claim on that the trial court erroneously refused to award them attorney fees as the prevailing party.our remaining task is to address the raiders contentions that the trial court committed evidentiary and instructional errors,such that they are entitled to a new trial on damages for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
disposition 
the order denying oacc motion for jnov on the fraud cause of action is reversed with directions to grant the motion.the trial court is directed to vacate the judgment and prepare a new judgment consistent with this disposition.the raiders appeal from the order denying attorney fees is dismissed as moot.oacc shall recover its costs on appeal.cal.rules of court,rule a.
i respectfully dissent.unlike the majority,i believe the trial court properly denied the motions of the oacc for jnov on the negligent misrepresentation fraud count.the trial court properly submitted to the jury,as a question of fact,the issue of whether the raiders had waived its claim of fraud,and correctly instructed on this issue as one of intentional relinquishment.and there is substantial evidence to support the jury finding that the raiders did not waive this claim.
more generally,i believe that the majority approach to the doctrine of implied basing that doctrine on estoppel while downplaying misguided.that approach muddles the law in this area.and that muddle will now make it easier to find that a party has waived a fraud claim as a matter of law,thereby harming many who may actually have been defrauded.the majority concludes that the doctrine of implied waiver as to a fraud claim is better understood as an application of the doctrine of equitable estoppel than waiver in the traditional sense,which generally rests on a party intent,ante,at,italics added.on the contrary,the doctrine of implied waiver as to a fraud claim is best understood as an application of the doctrine of implied waiver,which focuses on intent.
i must begin at the beginning.w aiver is the intentional relinquishment of a known right after knowledge of the facts.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d,waller.waiver always rests upon intent.ibid.a waiver may be either express,based on the words of the waiving party,or implied,based on conduct indicating an intent to relinquish the right.italics added.thus,california courts will find waiver when a party expressly relinquishes a right or when that party acts,conduct are so inconsistent with an intent to enforce the right as to induce a reasonable belief that such right has been relinquished.id.at,d.whether a party waives a right by expression or by conduct,that party must always intend to waive the right because waiver,express or implied,always rests upon intent.intent may be implied through conduct.id.at,d.
these waiver rules,beginning with schmidt mesmer cal,schmidt,have been applied in the context of a contractual party who may have been fraudulently induced to enter into a contract but who,through subsequent expression or conduct,has been found to have waived any claim of fraud through intentional relinquishment.citing schmidt,as well as the other venerable decisions cited in the majority lee cal,and ball warner,court,nearly years ago,in schied bodinson d,schied,accurately encapsulated the schmidt waiver principle as follows the authorities are uniform in holding that a party to an executory contract,who,with full knowledge of the facts constituting the fraud complained of,subsequently,with intention to do so,affirms the contract and recognizes it as valid,either by his written agreement or by acts and conduct,and accepts substantial payments,property or the performance of work or labor not required by the original contract,thereby waives his right to damages on account of the fraud.schied,supra,at,italics added accord,storage services oosterbaan d.see also clark equipment wheat d.a careful review of some of the more recent cases quoting from a there can be no waiver of a right to sue for fraud in the absence of an intentional relinquishment of a known right,and a request for modification of contractual provisions and even the acceptance thereof are simply factors to consider in determining whether the requisite intent of a contractual party to waive a fraud claim was express,or whether it can be implied or inferred from the surrounding circumstances.see,ante,at.
schied also noted,correctly,that determining the issue of fraud waiver ordinarily presents a question of fact,a point the majority acknowledges as a truism.schied,supra,d at,see,ante,at.
in line with schied and the waiver rules of intentional relinquishment quoted above,the trial court here properly instructed the jury on the issue of whether the raiders had intentionally waived its claim for expression or by instructing as follows the term waiver refers to an intentional relinquishment of a known right.you are instructed that a party to a contract,who,with full knowledge of the facts constituting the fraud complained of,subsequently,with intention to do so,affirms the contract and recognizes it as valid,either by his written agreement or by acts and conduct,and accepts substantial benefits not required by the original contract,thereby waives his right to damages on account of the fraud.it is for you,the jury,to determine from all the facts and circumstances shown in the evidence whether the raiders intended to waive its right to recover fraud damages from oacc by entering into the june,agreement,the june supplement.in order for there to have been such a waiver,it must be established that there was a material change in the agreement to the substantial benefit of the raiders,and that the raiders at the time of such change had full knowledge of the facts constituting the fraud.
thus,the trial court correctly instructed the jury on express waiver based on words and implied waiver based on conduct,recognizing that both types of waiver encompass intentional relinquishment.the trial court did not provide what would have been an improper instruction in light of the implied waiver rule that no waiver could be found unless the raiders subjectively intended to waive its right to sue for fraud conduct would not suffice.see rubin los angeles fed.sav.loan d.
