after he was forced out of his position as an initial appearance hearing officer for the maricopa county superior court,vernon harris unsuccessfully sued the superior court and the other defendants for violations of,inter alia,his rights under title vii of the civil rights act and the fourteenth amendment.defendants then sought substantial attorneys fees and costs from harris,and were awarded over in fees and costs by the district court.harris challenges those awards.our laws encourage individuals to seek relief for violations of their civil rights,and allow a defendant to recover fees and costs from a plaintiff in a civil rights case only in exceptional circumstances in which the plaintiff claims are frivolous,unreasonable or without foundation.see barry fowler,cir internal quotation marks,citation omitted christiansburg garment eeoc,d.moreover,only fees attributable exclusively to plaintiff frivolous claims,are recoverable by a defendant.see city of hailey,cir internal quotation marks,alterations and citation omitted.because the district court both used an impermissible method of determining the amount of fees and costs to be assessed for the claims for which fees were appropriate,and erred in some of its determinations as to which claims were properly subject to a fee award to defendants,we vacate the award of attorneys fees and remand for a new award that complies with this opinion.
in february of,vernon harris was appointed as an initial appearance hearing officer for the maricopa county superior court.no employment contract was executed between harris and the superior court,and by statute such hearing officers,also known as commissioners,serve at the pleasure of the chief presiding judge of the court.see.in late or early,allegations were made that harris had engaged in inappropriate conduct towards female staff members,had asked his secretary to perform personal errands for him,and had performed his own duties inadequately.in january and february of,harris was placed on administrative leave,investigated,and,finally,given the option of resigning or being terminated.he chose to resign.
harris,who is african american,then filed a charge with the equal employment opportunity commission in which he alleged that he had been discriminated against on account of his sex and his race,which the eeoc dismissed.in february of,harris filed a complaint in maricopa county superior court,naming as defendants the state of arizona,maricopa county superior court,maricopa county,and the arizona supreme court.defendants removed the case to federal court,at which point harris filed an amended complaint in which he made the following ten claims against the defendants breach of contract breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing hostile and discriminatory work environment race discrimination false of privacy wrongful termination in violation of public policy intentional or negligent infliction of emotional distress defamation violation of due process and equal protection under the law and intentional interference with a business relationship.
the parties then engaged in several years of discovery and legal maneuvering.of note,in january,maricopa county was dismissed from the lawsuit on harris motion,and in october,defendants motion for judgment on the pleadings was granted with respect to harris wrongful termination claim.in july,after both harris and the defendants filed summary judgment motions,the district court granted defendants summary judgment on the remaining claims in a sealed order.harris appealed to this court and we affirmed in a memorandum disposition.harris.of,cir.we denied defendants motion for attorneys fees incurred in connection with the appeal without comment or explanation.
prior to our disposition of the appeal,defendants moved for attorneys fees in district court.the district court denied the motion without prejudice.after we denied harris petition for rehearing of his appeal,defendants again moved in district court for attorneys fees,seeking in fees under arizona revised statutes a and j and and k,expenses of,and reasonable fees and costs for preparation of the fee petition.
in,the district court granted in part and denied in part the fee motion,awarding defendants in fees and in costs.it separated defendants claims into those it designated,for which fees are available to prevailing defendants under arizona revised statute a so long as certain conditions apply those it designated as federal civil rights claims,for which fees are available to prevailing defendants in very limited circumstances under and k and those it designated as state law claims sharing a common nucleus of operative facts with the federal civil rights claims.it determined that most of harris basic civil rights claims,including his claims of disparate treatment,retaliation,and equal protection,were not frivolous,and thus that no attorneys fees were permissible for those claims.similarly,it determined that his defamation and tortious interference claims were not frivolous,and awarded no fees on those claims.for harris other claims it found fees to be appropriate.
although the defendants were able to specifically attribute work amounting to only about of attorneys fees to the claims for which the district court determined fees to be warranted,the district court calculated the amount attributable to these claims to be by taking the in general fees fees that the defendants requested but that they were not able to allocate to any particular dividing them equally across the ten claims in harris amended complaint,and then allocating to each claim for which it determined fees to be appropriate of the total general fees.after calculating the amount of fees in this manner,the district court reduced the award by approximately half,to,in light of harris financial hardship.with respect to expenses,the district court awarded a prorated amount of defendants requested expenses based on the ratio of claims for which expenses are not available to claims for which,in the district court view,expenses were available.there was no reduction to the amount of expenses for financial hardship,however.harris timely appealed.
the principal issues in this case are legal in nature and therefore reviewed de novo.see city of hailey,cir see also ramsey air meds,cutter aviation,app.harris primary challenge is to the methodology that the district court used to determine the amount of fees attributable to those claims for which fees were appropriate.the remaining challenges involve which claims may appropriately be the subject of fee awards.
defendants requested attorneys fees of.some of this amount was allocated to specific claims,but it was not possible for the defendants to so allocate the vast majority of the fees.accordingly,of the fee amount requested by defendants was not associated with any specific claim,but instead was assigned to a category of general fees.the district court divided these general fees equally across the ten claims in harris amended complaint,and then for each claim for which it determined that fees were appropriate,added the of the general fees apportioned to that claim to the much smaller amount of fees the defendants asserted were specifically attributable to the defense of that claim.for instance,for the wrongful termination claim,which the district court determined was frivolous simply by examining the amended complaint,and on which the district court granted defendants judgment on the pleadings in march of,months before it reached its decision as to the other claims,the district court calculated the amount of fees to be from general fees and from work that defendants asserted was specifically attributable to defending against that claim.
in a civil rights case,such as this one,the allocation of general fees between claims for which a fee award is appropriate and claims for which such an award is not appropriate,based solely on the number of claims,is impermissible,for reasons that go to the heart of our civil rights policy.congress and the courts have long recognized that creating broad compliance with our civil rights laws,a policy of the highest priority,requires that private individuals bring their civil rights grievances to court.see newman piggie park enterprises,d.even when unsuccessful,such suits provide an important outlet for resolving grievances in an orderly manner and achieving resolutions of highly controversial,and often inflammatory,disputes.guaranteeing individuals an opportunity to be heard in court instead of leaving them only with as the means of remedying perceived injustices creates respect for law and ameliorates the injury that individuals feel when they believe that they have been wronged because society views them as inferior.our system of awarding attorneys fees in civil rights cases is in large part dedicated to encouraging individuals injured by discrimination to seek judicial relief.see id.
in accordance with this objective,courts are permitted to award attorneys fees to prevailing plaintiffs as a matter of course,but are permitted to award attorneys fees to prevailing defendants under and k,as well as j,only in exceptional circumstances,barry,at cir prevailing defendants may recover fees only for claims that are frivolous,unreasonable,or groundless.christiansburg garment,at.to put a finer point on it,a defendant is entitled only to the amount of attorneys fees attributable exclusively to a plaintiff frivolous claims.see,at quoting quintana jenne,cir see also fox vice,cir a defendant is only entitled to attorneys fees for work which can be distinctly traced to a plaintiff frivolous claims.this policy was adopted expressly in order to avoid discouraging civil rights plaintiffs from bringing suits,and thus undercut ting the efforts of congress to promote the vigorous enforcement of the civil rights laws.christiansburg garment,at.
a civil rights case such as the instant one that contains both and frivolous claims presents the problem of allocating fees,among those claims.the proper allocation of attorneys fees among such claims,when a defendant seeks to recover fees,is both simple and obvious,at least in theory.fees may be awarded only for frivolous claims,and a defendant bears the burden of establishing that the fees for which it is asking are in fact incurred solely by virtue of the need to defend against those frivolous claims.that is because here as in cases involving attorneys fees generally,t he burden of establishing entitlement to an attorneys fees award lies solely with the claimant.trustees of directors guild of pension benefits plans tise,cir citing hensley eckerhart,d.accordingly,a defendant must demonstrate that the work for which it asserts that it is entitled to fees would not have been performed but for the inclusion of the frivolous claims in the complaint.to do when a court simply divides a defendant total attorneys fees equally across plaintiff frivolous and nonfrivolous claims and attributes to the frivolous civil rights claims a share of those total fees with no demonstration that such fees were in fact incurred solely in order to defend against the frivolous claims would be to risk requiring a plaintiff to pay defendants attorneys fees incurred in defeating his nonfrivolous civil rights claims,an outcome barred by our precedent and that of the supreme court.unless a prevailing defendant can establish that its attorneys would not have performed the work involved except for the need to defend against the frivolous claims and thus would not have done the work in whole or in part in order to defend against the nonfrivolous claims,it is not entitled to the fees in question.where,as here,the plaintiff seeks relief for violation of his civil rights under various legal theories based on essentially the same acts,and a number of his claims are not frivolous,the burden on the defendant to establish that fees are attributable solely to the frivolous claims is from a practical standpoint extremely difficult to carry.that burden is not carried when the method of allocation is that which was used either by defense counsel or the court.
although some portion of the fees awarded to defendants by the district associated with the claims that the district court deemed awarded under arizona revised statute a rather than under the civil rights fee statutes discussed above,the same rule applies to those claims.first,itself makes clear that a fee award may not exceed the amount necessary to defend against those claims for which such fees are appropriate.see.b.second,and more important,even the claims designated as by the district court allege violations of harris civil alleged that defendants breached their contract with him by discriminating against arizona state policy with regard to attorneys fees for defendants in civil rights cases is intended to be equally protective of plaintiffs as is federal policy.see sees ktuc.thus,under arizona law it is impermissible to require a plaintiff to pay fees that a prevailing defendant incurred in whole or in part defending against nonfrivolous civil rights claims.id.it would make little sense to allow a prevailing defendant to recover all or a portion of such fees simply because a plaintiff included a claim in his complaint in addition to his civil rights claims.accordingly,the only fees that may be attributed to harris contracts claims for purposes of a are those that the defendants are able to demonstrate would not have been incurred but for the inclusion of those claims in the complaint.thus it was error for the district court to attribute to each of the contracts claims a tenth of the general fees,with no demonstration that the work involved was actually performed solely in order to defeat those claims.
in determining its fee award,the district court relied on cairns franklin mint,cir,in which this court allowed an apportionment of general fees among claims.cairns,however,was not a civil rights case,and thus did not implicate our longstanding policy of solicitude for civil rights plaintiffs,and our insistence that they be required to reimburse defendants only for fees incurred in defense against exceptional ly unwarranted claims.see barry,at.additionally,the general fees in this case were more than ninety percent of the total attorneys fees the court found reimbursable,a factor apparently not present in cairns.our other case cited by defendants in support of the district court methodology also did not concern fees to defendants in a civil rights case.see,hudson moore bus.forms,cir concerning sanctions under rule.
the district court made an identical error with respect to awarding fees for work that the defendants asserted was specifically attributable to individual claims for which fees were permissible.in addition to impermissibly dividing the general fees across all claims,defendants in many instances divided fees for specific work entries among different claims.for example,the in fees that were purportedly attributable specifically to the defense against the wrongful termination claim was a result of two different time entries for legal research.one of those time entries was divided across four claims with one quarter of the fee associated with that time entry allocated to each claim,including claims that the district court found were nonfrivolous.in other words,the fee purportedly attributable specifically to plaintiff frivolous wrongful termination consisted in part of work that was also done for the purpose of defending against nonfrivolous claims.defendants had similar entries for the specific fees for other claims,and,for at least one claim,hostile work environment,defendants did not list any work that was not performed for both frivolous and nonfrivolous claims.such division of fees for specific time entries is impermissible for exactly the same reasons that a division of general fees across frivolous and nonfrivolous claims is impermissible.to reiterate,the only fees that may be awarded are those incurred for work performed exclusively in order to provide a defense against claims for which fees are permissible.if defendants do not demonstrate that the work would not have been performed in order to defend against the nonfrivolous civil rights,or to put it differently,but for the need to defend against the frivolous claims,fees associated with that work can not be awarded,even in part 
we next examine the district court decisions to award attorneys fees with respect to each of the claims for which it determined that fees were appropriate.
contracts claims 
arizona revised statute provides that i n any contested action arising out of a contract,express or implied,the court may award the successful party reasonable attorney fees in order to mitigate the burden of the expense of litigation to establish a just claim or a just defense.a,b.it is not,however,a fee shifting statute as the arizona supreme court has stated,m ere eligibility under a does not establish entitlement to fees.wagenseller scottsdale mem l,en banc.instead,a court deciding whether to award fees under the statute must consider the multifactor standard outlined in associated indemnity corporation warner,
harris chief claim with regard to the fees for the claims for which the district court awarded fees under a is that the claims did not aris e out of a contract.the proper inquiry for determining whether a claim arise s out of a contract is whether the claim could not exist but for the breach or avoidance of contract.ramsey air meds,cutter aviation.div,see also by and through white arizona property and cas.ins.guar.fund,en banc.it is well established,moreover,that a defendant is entitled to attorney fees if the plaintiff claims arise out of an alleged contract that is proven not to exist.see chevron schirmer,cir.
here,harris claims for breach of contract and the duty of good faith and fair dealing were explicitly premised on the existence of an implicit contract that the district court found did not exist,and thus were eligible for a fee award under.additionally,while different courts might reasonably reach different determinations as to whether a fee award was appropriate under the associated indemnity factors,we see no abuse of discretion in the district court decision to award fees for these two claims.as we explained above,however,because this is a civil rights case,in awarding such fees,the district court must under arizona law include only fees for legal work that was not performed in whole or in part in order to defend against the nonfrivolous civil rights claims.see sees,at.thus,the award of fees in connection with this claim must be vacated as well.
fees were not appropriate at all under a for harris due process claim.to state a cognizable due process claim harris was required to show a recognized liberty or property interest at stake.guzman shewry,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.harris alleged that defendants deprived him of a property interest in continued employment,a claim apparently based on contract,but also alleged a liberty interest in being free from defamation.see id.at a person liberty interest is implicated if the government levels a charge against him that impairs his reputation for honesty or morality internal quotation marks and citations omitted.while the asserted property interest relied on the alleged contract,the liberty interest did not.accordingly,harris due process claim was not dependent on the existence of a contract it could have advanced merely on the asserted liberty interest.thus,fees were not available under for the due process claim 
state and federal civil rights statutes 
in addition to the fees sought under,defendants also sought fees under three civil rights revised statute j and and k.under arizona revised statute j,the court may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney fee under.b,i n any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of,the court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party,other than the united states,a reasonable attorney fee as part of the costs and under k,i n any action or proceeding under title vii of the civil rights act the court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party,other than the equal employment opportunity commission or the united states,a reasonable attorney fee.fee awards to prevailing defendants under all three of these statutes are governed by the same standard the court may award attorney fees only if it finds that the plaintiff action was frivolous,unreasonable,or without foundation,even though not brought in subjective bad faith.christiansburg garment,at hughes rowe,d sees,at.in determining whether this standard has been met,a district court must assess the claim at the time the complaint was filed,and must avoid post hoc reasoning by concluding that,because a plaintiff did not ultimately prevail,his action must have been unreasonable or without foundation,at quotation marks omitted.
the district court awarded fees for the following claims on the basis that they were frivolous,unreasonable,or without foundation hostile work environment,false of privacy,wrongful termination,and negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress for each of these claims,harris challenges the district court determination that fees were appropriate 
hostile work environment based on gender and race 
although harris made a single claim alleging that he had been subjected to a hostile work environment on account of his race and gender together,the district court treated this claim as two separate claims,one concerning race,one concerning gender.it found that harris subclaim was frivolous because it was filed more than time limit imposed by title the last act of discrimination alleged by harris that the district court categorized as.it did not determine that his subclaim was apparently categorized acts within the day window as race that instead it was frivolous because he did not allege severe and pervasive conduct based on his race,as would be required for relief under title vii.
the district court erred in dividing the claim in two,and then treating half of it as frivolous because of title vii statute of limitations and half as frivolous for a substantive reason.harris claimed that his work environment was hostile because of discrimination against him as a black male,not that he was discriminated against as a male and then suffered separate discrimination as a black person.it is perfectly plausible that gender and race could together give rise to discrimination in the manner harris alleged he claimed that false sexual harassment allegations were made against him and that action was taken on these false charges because of the combination of his race and gender.prejudiced individuals have long promulgated a pernicious image of black men as sexual predators a view that they do not hold with respect to men of other racial backgrounds or with respect to black women.see,powell state of alabama.courts,moreover,have properly shown solicitude for claims based on the intersection of different categories of discrimination.see jefferies harris.community action ass n,cir discrimination against black females could exist even in the absence of discrimination against black men or white women.
nevertheless,the district court did not err in determining that the hostile work environment claim as a whole was frivolous.a hostile work environment claim requires inter alia that the conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim employment and create an abusive working environment.pavon swift trans,cir.the discriminatory conduct that harris alleged fell short of meeting this condition,and harris himself did not allege that the condition was met.while harris allegations of discrimination were sufficient to make out a prima facie case of disparate treatment under title vii,they were obviously insufficient for a hostile work environment claim.
although the court may not have erred in determining that the claim was frivolous,it nonetheless erred in awarding substantial fees to defendants on this claim.almost every time entry in defendants fee petition for work related to the hostile work environment claim was also listed as related to some or all of harris nonfrivolous discrimination claims.as we have already explained,in a civil rights action with multiple claims,only some of which are groundless,a defendant is entitled only to those fees attributable exclusively to defending against plaintiff frivolous claims.if the work is performed in whole or in part in connection with defending against any of plaintiff claims for which fees may not be awarded,such work may not be included in calculating a fee award.accordingly,the fees properly attributable to this claim,if any,would be quite minimal.
false of privacy 
the district court found harris false of privacy claim frivolous because as a limited purpose public figure harris had no privacy interest in the allegations against him.a person employed by the government is only a public official with limited privacy interests when he holds a position that has such apparent importance that the public has an independent interest in his performance,beyond the general public interest in the performance of all government employees.rosenblatt baer,d.under arizona law,such a public official can not sue for false light invasion of privacy if the publication about which he complains relates to his performance of his public duties.godbehere phoenix newspapers.
the district court found that it was obvious that harris was a public official of the relevant sort,as opposed to an ordinary government employee.its only support for this conclusion,however,was a set of cases concerning law enforcement officers,who are presumptively public officials.see id.police and other law enforcement personnel are almost always classified as public officials.such cases are an insufficient basis on which to conclude that the issue raised by a hearing officer or similar low level judicial officer is so important a public employee that the public interest in him is beyond the general public interest in the performance of all government employees has been answered clearly by precedent,as the district court was required to do before deeming the false light claim in this case frivolous.see gibson,at.even in cases that do not involve civil rights,we have been extremely hesitant to find claims meritless the bar is higher still when considering the claims of a plaintiff seeking vindication of his civil rights.see taylor ag indus.pure gro,cir finding that a claim was not wholly without merit despite negative cases from seven other circuits and the supreme court because no case in this circuit had so held see also hughes rowe,d the fact that a petitioner claims,even where they failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted,warranted the detailed consideration of a seven page district court opinion indicated that they were not frivolous.harris false light claim did not in any way approach the level of futility required to treat its outcome as obvious and the claim as being without merit instead,it presented a question that,so far as we are aware,has not been previously answered by any court.rather than being frivolous,it performed the salutary function of giving a court the opportunity to address a previously unanswered question.
wrongful termination 
to prevail on a wrongful termination claim under arizona law,a plaintiff must demonstrate that an employment relationship was terminated in violation of a state statute that does not provide its own remedy for statutory violations.see.b taylor graham county chamber of commerce.harris identified as the only bases for his wrongful termination claim a federal statute and an arizona statute that provides it own remedy for a statutory violation.because the result of such a patently inadequate claim is obvious,the district court did not err by determining that it was frivolous.see gibson,at.of course,the fees properly attributable to this claim,which placed on defendants only the burden of examining the basic legal requirements for such a claim,which are set forth on the face of the statute,would unquestionably be quite small.
negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress 
the district court relied on an erroneous legal standard to reach its determination that harris negligent infliction of emotional distress claim was frivolous.arizona law requires that emotional distress result in illness or bodily harm in order to recover for negligent infliction of emotional distress.keck jackson.according to the district court,harris claim was frivolous because he failed to allege in his complaint that he had suffered any physical injury instead he alleged only that he had suffered severe emotional distress.bodily harm,however,is a broader concept under arizona law than might be suggested by the common usage of the term.in particular,it comprehends substantial,emotional disturbances unaccompanied by any physical injury,see monaco healthpartners of southern arizona.div.accordingly,harris invocation of severe emotional distress in his complaint appears sufficient as a matter of pleading.
this sufficiency is,perhaps,reflected in the fact that defendants did not seek judgment on the pleadings as to this claim.on that point,we note that it was unreasonable for the defendants to seek,and for the district court to grant,substantial attorney fees on the ground that harris failed to plead a required element of his claim when defendants failed to challenge the pleading as insufficient at an earlier point in the proceedings.
the district court made a different but related error with respect to harris intentional infliction of emotional distress claim.the district court found this claim to be frivolous because plaintiff allege d in his amended complaint that he was falsely accused of sexual harassment,and that such allegations tarnished his reputation,and it was clear from the complaint that this conduct was not sufficient to bring an iied claim,which requires extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendants.four years earlier,however,when deciding whether to grant the defendants judgment on the pleadings,the district court said of exactly the same claim,plaintiffs allegations regarding defendants conduct,if true,may suffice for extreme and outrageous conduct.in christianburg,the supreme court cautioned that district courts must resist the understandable temptation to engage in post hoc reasoning by concluding that,because a plaintiff did not ultimately prevail,his action must have been unreasonable or without foundation.christiansburg,at.here,the district court appears to have succumbed to the very understandable temptation of which the supreme court warned.the fee award as to this claim can not stand on the ground asserted by the district court.
the district court also awarded defendants fees incurred in preparing their motion for attorneys fees.this court has held that fees can be recovered for preparing a motion for attorneys fees under b and k.see mcgrath county of,cir b manhart city of los angeles,of water and power,cir k.similarly,arizona law supports the recovery of attorneys fees for the preparation of a successful fee application.see generally schweiger china doll.such awards are,of course,subject to the same reasonableness determination as all other attorneys fees awards,including considering the results obtained by the party seeking the award.see blanchard.on remand,the district court shall evaluate whether fees for defendants fee motion are still proper in light of this opinion,and the amount of fees that ultimately should be awarded,if any.
harris also challenges the district court award of nontaxable expenses.defendants sought in nontaxable expenses such as computerized legal research,factual investigation,and photocopying.the district court,noting that expenses are not available under arizona revised statute,see ahwatukee custom estates mgmt.ass n,bach,awarded expenses for the claims that it designated as not arising from a contract.because defendants did not break down their expenses on a claim by claim basis,the district court simply defendants expenses by the district court count,two and of harris ten claims were,and seven and were not,so the district court awarded defendants of the expenses that they reported.
harris does not challenge the potential availability of expenses to a prevailing defendant as part of an attorney fee award under arizona revised statute j and and k.he does,however,correctly contend that expenses are recoverable only as part of the award of attorney fees,harris marhoefer,cir,and thus that defendants may recover their expenses only with respect to claims for which attorney fees were other words,harris frivolous claims,and not simply all of his claims.the district court,accordingly,erred by awarding expenses with respect to claims for which no award of attorneys fees was appropriate.
additionally,the district court erred in its equal division of expenses across claims.again,because expenses are part of the attorneys fees award,they are recoverable only on the terms on which attorneys fees are recoverable.thus,only those expenses are recoverable that the defendants can demonstrate were incurred solely with respect to frivolous claims and that would not have been incurred in whole or in part with respect to any of the nonfrivolous claims defendants expense petition,which does not allocate defendants substantial expenses to the claims for which they were incurred,is plainly insufficient.
harris briefs are scattershot affairs containing numerous issues,many of which are insufficiently developed.those issues that we have not previously addressed lack merit.only one requires any discussion.harris contends that because we denied defendants attorneys fees for his appeal of the dismissal of the underlying action,the district court was barred from awarding attorneys fees by the law of the case doctrine.our prior decision not to award attorneys fees to defendants for harris appeal of the district court award of summary judgment in favor of defendants included no determination that would bar an award of attorneys fees by the district court for the underlying case we simply exercised our discretion and declined to award fees for work done on appeal.see thomas bible,cir.
for the reasons stated above,we vacate the award of attorneys fees and remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
vacated and remanded.
in city of hailey,cir,we held that attorney fees may be awarded to a defendant in a civil rights action when frivolous claims are joined with claims that are not frivolous.id.at.what we gave in,we take away today.the majority holds that civil rights cases trigger an additional level of scrutiny of defendant claims to attorney beyond requiring them to prove that the plaintiff claims were frivolous,unreasonable,or without foundation.christiansburg garment eeoc,d.relying entirely upon its own conception of civil rights policy,the majority fabricates a new rule in a civil rights case,such as this one,the allocation of general fees is impermissible.op.at see also id.at.henceforth,a defendant may not recover attorney fees unless it can prove that fees would not have been incurred but for the inclusion of non frivolous claims.id.at emphasis added.the majority has so whittled away at defendants right to receive attorney fees that defendants should reconsider whether any recovery is possible.see op.at the burden on the defendant to establish that fees are attributable solely to the frivolous claims is from a practical standpoint extremely difficult to carry.i disagree with this double bonus to civil rights plaintiffs because it is extralegal and counterproductive,not only for reasons that go to the heart of our civil rights policy,but for reasons that go to the heart of the administration of justice.
the majority joins the short side of an existing circuit split that is currently before the supreme court.the first,fifth,seventh,and eleventh circuits have held that defendants in civil rights cases may recover attorney fees even when the plaintiff frivolous claims are intertwined with nonfrivolous claims.see ward hickey,cir fox vice,cir,cert.granted,d,curry robins,cir quintana jenne,cir head medford,cir.the one clear outlier is the sixth circuit,which has adopted a rule that a prevailing defendant may not recover attorney fees if the plaintiff has raised even one nonfrivolous claim.see balmer hca,cir.the majority does not agree outright with any of these enabling the its position is closest to the sixth circuit plainly unreasonable rule.we can anticipate further guidance from the court when it decides fox,a case in which it recently granted a writ of certiorari 
although,as i explain,i concur in the judgment in part,i respectfully disagree with the majority reasoning and the bulk of its judgment.
vernon harris held an position as an initial appearance hearing officer or commissioner with maricopa county superior court.within five months of his appointment,harris was under investigation for complaints that he had engaged in inappropriate conduct toward female staff and using court staff for his personal correspondence.after the superior court determined that harris had violated the canons of judicial ethics and engaged in unprofessional conduct,the superior court gave him the option of resigning or being fired.he resigned.
harris then brought suit against the superior court,the arizona supreme court,and maricopa county collectively,maricopa county.he accused the defendants of various forms of breach of contract,wrongful termination,infliction of emotional distress,violation of privacy,race discrimination,and hostile work environment based on race or gender.all ten of his claims were eventually dismissed,we affirmed that judgment,and the defendants sought attorney fees under arizona and law.the defendants sought roughly in fees with almost in costs.the district court awarded attorney fees under arizona law for two and a half claims based on contract.of the remaining seven and a half civil rights claims,the district court found that all were,but only four were frivolous.faithfully following christiansburg,the district court held that maricopa county could only recover fees on harris frivolous claims.the court reduced the fees requested by the county by apportioning time between the compensable and claims.in an exercise of its equitable discretion,the district court further decided that it would not award fees for a frivolous disparate impact claim because it was sufficiently related to disparate treatment and retaliation claims,which,although not meritorious,were not frivolous.using the lodestar method,the court calculated the fees,with various adjustments,at about.the court declined to enhance the lodestar and then reduced the lodestar by roughly percent because of the plaintiff financial hardship,although finding that some award of attorney fees is necessary to serve as a deterrent,or to ensure that future defendants and the courts are not saddled with frivolous and unsuccessful claims.ultimately,the court awarded the defendants in attorney fees and in costs.the attorney fees represent about percent of the fees requested.
the majority opinion errs in multiple ways,but in this way first it flatly misstates the standard of review and then applies the wrong standard all the way down.we have long held that we review the district court determination of attorney fees for abuse of discretion.see,at.this standard applies to all aspects of our review,including review of the district court decision to award fees under arizona state law,chevron schirmer,cir the district court decision that particular claims are groundless or unreasonable under state law,cairns franklin mint,cir the district court decision to award fees under,benton oregon student assistance com n,cir the district court decision that constitutional claims are frivolous,at the district court decision to award fees for the preparation of the motion for attorney fees,mcgrath county of nevada,cir and the district court decision concerning the manner in which to calculate the awarded fees,hensley eckerhart,d cairns,at.
despite our clear precedent,the majority is unwilling to give way to the district court on anything t he principal issues in this case are legal in nature and therefore reviewed de novo.op.at.the majority apparently derives this de novo standard of review from what has become language in attorney fees opinions elements of legal analysis and statutory interpretation that figure into the district court attorney fees decision are reviewable de novo,at,quoting richard department of developmental services of state of california,cir,citing fischer,cir,citing corder gates,cir,quoting kilgour city of pasadena,cir,quoting cabrales county of los angeles,cir,quoting hall bolger,cir.we have never cited the boilerplate as a standalone standard of review in attorney fees cases.
rather,de novo review is the standard for a narrow range of legal issues that help define the scope of the district court discretion.as the supreme court explained the standard the district court necessarily has discretion in making the determination about how to calculate the attorneys fee award,but that this discretion must be exercised in light of the considerations we have identified.hensley,at.our cases demonstrate that we have reviewed certain issues in fee awards de novo when they relate to some element of legal analysis.cabrales,at reviewing the district court denial of fees based on its decision that it was legally precluded from awarding fees see also,hall,at,reviewing the district court holding that sovereign immunity did not preclude it from awarding interest on attorney fees.
whatever these elements may be,it is clear that the method of fee calculation is not such an element and that the proper standard of review is for abuse of discretion.see hensley,at cairns,at.
the majority establishes a new rule for prevailing defendants who seek attorney fees in cases in which at least one claim is based on the civil rights laws.i have two objections.first,i generally object to the majority,in effect,double counting the burden successful defendants must bear.second,i specifically object to the but for test the majority creates.
i disagree that prevailing defendants ability to recoup attorney fees in civil rights cases should be burdened beyond that called for by existing case law.section itself does not distinguish between the right of prevailing plaintiffs and that of prevailing defendants to recover attorney fees.b in any action or proceeding to enforce civil rights laws,the court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney fee emphasis added.for rights policy reasons,the supreme court later restricted prevailing defendants access to attorney fees,allowing them only for the defense of frivolous,unreasonable,or foundation less claims.christiansburg,at.thus,expressly in order to avoid discouraging civil rights plaintiffs from bringing suits,and thus undercutting the efforts of congress to promote the vigorous enforcement of the civil rights laws,op.at internal quotations omitted,after christiansburg,defendants unlike only recover their attorneys costs in exceptional circumstances,for frivolous claims.
once defendants have shouldered the extraordinary burden of demonstrating that plaintiffs claims were not just meritless,but frivolous,they are entitled to attorney fees on the same basis as everyone else.there is no justification in for imposing a double burden on defendants.and we should not apply the supreme court policy considerations where it has not,including to our review of the manner in which district courts allocate fees.when we do so,we hamper the district court ability to make equitable decisions to accommodate the realities of litigation with which we are much less familiar.in addition,we risk rewarding plaintiffs for raising groundless and frivolous litigation against defendants like maricopa county,who must then spend their limited funds defending against unreasonable claims.we risk straining the capacities of defendants to prevent and redress real civil rights grievances.even our own policy interests are not served by hindering the district court ability to require plaintiffs like harris to bear the costs of clogging our courts with groundless and frivolous litigation.see munson milwaukee bd.of sch.directors,cir w hen a civil rights suit is lacking in any legal or factual basis,an award of fees to the defendant is clearly appropriate to deter frivolous filings and to ensure that the ability of the courts to remedy civil rights violations is not restricted by dockets crowded with baseless litigation.alterations in original citations omitted.finally,the majority decision diminishes legitimate civil rights claims by suggesting that we can not even distinguish between nonfrivolous and outright frivolous claims and that anyone filing a civil rights claim may play by a different set of rules from everyone else.
our decision here conflicts with the decisions of at least four other circuits.although these cases have acknowledged that the difficulty of calculating attorneys fee awards in cases in which frivolous and nonfrivolous civil rights claims are intertwined,they concluded that defendants are not precluded from receiving an award.accordingly,the first,fifth,seventh,and eleventh circuits have held that prevailing defendants must be allowed to recoup the cost of defending against frivolous civil rights claims,even if those claims are interrelated with nonfrivolous ones.
in ward,the first circuit expressly held that the interrelatedness of frivolous and nonfrivolous claims may not be used as a reason to deny attorney fees to prevailing plaintiffs in civil rights cases.id.at.the circuit court reversed the district court denial of attorney fees because of the lower court reliance on the interrelated claims doctrine,a doctrine that enables a court to grant a fee award includ ing fees for work performed on unsuccessful claims if that party unsuccessful claims are interrelated to the successful claims by a common core of facts or related legal theories.id.the first circuit held that the district court had improperly relied on the doctrine,denying all fees to the prevailing defendants and allowing frivolous civil rights claims to waste judicial resources that would otherwise be used for legitimate claims.id.the first circuit concluded a district court should not deny fees for defending frivolous claims merely because calculation would be difficult.id.at.the circuit court remanded to the district court for recalculation.id.at.
when presented with the question of an attorneys fee award for interrelated frivolous and nonfrivolous civil rights claims,the fifth circuit agreed with the first circuit.in fox vice,cir,cert.granted,d,the fifth circuit held that a defendant does not have to prevail over an entire suit in order to recover attorney fees for frivolous claims because requiring otherwise would undermine the intent of congress to allow plaintiffs to prosecute frivolous claims without consequences merely because those claims were joined with additional claims.id.at quoting,at quoting quintana,at internal quotation marks omitted.quoting from our opinion in,the fifth circuit noted,s uch a rule would also make a defendant entitlement to attorney fees depend not upon a district court review of the merits of a plaintiff claims,but upon how a plaintiff chose to draft his complaint.id.at quoting,at.
the seventh circuit has adopted a similar position on fee awards for interrelated frivolous and nonfrivolous civil rights claims.in what may be the earliest circuit opinion on this issue,curry,the seventh circuit affirmed a district court decision granting fees to prevailing defendants in a civil rights case,even though the claims for which the defendants merited fees were interrelated with other claims which might not properly be characterized as frivolous.id.at.the seventh circuit reasoned that such fees were merited because to be a prevailing party under,a party need not prevail on all issues if a significant one is resolved in its favor.id.alteration,quotation marks,and citations omitted.
likewise,the eleventh circuit has repeatedly held that prevailing defendants must be able to recover fees associated with the defense of frivolous civil rights claims,even if those claims are interrelated with nonfrivolous ones.see quintana,at head.in quintana,the eleventh circuit affirmed the district court decision to award fees for a claim of retaliation,which the court had found was frivolous,but reversed the district court decision to award fees for a claim of discrimination,which the court had found to be not frivolous.the eleventh circuit made clear,however,that it was not holding that a civil rights defendant may receive attorney fees for an unsuccessful claim that is not frivolous because s uch a holding would frustrate the goal of congress that the provisions of title vii be enforced vigorously.quintana,at rather,in quintana,the eleventh circuit relied upon its own precedent in head,which established that it was the province of the district court to properly weigh and assess the amount of attorney fees realistically attributable solely and exclusively to the plaintiff frivolous claims.at.thus,in the eleventh circuit it is well established that although prevailing defendants may not recover the costs of defending against nonfrivolous civil rights claims,they must recover the costs of defending against frivolous ones,which apportionment the district courts are equipped to make,even in cases in which the compensable claims are interrelated with ones.
each of these first,fifth,seventh,and prevailing defendants to recover the costs of defending against frivolous civil rights claims under circumstances such as those presented to us today.in fact,so have we.see,at.in holding to the contrary,the majority has rejected our own precedent,as well as the reasoning of a majority of other circuits inasmuch as the majority opinion imposes an additional burden on prevailing defendants in civil rights that imposed by christiansburg and in contravention of our precedent and the majority of respectfully disagree.
once prevailing defendants have carried their heavy burden of establishing that plaintiff claims are frivolous,they should be entitled to attorney fees on the same basis as prevailing plaintiffs.the manner in which the district court awards fees to parties who are entitled to fees for some claims,but not other claims,is committed to the district court sound discretion.in general,a district court does not abuse its discretion when it makes a pro rata allocation of fees.the majority new but for rule has never been our rule.
in cairns,we held that a district court may make a pro rata allocation of general fees.we affirmed the district court decision to make two pro rata allocations first,as between publicity and trademark claims,and second,as among the trademark claims.as to the first allocation,the district court found that because the right of publicity claim was held on interlocutory appeal while the trademark claims required full litigation,it was more appropriate to allocate of the general fees to the publicity claim and to the trademark claims.id.at.as to the second allocation,the district court found that because one of the three trademark claims was unreasonable and was therefore not recoverable,id.at,it was appropriate to reduce the trademark claim fee allocation by about,or thirty percent.id.at.the district court then reduced the award based on other equitable considerations.id.at.
in cairns,we held that this the district court decision to divide unspecified general fee money into two parts,because there were two categories of claims,and then to divide one of those halves into three parts,because there were three not an abuse of the district court discretion to apportion fees on a basis.indeed,we cautioned that the impossibility of making an exact apportionment between compensable and claims does not relieve the district court of its duty to make some attempt to adjust the fee award in an effort to reflect an apportionment.id.at quoting gracie gracie,cir.relying expressly upon that affirmation,the district court here did what the cairns district court used its discretion to divide pro rata the unspecified general fee money among the various claims,to reflect an apportionment as a starting point for further equitable accommodations.id.
the majority opinion argues that cairns is not is therefore not cairns was not a civil rights case,and thus did not implicate our longstanding policy of solicitude for civil rights plaintiffs,and our insistence that they be required to reimburse defendants only for fees incurred in defense against exceptional ly unwarranted claims.op.at.this argument is smoke and mirrors.although cairns was not a civil rights case,it was a lanham act case,which,like civil rights cases,allows prevailing defendants to be reimbursed for attorney fees only in exceptional cases,meaning cases that are groundless,unreasonable,vexatious,or pursued in bad faith.cairns,at quoting avery dennison sumpton,cir quoting stephen boney,boney,cir.though this language differs slightly from that applicable to civil rights lanham act affords fees for claims that are groundless,unreasonable,vexatious,or pursued in bad faith,where only claims that are frivolous,unreasonable,or without foundation can give rise to attorney fees for defendants in civil rights cases,christiansburg,u.at difference does not seem to be meaningful for purposes of distinguishing cairns from civil rights cases.in my view,cairns should control our discussion here.
we get into this discussion about cairns and the allocation of general fees,of course,because the defendants did not provide documentation for all of their fees.defendants do have a responsibility to establish entitlement to an attorney fees award.trustees of directors guild of pension benefits plans tise,cir the burden of establishing entitlement to an attorney fees award lies solely with the claimant.citing hensley eckerhart,d emphasis added.but unlike the majority,who believes such a responsibility grows out of civil rights policy considerations and therefore may affect plaintiffs and defendants differently,i recognize that this burden is always imposed on the fee claimant,whether plaintiff or defendant.
although this case may not require that we decide what a plaintiff burden for documentation would be,see op.at,the majority seizes this reprieve to impose an asymmetrical burden on defendants.it adopts an unprecedented,burdensome but for documentation rule accordingly,a defendant must demonstrate that the work for which it asserts that it is entitled to fees would not have been performed but for the inclusion of the frivolous claims in the complaint.op.at emphasis added.the majority itself expressly acknowledges that,under its punishingly strict formulation of the principle,the burden on the defendant is from a practical standpoint extremely difficult to carry.op.at.this heightened burden on defendants originates with the majority.it does not grow out of the relevant statutory language or case law,neither of which indicate for the christiansburg exception to what kinds of claims merit fees for and defendants are to be treated differently in their application for fee awards.trustees of directors guild of pension benefits plans tise,cir.for this reason,i disagree with the majority opinion insofar as it imposes a documentation burden on the defendants that would not be applied likewise to a prevailing plaintiff.
i recognize that awarding a party fees despite its failure to provide documentation risks allowing that party to be reimbursed for claims.but this is a problem that affects both plaintiffs and defendants within the civil rights context and without.and,for that reason,as it is one with which district courts are repeatedly confronted,i would defer to the district court discretion to determine that the fees awarded in this case were an appropriate measure of the work done defending the compensable claims.
after the law and applying an unstatutory documentation rule against the prevailing defendants,the majority applies microscopic scrutiny to the district court decision.although i disagree with the majority effort to to death defendants award,i do agree that two of the district court actions deserve remand.i present my concerns and concurrences below.i address the contract claims first and then the civil rights claims.
under arizona law,ars a,courts can award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party in a contested action arising out of a contract.based on this state statute and the seven factors identified by the arizona supreme court as being relevant to such a discretionary award,see associated indem.warner,the district court awarded the def
