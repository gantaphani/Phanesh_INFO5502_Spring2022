the question here is whether a liquidating supervisor in bankruptcy has the authority pursuant to b and to settle a disputed claim for the full amount of that claim in order to avoid the expenditure of attorneys fees and costs.we hold that such a settlement is authorized,and that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in approving the settlement in this case.
servisense was a corporation engaged in the business of reselling telecommunications services to residential customers.in march of servisense hired david dane as its vice care.he was subsequently promoted to president and chief operating officer on december.under his employment agreement,dane was to be paid a yearly salary,and a fter consecutive months of employment,he was entitled to receive months salary and benefits if terminated without cause the severance agreement.app.at.as of october of,the amount of dane annual salary was,and the value of dane benefits was approximately,for a total severance payment of.
servisense subsequently experienced financial difficulty,and dane agreed in june of to a reduction of his salary by to annually.on august,servisense filed for chapter bankruptcy protection.in december of servisense filed a motion to sell substantially all of its assets,converting the bankruptcy to a chapter liquidation proceeding.dane apparently provided valuable assistance both before and after the conversion to a chapter liquidation proceeding.after the conversion,dane assisted servisense in consummating the sale of its assets,including helping to formulate the joint liquidating plan of reorganization plan,until he was terminated as an employee in february of 
the events in question occurred during the period between the chapter filing and dane termination as an employee.on december,dane instructed servisense bookkeeper to restore his salary to,and dane was paid this salary until he was terminated.although the parties disagree as to whether servisense board authorized dane to increase his salary,the present controversy does not directly concern dane right to this salary,but rather primarily his right to severance pay.on january,a motion was filed in the name of the debtor proposing a retention payment agreement rpa with dane which will ensure his continued employment through the end of the sale process and which will also effectuate a resolution of claims which will otherwise arise in connection with dane severance agreement with the debtor.app.at.the rpa provided for a payment to dane of in consideration for his agreement to remain in the employ of the debtor through the completion of the sale of its assets.app.at.the rpa also provided that the payment would qualify as an administrative expense entitled to priority in bankruptcy,but that the payment shall reduce the debtor obligations under the severance agreement on a basis,and that the remaining claims held by dane arising out of the severance agreement shall constitute general unsecured claims against the debtor bankruptcy estate,which were not entitled to administrative priority.app.at.
a motion to approve this arrangement was filed in the bankruptcy court pursuant to rule a of the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure on january.the motion was signed by counsel for servisense and assented to by counsel for the creditors committee.although the motion was originally granted by the bankruptcy court,a motion to reconsider was filed by appellant peter chief executive officer,a director,and a creditor of whether the debtor approved the agreement.while the motion to reconsider was still pending,a liquidating supervisor,craig jalbert,the appellee here,was appointed.the bankruptcy court later granted the motion to reconsider.
in the interim,dane had been terminated in february of.the parties dispute the circumstances of the termination.the appellants argue that bos terminated dane for cause on february,but the appellee argues that dane was terminated with all of the other servisense employees on february.on march,dane filed an administrative claim for,arguing that he was entitled to that amount because the severance agreement was executory and because servisense had never rejected the agreement.
on april,the liquidating supervisor entered into a settlement with dane under which dane would receive everything that he would have received under the proposed january,agreement.a motion to approve the settlement was granted by the bankruptcy court,in re,servisense i and the bankruptcy court action was affirmed on appeal to the district court,in re,wl,servisense ii.
on an appeal from the district court,we independently review the bankruptcy court decision the approval of a compromise is within the sound discretion of the bankruptcy judge,however,and this court will not overturn a decision to approve a compromise absent a clear showing that the bankruptcy judge abused his discretion.jeffrey desmond,cir citations omitted.we apply this abuse of discretion standard against the background understanding that c ompromises are favored in bankruptcy.leblanc salem in re mailman steam carpet cleaning,cir quoting hicks,muse brandt in re healthco int l,cir alteration in original.t he responsibility of the bankruptcy judge,and ours on review,is not to decide the numerous questions of law and fact raised by appellants but rather to canvass the issues and see whether the settlement falls below the lowest point in the range of reasonableness.healthco int l,at quoting cosoff rodman in re grant,cir internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.
the propriety of bankruptcy settlements is judged under a standard 
in deciding whether to approve a compromise of a lawsuit,the specific factors a bankruptcy court should consider include i the probability of success in the litigation being compromised ii the difficulties,if any,to be encountered in the matter of collection iii the complexity of the litigation involved,and the expense,inconvenience and delay attending it and,iv the paramount interest of the creditors and a proper deference to their reasonable views in the premise.the court consideration of these factors should demonstrate whether the compromise is fair and equitable,and whether the claim the debtor is giving up is outweighed by the advantage to the debtor estate.

the bankruptcy court held with respect to the first two factors that dane had a colorable claim to administrative priority for his claim under the severance agreement and there would be no difficulties in the matter of collection.servisense i,slip op.at.with respect to the third complexity,expense,inconvenience,and delay of bankruptcy court found given the acrimony which was evident during the hearings on these matters and which permeated the affidavits presented,obtaining the required evidence will be arduous.the expense of such litigation is certain to exceed the settlement amount of.id.at.finally,with respect to the fourth factor,the bankruptcy court concluded that,because the cost of litigation would in all likelihood exceed the settlement amount,the creditors interests would better be served by settling the matter,avoiding the litigation and having the case closed as expeditiously as possible.id.at.
the district court agreed that dane had a colorable claim and that,based on the parties prior animosity which it observed as well,litigation of the issues covered by the settlement would likely be rife with disputes.servisense ii,wl,at,slip op.at.in addition,the district court noted that the parties did not dispute the bankruptcy court finding that the expense of such litigation would be certain to exceed the settlement amount,and it held that the bankruptcy court acted within its discretion with respect to the other jeremiah factors.id.the district court also noted that no party had objected to the appointment of the liquidating supervisor,indicating that he was not seen as partial or untrustworthy,and that the creditors committee had assented to the original rpa and had not objected to the liquidating supervisor settlement.id.at.
