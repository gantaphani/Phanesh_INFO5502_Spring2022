in two contracts,one in and the other in,allan block licensed county materials to manufacture allan block patented concrete blocks.the contracts forbade county materials to manufacture competing concrete blocks with certain exceptions for as long as the contract was in effect and for months after it was terminated.but when the licenses were terminated both at the same time,county materials decided not to honor the covenants not to compete.its excuse was that enforcement would be patent misuse,and it filed a suit in a federal district court in wisconsin,basing federal jurisdiction on diversity of citizenship,for a declaration to that effect.recently another panel of this court held that there was no patent misuse,and so affirmed judgment for allan block.county materials allan block,cir.meanwhile,however,allan block had filed a suit,also basing jurisdiction on diversity,against county materials,charging breach of both the and licensing contracts.that one giving rise to the present to trial,and a jury awarded allan block in damages,and other relief.county materials appeals.allan block,seeking additional relief.
federal law is agreed to cover the issue of res judicata,minnesota law the contract issues.as an original matter,wisconsin law rather than federal law should govern the issue of res judicata because the judgment that is claimed to operate as res judicata in this suit was rendered in a diversity suit.the supreme court held in semtek international lockheed martin,d,that while federal common law determines the preclusive effect of a judgment in a federal suit,even if it is a diversity suit and thus based on a claim under state law,the federal court should in a diversity case adopt as the federal common law rule of res judicata the rule of the state in which the court is located,which in this case is wisconsin.it is true that the dispositive issue in the previous diversity suit was federal patent misuse,but it was a defense to a claim of breach of a patent licensing agreement county materials license to manufacture allan block patented blocks,a claim that arose under state law.it would complicate matters unduly to base the rule of preclusion on the existence of a federal defense the defense of patent misuse that county materials was trying to establish by seeking declaratory relief,in order to prevent allan block from enforcing the covenants.in any event,parties are free to choose within reason whatever body of law they want to govern a litigation.
county materials main argument is that allan block claim of breach of contract is a compulsory counterclaim to the claim of patent misuse and therefore had to be filed as a counterclaim in the declaratory judgment suit or be forever forfeited.it is indeed for the most qualification explained later a compulsory counterclaim,defined in.a as any claim which at the time of serving the pleading the pleader has against any opposing party,if it arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party claim.both county materials claim of patent misuse and allan block claim of breach of contract arose out of the same transaction,namely county materials refusal to honor the covenants not to compete.
failing to file a compulsory counterclaim does normally preclude its being made the subject of another lawsuit.the doctrine of res judicata bars a person from splitting his claim between two suits,restatement second of judgments,and comment b,and allan block claim that the covenants not to compete are enforceable and that county materials has therefore broken them is the same claim whether it is interposed as a defense in a suit by the covenanter or made the basis of a separate suit for breach of the covenants.charles alan wright,estoppel by rule the compulsory counterclaim under modern pleading,iowa.and the fact that the earlier suit county materials involved only one of the two contracts and the later suit both would not allow allan block to sue even on the contract assuming the judgment in the first suit had res judicata effect,given its intimate connection to the first contract and the identity of the covenants not to compete in both contracts.the two contracts were parts of the same commercial relation,properly classified as a single transaction for purposes of res judicata in order to prevent piecemeal litigation.petromanagement joint venture,cir weston funding lafayette towers,cir.even more clearly,the covenants,though separable from the license contracts because effective only upon termination of the latter,are parts of the commercial relation established by them.
but there is an exception to res judicata for cases in which the only relief sought in the first suit is a declaratory judgment,stericycle,city of delavan,cir wisconsin law smith city of chicago,cir harborside refrigerated services,vogel,cir horn hardart national rail passenger,restatement,supra,and comment giving such a judgment preclusive effect would stymie a plaintiff who,having obtained a declaratory judgment,later the defendant thumbed his nose at the relief,an authorized and common sequel to a declaratory judgment.see declaratory judgment act,stericycle,city of delavan,supra,at.prudence would therefore require him if a declaratory judgment had preclusive effect to ask for injunctive relief in his first suit,rather than just for declaratory would usually make obtaining declaratory relief pointless.of course if specific issues are resolved in the declaratory judgment action,their resolution will bind the plaintiff by virtue of the doctrine of collateral estoppel should he later seek an injunction or damages.charles wright,arthur miller,edward cooper,federal practice and procedure,ed.but that is not a factor in this litigation.
this concern that we have just articulated with giving res judicata effect to a declaratory judgment is absent when the question is whether the defendant in the declaratory judgment action who fails to file a counterclaim that arises from the same transaction is barred by res judicata from filing a separate suit,because a defendant would not be wanting to reserve the right to seek further relief.nevertheless,he is not barred.harborside refrigerated services,vogel,supra,at restatement,supra,comment c.the reason is practical if the defendant had to bring his claims against the plaintiff as counterclaims in the declaratory judgment action,declaratory judgments would become devices for thwarting the choice of forum by the defendant,even though,in many declaratory judgment suits,including the one brought by county materials,the plaintiff is seeking declaratory relief in order to defeat preemptively a claim by the defendant.
county materials acknowledges the declaratory judgment exception to res judicata,but considers it a rule that must yield to rule a,the rule.but rule a is not independent of the doctrine of res judicata.it is in effect a procedural implementation of that doctrine.wright,supra kevin clermont,compulsory counterclaim rule creating effective and elegant res judicata doctrine,notre dame.see hartford accident indemnity sullivan,cir glass sylvania industrial,cir frank,dissenting.all rule a does is command that certain claims be pleaded as counterclaims.it does not specify the consequences of failing to do so.those consequences are given by the doctrine of res judicata,including its exceptions.to invoke rule a as a bar to basing a suit on a claim that might be thought a compulsory counterclaim in a declaratory judgment action would bring about what refusing to apply res judicata to defendants in such actions is designed to prevent forcing the defendant claims to be litigated as counterclaims in such an action.
against this conclusion,however,can be cited polymer industrial products,which holds that the defendant in a suit to declare his patent invalid must counterclaim for damages for infringement of the patent or lose his claim for such damages.the opinion relies on a literal interpretation of rule a the claim for infringement arises out of the same the plaintiff alleged the plaintiff claim that the patent is invalid and the rule itself,as we know,contains no express ex
