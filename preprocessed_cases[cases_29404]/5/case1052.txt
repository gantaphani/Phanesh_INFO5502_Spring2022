this appeal concerns whether a defendant is entitled to attorney fees as a prevailing party under of the copyright act,when a plaintiff voluntarily dismisses without prejudice a lawsuit containing copyright claims.in corcoran columbia broadcasting system,cir,we held a defendant in a copyright suit was a prevailing party and was entitled to attorney fees when the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the complaint without prejudice after the district court granted defendant motion for more definite statement.the supreme court,in the context of the fair housing amendments act fhaa,has since held prevailing party status turns on whether there has been a material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties,buckhannon bd.care home.dep t of health human,d internal quotation marks omitted,and we have held dismissal without prejudice does not alter the legal relationship of parties for the purposes of entitlement to attorney fees under a comparable fee shifting statute,see oscar alaska dep t of educ.early,cir.
we conclude corcoran is clearly irreconcilable with buckhannon and no longer good law.we therefore overrule corcoran and hold buckhannon material alteration test applies to of the copyright act.see miller gammie,cir en banc holding panel can reject prior panel opinion that is clearly irreconcilable with intervening supreme court authority.because the plaintiffs in this lawsuit remained free to refile their copyright claims against the defendants in federal court following their voluntary dismissal of the complaint,we hold the defendants are not prevailing parties and thus not entitled to the attorney fees the district court awarded them 
background 
from about until the,emil cadkin,sometimes solely and sometimes with william loose,created and recorded thousands of music cues,which are short musical works used in television and movies.these cues were administered by grh music grh,a partnership owned by emil cadkin and william loose.in the,emil cadkin authorized william loose to license the music cues to third parties.at some point,emil cadkin formed the cadkin trust as owner of all his copyright interests,appointing lila cadkin as trustee.
william loose incorporated music,to license music he controlled.the proceeds of music,are split between irma loose,william loose spouse,and the william loose family trust,which william loose formed to benefit his children.terrence loose is the trustee of the william loose family trust.
in october,emil cadkin and lila cadkin as trustee of the cadkin trust collectively the cadkins filed a complaint in federal district court against terrence loose as trustee of the william loose family trust the trust and irma loose and music,collectively.the complaint alleged william loose had removed emil cadkin name as author and grh name as publisher from cues emil cadkin had composed on his own or jointly with william loose,incorporated those cues into the music library with william loose credited as the sole author and then registered those cues with the copyright office,thereby allowing william loose to obtain the full royalty from the cues use.the allegations implicated over cues.the complaint contained numerous claims for relief,including copyright infringement,false designation of origin trademark and various california state law claims.
after extended settlement discussions proved fruitless,the trust and in february filed motions to dismiss,which the district court granted in part.the district court found the state law claims were preempted by the copyright act,dismissing them without prejudice found the fraud claims were not alleged with sufficient particularity,dismissing them without prejudice and directed the cadkins to join certain necessary parties.
the cadkins thereafter filed a first amended complaint,which contained three claims for relief copyright infringement,false designation of origin trademark and declaratory relief.the trust and again moved to dismiss.the district court,relying primarily on the cadkins failure to cite any legal authority in their opposition and insufficient specificity in the amended complaint factual allegations,granted the motion with leave to amend.
the cadkins then moved to remand the case to state court,with a second amended complaint appended.the motion admitted none of the parties herein may own the rights in any of the musical compositions at issue.the district court denied the motion to remand,explaining that remand was not possible when the case had been initiated in federal court.thereafter,the parties and the district court treated the second amended complaint as the operative pleading.it contained only state law claims declaratory judgment,unjust enrichment and accounting for profits.
the trust and again moved to dismiss,arguing the second amended complaint should be dismissed without leave to amend because all three state law claims were preempted by the copyright act,the factual allegations lacked specificity and any federal copyright or trademark claims were waived because they were not included in the amended pleading.the cadkins opposed the motion to dismiss and lodged a notice of voluntary dismissal under federal rule of civil procedure a.the district court deferred ruling on the trust and motions to dismiss until it ruled on the cadkins voluntary dismissal,which was eventually entered without comment on the district court docket in october.
the trust and then sought attorney fees and costs and,respectively.the trust later sought an additional in fees for work related to the attorney fees motion and response.at the district court direction,reduced its requested fee to carve out fees attributable to work on a related lawsuit not involving the cadkins,for a final requested amount of.

ii.standard of review 
we review an award of attorney fees under the copyright act for abuse of discretion.see traditional cat ass n,gilbreath,cir.a district court abuses its discretion when its decision is based on an inaccurate view of the law or a clearly erroneous finding of fact.id.
iii.discussion 
jurisdiction 
initially,we address our jurisdiction to consider the cadkins appeal of the order awarding the trust attorney fees.the trust maintains we lack jurisdiction because the cadkins notice of appeal listed only the february,judgment and did not explicitly list the december,judgment on the line specifying the order being appealed.we reject this argument.
when a party seeks to argue the merits of an order that does not appear on the face of the notice of appeal,we consider whether the intent to appeal a specific judgment can be fairly inferred and whether the appellee was prejudiced by the mistake.le astrue,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in determining whether intent and prejudice are present,we consider first,whether the affected party had notice of the issue on appeal and,second,whether the affected party had an opportunity to fully brief the issue.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
the notice of appeal refers to judgments re fees emphasis added,indicating the cadkins wished to appeal both the february judgment in favor of and the december judgment in favor of the trust.moreover,the notice of appeal notification form filed concurrently with the notice of appeal identifies two items on the line specifying the orders or judgments being appealed,and the trust had the opportunity to fully brief the propriety of the attorney fees award on appeal.the trust plainly had notice the cadkins were appealing the judgment in the trust favor and had ample opportunity to address the merits of that issue.
