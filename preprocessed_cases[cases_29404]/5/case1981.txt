introduction 
we hold that the owner of the dominant tenement possessing over the servient tenement an access easement that includes the right to grant other easements for like purposes may convey to an owner of property adjoining the dominant tenement an enforceable easement for access over the servient tenement.we also hold that when a party records a late notice to preserve easement under civil code section the attorney fees that can be assessed as a condition to dismissal of an action to establish the abandonment of an easement may include only those fees incurred in connection with that action for statutory abandonment,and not the fees incurred otherwise in the proceeding to contest the validity of the easement.

plaintiff commenced this litigation on june,by filing a complaint to quiet title in abandoned easement and for declaratory relief.plaintiff asserted his first cause of action under civil code section for statutory abandonment of easement.in his second cause of action,plaintiff sought declaratory relief with respect to the parties respective rights concerning the easement over plaintiff lot.on june,defendant recorded a late notice of intent to preserve easement under civil code section.on july,defendant filed a to quiet title and for declaratory and injunctive relief.
on september,defendant filed a motion to dismiss the action under civil code section because of the filing of the notice to preserve easement.plaintiff opposed the motion on the ground that defendant was not an owner of an easement within the meaning of civil code section because the instrument creating the easement in favor of defendant lot had not been executed by any owner of lot was not within the chain of title to plaintiff property.

law of easements 
an easement is a nonpossessory interest in land of another.wright best cal d,witkin,summary of cal.law ed.real property,witkin it is an interest in the land of another,which entitles the owner of the easement to a limited use or enjoyment of the other land bruce and ely,the law of easements and licenses in land ed,bruce and ely.easements may be either appurtenant or in gross.continental baking katz cal d,miller starr ed.cal.real estate,miller starr.an appurtenant easement attaches to the land of the easement holder and benefits the holder as the owner or possessor of the land.buehler plywood cal d,buehler witkin,supra,real property,at see.the land to which an appurtenant easement is attached is called the dominant tenement,and the land that is burdened by the easement is called the servient tenement wright best,supra,cal d at,camp meeker water system,public utilities com.cal d,witkin,supra,real property,at see.an appurtenant easement attaches only to the land of the easement holder it can not be severed and transferred separately from the dominant tenement unless otherwise provided by the parties at the time the easement was created.buehler,supra,cal d at,rest d property,servitudes,com.b.an easement in gross is not attached to any particular land,but is a personal right to use the land of another.it exists whenever the easement is not created for the purpose of benefiting land possessed by the easement owner and does not pass with the land.moylan dykes d.witkin,supra,real property,at see.because an easement in gross is personal,it may be conveyed independent of land.city of anaheim metropolitan water dist.of southern cal.d.city of anaheim.
an easement can be created to burden or benefit any estate in land,including future estates.rest d property,servitudes,supra.the intent of the parties determines which estates or servitude interests are burdened or benefited by a servitude.if their intent is not expressed,it may be inferred from the circumstances.in the absence of circumstances indicating some other intent,the normal inference is that the parties intend to burden or benefit the estates or other interests they own in the property.rest d,property,servitudes,supra,com.a,at moylan dykes,supra,d at.easements as property rights,when appurtenant to land,are transferable and descendible.moylan dykes,supra,d at,rest d property,servitudes,supra,bruce and ely,supra,at to.easement in gross are also alienable.callahan martin cal d,miller starr,supra,cal.real estate,at.
an easement can be created by an express or implied grant or reservation,prescription,deed,agreement,recorded covenant,or any instrument that transfers an interest or estate in real property.cushman davis d.miller starr,supra,cal.real estate,at,at.an instrument creating an easement is subject to the same rules of construction applicable to deeds and is interpreted in the same manner as a contract.the conveyance is interpreted in the first instance by the language of the document.when the intent of the parties can be derived from the plain meaning of the words used in the deed,the court should not rely on the statutory rules of construction when the document creating the easement is ambiguous,the court looks to the surrounding circumstances,the relationship between the parties,the properties,and the nature and purpose of the easement in order to establish the intention of the parties.the cardinal rule of interpretation is to ascertain and enforce the intentions of both the grantor and the grantee.miller starr,supra,cal.real estate,at fns.omitted see,the extent of a servitude is determined by the terms of the grant,or the nature of the enjoyment by which it was acquired,grants are to be interpreted in like manner with contracts in general,continental baking katz,supra,cal d at,kerr land timber emmerson d.in determining the scope of the easement the same rules are applicable as would apply to the construction of the terms of a contract.
validity of easement 
the easement at issue here was created by a series of express grants.by deed,oakley conveyed an appurtenant easement over plaintiff property lot in favor of palace court,the owner of lot at that time.in addition to granting an appurtenant easement over plaintiff property,deed conveyed to palace court the further right to grant easements for like purposes to others to be appurtenant to other lands.palace court exercised this further right when,pursuant to deed,it conveyed an access easement over plaintiff property,identical to the one it had,in favor of the owner of defendant property lot.palace court property is contiguous to plaintiff property.defendant property is contiguous to palace court property on the west and is immediately to the northwest of plaintiff property.
plaintiff concedes that deed granted palace court an appurtenant easement over plaintiff property.plaintiff argues,however,that palace court could not validly extend the benefit of its appurtenant easement to defendant property because deed fails specifically to identify another property,such as defendant property,as a dominant tenement,and that interpreting or applying deed as providing easement rights to defendant property would permit an unlimited number of easements outside the chain of title to plaintiff property and unreasonably burden plaintiff property.plaintiff argues that defendant is asserting,in effect,an easement in gross and that appurtenant easements may not be severed and converted into easements in gross.
easement right of property not specified in grant of easement 
as a general rule,an appurtenant easement may not be used for the benefit of property other than the dominant tenement specified in the grant of the easement,unless the terms of the easement provide otherwise.wright best,supra,cal d at,rest d property,servitudes,supra.the issue plaintiff raises is whether a property not identified in the document creating the easement can thereafter become an additional dominant tenement.
no identification of defendant property 
plaintiff contends there is no evidence of an express agreement to extend the benefit of the easement conveyed by deed to properties other than lot,the property owned by palace court at the time of the conveyance.plaintiff assertion is contradicted,however,by the language of deed itself,which,in addition to granting palace court an appurtenant easement across a wide strip of land on plaintiff property,unambiguously conveyed the separate and distinct further right to grant easements for like purposes to others to be appurtenant to other lands.
wright best,supra,cal d,on which plaintiff relies,is inapposite.in that case,the california supreme court held that an easement created for the benefit of mines owned or operated by the easement holder could not be extended to mines that were not owned or operated by the easement holder at the time the easement was created.id.at.the court reasoned that i n the absence of a very clear intention to the contrary,a court should not assume that the grantor contracted with reference to any claims which were not then in operation.ibid.the court further noted,in order to validly create such rights which will benefit property to be later acquired,the parties must express their intention in such manner as to admit of no doubt.ibid.the intention of the parties in this case,as set forth in the terms of deed,was to accord palace court the right to grant easements for like purposes to others to be appurtenant to other lands.the plain language of the deed states the parties intent that other lands benefit from the access easement over plaintiff property.moylan dykes,supra,d at.miller starr,supra,cal.real estate,at rest d property,servitudes,supra,com,at.
plaintiff also contends the failure of deed between plaintiff predecessor,oakley,and palace court to identify defendant property as an intended dominant tenement invalidates the subsequent conveyance in deed from palace court to the owner of defendant property.plaintiff also asserts that the language,the further right to grant easements for like purposes to others to be appurtenant to other lands is legally insufficient to give palace court the right to convey an easement to the owner of defendant property because that language does not specify the geographic parameters of the other lands to be benefited.plaintiff states that t his vague and unspecific power to extend the benefits of the appurtenant easement to any owner of any land dooms the validity of the easement.
plaintiff can point to no authority requiring that,in the document conveying to the owner of the dominant tenement the right to grant other properties an easement over the servient tenement,there be identification of those other properties.failure to specify the dominant tenement in the instrument creating an easement does not necessarily invalidate the easement.see miller starr,supra,cal.real estate,at fn.omitted when the deed does not identify the dominant tenement to which the easement is appurtenant,the court can examine extrinsic evidence,such as the testimony of the parties to the deed,the context of the transaction in which the deed was given,the physical location of the easement in relation to other property,and the like,in order to identify the dominant tenement see moylan dykes,supra,d at.court may look to extrinsic evidence when deed makes no reference to dominant tenement.here,the grantee was the owner of a specifically identified dominant tenement and was given the authority to designate other dominant tenements.
a dominant owner may not use an appurtenant easement to benefit any property other than the dominant estate.bruce and ely,supra,at.but here,the grantor has authorized multiple dominant tenements.there can be concurrent easement rights in owners of different properties to use the servient tenement.id,at.for example,the right to use an easement appurtenant extends to each subdivided portion of the dominant estate.the owner of a divided part of the original dominant tenement may use the easement,even though the owner particular lot does not abut the servitude.id,at to.these principles logically support defendant easement rights here.
by the express language of deed,oakley and palace court contemplated that the owners of lot would not only have an easement over lot,but have the right to grant easements over lot to owners of other properties,such as lot.deed conveyed to the owners of lot an access easement over plaintiff property,including the right to grade and improve the same,extending in a westerly direction from the new dume road deed provided the owners of lot the further right to grant easements for like purposes to others to be appurtenant to other lands,and the right to dedicate the same.
even if we consider the extrinsic evidence,it supports defendant position that defendant property was intended to be a dominant tenement.a month after the recordation of deed,deed was recorded,and it conveyed to the owner of defendant property the roadway access easement referred to in deed.but for the roadway easement,defendant property,which is located to the northwest of plaintiff property,would be landlocked,without access to kanan dume the only road servicing the area.by document,pursuant to the authority in deed,palace court conveyed an easement over plaintiff property to a landowner adjoining palace court property and in that document,recorded one month later,described the nature of the area and proposed road.that document states that palace court right to convey like easements to others was to provide for extension of the roadway to serve certain properties to the west and north of palace court property.defendant property is located within those geographic parameters.even though deed and document were executed after deed and not executed by oakley,the documents were executed within the same general time period,and deed and document are consistent with,and appear to carry out,the purpose of deed authorization of the right to grant easements for like purpose.thus,the context of the transaction in which the deed was given,the physical location of the easement in relation to other property,and the like,miller starr,supra,cal.real estate,at see moylan dykes,supra,d at.suggest that defendant lot was the type of property intended to be a dominant tenement.
unlimited future easements 
plaintiff contends that interpreting deed to permit palace court to convey subsequent easements to unspecified other lands would seemingly allow palace court or its successor to grant an unlimited number of easements over plaintiff property with no geographic limitation or proximity requirement,thereby unreasonably burdening plaintiff land.plaintiff argues that such easement grants would be outside the chain of title to plaintiff property and would cloud marketable title to that property.
that deed did not identify with greater specificity the other lands to be benefited by subsequent easement grants does not invalidate defendant easement.interpreting deed to allow the conveyance of an easement in favor of defendant property would not,as plaintiff contends,necessarily grant palace court and its successors to right to convey an unlimited number of easements over plaintiff property with no geographic or proximity requirement.we do not have to determine if the grant was intended to be,and could be,unlimited,because we deal with whether defendant property can benefit from that easement.plaintiff has offered no evidence that the servient tenement is overburdened or subjected to unreasonable damage 
deed indication that the easement was for access to the proposed dume road and specification that future easement grants be for a like purpose do not suggest an unlimited number of potential dominant tenements.neither do deed and document,which are for such access for properties in the immediate area.document,recorded one month after deed and simultaneously with deed,at least indicate the general geographic boundaries for future easement grants.document states that palace court had acquired an access easement over plaintiff property that palace court had undertaken,at its expense,the survey of grading and improvement of a roadway upon that easement and that palace court right to grant like easements to others was to provide for extension of that roadway westerly and northerly,in order to serve the northeasterly quarter of the northwesterly quarter of section.defendant property is located in the northeasterly quarter of the northwesterly quarter of section.
the courts have held use of a roadway easement to be limited only by the requirement that it be reasonably necessary and consistent with purposes for which the easement was granted.wall rudolph d,quoting city of pasadena.cal d.such use presumptively includes normal future development within the scope of the basic purpose.id.at.see also annotation,extent and reasonableness of use of private way in exercise of easement granted in general terms,and cases cited.extending the benefit of the easement granted by deed to other lands in the northeasterly quarter of the northwesterly quarter of section for access to kanan dume road appears to be consistent with both the normal future development of the area and the purposes for which the easement was granted.see camp meeker water system,public utilities,supra,cal d at,it is to be assumed that the parties anticipated such uses as might reasonably be required by a normal development of the dominant tenement.moreover,the grantor must have contemplated some significant use of the easement because she gave the grantee the right to dedicate the same and gave easement rights to subdivisions of lot.
that defendant easement may not have been recorded in the chain of title to plaintiff property is not a reason for invalidating that easement.an easement need not be recorded to be enforceable.miller starr,supra,cal.real estate,at.although an unrecorded easement may not be enforceable against a bona fide purchaser of the servient estate zimmerman young d,plaintiff does not claim to be a bona fide purchaser against whom defendant easement rights are unenforceable.moreover,the easement that was recorded and in the chain of title to plaintiff property gives notice of the right of the owner of lot the initial dominant tenement to grant to other property owners an easement over plaintiff property.because plaintiff does not claim to be a bona fide purchaser without notice of the easement,we need not decide whether there is sufficient notice of defendant easement rights as against a bona fide purchaser of plaintiff property.
appurtenant easement or easement in gross 
plaintiff contends that the conveyance in deed of easement rights to the owner of defendant property amounted to an improper attempt to convert an appurtenant easement into an easement in gross,in violation of california real property law.plaintiff concedes that deed conveyed two distinct appurtenant access easement across plaintiff property in favor of lot and the right to grant easements over the same access area to benefit other properties.the conveyance in deed was an exercise of the latter of these two rights.there is no evidence to suggest that that conveyance was an attempt to sever the access easement appurtenant to lot and to transfer it to defendant property or to a owner.
plaintiff argues that the right conveyed
