golden pisces,golden pisces and onebeacon america insurance group onebeacon appeal the district court order denying their motion for attorneys fees following their successful suit for breach of contract against fred wahl marine construction,fred wahl.under the american rule,which applies in federal litigation,including maritime litigation,golden pisces and onebeacon are not entitled to attorneys fees absent statutory authorization,an enforceable contractual provision,or an equitable exception to the rule.rich indus.lumber,d.because no statute authorizes attorneys fees for this maritime cause of action,because the parties contract was void,and because no recognized equitable exception applies,we affirm the district court order denying attorneys fees.
golden pisces owns the golden pisces,which at the time this action arose was based in newport,oregon.in the fall of,golden pisces and fred wahl,a shipyard in reedsport,oregon,entered into an oral agreement whereby fred wahl would make repairs on the golden pisces,with golden pisces paying standard shipyard rates and costs for work performed.after the parties entered into the oral agreement,fred wahl presented the golden pisces captain with a form contract that purported to limit fred wahl liability through a warranty disclaimer.the form contract also contained a clause providing for attorneys fees in favor of the prevailing party i n any litigation to enforce or interpret this agreement.although the captain signed the form contract,it was never signed by the ship manager nor was it signed by a representative of fred wahl.
fred wahl completed the repairs in december.the golden pisces departed for alaska for the a cod fishing season at the beginning of january.in february,in the midst of fishing operations,the golden pisces suffered problems due to misalignment of the propeller shaft that fred wahl had installed.it returned to the fishing grounds after undergoing repairs in dutch harbor,alaska,only to break down again at the beginning of march.it was towed back to dutch harbor and missed the remainder of the fishing season.golden pisces insurer,onebeacon,paid in repairs.
golden pisces and onebeacon brought suit against fred wahl in district court,alleging negligence,breach of contract,breach of warranty,and breach of the implied warranty of workmanlike performance,and claiming consequential losses and lost profits.fred wahl raised the affirmative defenses that golden pisces was comparatively negligent that golden pisces impliedly warranted the suitability of a propeller it provided to fred wahl for installation that the owner accepted the repairs following sea trials and that the work order and attached form contract created an enforceable agreement so as to disclaim fred wahl of any liability for all consequential,indirect or special damages,pursuant to the terms of the contractual warranty disclaimer.fred wahl also counterclaimed for unpaid repair bills.the parties stipulated to several facts but disputed whether golden pisces was comparatively negligent and whether the terms of the form contract controlled.
after a trial,the district court found for golden pisces and onebeacon on the issue of liability.it further found that there was no written contract between the parties which would operate to limit plaintiffs remedies against defendant.the court concluded that the work order and form contract did not create an enforceable contract 
the document fails to set forth essential terms of the agreement,such as a complete description of the work to be performed,the amount to be charged for the repair work and the payment terms.the document further contains an integration clause which precluded referencing prior or subsequent oral agreements to supply the missing terms t here are no written modifications.the document is not even signed by a representative of wahl.
the court thus held that the terms of the parties oral did not include an implied warranty disclaimer or an attorneys fees.the court awarded golden pisces for damage to the vessel and in lost profits and awarded onebeacon.it awarded fred wahl on its counterclaim against golden pisces for outstanding bills.
golden pisces and onebeacon then moved for attorneys fees and costs.because no federal statute provides for attorneys fees in suits arising in admiralty,golden pisces and onebeacon invoked the following provision from the form contract on which fred wahl had unsuccessfully relied in defending against the complaint 
in any litigation to enforce or interpret this agreement,the losing party agrees to pay the prevailing party reasonable attorney fees including costs of depositions and experts.
the district court granted golden pisces and onebeacon motion for costs but denied the motion for attorneys fees,holding there was no written contract between the parties and that consequently the purported attorney fees clause was null and void,and not enforceable against either party in this action,regardless of the outcome.see,perry,cir.
golden pisces and onebeacon timely appealed.
the district court had original jurisdiction over this maritime action pursuant to our appellate jurisdiction arises under.we review de novo conclusions of law,including interpretations of the american rule,by a district court sitting in admiralty.madeja olympic packers,llc,cir perry,at.when the district court correctly interprets the american rule,however,we review its decision whether to award or deny attorneys fees for abuse of discretion.perry,at.
because golden pisces and onebeacon claim arose in admiralty,federal law governs this appeal.see royal ins.of am.pier,cir.in federal litigation,the american rule generally precludes an award of attorneys fees absent statutory authorization or an enforceable contractual fees provision.alyeska pipeline serv.wilderness soc y,d see also rich,at.perry,at.however,federal courts have created a limited set of equitable exceptions to the american rule and will award attorneys fees even in the absence of an applicable statutory or contractual provision when,for example,the losing party acted in bad faith or willfully disobeyed a court order.see alyeska,at.these exceptions are unquestionably assertions of inherent power in the courts to allow attorneys fees in particular situations.id.at.
golden pisces and onebeacon do not argue that a statute or enforceable contract authorizes an attorneys fees award here.nor do they argue that a previously recognized equitable exception to the american rule applies in this set of circumstances.instead,golden pisces and onebeacon ask this court to recognize a new equitable exception to the american rule by announcing a uniform maritime rule of true reciprocity of contractual attorney fees provisions so as to enforce a contractual attorneys fees provision in favor of a party who prevailed in a breach of contract action by showing that the underlying contract was void.golden pisces and onebeacon have not pointed us to a single federal or state court decision that so held in the absence of a governing reciprocity statute nor have they demonstrated the existence of a compelling policy rationale to create this new exception we therefore decline their invitation and affirm the district court denial of fees.
when there is no effective manifestation of assent,there is no contract at all.restatement second of contracts cmt.a.here,the district court found that the parties had not mutually assented to the terms of the form contract.without mutual assent,the parties written contract was therefore void.see restatement second of contracts cmt.a defining void contract as a promise for breach of which the law neither gives a remedy nor otherwise recognizes a duty of performance by the promisor and explaining that such a promise is not a contract at all.
consistent with this understanding that a void contract is not a contract at all,in applying the american rule federal courts have distinguished between contracts that are void as opposed to divisible or voidable.in a diversity case applying indiana law,for example,the seventh circuit enforced an attorneys fees provision in an employment contract in favor of the mo
