plaintiff appellant robert hilton appeals from the judgment of the united states district court for the northern district of new york hurd,dismissing his complaint against lester wright and the new york department of correctional services after granting the defendants motion for summary judgment on hilton individual claims for damages arising from asserted violations of his rights under the eighth amendment of the united states constitution,the americans with disabilities act,and the rehabilitation act.hilton also appeals from that portion of a separate order of the district court denying his application,on behalf of a class,for the award of certain costs incurred by his counsel in connection with monitoring a settlement between the class and the defendants.because the district court did not adequately explain why it granted the defendants motion for summary judgment on hilton claims for damages,we vacate the judgment and remand the case for the district court to address more fully the defendants motion.additionally,because the district court misinterpreted the parties settlement agreement with respect to the recovery of reasonable costs,we vacate that part of its order denying hilton application for reimbursement of expenses and remand the issue to the district court for it to determine in its discretion whether to grant,fully or partially,hilton application for such costs.
background 
plaintiff appellant robert hilton,a former state prisoner,is infected with the hepatitis c virus hcv,a slowly progressive but potentially fatal disease affecting the liver.defendant appellee new york state department of correctional services docs was aware of hilton condition when he was placed in its custody in april.hilton served about a year in prison but did not receive treatment for his condition allegedly because docs determined,pursuant to its guidelines then in effect,that hilton period of incarceration was not long enough to allow for proper evaluation and treatment.shortly after hilton was released,he was convicted of a new crime and returned to docs in august.
in may,after a lengthy screening process,certain members of the docs medical staff recommended that he be treated with antiviral drugs to combat his hcv.hilton was not allowed to receive such treatment,however,without the express authorization of defendant appellee lester wright,chief medical officer and assistant commissioner of docs.wright refused to allow treatment because he determined that hilton was ineligible under existing docs guidelines guidelines which he himself had promulgated.specifically,because hilton had admitted to using drugs in the past his hcv antiviral treatment was conditioned on his completion of or enrollment in one of two select docs substance abuse programs program requirement after hilton was denied treatment,he sought to enroll in one of the programs,but he soon learned that he was ineligible because,as gauged by the earliest date of possible release,he was not going to be in prison long enough to complete that program.around that time,hilton complained to members of the prison medical staff about symptoms related to his hcv.the staff forwarded this information to wright,noting that hilton was again requesting antiviral treatment.wright asked for hilton medical records and,after studying those related to prior hcv treatment at bellevue hospital in new york city,concluded that hilton was a who would not benefit from antiviral treatment.
on august,a little more than three months after hilton original request for treatment was denied,hilton filed this lawsuit against wright and docs and moved for a temporary restraining order that would require wright to authorize antiviral treatment.shortly thereafter,wright stipulated that he would authorize treatment for hilton 
on september,hilton amended his complaint to join another inmate as a plaintiff and to assert claims on behalf of all similarly situated prisoners in the custody of docs.the complaint asserted three causes of action.first,under and the eighth and fourteenth amendments of the constitution,it sought damages and equitable relief based on the defendants asserted deliberate indifference to the plaintiffs serious medical needs.the complaint alleged that the policy conditioning hcv antiviral treatment for former alcohol and drug users on their participation in the program was without medical justification.the requirement true aim,the complaint asserted,was to limit the number of inmates receiving such treatment and,thereby,save money.the complaint also asserted that docs had an unusually long hcv screening process in place for the same reason the second and third causes of action sought damages and equitable relief based on asserted violations of the americans with disabilities act ada,and the rehabilitation act.they alleged that the defendants regarded the plaintiffs as disabled on the basis of their former drug or alcohol use,and discriminated against them through the program requirement.
the district court certified the class with respect to the plaintiffs claims for injunctive relief in february,and the parties began settlement discussions.in july,they reached an interim settlement agreement,which became final in january settlement agreement.the settlement agreement resolved all of the class injunctive and equitable claims.it permanently eliminated the program requirement and provided steps to identify and treat those prisoners that had been previously denied medication because of their failure to participate in the program the settlement agreement also called for payment to class counsel of fees for attorney and paralegal time used monitoring the agreement implementation for a period.the award of those fees was capped at,subject to discretionary upward adjustment by the district court.
one method of such monitoring was the distribution of a questionnaire to affected prisoners.hilton lawyers agreed to collect and analyze the questionnaires and share the results with docs.this information was intended to give docs a definitive class list and a mechanism to monitor its own compliance with the settlement agreement.because docs did not know which inmates had been denied treatment pursuant to the program requirement,the questionnaire was mailed to all hcv infected inmates and served as the class members only form of notification about the settlement agreement.the expanded number of inmate responses to the questionnaire greatly increased the administrative burden on hilton lawyers,who,according to hilton,became essentially responsible for coordinating relief under the settlement agreement.they hired an assistant to enter data and manage correspondence with the inmates.this latter function also required retaining translation services and engineering several.eventually hilton lawyers sent docs a list of around potential class members,and docs,through its own records,was able to reduce the list to 
the settlement agreement left hilton and the other named plaintiff with claims against wright and docs for damages only.the defendants moved for summary judgement on these claims.in a order the district court granted the motion.as all of the plaintiffs claims had either settled or been disposed of by summary judgment,the district court entered judgment dismissing hilton complaint.hilton appealed and his settled.
while hilton appeal was pending,his attorneys moved the district court for fees and costs incurred monitoring the settlement agreement.they applied for the maximum amount of attorneys fees and also in additional expenses mostly incurred paying the hired assistant to administer the questionnaires and compile the original class list.the district court granted the full amount of documented attorneys fees but denied the expenses.
discussion 
section claims against wright 
hilton appeals the district court decision to grant summary judgment against him on his section claim for damages against wright.the district court disposed of that claim in one paragraph.it concluded that there was not a genuine issue of material fact about whether wright conduct violated the eighth amendment because 
plaintiffs robert hilton and louis vasquez not a party to this appeal had three and four months sic delay respectively for treatment of their hepatitis c because of the requirement to enroll in an asat or rsat program.the plaintiffs submitted records fail to establish that either received a serious injury because of the delays.
additionally,the district court held that even if there were a genuine issue of material fact about whether hilton constitutional rights were violated,wright nevertheless would be entitled to qualified immunity.
although we review grants of summary judgment de novo,the opinion of the district court is often helpful in guiding our examination of the record.in this case,the extreme brevity of the district court opinion with respect to hilton section claim denies us this usual assistance.indeed,the district court determination that wright enjoys qualified immunity from hilton claim is entirely conclusory and essentially requires this court to consider the issue in the first instance.under these circumstances,we elect to vacate the district court grant of summary judgement against hilton on his eighth amendment claim and remand the issue for further explanation as to one or both of the following questions 
why,given the evidence on the record,there is no genuine issue of material fact about whether wright is entitled to qualified and immunity,and why there is no genuine issue of material fact about whether the doctor conduct violated the eighth amendment.
when clarifying these aspects of its decision,the district court should bear in mind the following.in pearson callahan,d,the supreme court revised the traditional qualified immunity analysis set out in saucier katz,d.saucier had instructed courts considering a defendant qualified immunity from suit to first determine whether the plaintiff had a viable claim that one or more of his or her constitutional rights had been violated.see id.at.if the court was satisfied that the plaintiff had indeed alleged or,in the context of a motion for summary judgement,shown a genuine issue of material fact regarding a constitutional violation,then the next step under saucier was to determine whether the conduct alleged violated a clearly established constitutional right about which an objectively reasonable person would have known.see harlow fitzgerald,d.this was to ensure that government officials are not held liable for conduct that,prior to the case at hand,was generally thought to be acceptable.pearson freed courts from the mandatory nature of saucier process and allowed them to do the second,and often dispositive,step first.at.henceforth courts may avoid reaching difficult questions of constitutional law where there is no question that an objectively reasonable government official would not have known his conduct was in violation of the constitution,that is,where the right asserted by the plaintiff is not clearly established.
as it stands now,judges of the district court should be permitted to exercise their sound discretion in deciding which of the two prongs of the qualified immunity analysis should be addressed first in light of the circumstances in the particular case at hand.id.at.thus,we do not pass on which step of the qualified immunity analysis the district court should first undertake.it may begin its analysis by considering whether conditioning medical treatment for a progressive disease on participation in a prison program violates a clearly established right that an objectively reasonable person would have known about,or it may first address whether such a practice in fact violates the eighth amendment.
if the district court decides,or is eventually compelled,to consider the underlying constitutionality of wright conduct,we note there may well be genuine issues of material fact.the supreme court has interpreted the eighth amendment as guaranteeing a prisoner medical treatment for serious medical needs.estelle gamble,d.deliberate indifference by the government to such medical needs thus violates the constitution.see id.at.no party disputes that hilton medical needs were serious,but the two sides disagree about whether wright response to these needs or lack thereof rose to the level of deliberate indifference.to establish deliberate indifference,hilton must show that wright harbored the requisite mental state while he denied hilton treatment.he must show that wright knew of and disregarded an excessive risk to hilton safety that he not only was aware of facts from which a reasonable person would conclude hilton faced an excessive risk,but that he personally actually drew that inference.farmer brennan,d.this mental state is akin to subjective recklessness it need not be shown that wright intended for hilton to suffer harm,but wright actions in this regard must have been more than merely negligent.salahuddin goord,cir.relevant to this inquiry are questions of fact such as what did wright know about how long hilton treatment had been delayed and what did wright know about the likely medical consequences of such a delay 
hilton points to evidence in the record that might contradict the district court implicit holding that there were no genuine issues of material fact about how long hilton was denied treatment three months or how seriously hilton was injured as a result of such delay not seriously.these facts,while not necessarily material in and of themselves,may be material in the district court overall analysis because they bear on what wright knew about the health risks facing hilton.
first,it is not clear from the record that there is no genuine issue of fact about how long hilton was denied treatment by docs.hilton points to evidence that docs was aware that he had hcv when he was incarcerated in and.although docs did not rely on the program requirement as a justification for denying hilton treatment during this first period of incarceration,the fact if proved that hilton was denied treatment at that time may be relevant to the question of what wright knew about hilton conditions and medical history when he denied hilton treatment in the summer of.
second,and relatedly,hilton argues that there is evidence in the record indicating that a delay in treatment for hcv could be seriously harmful for a person like him whose infection was advanced and,for the most part,previously untreated.again,if hilton could establish that the delay in treatment caused him harm,this fact might bear on wright knowledge of the risks to which he was subjecting hilton.
finally,we note with respect to hilton experience during his first period of incarceration,it appears from hilton brief that he is now alleging that his eighth amendment rights were violated not only by the program requirement,but also by docs policy of denying hcv treatment to certain prisoners whose expected prison terms are less than fifteen months.hilton did not raise this issue in his complaint for he only learned for the first time through the defendants statement of material facts that the minimum was docs basis for denying treatment in and.at that point,hilton argued the claim to the district court as part of his opposition to the defendants motion for summary judgment.when the district court is briefed on an issue that can be understood as implicit in the larger challenge,the opposing party does not argue waiver,and the district court considers the issue,then that issue is not waived.see dickerson napolitano,cir.we have no indication from the district court decision whether it regarded the issue as waived,and we decline to make such a determination on appeal.on remand,the district court is instructed to consider whether hilton eighth amendment argument based on docs initial denial of treatment in and has been waived,and if it has not been waived,then to decide it.
ada and rehabilitation act claims against docs and wright 
hilton also challenges the district court dismissal of his claims against docs and wright in his official capacity under the ada and rehabilitation act defendants argue that the dismissal should be affirmed because hilton has failed to produce any evidence that wright or docs regarded him personally as being substantially limit
