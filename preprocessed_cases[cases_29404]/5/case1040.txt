we consider whether a plaintiff may be awarded attorneys fees against the united states under the equal access to justice act with respect to issues not reached by a district court in reversing a federal agency decision.
tom hardisty filed a claim for supplemental security income in,alleging disability from early based on several serious degenerative disk diseases,attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,and a mathematics learning disorder.the social security administration ssa denied his claim initially and on reconsideration.an administrative law judge alj then held a hearing on hardisty claim in.at that hearing,the alj heard testimony from hardisty,a lay witness,numerous physicians,a vocational expert,and others.in due course,the alj decided that hardisty was not entitled to benefits because,although he had a severe impairment,he retained the residual functional capacity to perform jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy.
after the ssa appeals council denied hardisty request for review,making the alj decision the final decision of the ssa commissioner,hardisty sought judicial review on numerous grounds.in,the district court reversed and remanded to the commissioner for the calculation of an award and benefits,ruling that substantial evidence did not support the alj credibility determination with respect to hardisty testimony.a month after judgment on the merits,hardisty filed a request for attorneys fees under the equal access to justice act,eaja,which was denied hardisty timely appealed denial of fees.
the alj based his decision on an adverse credibility finding against hardisty.that finding rested on three grounds.first,the alj reasoned that hardisty criminal history,involving numerous property crimes committed eighteen years ago in california,constituted a basis for questioning his credibility.second,the alj noted that a medical report from melanie vergara,one of hardisty physicians,was inconclusive regarding malingering.third,the alj found that hardisty intentionally sought to mislead the ssa when he testified that he had driven only halfway to the hearing,a statement contradicted by his own lay witness.even though hardisty later corrected his testimony,the alj decided that the record overall belied hardisty credibility.
in challenging the commissioner ruling,hardisty first argued that the government erred when it improperly rejected plaintiff testimony.he also raised several other arguments,including that the government improperly rejected lay witness testimony and vergara opinion,improperly evaluated residual functional capacity,posed an improper hypothetical to the vocational expert,and failed appropriately to question the vocational expert.
the district court ruled that the commissioner had not provided clear and convincing reasons for discrediting hardisty testimony as required by cotton bowen,cir per curiam.specifically,the court explicitly rejected each of the government three reasons for discrediting hardisty testimony.with respect to the first reason,hardisty criminal history,the court ruled hardisty crimes,which did not involve dishonesty and occurred more than eighteen years prior to the hearing,too remote to be a clear and convincing reason to discredit hardisty.the court relied on federal rule of evidence,which allows for the admission of evidence of crimes involving dishonesty but not evidence of crimes older than ten years without a further balancing of probative value and prejudicial effect.with respect to the second reason,evidence of malingering,the court ruled that the government failed to identify what evidence undermined the claimant complaints and failed to discredit the doctors who provided evidence corroborating hardisty account.with respect to the third reason,the inconsistency about driving,the court noted that hardisty had corrected his testimony on who drove to the hearing,thereby resolving the conflict.the court then,pursuant to varney secretary of health and human services,cir,remanded for the calculation and award of benefits.
in ruling on the subsequent eaja request,the court first addressed the issue on which hardisty claim had been remanded,concluding that the commissioner position was substantially justified and thus not a basis for eaja.d a.the court observed that the alj reliance on hardisty criminal history,though contrary to the federal rules of evidence,was not unlawful because such rules do not apply to administrative proceedings.see bayliss barnhart,cir.the court concluded,furthermore,that there was some basis for the alj finding of malingering because of vergara report and that the alj interpretation of the testimony regarding driving,while erroneous,had some basis in the record.thus,the court ruled,the commissioner position was substantially justified and was not appropriate.
the court next addressed hardisty argument that fees should be awarded for the government positions that hardisty challenged but that it did not address when it originally reviewed the case.those positions too,according to hardisty,were not substantially justified.the court,however,declined to award fees on these issues in the absence of the identification of any authority,including circuit precedent,requiring it to do so.
on appeal,hardisty first argues that fees should be awarded for those agency positions that hardisty challenged but that the district court did not decide.
as always in cases of statutory interpretation,we begin with the text of the statute.the text is particularly important in this case because the supreme court has refused to allow the award of attorneys fees without clear statutory authorization.alyeska serv.pipeline wilderness soc y,citing day woodworth,how.oelrichs spain,wall.flanders tweed,wall.stewart sonneborn,fleischmann distilling maier brewing,rich united states ex rel.industrial lumber,see ruckelshaus sierra club,given all the foregoing,we fail to find in the statute the requisite indication that congress meant to abandon historic principles ardestani,w e can not extend the eaja to administrative deportation proceedings when the plain language of the statute constrain s us to do otherwise.buckhannon bd.care home,west virginia of health human,in alyeska,we said that congress had not extended any roving authority to the judiciary to allow counsel fees as costs or otherwise whenever the courts might deem them warranted.internal citations omitted.that is in part because,in reviewing claims for attorneys fees,o ur basic point of reference is the american rule.ruckelshaus,u.at citing alyeska,at.that rule,which provides that the prevailing litigant is ordinarily not entitled to collect a reasonable attorneys fee from the loser,alyeska,at,has dominated the american court system since its beginning,see id.at remarking that the american rule is deeply rooted in our history.
the eaja creates an exception to the american rule.it authorizes federal courts to award attorneys fees,court costs,and other expenses when a party prevails against the united states,although is not mandatory.united states acres of land,cir.the statute provides that 
except as otherwise specifically provided by statute,a court shall award to a prevailing party other than the united states fees and other expenses,in addition to any costs awarded,incurred by that party in any civil action,including proceedings for judicial review of agency action,brought by or against the united states in any court having jurisdiction of that action,unless the court finds that the position of the united states was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.
