in the absence of an objection,the trial court could consider the signed copy of the lease.see pomona college superior court th,d general security th,fn,d lumbermens mut.cas.vaughn d.but even if the trial court had erred,the error would have been harmless because the lease provisions at issue are the same in both the signed copy and the unsigned copy attached to the complaint.it is undisputed that the trial court could properly consider the unsigned copy in determining whether to grant judgment on the pleadings.w hen a written instrument is attached to the pleading and properly incorporated therein by reference,the court may examine the exhibit and treat the pleader allegations of its legal effect as surplusage.citation.lumbermens mut.cas.vaughn,supra,d at.
