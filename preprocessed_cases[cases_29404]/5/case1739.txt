albert lee lee appeals from an order that granted respondents motion to compel lee to acknowledge the satisfaction of a prior order for attorney fees and costs code civ,and denied in part lee motion for other attorney fees and costs incurred in the proceeding the appeal reflects the complexities that can arise when a party who prevailed on an motion to strike exercises his right to seek attorney fees and costs in connection with the motion,successfully defends against the opposing parties appeals,and attempts to enforce the judgment against opponents who pay some of the amounts awarded but refuse to pay other amounts.we will reverse the order,but not entirely for the reasons lee asserts.

this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
lee contends the court erred in denying recovery for attorney fees he incurred in preparing an abstract of judgment and judgment liens denying a portion of his costs after judgment and granting lucky motion to certify the satisfaction of the august order regarding attorney fees and costs.the record and briefing on these issues suggest it would be helpful to begin our analysis with a brief overview of judgments,costs,interest,and the enforcement and satisfaction of judgments.
preliminary principles 
critical to understanding the interplay between judgments,costs,attorney fees,and interest,is the determination of what exactly constitutes the judgment.
a judgment is the final determination of the rights of the parties in an action or proceeding.there may be,in some circumstances,judgments for or against one or more of several plaintiffs or defendants in a single case,but there is always one judgment that determines the rights of any one particular party or parties lucky vis a vis another party on the other side of the pleadings lee.
in the matter before us,there is no document in the record entitled judgment.however,the order granting lee motion to strike states the for damages for malicious prosecution is hereby stricken and lee is hereby dismissed with prejudice.it is so ordered adjudged and decreed.a written order of dismissal signed by the court constitutes a judgment and is effective for all purposes.cohen hughes markets,th,fn.for purposes of this appeal,the judgment is the order dismissing lee from the case 
we also note that the order of dismissal does not specifically provide that lee shall recover attorney fees and costs.this recitation is unnecessary,however,since attorney fees and costs are awarded to the prevailing party on an motion to strike as a matter of law,pursuant to section,subdivision c.see also code civ.
amount of the judgment 
the principal amount of a judgment is the amount of any damages awarded,plus any costs including attorney fees to which the prevailing party may be entitled,less any amounts paid by the judgment debtor.postjudgment interest accrues on the principal amount of the judgment at the rate of ten percent per annum.how the costs are added to the judgment,and how interest is calculated,turns on the manner in which those costs were imposed or the purpose for which the costs were incurred.
prejudgment costs to prevailing party.as a general rule,the prevailing party may recover certain statutory costs incurred in the litigation up to and including entry of judgment.these costs may include attorney fees,if authorized by contract,statute such as the statute or law,subd.a.most costs are obtained by filing a cost memorandum,although attorney fees require a separate noticed motion,subd.c cal.rules of court,rule.where costs are established by the judgment,but the amount of the award is ascertained at a later time,the court clerk enters the costs on the judgment after the amount is determined.cal.rules of court,rule b bankes lucas th.in other words,the amount of the cost award is incorporated into the judgment.
interest at the rate of ten percent per annum accrues on the unpaid principal amount of the judgment,including the amount of the cost award and attorney fees award,as of the date of judgment entry,subd.a.therefore,interest ordinarily begins to accrue on the prejudgment cost and attorney fees portion of the judgment as of the same time it begins to accrue on all other monetary portions of the entry of judgment.see sternwest ash d,once attorney fee award is determined by the trial court,it is added to the judgment,and the total judgment bears statutory postjudgment interest until paid.
postjudgment enforcement costs.in addition to attorney fees and costs imposed as a result of prevailing in the action,postjudgment costs of enforcing the judgment may also be recovered.some costs,such as fees incurred in regard to abstracts of judgment or notice of judgment liens,may be claimed as a matter of right under section.other enforcement expenses incurred by a judgment creditor are recoverable if,upon noticed motion,the court determines they were reasonable and necessary costs of enforcing a judgment.see ketchum moses cal th,fn.attorney fees incurred in regard to previous award of fees under statute are recoverable under ketchum wanland law offices of mastagni,holstedt chiurazzi th,expenses of enforcing attorney fees award are recoverable under wanland.
when postjudgment enforcement costs are allowed,they become part of the principal amount of the judgment,subd.d,subd.a david karton,a law dougherty th,david karton.therefore,interest accrues upon those costs at the rate of ten percent per annum,subd.a.
appellate court order of costs on appeal.if an appeal is taken from the judgment,the party prevailing in the court of appeal is usually entitled to costs on appeal.cal.rules of court,rule.the award of costs is included in the remittitur,although the amount of the award is determined in the trial court.cal.rules of court,rule b,c.these costs,however,are not added to the trial court judgment,but constitute a separate judgment.los angeles unified school dist.wilshire center marketplace th,see cal.rules of court,rule b,c.interest thereon begins to run from the date of the entry of the trial court award.see dalzell kelly d,costs awarded on appeal by appellate court bear interest from the date of taxing costs or expiration of time for taxing.
trial court order of costs on appeal.a party may also obtain an award of costs,including attorney fees,if it has successfully defended on appeal the trial court grant of its motion to strike.wilkerson sullivan th,evans unkow th.it is not entirely clear whether such an award should be incorporated into the original judgment since it is imposed by statute rather than by the court of appeal,determined in the trial court,and intended to protect the defendant who succeeded in the trial court on the motion to strike or constitute an independent judgment since it pertains to costs incurred solely in the appellate court.see carpenter jack in the box th,award of attorney fees and costs under,subd.c,does not depend on court of appeal making any award los angeles unified school,supra,th at costs on appeal awarded pursuant to,at the discretion of the appellate court,did not affect the finality of the underlying judgment.although in this case lee obtained awards of attorney fees and costs for expenses incurred on appeal,we need not and do not decide this issue in order to resolve the appeal.
allocation of payments on judgment 
payment on a judgment is allocated first to accrued interest on the principal amount,and then to the principal.big bear properties,gherman d,big bear see.
satisfaction of judgment 
the amount required to satisfy a money is the total amount of the judgment,plus costs added after judgment including attorney fees,plus accrued interest on the judgment,less payments and any amounts no longer enforceable.alternatively,a money judgment will be deemed satisfied if there is an agreement by the parties that a tendered amount is sufficient,subd.a a money judgment may be satisfied by payment of the full amount required to satisfy the judgment or by acceptance by the judgment creditor of a lesser sum in full satisfaction of the judgment.
when a money judgment is satisfied in full,the judgment creditor must immediately file with the court an acknowledgement of the satisfaction of the judgment.if an abstract of judgment has been recorded,the judgment creditor must serve an acknowledgement on the debtor as well.the judgment debtor may serve a demand on the judgment creditor to comply with these requirements,and if the judgment creditor fails to do so within days of receipt of the demand,the judgment debtor may file a noticed motion with the court to require the judgment creditor compliance,subds.b,d.if the judgment creditor failed to comply with the demand without just cause,the judgment creditor is liable to the judgment debtor for damages and a statutory penalty of,subd.e.in addition,the court shall award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.
with this overview in mind,we turn to the issues raised in this appeal.
lee request for attorney fees incurred to enforce the november order 
lee motion of december,sought an order requiring lucky to pay lee for,among other things,the attorney fees lee incurred in preparing and filing an abstract of judgment and notices of judgment lien in november.the trial court denied lee request on the ground that lucky had fully paid the amounts due under the november order before lee brought his motion.the court erred.
background 
section entitles a judgment creditor to reasonable and necessary costs of enforcing a judgment.by the terms of the statute,attorney fees may be recovered under section to the extent otherwise authorized by law.attorney fees incurred to enforce payment of fees and costs awarded under section,subdivision c,are recoverable under section.ketchum,supra,cal th at fn.wanland,supra,th at see also globalist internet technologies,reda th,attorney fees incurred in enforcing judgment,or defending its validity against a challenge in another forum,recoverable under.
however,costs and attorney fees sought under section must be pursued by noticed motion within the time frame set forth by section,subdivision a,which provides in part the judgment creditor may claim costs authorized by section by noticed motion.the motion shall be made before the judgment is satisfied in full,but not later than two years after the costs have been incurred.italics added.
in the trial court,lucky argued that lee could not recover his attorney fees because the november order as opposed to the judgment in the case was fully paid pursuant to a commercial code section accord and satisfaction.although the trial court did not rely on the accord and satisfaction argument,it found that lucky had actually paid in full the november order an argument lucky now embraces before lee brought his december motion,and lee therefore could not recover his requested attorney fees 
taking the bait,lee contends in this appeal that the trial court erred because the november order was not paid in full.he argues lucky did not pay the costs set forth in the november cost bill those costs were incurred in enforcing the november order and the november order can not be deemed paid in full unless lucky also pays the costs incurred to enforce it.
the trial court erred,but our focus is not upon the reason lee asserts.rather,lee is entitled to recover for his attorney fees because,regardless of whether lucky had paid in full the amounts owing due to the november order,the judgment in the case had not been satisfied in full by the time of lee motion,subd.a.
a motion for attorney fees incurred in enforcing a judgment must be filed before the judgment is satisfied in full,subd.a.the judgment in this case is the order of dismissal.at the time the judgment was entered,the costs and fees to which lee was entitled as the prevailing party had not been ascertained,subd.c.when lucky did not timely file a motion to tax the in costs claimed in lee cost memorandum of july,those costs were incorporated as a matter of law into the judgment.cal.rules of court,rule b.on november,when the court awarded the in attorney fees and costs lee incurred in prevailing on the motion to strike pursuant to section,subdivision c,that amount was added to the judgment as well.see cal.rules of court,rule b,subd.a.when lucky did not timely file a motion to tax the in enforcement costs claimed in lee cost memorandum of november,those costs were also incorporated into the judgment,subd.d,subds.a,b.therefore,when lucky mailed a payment to lee on december,the principal amount of the judgment was,not including accrued interest that would also have to be paid in order to satisfy the judgment.lucky payment of had not satisfied the judgment.
on august,the court awarded lee for attorney fees and costs incurred in successfully defending against lucky appeal of the grant of the motion to strike.lucky paid.either the august order should be considered an independent judgment for costs incurred on appeal and thus has no bearing on whether lucky had satisfied the original judgment,or should be added to the original judgment.either way,lucky still had not paid the original judgment in full,despite his payment of 
therefore,by the time lee filed his motion in december,for reasonable code of civil procedure sections c,and attorneys fees and costs incurred up through the hearing of this motion,including the attorney fees incurred in filing the abstract of judgment and notice of judgment liens,lucky had not fully satisfied the judgment.recovery was not barred by the time limits of section.
the november order is not the judgment under section 
lucky contention that the november order constituted the judgment for purposes of defining the time by which lee motion had to be filed under section is incorrect.his arguments are,essentially,that lee pursued enforcement procedures after the november order was issued and for the amount it awarded,so lee was really enforcing the november order an order can sometimes be appealed or enforced as if it were a judgment and each cost or fee award a court issues must constitute a separate obligation.none of these points has merit here.
lucky argues that lee treated the november order as a separate obligation by filing a notice of lien and abstract of judgment only in the amount awarded by the november order,rather than for that amount plus costs.his theory appears to be that,since lee was only seeking to enforce the november order,he would have to file his motion for the fees incurred in that enforcement before the november order was satisfied,not before the judgment was satisfied.
the argument is meritless.in the first place,the trial court written order makes no factual finding that lee incurred the enforcement costs solely to enforce the november order,and there is little evidence to support such a finding.the cost bill pertaining to his enforcement of the november order was not filed until november,a day after he filed the abstract of judgment.the absence of any reference to this cost bill in the abstract of judgment therefore has no bearing on what lee was trying to enforce.nor does it bear on the amount that was required to satisfy the november order or,more importantly,the judgment.
the only cost bill lee had filed by the time he filed the abstract of judgment was the july cost bill,pertaining to prejudgment filing fees as the prevailing party on the motion to strike.lee omission of these costs from the abstract of judgment neither establishes that lee waived his right to recover the set forth in his unopposed july cost bill nor changes the amount actually due under the judgment as a matter of law.
moreover,to the extent it might be construed that lee was trying to use the abstract of judgment and judgment liens to enforce only the november order,rather than the entirety of the judgment,it does not change the language of section that precludes the award of attorney fees only if the judgment is satisfied in full,subd.a,italics added.in other words,even if there was substantial evidence that lee was trying to enforce only the amounts awarded in the november order as a factual matter,it does not follow as a legal matter of statutory construction that the motion to recoup his attorney fees had to be filed before satisfaction of the november order rather than before satisfaction of the judgment.
while california enforcement of judgments law ejl provides that the word judgment means a judgment,order or decree entered in a court of this state,litigants do not have license to substitute the word order everywhere the word judgment appears in the ejl,regardless of the circumstances or statutory intent.the ostensible purpose of the broad definition of judgment in section is to permit an order awarding fees to be enforced under the ejl where there is no judgment.see,newland superior court th,prejudgment orders for monetary sanctions enforceable under ejl jones otero d,same.indeed,the law revision commission comment to section explains section is new and it continues the effect of former section order enforceable as judgment.italics added.in the matter before us,by contrast,there is a judgment in the case,which permits lee to enforce the amounts lucky owes him.
furthermore,the statutory purpose of requiring that the motion for enforcement costs be brought before the judgment is satisfied in full,subd.a is to avoid a situation where a judgment debtor has paid off the entirety of what he believes to be his obligation in the entire case,only to be confronted later with a motion for yet more fees.see carnes zamani cir,motion for attorney fees barred by where motion was filed after a full satisfaction of judgment had been filed.certainly that concern does not arise here,where lucky had undisputedly refused to pay amounts owing under cost bills and,by at least those amounts,owed more under the judgment.
lucky remaining arguments also fail to establish that lee was required to file his motion before the november order was satisfied.lucky points out that awards of fees and costs are separately appealable.however,the fact that a award of fees and costs may be appealed as a order,subd.a does not make it a judgment,let alone the judgment to be satisfied in full within the meaning of section.
lucky further argues that each of the awards of costs or fees stands on its own and creates a separate obligation that may be separately enforced and paid.lucky offers no legal authority for this position,and we find it unpersuasive.first,it is contrary to the rules of court and statutes of this state,which provide that awards for costs and fees incurred up to and including judgment are incorporated into the judgment cal.rules of court,rule b,and awards of costs and fees incurred to enforce or defend the judgment are incorporated into the judgment,subds.a,b.second,the rule lucky suggests would be problematic.a judgment creditor may have to file a number of separate cost bills and motions for fees,because the rights to such costs and fees arise at different times in the course of proceedings,and those rights would be waived if recovery were not timely sought.if,as here,the judgment debtor refuses to pay,the judgment creditor would have to issue numerous abstracts of judgment and writs of execution,which would increase the cost and burden of recovering the amounts to which the judgment creditor was entitled.third,even if lucky were right that each cost and fee award were to be enforced separately,it still would not necessarily follow that a motion to enforce any of those costs would have to be filed before the award were satisfied,as opposed to before the judgment is satisfied in full,subd.a,italics added.
lucky also contends that it had a right under civil code section to select which debt to satisfy by its payment,and it paid to satisfy the amount awarded under the november order,plus accrued interest.we discuss lucky reliance on civil code section post.for now,suffice it to say that any right lucky had to target his payment to the november order does not change the fact that lucky had not fully satisfied the judgment by the time lee filed his motion to recover his enforcement costs.
because the judgment was not fully satisfied by the time lee brought his motion for attorney fees incurred in connection with the abstract of judgment and lien notices,the trial court erred in denying recovery for those fees on that ground 
lee memorandum of costs 
in november,lee filed and served a cost memorandum to recover costs under section.in part,lee sought for recording a judgment lien and an abstract of judgment.the balance of the cost bill was for the cost filing notice of lien.lee did not object to the cost memorandum within the period permitted by section.
in opposition to lee december motion,however,lucky argued that the constituted lee first appearance fee in case number a case in which lucky was entitled to certain sums,and payment of that fee was unnecessary and not compensable under section.
in response,lee explained that in order to perfect a judgment lien over the proceeds that lucky claims in case number,lee was required to pay the filing fee so that the clerk would accept his notice of lien.
the trial court ruled the first appearance fee claimed by lee is,indeed,not covered by code of civil procedure lee may indeed be entitled to collect funds by assertion of his claim in case.there are no authorities on point that either party has called to the court attention.the request is unreasonable.lee contends,however,woo had only days under code of civil procedure c and d to file a motion to tax costs and did not do so hence,the objection is time barred.there is no showing as to how this limit was determined,and the court is troubled by lee haste in incurring such a first appearance charge without so much as giving woo a day opportunity after notice to pay the award.
the trial court erred.subdivision c of section reads within days after the memorandum of costs is served on the judgment debtor,the judgment debtor may apply to the court on noticed motion to have the costs taxed by the court the court shall make an order allowing or disallowing the costs to the extent justified under the circumstances of the case.subdivision d of section provides if no motion to tax costs is made within the time provided in subdivision c,the costs claimed in the memorandum are allowed.italics added see david karton,supra,th at.there are no exceptions to this rule,and the language of subdivision d is mandatory.
lucky defends the action of the trial court by referring us to sanai saltz th.there,the court considered the argument that a trial court lost jurisdiction to strike a cost memorandum filed under section where no motion to tax was filed within the period,and the costs could be challenged only by a motion for a new trial or for relief from the judgment.the court responded that,w hatever merit this analysis may have as an abstract proposition,the judgment in sanai had not even been entered by the time the motion to tax would have been due,and the cost memorandum sought items wholly outside the scope of section and section.sanai,at,fn.the appellate court ruled that the trial court could properly grant the motion to strike the memorandum of costs.id.at.
sanai is distinguishable from the matter at hand.here,the judgment had been entered before lee filed the memorandum of costs.whether or not the item was proper under section,it was within the scope of potentially recoverable enforcement costs under section.moreover,in sanai,the party opposing the costs had filed a motion to strike.here,lucky never filed any motion of any kind to strike,tax,or otherwise challenge the cost item.his arguments regarding the item arose only after lee had mentioned the november cost bill in explaining the amounts lucky had failed to pay as of the time of lee december motion lee had not put the propriety of the cost bill at issue in his motion,and lucky filed no motion to place the issue before the court either.
lucky section motion for satisfaction of the august order 
under section,subdivision d,a judgment debtor may apply to the court by noticed motion for an order requiring the judgment creditor to comply with a demand to file and deliver an acknowledgement of satisfaction of judgment.the judgment creditor will be liable to the judgment debtor for damages and forfeit to the judgment debtor if the judgment creditor failed to comply with the judgment debtor demand without just cause,subd.e.in addition,the court shall award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.
lucky sought an order under this section in regard to the august order,requesting as well the fine,attorney fees,and costs.the court granted lucky motion,ordered that lee issue a satisfaction of judgment,imposed the fine,and awarded lucky for attorney fees and costs.lee argues that the court erred,because lucky failed to demonstrate that the august order was satisfied.
application of section to the august order 
in its motion to compel certification that a judgment was satisfied,lucky directed its motion to the august order only the judgment satisfied by payment tendered the next day is the court august,award of in fees and costs.
we question whether section could be used to obtain certification that the august order,by itself,was satisfied.the august order was not the judgment in the case,but a order issued by the trial court under section,subdivision c,for lee costs and attorney fees incurred on appeal.however,because the parties do not dispute in this appeal the application of section to the august order,we will assume,for purposes of this appeal,that the august order may be the subject of a motion under section.
satisfaction of the august order 
as mentioned,a money judgment is satisfied if it is either paid in full or there is,for example,an accord and satisfaction,subd.a.in the trial court,lucky argued that the august order was the subject of an accord and satisfaction 
to obtain an accord and satisfaction under commercial code section,a debtor must prove that the debtor in good faith tendered an instrument to the claimant as full satisfaction of the claim,the amount of the claim was unliquidated or subject to a bona fide dispute,and the claimant obtained payment of the instrument,subd.a.if the debtor further proves that he accompanied the tender with a conspicuous statement that the amount was tendered as full satisfaction of the claim,and if the claimant does not prove that he tendered repayment of the amount within days,the debt is discharged,subds.b,c.
the trial court concluded that lee entered into an accord and satisfaction in regard to the august order because lee kept lucky payment notwithstanding lucky condition that retention of the funds would constitute a satisfaction of the debt.the court did not make a finding as to whether lucky tender of the funds was a good faith attempt to resolve a bona fide dispute over the amount due,but for purposes of review we will assume that the findings are implicit in the court ruling.
lee argues that lucky failed to prove that his attempt at an accord and satisfaction was made in good faith,and the amount of the claim was unliquidated or subject to a bona fide dispute.we review for substantial evidence.see woolridge electric th supp.
good faith 
lucky did not argue explicitly in the trial court that its attempt at an accord and satisfaction was made in good faith.nor did lee object to lucky motion on this ground.in response to lee arguments in his opening brief on appeal,lucky asserts that it acted in good faith,urging that it made the tender due to its concern that lee would file an abstract of judgment and lee was disputing the amount that was owed.lucky does not support these assertions with any citation to the record,and we find nothing in the record to support them.
nonetheless,a trial court might be able to infer the good faith of a debtor tender from the nature of the debtor attempt to resolve some dispute the parties had over the amount that was due.we therefore turn to that issue.
amount unliquidated or subject to bona fide dispute 
lucky had to prove that the amount of the debt represented by the august order was unliquidated or subject to a bona fide dispute.lucky does not contend that the amount was unliquidated,so we consider whether there was a bona fide dispute.
we find no substantial evidence to support the conclusion that lucky tendered the in order to resolve a bona fide dispute over the amount owing under the august order.there is no direct evidence that the parties disputed what lucky owed in regard to the august order when lucky tendered the cashier check,or even that they discussed the issue until after lucky tendered the money.
