on august,unum life insurance company of america denied paul hofer claim for disability benefits.he submitted a second claim on september,which was denied on december of that year.on january,hofer filed this diversity suit in the united states district court for the district of kansas.see granting diversity jurisdiction.six months later unum reversed course and agreed to pay benefits and refund premiums covering january,through october.it also paid benefits due from october,to october,but in making these latter payments,it initially reserved d the right to enforce any and all provisions of the policy and to seek to recoup the payments if it deems that is warranted.vol.ii at.that reservation was withdrawn in february,shortly after hofer underwent further medical tests.the parties eventually stipulated that since march,hofer had been sufficiently disabled to be entitled to partial benefits under the policy,but that any claims that accrued before january,were barred by the statute of limitations.in an admirable display of their attorneys professionalism,the parties submitted their remaining disputes to the district court upon stipulated facts.
by order dated january,the district court held that unum did not breach its contract with hofer when it denied benefits in unum breached its contract when it denied benefits on december,and hofer was therefore entitled to certain prejudgment interest,but only from that date forward in calculating hofer benefits,unum had properly interpreted the unambiguous definition of the term prior net income in the insurance policy and hofer was not entitled to certain automatic benefit increases for which he had paid additional premiums after the onset of his disability.in addition,the district court awarded hofer approximately half the attorney fees he requested.hofer appeals each of these rulings.we have jurisdiction under and affirm.
denial of benefits in 
the district court rejected hofer claim that he was improperly denied benefits when he first submitted a claim in.in essence,the court ruled that hofer had not proved that he had submitted sufficient information to unum to establish his claim at that time.the court decision rested on the parties stipulated facts.when the district court makes nondiscretionary legal determinations based on stipulated facts,our review is de novo.fdic kansas bankers sur,cir.
the following facts are among those stipulated on march,hofer,a dentist,went to see lynn ketchum about pain he was experiencing in his forearms and hands.ketchum made an initial diagnosis of bilateral flexor tenosynovitis,carpal tunnel syndrome,and overuse syndrome,or cumulative trauma disorder.following ketchum advice,hofer decreased his work schedule by.he had several visits,and was referred to specialists for additional diagnosis and treatments.by august,when hofer visited ketchum for a fourth time,he was working about three days a week and his condition was slowly improving.
hofer was insured under a policy and a policy from unum.on june,he submitted a claim for benefits under the policy.he also submitted a claim under the overhead policy,but that claim is no longer at issue,except with respect to prejudgment interest.residual disability is defined in the policy as a disability that restrict s the insured ability to perform the material and substantial duties of his occupation for as long a time as the insured customarily performed them before the injury or sickness or as effectively as the insured customarily performed them before the injury or sickness.vol.i at.
the policy contains the following provision governing submission of a claim 
to make a claim under this policy,the following steps must be taken 
give notice of claim someone must notify unum that disability has started as defined in this policy 
file proof of loss the insured,or someone acting on the insured behalf,and the insured attending physician must complete and return the claim form provided by us 
promptly complete and return any other forms unum requires and 
the insured undergoes a medical examination by a specialist appropriate for the condition or a personal interview as often as unum reasonably requests while the claim is pending.unum reserves the right to select the examiner.unum will pay for the examination.
we unum will evaluate the claim and either 
pay the benefits specified in the policy or 
notify the insured and any loss payee that benefits are not payable and why.if unum needs more information,unum will tell the insured and any loss payee what unum needs.
id.at.the policy also provides that unum will not pay any benefit until we have sufficient proof of loss.id.at.
to support hofer claims,ketchum submitted to unum an attending physician statement,along with certain medical records.id.at.the record in this case,however,does not reveal what information these documents contained.on august,nancy ball,an agent of unum,contacted ketchum to discuss hofer claims.
hofer claim was denied on august,in a letter from unum which states 
thank you for your kind patience and cooperation while we have been administering your claim for disability income benefits.based on a thorough review of the information contained in your file and the applicable terms of your policy,disability benefits have been denied.
the policies state 
residual disability and residually disabled mean 
injury or sickness does not prevent you from engaging in your regular occupation,but does restrict your ability to perform the material and substantial duties of your regular occupation 
for as long a time as you customarily performed them before the injury or sickness or 
as effectively as you customarily performed them before the injury or sickness and 
you are receiving medical care from someone other than yourself which is appropriate for the injury or sickness 
as you are aware,unum had requested and reviewed medical documentation pertaining to your illness.based on a review of this documentation,questions arose as to the extent of impairment you were claiming.as a result,our medical director,nancy ball,spoke directly with your attending physician,lyn sic ketchum,on august.
according to unum review and based on the lack of objective medical documentation,it is unum determination your condition does not preclude you from performing the material and substantial duties of your occupation.additionally,our medical director spoke with your attending physician,ketchum,regarding your claim and concurs with unum conclusion.therefore,no benefits are payable under the terms of your policies.
unum and ketchum discussed the possibility that electrodiagnostic testing a thorough consultation through the institute for the rehabilitation of disabled dentists may assist you in gaining clarification of your current condition given the lack of objective data at this point to substantiate your claim.
hofer,please understand that our decision has been based on a complete evaluation of the file as it has developed in your claim.should there be any additional information which we are not aware of which you feel may have affected our decision,or if you have any questions regarding this decision,please call me at this phone number.

id.at ellipsis in original.
hofer argues that this stipulated evidence establishes unum breach.he contends that unum had all the information it needed to determine that he was disabled.we are not persuaded.although unum no longer disputes that hofer has in fact been eligible for benefits since march,nothing in the record shows exactly what information unum had when it denied hofer claim.as stated by the district court it is immaterial whether hofer was restricted in his activities if hofer did not provide this information to unum,then unum could not be in breach when it denied hofer claim.id.vol.ii at.to be sure,there is evidence that ketchum had told hofer to reduce his work hours and that hofer had done so.but there is no evidence that this information was ever communicated to unum.indeed,a memorandum in unum file memorializing the conversation between ketchum and unum medical director states that ketchum said only that hofer should not work more than hours per week,and that nothing ketchum said support s loss of work capacity.id.vol.i at.the record does not indicate how many hours hofer worked each week before developing his disability.
hofer points out that the parties stipulated that ketchum submitted an attending physician statement to unum before it denied his claim.but the parties did not stipulate to the contents of the statement,nor was a copy provided to the district court.the parties also stipulated that certain medical records were sent to unum before the claims were denied.id.at.but,again,the record does not show what information these medical records contained.we agree with the district court that t here simply is no evidence in the record from which the court can conclude that unum knew in that ketchum had told hofer to reduce his working hours.id.vol.ii at.
hofer raises three other challenges to unum denial of benefits.first,he claims that unum denial letter applied the wrong standard for residual disability.he points to the fourth paragraph of the letter,which states that your condition does not preclude you from performing the material and substantial duties of your occupation,id.vol.i at,whereas the disability policy states that the standard for residual disability benefits is whether the condition restricts the ability to perform the material and substantial duties of the person occupation for as long a time as the insured customarily performed them before the injury or sickness or as effectively as the insured customarily performed them before the injury or sickness,id.at.but the second paragraph of the letter quotes the standard in full.the language relied upon by hofer,which appears two paragraphs later,is apparently shorthand for the complete standard.in any event,as the district court observed,even if unum applied the wrong standard,that does not alter the fact that hofer has not shown that unum possessed information from which it could conclude that he was residually disabled.id.vol.ii at.
second,hofer argues that if unum did not have enough information to make its determination,it had a duty to request more information.the policy states that once the claimant has properly submitted a claim,unum will either pay the benefits or notify the insured and any loss payee that benefits are not payable and why.if unum needs more information,unum will tell the insured and any loss payee what unum needs.id.vol.i at.this provision would prohibit unum from denying or delaying payment based on the absence of information that it knows the insured could provide if requested.it makes no sense,however,to read this obligation namely,to request more information if unum needs it as requiring unum to request more information when the information before it is definitive and it has no reason to know that contrary information exists.all unum could do in these circumstances was inform hofer that it was open to receiving contrary information.and that is what it did.the denial letter invited hofer to send any information which we are not aware of which you feel may have affected our decision,and also invited hofer to appeal the decision to unum quality review section.id.at.we therefore agree with the district court that unum did not violate the more information provision when it denied hofer claims in.
finally,hofer argues that once unum had rejected his claim,providing further proof would have been a useless act.see rosenbloom new york life ins,cir a party is not required to do a useless,futile act w here failure of a party to perform a condition is induced by a manifestation to him by the other party that he will not substantially perform his own promise,performance of such condition is waived,and,therefore,excused.if we had concluded that unum was in breach when it denied benefits,this argument might have merit.but unum denied benefits because hofer had not fulfilled a condition precedent under the,providing sufficient proof that he was disabled.unum in no way indicated that it would deny benefits regardless of the evidence of disability.on the contrary,it expressly invited hofer to provide further proof of his claimed disability.but hofer delayed.according to the stipulated facts,no additional documents were sent after the denial until hofer submitted his second claim on september.in short,unum did not breach its contract with hofer when it denied his claim in.
ii.prejudgment interest 
the district court agreed with hofer that unum breached its insurance contracts with hofer when it rejected his second claim on december,because unum at that time had adequate information to determine that he was disabled for all months preceding october.vol.ii at.it awarded prejudgment interest from december,until hofer was paid on benefits and premium refunds owed by unum.hofer contends that interest should have accrued from the date he paid the premium or the date he was eligible for the benefit.
prejudgment interest in a diversity action is a substantive matter governed by state law.webco,thermatool,cir.prejudgment interest in kansas is governed by.miller botwin.that statute provides 
creditors shall be allowed to receive interest at the rate of ten percent per annum,when no other rate of interest is agreed upon,for any money after it becomes due for money lent or money due on settlement of account,from the day of liquidating the account and ascertaining the balance for money received for the use of another and retained without the owner knowledge of the receipt for money due and withheld by an unreasonable and vexatious delay of payment or settlement of accounts for all other money due and to become due for the forbearance of payment whereof an express promise to pay interest has been made and for money due from corporations and individuals to their daily or monthly employees,from and after the end of each month,unless paid within fifteen days thereafter.
before assessing the district court application of the statute,we must determine our standard of review.there is authority that federal,rather than state,law governs the standard of appellate review.see felder united states,cir in general,the standard of appellate review is a procedural matter in which the forum will utilize its own standards even when it is applying the substantive law of another jurisdiction.but in this case we need not decide which law governs because both kansas and federal law provide an standard.see united phosphorus,midland fumigant,cir we review a decision to grant or deny prejudgment interest for an abuse of discretion.blair constr.mcbeth,allowance of prejudgment interest is a matter of judicial discretion subject to reversal only upon a showing of abuse of discretion.
a more challenging question is whether review must be modified when,as here,the parties have stipulated to the underlying facts.hofer contends that in this circumstance we should review de novo.we believe otherwise.de novo review is appropriate when deciding definitive legal issues.it is inappropriate when there is need for give in the joints.even when stipulated historical facts resolve the underlying liability,awarding prejudgment interest requires weighing too many inexact factors for us to establish firm rules for decision.we are unable to construct an algorithm that spits out the legally required result,or,to be more precise,we are confident that any algorithm we constructed would provide unsatisfactory results far too often.although in a specific case the correct decision may be clear,by and large the decision involves multifarious,fleeting,special,narrow facts that utterly resist generalization.pierce underwood,d quoting maurice rosenberg,judicial discretion of the trial court,viewed from above,syracuse.familiar with the issues and litigants,the district court is better situated than the court of appeals to marshal the pertinent facts and apply the legal standard cooter gell hartmarx,d mandating review of ruling under.moreover,a decision regarding how much,if any,prejudgment interest to award grows out of,and is bounded by,detailed factual circumstances,which limit the value of appellate court precedent.buford united states,d mandating review of issue arising under united states sentencing guidelines.accordingly,in our view,a proper division of responsibility between the district and appellate courts counsels application of an standard of review even when the historical facts are undisputed.
in kansas,prejudgment interest is allowed on liquidated claims.a claim becomes liquidated when both the amount due and the date on which it is due are fixed and certain,or when the same become definitely ascertainable by mathematical computation.green constr.kansas power light,cir quoting plains,gable.we defer to the district court determination that the benefits and premium refunds owed to hofer were not due until december,the date by which unum had sufficient information and a reasonable time to determine that hofer was disabled.to be sure,unum has conceded that hofer was disabled well before that date.but unum had no duty to pay benefits or refund premiums until hofer had submitted a valid claim providing unum with sufficient proof of loss.
hofer argument to the contrary appears to rely on his contention that unum was in breach of contract when it denied his claims and that submitting further information to support those claims would have been a useless act.but we have rejected those contentions.the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding prejudgment interest only from december,forward.
iii.definition of prior net income 
under the unum disability policy,the amount of the benefit is derived from the insured prior net income.vol.i at.hofer argues that unum and the district court misinterpreted the term.he contends that the policy definition of prior net income is ambiguous and should be interpreted against unum.although hofer is correct that under kansas law any ambiguity in the agreement is to be construed against the drafter,time warner entm t everest midwest licensee,cir,we agree with the district court that the language is not ambiguous.
whether a contract provisions are ambiguous is a matter of law to be determined by the court,flight concepts.boeing,cir,and therefore is reviewed de novo,see time warner,at.the test to determine whether an insurance contract is ambiguous is not what the insurer intends the language to mean,but what a reasonably prudent insured would understand the language to mean.colfax johnson.in determining whether ambiguity exists,the language of the contract is to receive a fair,reasonable,and practical construction.marquis state farm fire cas.
the unum policy provides for benefits according to the following formula 
loss of net income prior net income x maximum disability benefit 
vol.i at.the denominator prior net income is defined as 
the largest of your average monthly net income for the last months before the elimination period began,the months before the disability began your average monthly net income for the period immediately before those months or the highest average monthly net income for any two consecutive years of the last years before the elimination period began.on each anniversary of the first day of a period of disability,we will calculate a factor.we will multiply the prior net income by that factor.then we will use that amount to calculate the residual disability benefit or the recovery benefit.
id.the first sentence of this definition sets prior net income for the first disability period as the largest of three calculated amounts,each of which is an approximation of what the insured was making before becoming disabled.the remainder of the definition provides that this figure will be indexed for inflation for each successive year of disability.the policy defines the numerator loss of net income as your indexed prior net income minus the net income you earned for the month to which the payment relates.id.
roughly speaking,the formula provides that the insured will receive a percentage of the maximum disability benefit equal to the percentage of income lost as a result of disability.if the insured disability reduces his income by,say,then the benefit due is of the maximum benefit permitted.if in subsequent years the insured suffers a greater lesser loss of income,then the benefit will be a higher lower percentage of the maximum benefit.the inflation adjustment is necessary to avoid unfairness to the insured.without the adjustment,the loss of net income in a later year would be the prior net income approximately the amount earned before disability minus the amount earned in the later year.if the rate of inflation were high enough,a disabled insured who has had to reduce his work by might still earn as much as when he was not disabled,so the loss of net income would be,and he would receive no disability benefit under the policy.with the inflation adjustment,however,a disabled insured who continues from year to year having to reduce his work load by the same amount say,will continue to receive the same benefit even though his income increases at the same rate as inflation.
hofer,however,would construe the policy definitions differently.in his view,the numerator loss of net income is indexed for inflation but the denominator prior net income is not.he focuses on the fact that the policy defines loss of net income as your indexed prior net income minus the net income you earned for the month to which the payment relates.id.at,emphasis added.he points out that if prior net income,the numerator of the fraction,already incorporates indexing in its definition,then the word indexed in the definition of loss of net income is superfluous.he concludes,the definition of the numerator,loss of net income specifically refers to indexing,while the denominator,prior net income fails to use the same term.this reasonably implies the former is indexed,while the latter term is not.aplt.br.at.at the least,according to his argument,the use of the word indexed in the definition of loss of net income creates an ambiguity,which should be resolved against unum.
we disagree.the use of the word indexed in the definition of loss of net income is clearly just to emphasize that the factor referred to in the definition of prior net income and which,according to that definition,is to be use d to calculate the residual disability benefit.vol.i at applies also when using prior net income to calculate loss of net income.an alternative reading of contract language does not create a legal ambiguity unless that reading is reasonable,marquis,at,and hofer reading is not reasonable.under his interpretation of the formula,a period of inflation would cause the benefit to depart from its intended purpose of reflecting the extent of the insured disability indeed,the loss of net income could,after several years of inflation,exceed the unindexed prior net income,so that the numerator of the fraction exceeds the denominator and the benefit exceeds what the insured would be entitled to for total disability.this is a strained reading of the policy language and it creates a nonsensical result.the district court was undoubtedly correct in rejecting hofer contention and finding no ambiguity in the definitions the only reasonable interpretation of the language is that during the first year,prior net income is not indexed,but during subsequent years,prior net income is indexed in order to take inflation into account in both the numerator and the denominator of the residual disability benefit equation.vol.ii at.
iv.increase in maximum disability benefit 
hofer policy states 
on each annual review date until the policy anniversary when your age is,you will automatically have the opportunity to increase the maximum disability benefit by the indexed amount provided that you are not then disabled and you have not refused the opportunity to increase your coverage in two consecutive years 
when the opportunity is made available,you may increase the maxi
