charles kinney appeals from a award for attorney fees and costs michele clark incurred in a prior appeal while attempting to enforce an earlier award for attorney fees and costs against kinney.kinney has been challenging clark entitlement to fees and costs in this action since,when the trial court first awarded clark attorney fees and costs under a residential purchase agreement to which she and kinney were parties and under which kinney brought this unsuccessful against clark.this appeal,like the numerous appeals before,lacks merit.we grant clark motion to dismiss the appeal because it is frivolous.
the los angeles superior court,this court,and the united states district court for the central district of california all have declared kinney to be a vexatious litigant.under a prefiling order issued in,kinney,while,may not file new litigation including any appeal or writ in a california state court without first obtaining leave of the presiding judge.undeterred,kinney has retained a series of attorneys to represent him in his continued and unconscionable campaign in the courts against clark.the prefiling order covering kinney in propria persona litigation has been ineffective in constraining his vexatious litigation.accordingly,on clark motion,we impose an expanded prefiling order,requiring kinney to obtain leave of the presiding judge before filing new litigation including any appeal or writ against clark or her attorney in a court of this state,even when he is represented by counsel.this prefiling order is necessary to protect clark,her attorneys,and our courts from kinney abuse of the judicial process.
on the court own motion,we impose monetary sanctions on kinney for filing a frivolous appeal.

in july,clark declared bankruptcy.the expense of defending against kinney claims was a substantial factor leading to clark bankruptcy.kempton clark,supra.in march,the bankruptcy court ordered clark to appear in state court and defend the related action.on clark motion,the superior court in the related action declared kempton to be a vexatious litigant because she was merely acting as kinney proxy and he was using her as his puppet.id.at.after kempton failed to post a bond as ordered,the superior court dismissed the related action.kinney sought relief from this ruling on behalf of kempton in the bankruptcy court,federal district court,and the ninth circuit court of appeals.id.at.he was unsuccessful in each venue.
after the superior court dismissed the related action,clark moved for attorney fees against kinney and kempton under the agreement.kinney opposed the motion,arguing clark lacked standing to claim attorney fees and costs due to her bankruptcy.kempton clark,supra.on october,after clark was discharged from bankruptcy,the united states bankruptcy court for the central district of california issued an order stating in pertinent part,all of clark right to recovery of attorneys fees and costs from kempton and kinney arising from litigation concerning the fernwood property are deemed to have been abandoned by the trustee.the order further explained kempton and kinney are not creditors of this estate.they have twice sued clark in state court,and lost both times.kempton and kinney also lost several related appeals.as,kempton and kinney have no interest in the administration of this estate.therefore,the court finds that kempton and kinney do not have standing to object to the motion to compel abandonment of property.the bankruptcy court stated that the amount of fees,if any,recoverable under the agreement and california law will be adjudicated in the state court.back in state court,clark prevailed on her motion for attorney fees in the related action and successfully defended kinney and kempton appeal from the order awarding fees.kempton clark,supra.
clark enforcement of the fee award and additional claims for attorney fees against kinney 
in,clark began her efforts to enforce the december,award of attorney fees and costs in the present action.kinney attempted to thwart those efforts by serving a claim of exemption,asserting the funds clark was seeking belonged to his mother trust estate,although the funds were in an account that did not bear the name of the trust or estate.clark filed a motion to determine the claim of exemption.the trial court denied kinney claim and allowed a levy upon funds to pay the award.instead of filing the appeal in his own name and seeking leave of court to proceed under the prefiling order,kinney filed a notice of appeal from that order as attorney for his mother trust and estate.we dismissed the appeal based on lack of standing because the trust and estate were not parties to the action in the trial court and did not seek to intervene in the action or vacate the order in the trial court.kinney clark,nonpub.opn.
on march,the trial court awarded clark additional fees for work her attorneys performed in attempting to enforce the december,fee award.kinney had opposed clark motion for fees on his own behalf,and on behalf of judith kempton representative of the estate of kimberly kempton and his mother estate.kempton cooper june,nonpub.opn.attorneys filed a notice of appeal on behalf of kinney,judith kempton and kinney mother estate.we dismissed the appeal as to judith kempton and kinney mother estate based on lack of standing.id.at.we affirmed the march,fee award as to kinney,rejecting his argument among others that pending state and federal appeals automatically stayed the action and precluded the trial court from entering a new fee award under the agreement.id.at.
also in,clark began her efforts to enforce a july,award of attorney fees and costs the trial court granted for work clark attorneys performed in successfully defending kinney and kempton appeal from the december,fee award.neither kinney nor clark appealed from the july,award.kinney again filed a claim of exemption,contending clark enforcement of the july,award was stayed by his pending appeals in the state court including case no,the appeal from the denial of his first claim of exemption,discussed above and federal court arising out of the bankruptcy proceedings.clark filed a motion to determine the claim of exemption.kinney filed a written opposition,representing himself,the estate of kimberly kempton,and his mother trust and estate.the trial court denied the claim of exemption and allowed a levy upon funds to pay the award.kinney,the estate of kimberly kempton,and kinney mother trust and estate appealed.an attorney represented kinney and the other appellants.we dismissed the appeal for lack of standing as to the estate of kimberly kempton and kinney mother trust and estate because these parties could not show they were aggrieved by the order,as the levy was upon kinney property.we dismissed the appeal as to kinney,concluding it lacked merit because the state and federal appeals,which were not related to the july,fee award,did not stay clark efforts to enforce that award.kinney clark,nonpub.opn.

discussion 
motion to dismiss this appeal 
the agreement between kinney and clark states that the prevailing party in i n any action,proceeding,or arbitration between the parties arising out of the agreement is entitled to an award of reasonable attorney fees and costs from the party.the present action arises out of the agreement.clark prevailed on appeal in this action in appellate case number,the appeal from the denial of kinney first claim of exemption.she sought an award of attorney fees and costs for the work her attorneys performed in successfully defending the appeal,as part of her efforts to enforce the december,award of attorney fees and costs.on may,the trial court awarded clark an additional in attorney fees and costs.kinney does not dispute that clark attorneys performed the legal services.nor does he challenge the reasonableness of the amount of the award.
instead,kinney challenges clark entitlement to attorney fees and costs under the agreement,asserting recycled arguments that state and federal courts already have rejected.he attempts to attack prior final orders as a basis for defeating the order before us.in his appellate reply brief in this matter,he states,it does matter how many times kinney loses,void orders are never final.but,despite many years of attempting to invalidate the underlying judgment and each and every award of attorney fees and costs the trial court has issued in this action,kinney has yet to prevail or demonstrate that any order is void in these collateral attacks.
clark moves this court to dismiss the appeal,arguing it is frivolous.an appeal is frivolous when it is prosecuted for an improper motive to harass the respondent or delay the effect of an adverse judgment or when it indisputably has no merit when any reasonable attorney would agree that the appeal is totally and completely without merit.in re marriage of flaherty cal d.we agree with clark that the appeal is frivolous and grant her motion.the contentions kinney raises on appeal in opposition to clark entitlement to attorney fees and costs lack merit and are asserted in furtherance of his campaign of harassment of clark.
clark bankruptcy did not eliminate her entitlement to attorney fees and costs under the agreement 
in his opening appellate brief,kinney repeats his claims that all orders awarding clark attorney fees and costs that the trial court issued after clark declared bankruptcy in july violate bankruptcy law and are void,and no state court has any jurisdiction over these federal law issues.
california state courts have jurisdiction over clark claims for attorney fees and costs under the agreement.the trial court made the first award of attorney fees and costs to clark the december,award before clark declared bankruptcy.clark did not attempt to enforce that award in the state courts until after the bankruptcy court discharged her and ordered that she could pursue additional claims for attorney fees and costs against kinney in state court.thus,the trial court orders relating to clark enforcement of the december,award and awarding her additional attorney fees and costs did not violate the automatic stay arising from her bankruptcy petition.
kinney asserts the trial court could not award clark additional attorney fees and costs under the agreement after her discharge from bankruptcy because she did not reaffirm the agreement in the bankruptcy court and therefore the agreement was deemed rejected under title united states code section and rendered unenforceable.only executory contracts and unexpired leases are affected by title united states code section.an executory contract within the meaning of this statute is a contract on which performance is due to some extent on both sides and in which the obligations of both parties are so far unperformed that the failure of either party to complete performance would constitute a material breach and thus excuse the performance of the other.in re cflc,cir.the agreement containing the attorney fees and costs provision is not an executory contract because it was fully performed when the real estate transaction occurred in,nearly five years before clark declared bankruptcy.therefore,the attorney fees and costs provision in the agreement was not rendered unenforceable under title united states code section.
kinney also argues clark was not entitled to collect on the december,order awarding her attorney fees and costs because her debt to her attorneys was discharged in bankruptcy,so her recovery on that award would constitute an improper windfall.this argument does not advance kinney cause on appeal for multiple reasons.
first,this issue is not before us on appeal.as discussed above,in appellate case number,kinney already challenged the trial court order denying his claim of exemption and allowing a levy upon his funds to pay the december,award.that order is final.the matter before us is clark claim for attorney fees and costs incurred in successfully defending kinney appeal from the trial court order denying his claim of exemption and allowing a levy upon his funds to pay the december,award.kinney does not dispute clark prevailed in appellate case number,her attorneys performed the legal services claimed,and the amount of the award is reasonable.arguments that should have been raised in appellate case number,regarding clark entitlement to collect on the december award,are not germane to our resolution of this appeal.
second,even if kinney challenge of the december,award of attorney fees and costs were timely,he lacks standing to make the argument regarding the effect of clark bankruptcy discharge on her debt to her attorneys.clark has a judgment against kinney in the amount of the december,award.what clark owes her attorneys and what she pays them out of the judgment are matters between her and her attorneys.as the bankruptcy court pointed out to kinney when it granted the motion to abandon clark right to recover attorney fees and costs against him,kinney was not a creditor of clark estate and he had no interest in the administration of her estate.clark bankruptcy did not benefit kinney.it did not discharge his debt to her the december,award.accordingly,we reject kinney argument that allowing clark to enforce the judgment against him would be inequitable to him and a windfall for her.
we note kinney repeatedly has argued in the bankruptcy court,the federal district court and the ninth circuit court of appeals without success that all superior court orders awarding clark attorney fees and costs issued after clark declared bankruptcy in july violate bankruptcy law and are void.in fact,kinney removed this appeal to the united states district court for the central district of california,arguing the federal court has subject matter jurisdiction on numerous grounds,including bankruptcy issues.the district court remanded the matter to this court and imposed monetary sanctions on kinney,rejecting his claim that bankruptcy concerns are implicated in the trial court award of attorney fees and costs to clark under the agreement.the court explained the attorney fee motions are pure matters that belong in state court.the court is not persuaded that any bankruptcy concerns are being violated by any actions or decisions in the state court.although kinney maintains in his opening appellate brief that this action involves issues that can only be resolved in federal court using bankruptcy law,the federal courts have rejected this assertion and instructed the parties to litigate clark claims for attorney fees and costs in state court applying state law.notwithstanding kinney barrage of district court filings and ninth circuit appeals,the federal courts have declined his requests for an order staying the proceedings in this action.
pending state court appeals from other awards of attorney fees and costs did not stay this action and preclude the trial court from awarding clark additional attorney fees and costs under the agreement 
kinney also repeats an argument he has unsuccessfully asserted in prior appeals in the present action,challenging earlier orders awarding clark attorney fees and costs,appellate case nos,discussed above that appeals related to other awards of attorney fees and costs automatically stayed the action below under code of civil procedure section preventing the trial court from awarding clark additional fees and costs.as set forth above,in appellate case number,kinney appealed from the trial court march,order in this action awarding clark attorney fees and costs for the work her attorneys performed in attempting to enforce the december,fee award.in appellate case number,kinney appealed from an order denying his second claim of exemption and allowing a levy upon funds to pay the july,fee award in favor of clark and against kinney.both of these appeals were pending on may,when the trial court made the order at issue in this appeal awarding clark attorney fees and costs for the work her attorneys performed in successfully defending the appeal from the denial of his first claim of exemption in appellate case number kinney does not cite authority or provide argument supporting his position that an appeal from an attorney fee order would prevent the trial court from issuing a subsequent,separate and distinct attorney fee order based on new and different legal services rendered.we are aware of no such authority.
kinney attempt to challenge clark retainer agreement with her attorneys fails 
kinney contends clark attorneys have no right to attorney fees and costs because they the attorneys never filed a separate,independent state court declaratory relief action against clark regarding their retainer.kinney waged previous unsuccessful attacks on clark retainer agreement with her attorneys in appellate case numbers the present action and the related action.as division two concluded in case number,kinney has not demonstrated he has standing to challenge clark consent to the lien in her retainer agreement with her attorneys.kempton clark,supra.the authority kinney cites in this appeal to support his contention is inapposite.mojtahedi vargas th,attorney action against his former client subsequent attorney for a portion of settlement proceeds was properly dismissed on demurrer because the attorney failed to establish the existence,amount and enforceability of the lien in an independent action against his clients.clark attorneys provided legal services in successfully defending clark in this action in appellate case number.clark filed a motion for attorney fees and costs under the agreement,as the prevailing party on appeal.the trial court awarded the fees and costs.clark attorneys were not required to sue her to establish their entitlement to be paid for the legal work they performed.
kinney belated challenges to the and vexatious litigant orders are not properly before us 
finally,kinney continues to complain about the superior court order and the decision from division two of this district,declaring him to be a vexatious litigant.the time has long ago passed to contest these final decisions.
this appeal is frivolous.kinney recycled arguments have no more merit now than they did the numerous times he raised them before.we grant clark motion to dismiss the appeal.
motion for sanctions prefiling order 
clark filed a motion for sanctions against kinney in this court,seeking an expanded prefiling order requiring kinney to obtain leave of the presiding judge before filing any new litigation,even when he is represented by counsel.kinney opposes the motion,arguing courts may impose prefiling requirements on vexatious litigants only,and not vexatious litigants who file new litigation through counsel.
under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a a provision in the vexatious litigant statutory scheme,a court may,on its own motion or the motion of any party,enter a prefiling order which prohibits a vexations litigant from filing any new litigation in the courts of this state in propria persona without first obtaining leave of the presiding justice or presiding judge of the court where the litigation is proposed to be filed.italics added.
we recognize that the prefiling order contemplated by section applies to litigation filed by litigants.but this statutory limitation does not prevent us from expanding the prefiling order under the circumstances of this case,for two reasons.first,case law holds that it is appropriate to extend a prefiling order issued under section to new litigation filed by a vexatious liti
