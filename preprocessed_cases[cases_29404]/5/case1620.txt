plaintiffs children and families commission of fresno county fresno commission,madera county children and families commission madera commission,first merced county merced commission,first solano children and families commission solano commission and kendra rogers collectively the commissions,appeal from a postjudgment order denying their motion for attorney fees sought under the private attorney general doctrine.code civ,we conclude section does not apply because,as the trial court correctly determined,the financial burden of this litigation was not out of proportion to the commissions pecuniary stakes in the proceedings.we therefore affirm the order denying attorney fees.
factual and procedural background 
in november,california voters adopted proposition,the california children and families first act of,adopted,health,subd.c hereafter prop or the act.prop created a program to promote,support and improve the early development of children from the prenatal stage to five years of age,through the establishment,institution,and coordination of appropriate standards,resources,and integrated and comprehensive programs emphasizing community awareness,education,nurturing,child care,social services,health care,and research.health.
to pay for these programs,prop imposes a surtax on cigarettes and tobacco products,which is deposited into the california children and families trust fund the trust fund in the state treasury.health,subd.a.prop also established a new state commission,known as the california children and families commission the state commission,and authorized each county to establish a county children and families commission.health,subd.a a.the state and county commissions administer the programs authorized by the act.health,subd.b.
the trust fund moneys are allocated and appropriated as follows percent to separate accounts of the state commission and percent to county commissions,which are deposited into local trust funds administered by each county commission.health,subd.d.moneys in the local trust funds are to be expended only for the purposes authorized by this a ct and in accordance with the county strategic plan approved by each county commission.health,subd.d a.
prop provides that moneys raised pursuant to the cigarette and tobacco taxes shall be appropriated and expended only for the purposes expressed in the act,and shall be used only to supplement existing levels of service and not to fund existing levels of service.no moneys in the trust fund shall be used to supplant state or local general fund money for any purpose.the act authorizes the legislature to amend its provisions by a vote of both houses and provides that all amendments shall be to further the a ct and must be consistent with its purposes.stats,proposition.
in march,assembly bill ab was approved by more than of each house of the legislature and signed by the governor.ab was enacted because of california severe fiscal crisis,which has resulted in funding shortfalls for many services at the state and local levels.health and human services programs that serve children are among the most seriously affected by this lack of funding.stats,ch.ab,a.the legislature found that funding shortfalls had forced counties to eliminate essential health and human services to children that had been paid for with state funds,and while many county commissions maintained substantial balances in their prop trust funds,they were unable to use the money to make up the shortfall due to the act prohibition against supplanting existing service levels.stats,ch.ab,d.
to solve this problem,ab authorized the transfer of a specified amount of funding from the state and county trust funds.ab added three health and safety code sections section,which established the children and families health and human services fund human services fund in the state treasury which was to be used upon appropriation by the legislature,to provide health and human services,including,but not limited to,direct health care services,to children from birth through five years of age section,which directed that million be transferred from the state commission accounts to the human services fund and section,which directed that million from the combined balances of all the county commissions trust funds be transferred to the human services fund.the legislature asserted this transfer did not supplant existing levels of service because the services were no longer being funded and that requiring prop funds to be used in this manner would help counties achieve the act overall objective of promoting,supporting,and optimizing early childhood development.stats,ch.ab,g.
each county commission was supposed to remit percent of its county commission funding for deposit into the human services fund by june.health,subd.c.these remissions were not to cause any county commission fund balance to fall below the amount the county commission received from the trust fund in the fiscal year.health,subd.c.to the extent the total remitted by all county commissions exceeded million,the excess was to have been proportionally returned to all contributing county commissions.health,subd.c.
on april,the fresno,madera and merced commissions,as well as taxpayer kendra rogers,filed a petition for writ of mandate in fresno county superior court,naming governor edmund brown,california state controller john chiang,and california director of finance ana matosantos as defendants collectively the state officials.the commissions alleged the legislature exceeded its authority in enacting ab,asserting the measure interfered with local control of commission funds,violated prop prohibition on using those funds to supplant existing services,and threatened to allow expenditures for services to all age groups,rather than children to age five and their families.the commissions sought a writ of mandate prohibiting the state officials from implementing or complying with ab they also asked for declaratory and injunctive relief,as well as attorney fees pursuant to section.
pursuant to a stipulation,the solano commission joined the initial three commissions in prosecuting the action.six other county commissions filed similar suits throughout the state.all of these cases eventually were consolidated in fresno county.
governor brown initial budget proposal in january called for using billion of the more than billion held in the state and county commissions trust funds to fund medi cal services for children through age five to allow continued funding of core programs providing early childhood health services,subject to voter approval.this approach changed in the may revision to the budget which increased funding to the health and human service agency by billion in light of the legal challenges brought against the state use of prop funding for the medi cal program.while the may revision noted the state would continue to defend the legal challenges,the administration elected to take a conservative approach and restore the general fund costs.the budget the governor signed on june,did not include the transfer of the prop funds for use by the health and human services agency.
on november,after briefing by the parties and argument,the trial court issued its order on the petition.the issue before the court was whether ab was a valid amendment to prop,which turned on whether ab furthered prop purposes.the court rejected the state officials assertion that the undisputed purpose of prop was funding programs for preschool children,finding instead that prop was intended to emphasize local and provide for greater local flexibility in designing delivery systems.the court determined the purposes of the two laws were conflicting while prop clearly requires local experts and community representatives to decide how the funds are to be spent,ab clearly divests the county commissions of that authority and vests it in the legislature.as the court explained,t o claim that transferring from local communities to the state legislature is consistent with prop is like asking the court to find that black means white.
the court also found that ab violated prop prohibition against using trust fund money to supplant or replace funding for existing levels of services for young children,noting that ab essentially states that its intent is to transfer the funds out of the local commissions to get around that prohibition by allowing the state legislature to do what prop prevents the commissions from doing.as the court explained,by claiming that the l egislature has prioritized ensuring that the target population continue to receive basic health care services,they are essentially acknowledging that the legislative intent is to use these funds to fund existing levels of service.
the court concluded that,based on the evidence before it,neither health and safety code section nor section furthered prop or were consistent with its purposes,and therefore the amendments could be validly enacted only be a vote of the electorate.the court also found that health and safety code section could not be severed from the rest of ab.therefore,the court held that the entire bill was invalid and the commissions were entitled to judgment on the peremptory writ.
following the ruling,the commissions dismissed their remaining causes of action,with the exception of their attorney fees claim.the court entered final judgment on january.the state officials elected not to appeal the judgment.
the commissions subsequently filed a motion for attorney fees under section,which provides,in relevant part,upon motion,a court may award attorneys fees to a successful party against one or more opposing parties in any action which has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest if a significant benefit,whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary,has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons,b the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement,or of enforcement by one public entity against another public entity,are such as to make the award appropriate,and c such fees should not in the interest of justice be paid out of the recovery,if any.
the motion sought in attorney fees incurred during the litigation the commissions argued their lawsuit enforced important rights affecting the public interest and conferred a significant benefit on two classes of persons children from the prenatal stage to age five and their families,and california voters.they asserted the lawsuit benefitted more than just their own constituents,as it enforced the rights of all california voters and young children and families throughout the state.the commissions claimed their interest in the litigation was not financial,as they sought to protect the funds entrusted to them and ensure the trust fund would be allocated to programs through local and not used to supplant funding for existing services for young children.while the commissions acknowledged they would retain a substantial amount of money by virtue of the lawsuit,they argued this was not an economic benefit to them but instead constituted money held in trust for the benefit of their constituents.
in their opposition to the motion,the state officials argued that the commissions had not shown that the lawsuit conferred a substantial benefit on the general public or a large class of persons,as neither young children nor the california electorate received any meaningful benefit from the trial court determination that ab exceeded the legislature power to amend prop.the state officials further argued the commissions had not established that the financial burden of enforcement made an attorney fee award appropriate,as they had a sufficient financial interest to bring the lawsuit without the prospect of an attorney fee award and their litigation costs of were not disproportionate to their expected financial gain,the retention of more than million in trust money that was subject to transfer had ab been enforced.
the trial court denied the motion for attorney fees.in its written order,it explained its decision as follows here the petitioner commissions are public entities with identified constituencies,appointed to hold and distribute the funds they receive in trust for their constituents.in this case,the commissions obtained a significant pecuniary benefit for their constituencies from this litigation,and as argued in the opposition,it was in no way disproportionate to the in fees they claim to have incurred,since the funds they preserved for their constituents were in the hundreds of millions.
the commissions did not need the prospect of attorney fees as an incentive to bring this litigation,and the issue they brought to the court was basically whose judgment was to decide the best way to help young california children it was that of the local commissions set up by prop o r the state l egislature.while the court found,as it had to,that the l egislature was not authorized to make that determination based on the plain language of prop,that does necessarily mean that there was a net substantial benefit to the families who receive prop services.
while respondents concede that important rights were protected including the right of the electorate to control the scope of legislative authority to amend statutes passed by initiative and the right of young children to the benefits of locally determined programs funded with taxpayer dollars,there is a question as to the extent of the substantial benefit obtained in that the inability of the state to use the one billion of tobacco tax revenue to fund existing health related programs necessarily meant that there were less funds available to fund those programs.
with regard to benefit to the electorate,it does seem,as respondents have argued,that the issue here was whether the people have the right to set limits on the power of the l egislature to make amendments,but whether in this case ab furthered the act and was consistent with its purpose,since the voters specifically authorized amendment on a vote of the l egislature where those conditions were met.
additionally,to qualify for an award under ccp,the court must find that it would not be in the interest of justice to pay the fees out of the plaintiff recovery,if any.here,the commissions were able to hold on to millions of dollars in funds they would otherwise have lost,out of which the could be paid.on the other hand,the state lost access to the billion it wanted to use to pay for critically needed health care services.if it now has to also pay to the commissions,that is even less available to fund health services.while petitioners have argued that denying the motion would result in a deprivation of services to young children,an equivalent deprivation may be suffered if the state w ere required to pay.
only the fresno,madera,merced and solano commissions,along with kendra rogers,appealed the fee denial.
discussion 
section codifies the private attorney general doctrine enunciated in serrano priest cal d,which rests upon the recognition that privately initiated lawsuits are often essential to the effectuation of fundamental public poli c ies embodied in constitutional or statutory provisions,and that,without some mechanism authorizing the award of attorney fees,private actions to enforce such important public policies will as a practical matter frequently be infeasible.healdsburg citizens for sustainable solutions city of healdsburg th.the doctrine purpose is to encourage suits enforcing important public policies by providing substantial attorney fees to successful litigants in such cases.robinson city of chowchilla th,robinson.
as pertinent here,an award under section requires a showing that the litigation enforced an important right affecting the public interest it conferred a significant benefit on the general public or a large class of persons and the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement,or enforcement by one public entity against another,were such as to make the award appropriate.conservatorship of whitley cal th,whitley.since the statute states the criteria in the conjunctive,each element must be satisfied to justify a fee award.city of maywood los angeles unified school dist.th,maywood.accordingly,we may uphold the trial court order denying the attorney fees motion if we determine any one of these elements is missing.
the third element,the necessity and financial burden requirement,involves two issues whether private enforcement was necessary and whether the financial burden of private enforcement warrants subsidizing the successful party attorneys.whitley,supra,cal th at.it is the second prong which is at issue here.our supreme court has explained this prong as follows in determining the financial burden on litigants,courts have quite logically focused not only on the costs of the litigation but also any offsetting financial benefits that the litigation yields or reasonably could have been expected to yield.an award on the private attorney general theory is appropriate when the cost of the claimant legal victory transcends his personal interest,that is,when the necessity for pursuing the lawsuit placed a burden on the plaintiff out of proportion to his individual stake in the matter.citation.this requirement focuses on the financial burdens and incentives involved in bringing the lawsuit.whitley,supra,cal th at.a party seeking fees under section has the burden of establishing its litigation costs transcend its personal interests.save open space santa monica mountains superior court th,beach colony ii california coastal com.d.
in whitley,our supreme court clarified the proper method of evaluating the financial burden element of section,when the cost of the legal victory transcends the successful party personal interest.see maywood,supra,th at.as explained in maywood,before whitley,appellate courts were divided as to whether it was proper to consider a claimant nonpecuniary personal interests when applying the financial burden element.citations.whitley resolved the dispute,holding that a litigant personal nonpecuniary motives may not be used to disqualify that litigant from obtaining fees under section.maywood,supra,th at.
the plaintiff in whitley,the conservator of her developmentally disabled brother,brought litigation resulting in a published appellate opinion that extended certain procedural protections to disabled persons challenging a community placement.whitley,supra,cal th at.the trial court denied her subsequent request for attorney fees under section,in part,on the ground the financial burden imposed by the case was not out of proportion to her personal interest in her brother.whitley,supra,cal th.the court of appeal affirmed the fee denial,holding that a strong nonpecuniary personal interest in the litigation could disqualify a litigant from obtaining attorney fees under section.whitley,supra,cal th at.
our supreme court reversed,holding that a litigant personal nonpecuniary motives may not be used to disqualify that litigant from obtaining fees under section.whitley,supra,cal th at.the court explained that the appellate court contrary interpretation has no basis in the language,legislative history,or evident purpose of section,which is not to compensate with attorney fees only those litigants who have altruistic or lofty motives,but rather all litigants and attorneys who step forward to engage in public interest litigation when there are insufficient financial incentives to justify the litigation in economic terms.whitley,supra,cal th at.
in so holding,the court cited,with approval,the method for weighing costs and benefits of litigation illustrated in los angeles police protective league city of los angeles d lappl.whitley,supra,cal th at.first,the trial court fixes or estimates the monetary value of the benefits obtained by the successful litigants themselves,discounted by some estimate of the probability of success at the time the vital litigation decisions were made which eventually produced the successful outcome.whitley,supra,cal th at.next,the trial court turns to the costs of the litigation which may have been required to bring the case to fruition.id.at.finally,the trial court place s the estimated value of the case beside the actual cost and make s the value judgment whether it is desirable to offer the bounty of a fee in order to encourage litigation of the sort involved in this case a bounty will be appropriate except where the expected value of the litigant own monetary award exceeds by a substantial margin the actual litigation costs.id.at,citing lappl,supra,d at.
although whitley was a private enforcement action,one appellate court has concluded that its holding applies to public enforcement cases where a public entity pursues attorney fees against another public entity.city of maywood,supra,th at.the court in city of maywood noted that,when applying section financial burden criterion to political subdivisions,the trial court should consider whether the burden of the litigation transcended the interests of both the political entity and the collective interests of the individuals that entity represents.city of maywood,supra,th at.but,when assessing this factor in the context of a public entity legal victory,the trial court may only consider the public entity pecuniary interests and the pecuniary interests of its constituents.ibid.
standard of review 
here,the trial court effectively determined that the commissions failed to satisfy the financial burden element of section because the cost of the litigation was not out of proportion to the value of the case to the commissions constituents.generally,a trial court ruling on a request for attorney fees under section is reviewed for abuse of discretion.vasquez state of california cal th.de novo review is appropriate when the trial court determination of whether the statutory criteria were met presents an issue of statutory construction or a question of law.whitley,supra,cal th at serrano stefan merli plastering,cal th.
the financial burden element of section requires a determination of the cost of the litigation relative to its value to the commissions.this is not a question of law.the trial court,being more familiar with the dynamics of the litigation,is in a better position to assess the financial burden of the lawsuit in relation to its value to the commissions.we review the trial court order for abuse of discretion.see lappl,supra,d at trial court assessment of financial burden element merits deference from appellate court,though appellate court need not shirk from correcting errors in methodology or calculation.
in reviewing the ruling,we must pay particular attention to the trial court stated reasons in denying or awarding fees and see whether it applied the proper standards of law in reaching its decision.citation.the pertinent question is whether the grounds given by the court are consistent with the substantive law of section and,if so,whether their application to the facts of this case is within the range of discretion conferred upon the trial courts under section,read in light of the purposes and policy of the statute.county of colusa california wildlife conservation bd.th.the trial court determination may not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing that there is no reasonable basis in the record for the award.ibid.
the trial court determined the commissions brought this litigation to preserve their trust funds,which were to be used to pay for programs for their constituents.it denied the commissions section fee request because the trust fund money they preserved far exceeded the fees incurred and therefore the bounty of a fee award was not required to encourage the litigation.
the trial court did not abuse its discretion in so finding.the evidence before the court showed that the commissions faced losing more than million combined had the transfers provided for by ab gone into effect the amount saved was more than times the amount of attorney fees expended.the commissions did not need a bounty of fees to encourage the litigation and the financial burden of the litigation was not out of proportion to the commissions stake in the matter.
the commissions contend the trial court applied the incorrect standard when assessing whether the financial burden of enforcement by one public entity against the other makes a fee award appropriate.arguing that a different standard applies to public enforcement actions,they assert the pertinent question in such cases is
