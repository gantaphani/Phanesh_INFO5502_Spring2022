background 
this patent case relates to document processing systems.eon net owns the,and patents,which are part of a larger patent family that issued from continuation and divisional applications of a parent patent application filed in the patent portfolio.the listed inventors include mitchell medina,robert leech,and catherine elias,and the inventors are principals of eon net,which is one of a number of patentholding companies formed to enforce various patents within the patent portfolio.exceptional case order,at.the first five patents that issued were assigned to eon net companion corporation,millennium millennium,the,and patents were assigned to eon net,and subsequent patents were assigned to another related entity,glory licensing llc glory.id.at.
a.the asserted patents 
the asserted patents are entitled information processing methodology and disclose a system and method for inputting information from a document,storing certain portions of the inputted document information in memory according to content instructions,and formatting the stored document information for use by a computer program,effectuating a paperless office.claim of the patent is representative of the claims on appeal,claiming a multimode information processing system for inputting information from a document or file on a computer into at least one application program according to transmission format instructions.specifically,claim reads 
a multimode information processing system for inputting information from a document or file on a computer into at least one application program according to customizable transmission format instructions,and to operate in at least one of 
a definition mode wherein content instructions are used to define input information from within said document or file required by said at least one application program and 
an extraction mode to parse at least a portion of said document or file to automatically extract at least one field of information required by said at least one application program and to transfer said at least one field of information to said at least one application program according to said customizable transmission format instructions.
patent,ll emphases added.the claimed invention is directed to a system for efficiently processing information originating from hard copy documents,id.ll and figure of the written description shows a preferred embodiment where the document is scanned into memory for processing by a computer that contains a number of application units that utilize the information obtained from the scanned document 
in figure,the scanner extracts information from a hard copy document and stores that information in either its memory or the computer main memory.id.ll.the computer then reads the document information from either memory and selects portions of the document information according to content instructions,which define the portions of the document information that a particular application unit requires.id.ll.after the computer has obtained the selected portions of the document,it formats the selected portions into the format required by a particular application unit according to transmission format instructions and creates an input file for use by the application unit.id.ll.
the written description provides an example that more concretely describes the patented system.in the example,a small business can create electronic copies of its business records and use computer applications such as quicken to manipulate information contained in those hard copy documents.id.in this example,the system first obtains information from hard copy business records using content instructions that indicate the portions of the documents that contain information that can be used by quicken,such as the portions of an invoice that contain the payee address or invoice amount.id.ll,ll.the computer then formats the selected information into a format recognized by quicken and creates an input file that a user can open in the quicken application.id.ll,ll.after launching quicken and opening the input file,the user can manipulate the information obtained from the hard copy documents to manage accounts,write checks,and prepare business records.id.
b.the litigation 
the patent portfolio has a long litigation history,beginning in.exceptional case order,at.between and,millennium filed four lawsuits asserting various claims of the patent portfolio.id.at.after,zimmerman began to represent millennium as its litigation counsel,and,in the course of his representation,zimmerman filed a large number of lawsuits alleging infringement of the patent portfolio.id.at.by the time the district court found that eon net conduct presented an exceptional case under,zimmerman had filed over lawsuits on behalf of eon net or its related entities asserting infringement of the patent portfolio.id.at.almost all of these cases resulted in early settlements or dismissals.id.at.
eon net sued flagstar in,alleging that the processing of information entered by customers on flagstar website infringed various claims of the patent.early in the case,flagstar moved for summary judgment of noninfringement because it utilized document processing technology provided by kofax image products,inc,who held a license to the patent.id.at the same time,flagstar filed a motion for sanctions pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure on the basis that eon net failed to investigate or identify allegedly infringing products and that eon net asserted baseless infringement claims.id.at.the district court granted both motions,concluding that the written description limited the asserted claims to processing information originating from a hard copy document,that eon net position that the claims covered the processing of information entered on a website was baseless,and that eon net failed to investigate or identify allegedly infringing products prior to filing suit.id.at.the district court accordingly assessed attorney fees and costs against eon net and zimmerman for their violation of rule.id.at see also eon net lp flagstar bancorp,cv,judgment by court ecf.
eon net and zimmerman appealed.on appeal,we vacated and remanded both the summary judgment ruling and the imposition of sanctions because the district court failed to afford eon net notice and the opportunity to present its infringement and claim construction arguments during the briefing on the motions.eon net lp flagstar bancorp,app x,eon net i.without a full claim construction analysis,including a consideration of eon net claim construction arguments,we held that it was impossible to determine if eon net claim construction and infringement positions were without merit.id.at.we expressly declined,however,to pass judgment on what the appropriate construction of the patent should be.id.at.
on remand,the district judge who initially handled the case recused herself.exceptional case order,at.upon reassignment to a second district judge,eon net amended its complaint to add infringement allegations for the and patents,and the parties engaged in the claim construction process.id.at.after reviewing the parties briefs and holding a hearing,the district court construed the disputed claim terms.claim construction opinion,at.central to this appeal,the district court concluded that the terms document,file,extract,and template were limited to information originating from a hard copy document.id.at.based on these constructions,eon net stipulated to noninfringement of the asserted claims.noninfringement order,at.
flagstar subsequently moved for attorney fees pursuant to,and the district court granted flagstar motion.exceptional case order,at.the district court based its exceptional case finding on what it found were eon net pursuit of baseless infringement claims,eon net improper purpose of bringing the against flagstar to obtain a nuisance value settlement,eon net destruction of evidence,and eon net offensive litigation tactics.id.at.the district court invited flagstar to renew its motion to impose rule sanctions.id.at.
flagstar thereafter renewed its motion for sanctions pursuant to rule and submitted a statement of attorney fees and costs expended on the litigation.the district court granted flagstar motion for sanctions,concluding that eon net and its counsel failed to perform a reasonable investigation and that their claim construction positions were unsupportable.supplemental order on fees and costs,at.thus,the district court reinstated in full the in attorney fees and costs against eon net and zimmerman for their violation of rule.id.at.regarding,the court awarded flagstar in attorney fees and costs for litigating the case following remand.id.at.
eon net and zimmerman timely appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
eon net appeals the district court construction of the terms document,file,extract,and template.eon net also appeals the district court imposition of rule sanctions and the district court exceptional case finding we address each issue below.
claim construction 
we review a district court claim construction de novo.cybor fas,en banc.to ascertain the scope and meaning of the asserted claims,we look to the words of the claims themselves,the written description,the prosecution history,and,lastly,any relevant extrinsic evidence.phillips awh,en banc.
as a general rule,claim terms should be given their ordinary and customary meaning to persons of skill in the art as of the effective date of the patent application.id.at.although the claims of a patent define the invention for which the patentee is entitled to an exclusionary right,we must read the claims in view of the specification,of which they are a part.id.at quoting markman westview instruments,en banc.the specification is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed claim term,and,usually,the specification use of a claim term is dispositive.phillip,at quoting vitronics conceptronic,see also icu,alaris med.thus,the specification is always highly relevant to the claim construction analysis.phillips,at quoting vitronics,at.
eon net appeals the district court construction of the terms document,file,extract,and template.eon net argues that the ordinary meanings of file and document are not limited to information derived from a hard copy document.eon net asserts that the written description discloses a computer file embodiment,and that the asserted claims are directed to this embodiment.finally,eon net argues that the united states patent trademark office has allowed claims in related patent applications that expressly recite that the claimed document or file is not derived from scanning a hard copy document,which,according to eon net,shows that the document and file terms are not limited to information originating from a hard copy document.
flagstar responds that the written description defines the claimed invention as a system for processing information that originates from hard copy documents.flagstar also argues that eon net claim differentiation argument fails because the clear import of the written description is that the patents are limited to processing information that originates from hard copy documents.
we agree with flagstar that the disputed claim terms are limited to information that originates from a hard copy document.the written description repeatedly and consistently defines the invention as a system that processes information derived from hard copy documents.the background of the invention section explains that conventional systems have limitations which decrease the efficiency of processing information from a hard copy document.patent,ll.thus,t he invention is directed to a system for efficiently processing information originating from hard copy documents,more specifically to a hard copy document application program interface which minimizes the need to manually process hard copy documents.id.ll.
consistent with that defined field,the summary of invention section defines the invention as providing an application program interface which inputs a diversity of hard copy documents using an automated digitizing unit and which stores information from the hard copy documents in a memory as stored document information.id.ll.this definition furthers the objects of the invention,which include to provide an application program interface which allows a user to select specific portions of information extracted from a diversity of hard copy documents provide an application program interface which will allow the extraction,selection,formatting,routing,and storage of information from a hard copy document and provide a cost effective system for inputting hard copy documents which can accommodate hard copy documents in a diversity of formats.id.ll.
similarly,in describing the invention in detail,the written description explains that the invention provides an interface between information originating from a hard copy document and a computer application unit which uses the information.id.col ll.as part of this disclosure,the written description teaches that the claimed file contains information that originated from a hard copy document,explaining that the instant invention provides for parsing information extracted from a hard copy document and transmitting that information as an input file to a user or application.id.ll.the written description concludes that the instant invention provides an integrated and comprehensive system for handling information from a hard copy document,thus permitting a paperless office.id.ll.in total,the term hard copy document appears over times in the common disclosure of the,and patents.
these statements about the invention are not limited to specific embodiments or examples but describe and define the invention overall.thus,eon net argument that the written description provides support for a computer file embodiment is without merit.
eon net primarily points to figure of the written description and the accompanying text to argue that they disclose an embodiment wherein the processed document or file is not limited to information originating from a hard copy document.figure,however,details the input process for the preferred embodiment of the invention described in figure,id.ll,which,as described above,illustrates the system for processing information from a hard copy document according to the instant invention,id.ll.the input data flow process performed by this system,as depicted in figure below,shows that the input document can include text information from a character input or character recognition hardware,image information provided by a scanner,and information from a communication interface connected to an external device 
the written description explains that the character input module inputs textual information,such as alphanumeric characters,from an input device such as a keyboard.id.ll internal reference numbers omitted.eon net argues that because the character input module allows a user to enter textual information for processing as an input document,this disclosure shows that the invention is not limited to information originating from a hard copy document.
the written description,however,states that figure describes the data flow process for a system that processes information originating from a hard copy document.id.ll,ll.indeed,the written description explains that t he hard copy document may contain textual information or image information or both.id.ll.absent from the specification is any teaching that the textual information is information other than information originating from a hard copy document.thus,figure and the related disclosure are consistent with the remainder of the written description,which repeatedly defines the invention as a system for processing information originating from hard copy documents.
eon net claim differentiation argument is also unavailing.first,claim differentiation is a rule of thumb that does not trump the clear import of the specification,edwards lifesciences,llc cook,and,in this case,the written description defines the invention as a system for processing information that originates from a hard copy document.second,the claims in the patent portfolio that eon net points to recite that the claimed file or document file is not derived from scanning a hard copy document,patent,claim patent,claim.the specification discloses that scanning is only one of many methods to obtain information from a hard copy document,such as using an electrical or optical device to extract information from a hard copy document.patent,ll.thus,while these claims may show that the claimed invention encompasses the processing of information originating from a hard copy document that was obtained by a method other than scanning,the claim language does not address whether the construction of document or file may expand beyond encompassing information originating from a hard copy document.
in sum,we agree with the district court construction of the document,file,extract,and template terms.this is not a case where a district court improperly imported a limitation from the specification or where the question of what the specification teaches about the claims presents a close call here,the specification unequivocally compels the constructions adopted by the district court.accordingly,because eon net stipulated to noninfringement of the asserted claims of the,and patents under the district court claim construction,we affirm the court judgment of noninfringement.
exceptional case finding 
a district court is vested with the authority to award attorney fees to a prevailing party in patent litigation if it determines that the case is exceptional.a determination whether to award attorney fees under involves a process.first,a district court must determine whether the prevailing party has proved by clear and convincing evidence that the case is exceptional.forest,abbott.we review de novo whether the district court applied the proper legal standard,and we review the court exceptional case finding for clear error.id.at.second,if the district court finds the case to be exceptional,the court must then determine whether an award of attorney fees is appropriate and,if fees are appropriate,the amount of the award.cybor,at.we review that determination for an abuse of discretion.id.
when reviewing an exceptional case finding for clear error,we are mindful that the district court has lived with the case and the lawyers for an extended period.having only the briefs and the cold record,and with counsel appearing before us for only a short period of time,we are not in the position to the trial court judgment.however,because of the substantial economic and reputational impact of an award of attorney fees,we examine the record with care to determine whether the trial court clearly erred in its exceptional case finding.medtronic navigation,brainlab medizinische computersysteme gmbh,fed.cir.
here,eon net only appeals the district court exceptional case finding and has not appealed the district court determination of the amount of attorney fees and costs.eon net argues that the district court clearly erred in its exceptional case finding,asserting that eon net proffered reasonable claim construction positions,that the purpose of its lawsuit to obtain licensing revenue was proper,that eon net did not destroy any relevant documents,and that eon net litigation tactics were not offensive or vexatious.thus,argues eon net,the district court committed clear error and its exceptional case finding should be reversed.
we disagree.it is undisputed that the district court applied the correct legal standard under.regarding the court factual finding,as a general matter,we have observed that many varieties of misconduct can support a district court exceptional case finding,including lodging frivolous filings and engaging in vexatious or unjustified litigation.see takeda chem,mylan.indeed,l itigation misconduct and unprofessional behavior may suffice,by themselves,to make a case exceptional under.rambus infineon techs.ag.absent litigation misconduct or misconduct in securing the patent,sanctions under may be imposed against the patentee only if both the patentee brought the litigation in bad faith and the litigation is objectively baseless.brooks furniture,dutailer int l.
here,the district court found that eon net litigation misconduct and its filing of a baseless infringement action in bad faith for an improper purpose warranted an exceptional case finding.we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in so finding and address each category of conduct below.
litigation misconduct 
the district court opinion recounted numerous instances of litigation misconduct.first,the district court found that eon net and its counsel destroyed relevant documents prior to the initiation of its lawsuit against flagstar and that eon net intentionally did not implement a document retention plan.exceptional case order,at.as recounted by the district court,eon net principal,mitchell medina,testified with regard to document retention,collection,and production that i do save anything so i do have to look and further testified that eon net and millennium have adopted a document retention policy which is that we do retain any documents because those companies have evolved into patent enforcement companies which are involved in the business of litigation.id.at.pursuant to this policy,in,medina and zimmerman discarded all documents from millennium infringement action against readsoft involving the patent portfolio,even though millennium had other pending cases.id.at.while zimmerman asserts on appeal that,after the readsoft case settled,he only discarded publicly available documents and nonessential documents such as receipts and retained all material documents,appellant br,it is impossible to determine the veracity of that statement.and,even if zimmerman assertions are true,it is undisputed that medina and ultimately eon net had an independent duty to preserve evidence during the ongoing lawsuits,see sensonics,aerosonic,and,in light of medina testimony,it was not clear error for the district court to conclude that eon net did not observe that duty.
the district court also detailed eon net litigation tactics.in particular,the district court found that eon net failed to engage the claim construction process in good faith because eon net failed to offer a construction for any disputed claim terms,lodged incomplete and misleading extrinsic evidence with the court,and submitted declarations that contradicted earlier deposition testimony by the declarants.exceptional case order,at.the district court concluded that eon net attempted to evade a careful analysis of the claim terms through the markman process after it prevailed in the eon net i appeal on the basis that the district court improperly granted summary judgment without affording eon net notice and an opportunity to argue its position on the scope of the patent claims.id.at.
eon net argues that it was not
