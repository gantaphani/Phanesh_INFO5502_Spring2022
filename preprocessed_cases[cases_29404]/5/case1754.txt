introduction 
in this appeal from the denial of an motion code civ,we hold that the trial court lacked the jurisdiction to rule on the merits of the motion because prior to the ruling the plaintiff had voluntarily dismissed the case before trial had commenced,the plaintiff had filed a request for dismissal prior to the trial court making a dispositive ruling or giving an indication of the merits of the underlying case,and prior to a time when the procedural posture was such that the plaintiff would inevitably lose.

contentions 
defendants contend on appeal that the trial court lacked the jurisdiction to reconsider,on the court own motion the motion the trial court erred in denying their motion to strike and the complaint should be struck because it violated the privilege.
in addition to other contentions,plaintiff contends that because it voluntarily had dismissed its complaint,the trial court was without jurisdiction to consider defendants motion and was only permitted to decide if attorney fees and costs should have been awarded to defendants.plaintiff is correct.further,because this contention is dispositive and because it involves a jurisdictional inquiry,we need only address this contention.
we vacate the trial court order denying defendants motion and remand the case to the trial court with directions to enter a dismissal without prejudice.
discussion the trial court had no jurisdiction to entertain defendants motion to strike because plaintiff had filed a dismissal before the court considered defendants motion.
