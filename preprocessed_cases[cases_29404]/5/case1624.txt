an individual who is denied state or local social services may challenge the denial through an administrative hearing process administered by the state director of social services director.if the party receives an unfavorable administrative decision,the exclusive remedy is a petition for writ of mandate in the superior court.welf.section governs this judicial review process and provides the applicant or recipient shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees and costs,if he obtains a decision in his favor.
in this case,a county social services recipient was unsuccessful in the administrative hearing process,but prevailed in the superior court writ of mandate action.the recipient then moved for attorney fees incurred for attorney services in the superior court and in the underlying administrative proceedings.the director agreed to pay the fees incurred for attorney services in the superior court,but not the fees incurred for work during the administrative proceedings.the director argued the recovery of the administrative attorney fees was not authorized under section.the superior court agreed and awarded only those fees incurred for work related to the writ of mandate petition.
the sole issue in this appeal is whether the court erred in concluding that as a matter of law it had no discretion under section to award attorney fees incurred for services performed in the underlying administrative proceedings.we hold the court properly interpreted section.applying statutory interpretation principles,we determine section permits a party to recover reasonable attorney fees incurred in the writ of mandate proceeding,but not fees incurred in the administrative hearing process.
factual and procedural summary 
this appeal arose from minor k entitlement to certain in home supportive services ihss under california law.the ihss program enables aged,blind or disabled poor to avoid institutionalization by remaining in their homes with proper supportive services bedoe county of san diego th,see et the program compensates persons who provide the services to a qualifying incapacitated person.guerrero superior court th.generally,an eligible person is entitled to ihss services not to exceed hours per month,subd.a.however,if the county welfare department determines the person needs at least hours per week of specified care,the individual shall receive services not to exceed hours per month,subd.b.the determination whether the individual is entitled to the higher benefit level requires a factually intensive evaluation of the assistance needed for numerous specified daily living tasks.
in,the county of san diego county found that k,who was diagnosed with autism and a seizure disorder,was eligible to receive ihss services for up to hours per month.during the next several years,the county continued to find k eligible for the monthly hours of paid supportive services.
in,k mother on her son behalf challenged the hour limit,and sought to receive services under the hour standard.an administrative hearing was held,at which neither k nor k mother was represented by counsel.k mother speaks japanese,and can read and write english but has difficulty speaking and understanding spoken english.after the hearing,the director denied the request.
k mother then retained attorney charles wolfinger to challenge the director denial.wolfinger agreed to represent the family on a pro bono basis because k parents could not afford an attorney,and agreed to seek fee reimbursement only from the director.while the administrative record was being prepared,wolfinger filed a writ petition in the superior court to set aside the denial.however,after reviewing the completed administrative record,wolfinger determined the record lacked sufficient documentary information to ensure success in the writ proceeding.he thus withdrew this writ petition and agreed to provide pro bono representation to k at a administrative hearing in which he planned to provide a more complete record.
at the hearing,wolfinger submitted numerous documentary exhibits and an page memorandum in an effort to show k disabilities warranted the higher benefit level.wolfinger also raised a legal issue regarding the propriety of the director imposing blanket age limitations for meal preparation and meal cleanup.in july,the director denied k claim,and provided a lengthy explanation.
three months later,in october,k,through his mother as guardian ad litem,filed a writ of mandate petition in the superior court challenging the director july decision.k was represented by wolfinger.wolfinger filed a memorandum of points and authorities supporting k claim that the director had improperly denied the higher benefit level for supportive services.
the director filed an answer denying the allegations,but did not file a responsive memorandum of points and authorities.instead,several months later,the director and k entered into a stipulated judgment granting k petition and issuing a writ of mandate.under the stipulation,the director agreed to set aside the july decision and find k eligible to receive up to hours of ihss monthly services and pay provider back wages.this stipulation was based on the parties agreement that k had an assessed weekly need of hours for the ihss services of meal preparation,meal,bowel and bladder care,feeding,dressing,bathing,oral hygiene and grooming,rubbing skin and care with prosthesis taking medications in the stipulation,the parties also agreed petitioner counsel charles wolfinger is entitled to reasonable attorney fees and costs,the amount to be mutually agreed on or determined after a noticed motion and memorandum of costs 
wolfinger then documented his attorney fees as follows hours x for work performed in connection with the superior court writ petition and hours x for work performed in connection with the administrative hearing.the director agreed to pay the full requested fees for the work related to the writ petition,but refused to pay the fees for the work related to the administrative hearing.the director argued that section precludes a court from awarding fees for work at the administrative hearing.
k then filed a motion under section,requesting the court to order the director to pay wolfinger total requested fees.because the director had agreed to pay the fee amount,the sole focus of the motion was wolfinger argument that section provides a court with the authority to award attorney fees for services related to the administrative hearing.in a declaration,wolfinger said that because he had prepared the entire administrative record on the issues and briefed some of them for the hearing,i spent considerably less time on the merits of the writ petition than i would have,had i not represented k at the administrative hearing.
in response,the director reasserted his arguments that attorney fees awarded under section are limited to attorney fees for work performed in connection with mandamus proceedings and t here is nothing in the statute which authorizes the payment of attorney fees for work performed in connection with the underlying administrative hearing.
in reply,wolfinger discussed the lodestar concept for the first time,but did not request an upward adjustment of his fees and argued only that he should be awarded his requested fees based on the actual amount of time worked both on the administrative hearing and the writ petition portions of the case.wolfinger also requested that the court award him fees incurred to litigate the attorney fees motion.
in its tentative ruling,the court agreed with the director that the administrative attorney fees were not recoverable under the plain meaning of section.after a hearing,the court confirmed this ruling and stated petitioner motion is granted for attorney fees requested for work on the litigation in the amount of and denied for attorney fees requested for work on the administrative hearing and for work on this fee motion.

statutory interpretation 
the rules governing statutory construction are well settled.we begin with the fundamental premise that the objective of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.citations.in determining intent,we look first to the language of the statute,giving effect to its plain meaning.citations.although we may properly rely on extrinsic aids,we should first turn to the words of the statute to determine the intent of the legislature.citation.where the words of the statute are clear,we may not add to or alter them to accomplish a purpose that does not appear on the face of the statute or from its legislative history.burden snowden cal th.

if a claimant does not prevail in the administrative process and seeks to challenge the decision,the exclusive remedy is to file a writ of mandate petition in the superior court under section.section states 
the applicant or recipient or the affected county,within one year after receiving notice of the director final decision,may file a petition with the superior court,under the provisions of section of the code of civil procedure,praying for a review of the entire proceedings in the matter,upon questions of law involved in the case.such review,if granted,shall be the exclusive remedy available to the applicant or recipient or county for review of the director decision.the director shall be the sole respondent in such proceedings.immediately upon being served the director shall serve a copy of the petition on the other party entitled to judicial review and such party shall have the right to intervene in the proceedings.

iii.analysis 
the issue on appeal is whether the court properly found k was not entitled to attorney fees incurred for services in connection with the underlying social services administrative hearing.
under california law,each party to a lawsuit must pay its own attorney fees unless a contract or statute or other law authorizes a fee award.douglas barnhart,cmc fabricators,th,see code civ.thus,unless specifically provided by statute or agreement,attorney fees are not recoverable.musaelian adams cal th.if a party seeking attorney fees is relying on a statutory authorization,a court has no discretion to award the fees unless the statutory criteria have been met as a matter of law.morgan imperial irrigation dist.th.
to show entitlement to attorney fees,k relies on the last sentence of section the applicant or recipient shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees and costs,if he obtains a decision in his favor.both parties agree that a social services claimant is entitled to attorney fees under this provision only if he or she prevails in the judicial action.in other words,without filing a petition for writ of mandate challenging an administrative decision and prevailing on that petition,it is undisputed that an applicant or recipient is not entitled to any attorney fees even if he or she prevailed in the administrative proceedings below.however,the parties disagree as to whether a party who files a writ petition and then obtains a decision in his favor in the writ proceeding is entitled to recover attorney fees incurred during the administrative proceeding.
in the almost years since the legislature enacted section,no court has addressed this precise issue in a reported decision.however,it appears that at least some courts litigants have assumed attorney fees are not recoverable.there are no cases in which a reviewing court has identified counsel work in the administrative hearing process as included within the recoverable attorney fees solely under section on the other hand,several courts have identified fees incurred in the superior and appellate courts as the fees recoverable under section.see,blackburn sarsfield d,county of alameda lackner d,see also silberman swoap d.
this assumption is supported by the language and purpose of the statute.the statute is entitled judicial review.the first paragraph details the procedures to be followed in obtaining review of the director final decision and states that a writ petition under code of civil procedure section is the exclusive remedy for obtaining review.the second paragraph provides for a waiver of filing fees and bonds,calendar preference,and prevailing party attorney fees to an applicant or recipient if he obtains a decision in his favor.ibid.these provisions are limited to the procedures to be followed in the judicial mandamus proceeding.it thus follows that the legislature intended the final sentence providing for prevailing party attorney fees would likewise be limited to fees incurred in the mandamus proceedings.
the legislative purpose of the statute supports this conclusion.as recognized by the california supreme court,the legislature enacted section to ensure access to the courts for individuals who are unlikely to have available resources to mount a judicial challenge we have previously described the purpose of section as ensuring that aggrieved parties have access to the judicial system to establish their statutory rights.the statutory elimination of filing fees and bond requirements,the preference in setting hearing dates,and the authorization of attorney fees and costs encourage such access.woods superior court of butte county cal d,italics added see tripp swoap cal d,overruled on another ground in frink prod cal d.forty years ago,this court similarly observed that the attorney fees provided for in section are to permit a claimant to establish his right to a statutory benefit that by its character is obtainable only by a needy person whose
