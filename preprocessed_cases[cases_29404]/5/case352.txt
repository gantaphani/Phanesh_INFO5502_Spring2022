opinion of the court 
at issue is whether the district court abused its discretion in assessing the reasonableness of attorneys fees requested by class counsel in a b securities class action.in all respects but one,the trial judge performed an exemplary analysis.but this factor requires that we vacate and remand.
this is an appeal in the rite aid corporation securities litigation,filed under the private securities litigation reform act of,et.class counsel in this complex b class action were successful in obtaining a settlement of million from outside auditors kpmg llp and former executives of rite aid.the kpmg settlement was one of the highest ever obtained from an accounting firm in a securities class action and resulted in the withdrawal of appeals from the previously negotiated million rite aid settlement.
the district court awarded class counsel,consisting of counsel berger montague,milberg weiss bershad schulman llp and other firms representing the class,million or of the kpmg settlement fund.the trial judge,who presided over both the rite aid and kpmg settlements,believed it would be hard to equal the skill class counsel demonstrated here.in re rite aid.secs,d,rite aid ii.the class appeared to agree.only two of the more than class members objected to the fee award.moreover,studies of comparable cases confirmed the requested fee percentage was within a reasonable range.for those reasons,the district court denied objector and unnamed class member walter kaufmann challenge to the requested fee award of million.id.at.
in the course of the litigation,there were two distinct,but with rite aid as the primary defendant,see in re rite aid.secs,d rite aid i,and one with kpmg as the primary defendant.see rite aid ii,d.the fee award in rite aid ii is under review,but rite aid i provides the necessary context,so we detail it briefly.
rite aid i 
the rite aid litigation commenced after public disclosures of disappointing earnings and a resulting drop in rite aid share price on march.law firms filed class actions against rite aid,its officers and directors,alleging,inter alia,violations of b of the securities exchange act of and rule.eventually on october,rite aid announced that its,and financial statements could no longer be relied upon,resulting in a reduction of rite aid previously reported earnings.
in june,the trial court appointed lead plaintiffs for the class and approved their selection of class counsel.the court also permitted the class to add rite aid outside auditor,kpmg,as a defendant.the complaint alleged rite aid published materially false financial statements,which kpmg erroneously stated were in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.after the suit was filed,the department of justice began its own investigation of rite aid accounting practices which,eighteen months later,resulted in criminal indictments against some rite aid officers.the securities and exchange commission also commenced an investigation of kpmg,although no criminal or civil charges were ever brought.
in december,class counsel negotiated a million cash and settlement with rite aid the settlement included rite aid and all its former officers and directors except former chief executive officer martin grass,former chief operating officer timothy noonan,and former chief financial officer frank bergonzi.the settlement reserved claims of the class and of rite aid against grass,noonan,and bergonzi,as well as against kpmg.
the notice of settlement,disseminated to potential class members,advised that class counsel would seek attorneys fees up to of the total recovery.there were no objections to the fee request.at the settlement fairness hearing,class counsel petitioned for a reduced fee award of of the total recovery.in june,the district court approved the settlement and a fee award of,or million.see rite aid i,d at.
rite aid ii 
in september,defendants kpmg and former rite aid officers appealed the rite aid i settlement,contending a provision of the settlement barring claims by parties against the settling defendants was overbroad.the appeal effectively halted distribution of the million partial settlement to class members.class counsel commenced protracted settlement negotiations with kpmg and the officers in early to.these negotiations culminated in the signing of a memorandum of understanding with kpmg in september and with the officers immediately before scheduled oral argument on the rite aid i appeal on september.concluding the settlement,however,proved difficult.in january,the district court ordered the parties to participate in mediation,which culminated in kpmg entering into a stipulation and agreement of settlement on march,
on march,and april,the district court gave preliminary approval to the settlements which included cash payments of million and withdrawal of all appeals in rite aid notice of the settlement was mailed to class members,advising that class counsel would request a fee of of the settlement fund.no class members objected to the settlement,but two members,including kaufmann,objected to the fee request.
following a fairness hearing on may,the district court overruled the objections and approved the settlement and fee request.see rite aid ii,d at.applying the factors announced in girsh jepson,cir,the district court found the proposed settlement to be fair and reasonable under all of the circumstances.rite aid ii,d at.with respect to class counsel fee request,the court found the declaration of professor john coffee,class counsel attorneys fees expert,most helpful in assessing the fee request reasonableness against the factors established in in re prudential ins,cir and gunter ridgewood energy,cir.rite aid ii,d at.relying on professor coffee findings,the court noted that statistical data from other class action settlements demonstrated an average percentage recovery of in securities class actions involving settlements greater than million a range of median rates from to over the course of a two year period in selected federal district courts and percentage recoveries between to were fairly standard in mega fund class actions involving settlements between and million.id.the court also found significant that only two class members objected to the fee amount and noted class counsel bore a risk of nonpayment in the event kpmg went out of business.id.at.the court found class counsel skill and efficiency in obtaining the settlement weighed in favor of approving the fee request,finding class counsel to be extraordinarily deft and efficient in handling this most complex matter and concluding it would be hard to equal the skill class counsel demonstrated here.id.at.performing a lodestar to confirm the fees reasonableness,the court found a handsome,yet fairly common lodestar multiplier of based upon hours billed since the fee application in rite aid i at an hourly rate of.id.at and.
for those reasons,the district court denied kaufmann objections and awarded class counsel the requested fees plus reimbursement of litigation expenses in the amount of.id.at.
kaufmann filed this timely appeal he objects to the fee award,contending the district court abused its discretion by awarding class counsel an unreasonable common fund percentage fee and failed to follow the proper standards for assessing attorneys fees.he also contends the district court violated the class rights to fifth amendment due process and to adequate representation under.by failing to appoint a guardian or fee award expert to counter class counsel expert declaration supporting their fee contention.
although an unnamed class member,kaufmann has standing to appeal,without first intervening.see devlin scardelletti,d holding that unnamed class members who object in a timely manner to approval of a settlement at a fairness hearing may appeal without first intervening see also bell atlantic bolger,cir holding that an unnamed plaintiff that did not intervene nonetheless had standing to appeal a class action settlement.the amendment to.added subsection e a,which allows a ny class member to object to a proposed settlement,voluntary dismissal,or compromise that requires court approval under rule e a.

kaufmann challenges the district court conclusion that the million fee request on the million rite aid ii settlement was reasonable.he contends the district court erred in assessing the fees reasonableness under our jurisprudence governing fee awards and should have applied a declining percentage sliding scale principle to reduce the to account for the magnitude of the settlement fund.he also contends the district court erred in calculating the lodestar multiplier using the hourly rates of the most senior lawyers on the case.
in assessing attorneys fees,courts typically apply either the method or the lodestar method.the method is generally favored in common fund cases because it allows courts to award fees from the fund in a manner that rewards counsel for success and penalizes it for failure.prudential,at internal quotations omitted.the lodestar method is more typically applied in statutory cases because it allows courts to reward counsel for undertaking socially beneficial litigation in cases where the expected relief has a small enough monetary value that a method would provide inadequate compensation or in cases where the nature of the recovery does not allow the determination of the settlement value required for application of the method.id.regardless of the method chosen,we have suggested it is sensible for a court to use a second method of fee approval to its initial fee calculation id.
consistent with past jurisprudence,the method was incorporated in the private securities litigation reform act of.a total attorneys fees and expenses awarded by the court to counsel for the plaintiff class shall not exceed a reasonable percentage of the amount of any damages and prejudgment interest actually paid to the class.nonetheless,we do not believe the private securities litigation reform act precludes the use of the lodestar method as a check on the calculation 
notwithstanding our deferential standard of review of fee determinations,we have required district courts to clearly set forth their reasoning for fee awards so that we will have a sufficient basis to review for abuse of discretion.see prudential,at gunter,at cendant prides,at.a district court should consider seven factors when analyzing a fee award in a common fund case 
the size of the fund created and the number of persons benefitted the presence or absence of substantial objections by members of the class to the settlement terms fees requested by counsel the skill and efficiency of the attorneys involved the complexity and duration of the litigation the risk of nonpayment the amount of time devoted to the case by plaintiffs counsel and the awards in similar cases.
gunter,at citing prudential,at in re gmc truck fuel tank prods.liab,cir cendant prides,at in re cendant,cir 
these fee award factors need not be applied in a formulaic way and in certain cases,one factor may outweigh the rest.gunter,at.in cases involving extremely large settlement awards,district courts may give these factors less weight.see prudential,at cendant,at.in cendant prides,we held that on the facts of that case,the most important factors were the awards in similar cases and the complexity and duration of the litigation.id.at 
in making its fee determination,the district court analyzed the requested fees under the factors outlined in prudential and gunter.rite aid ii,d at.but its fee analysis was somewhat abbreviated,undoubtedly because the district court addressed similar issues in its examination of the settlement fairness under the girsh factors in rite aid ii,id.at,and previously,in a similar fee award analysis in rite aid i,d at.though concise,the district court analysis nonetheless provides a sufficient basis for us to adequately review its award.that said,we remind the trial courts to engage in robust assessments of the fee award reasonableness factors when evaluating a fee request.see prudential,at remanding fee award determination b ecause the district court basis for,and calculation of,the appropriate fee percentage was unclear in light of the facts and cases it referenced,and because it should set forth a reasoned basis and conclusion regarding the proper percentage gunter,at stating if the district court opinion is so terse,vague,or conclusory that we have no basis to review it,we must vacate the order and remand for further proceedings cendant prides,at remanding for reevaluation of fee award where the district court brushed over our required analysis of the fee award factors and failed to make its reasoning and application of the jurisprudence clear internal quotations omitted.we reiterate that the proper standard of review is abuse of discretion.
size of the fund 
the district court found the size of the fund weighed in favor of approving the requested attorneys fees in discussing the settlement agreement merits in its girsh analysis,the court noted this was a rich settlement as measured against the many others involving auditors and recognized the settlement to be the third largest ever obtained from an accounting firm in a securities class action.rite aid ii,d at.
kaufmann,however,argues the district court overemphasized the importance of the fund size,ignoring that the size of the fund factor should receive less weight in mega fund cases.kaufmann contends the court should have applied a declining percentage sliding scale reduction in which fee awards decrease with the size of the settlement.he cites prudential,in which we agreed with the district court reduction of the percentage due to the size of the fund,explaining t he basis for this inverse relationship is the belief that in many instances the increase in recovery is merely a factor of the size of the class and has no direct relationship to the efforts of counsel.at internal quotations omitted.
our jurisprudence confirms that it may be appropriate for percentage fees awarded in large recovery cases to be smaller in percentage terms than those with smaller recoveries.see cendant,at noting several of our cases have stated that,ordinarily,the percentage of a recovery devoted to attorneys fees should decrease as the size of the overall settlement or recovery increases but there is no rule that a district court must apply a declining percentage reduction in every settlement involving a sizable fund.put simply,the declining percentage concept does not trump the analysis.we have generally cautioned against overly formulaic approaches in assessing and determining the amounts and reasonableness of attorneys fees.see cendant prides,at a district court may not rely on a formulaic application of the appropriate range in awarding fees but must consider the relevant circumstances of the particular case.
moreover,prudential does not mandate application of the declining percentage sliding scale.in prudential,we stated the reason courts apply the declining percentage principle is the belief that in many instances the increase in recovery is merely a factor of the size of the class and has no direct relationship to the efforts of counsel.at internal quotations omitted.in vacating the fee award of million on a settlement estimated at billion,id.at,much of our concern was case specific.in particular,we questioned such a sizable fee award when much of the settlement apparently resulted from the work of state regulators and a insurance task force.see id.at.here,in contrast,the district court found class counsel extraordinarily deft and efficient handling of this complex b matter resulted in a rich settlement.rite aid ii,d at.in short,the court found class counsel efforts played a significant role in augmenting and obtaining an immense fund.the court did not abuse its discretion in declining to apply a sliding scale reduction,nor in viewing the size of the fund to be a factor weighing in favor of approval of the fee request.
awards in similar cases 
in comparing this fee request to awards in similar cases,the district court found persuasive three studies referenced by professor coffee one study of securities class action settlements over million that found an average percentage fee recovery of a second study by the federal judicial center of all class actions resolved or settled over a period that found a median percentage recovery range of and a third study of class action settlements between million and million that found recoveries in the range were fairly standard.id.at.we see no abuse of discretion in the district court reliance on these studies.
kaufmann cites to certain decisions in which courts have found lower percentages or ratios in large fund cases.but most of the cases identified by kaufmann are easily distinguishable.citing cendant prides,he points out that our suggested lodestar multiplier of multiplier tied to the facts of that below the lodestar multiplier here of.cendant prides,however,was neither legally nor factually complex and the duration of the case from the filing of the amended complaint to the submission of a settlement agreement to the district court was only four months.at.
in cendant prides,the attorneys for the plaintiffs class filed a complaint accompanied by a motion for class certification,a motion for summary judgment,and a motion for preliminary injunctive relief and l ess than two months later the parties announced that they had reached an agreement in principle.at.because this occurred very early on in the litigation,discovery was virtually nonexistent and counsel only spent approximately hours on the action.id.at.in addition,the case was relatively simple in terms of proof,in that cendant had conceded liability and no risks pertaining to liability or collection were pertinent.id.at.moreover,there was a minimal amount of motion practice in cendant prides before settlement,counsel submitted only the complaint and three motions,all on the same day.id.at.these factors are absent in this case.we find no abuse of discretion in the district court comparison of this fee request to awards in other cases.
risk of nonpayment 
in assessing the risk of in its fee award analysis,the district court stated that while kpmg was in far better financial health than rite aid,the collapse of arthur andersen demonstrates that auditors can go out of business.rite aid ii,d at internal quotations omitted.moreover,the district court made several significant findings in assessing the risks of establishing liability under the girsh analysis that affect the risk of.because b requires proof that an accounting professional acted with knowledge recklessness,the court noted a successful outcome can never be regarded as a sure thing.id.at.the court explained a jury might well find that kpmg was itself misled by rite aid former management a finding supported by the fact the government has not indicted the firm,but indictments have been returned against grass and bergonzi.id.the court did not abuse its discretion in finding there were significant risks of or,which weighs in favor of approving the fee request.
class counsel skill and efficiency 
the district court,which supervised the litigation since its inception and was intimately familiar with class counsel performance,found the skill and competence of the attorneys weighed in favor of approving the requested fee award,noting class counsel were extraordinarily deft and efficient in handling this most complex matter.id.at.specifically,the court stated 
t hey were at least eighteen months ahead of the united states department of justice in ferreting out the conduct that ultimately resulted in the of over billion in previously reported rite aid earnings.their attention to detail was such that when rite aid financial concerns led to its willingness to consider renegotiating the portion of the rite aid i settlement,by investment advisors wilber ross and bear monetized the entire settlement and gained the class interest of when interest rates were the lowest they have been in over forty years.in short,it would be hard to equal the skill class counsel demonstrated here.
kaufmann contends attributing to class counsel the skill which enabled the class to obtain cash instead of securities and to receive a higher than money market rate of interest on the recovery,overlooks the role played by the expert investment advisors.but class counsel deserve credit for the role they played in directing the financial advisors.kaufmann also contends the government investigation,as opposed to any action by class counsel,ultimately caused kpmg to settle.but the government investigations never resulted in criminal or civil charges against kpmg and,as class counsel note,this may have hardened kpmg bargaining position.we see no abuse of discretion in the district court findings and its weighing this factor in favor of approving the requested fee percentage.
complexity,duration,and nature of the litigation 
in assessing the complexity,expense and likely duration of the litigation under the girsh factors,the district court found the litigation presented layers of factual and legal complexity which assured that,absent a global settlement,these disputes would take on dickensian dimensions.id.at.the court noted class counsel incurred many hours reviewing and analyzing hundreds of thousands of pages of documents produced by rite aid and kpmg,and dissecting rite aid financials and the results of internal investigations.id.internal quotations omitted.furthermore,the court noted the moving target nature of rite aid financial saga resulted in plaintiffs counsel preparing no less than four amended complaints.id.at.moreover,the court noted the litigation took several years,and the stipulation of settlement came about only with the assistance of mediation.id.at.also significant was the b scienter requirement,which the district court recognized may have been difficult to prove against outside auditors.see id.at.
given the complexity of the accounting matters at issue,the volume of documents,the shifting factual sands that required several amended complaints,the difficulties in proving scienter against an outside auditor,the duration of the litigation,and the necessity of resorting to mediation to reach a final settlement,we see no abuse of discretion in the district court finding the matter was a complex one.
absence of substantial objections by class members 
the class reaction to the fee request supports approval of the requested fees.notice of the fee request and the terms of the settlement were mailed to class members,and only two objected.we agree with the district court such a low level of objection is a rare phenomenon.id.at.moreover,as the court noted,a significant number of investors in the class were sophisticated institutional investors that had considerable financial incentive to object had they believed the requested fees were excessive.id.at and.the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding the absence of substantial objections by class members to the fee requests weighed in favor of approving the fee request.
in addition to the approach,we have suggested it is sensible for district courts to the percentage fee award against the lodestar method.prudential,at.here,it was proper for the district court to apply the method,with an abridged lodestar analysis serving as a.the l
