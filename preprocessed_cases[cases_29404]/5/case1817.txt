facts and procedural background 
galbiso complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief 
on december,galbiso filed a verified complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against opud based on asserted violations of the brown act and the public records act.according to the allegations,which we now summarize,galbiso was the owner of two parcels of land,referred to as parcels and,located within the geographical boundaries of opud.she purchased parcel in and the adjacent parcel in.in,opud established a special assessment district,known as the orosi sewer improvement district,to make improvements to its sewer system to be paid by special assessments against property owners who would benefit from the improvements.galbiso first learned of the special assessments shortly before completing her purchase of parcel in.galbiso believed the special assessments imposed against her property were unreasonable or unenforceable because they were based on a previous owner proposal to build a residential complex needing sewer hookups,which proposal had long since been abandoned and the land remained zoned for agricultural use.further,although opud charged her for sewer hookups,it allegedly could not actually provide sewer treatment capacity for that many residential units.after galbiso purchase of parcel,opud filed a lawsuit to judicially foreclose and sell parcels and for nonpayment of its special sewer assessments 
galbiso complaint in the present case further alleged that at a meeting of the opud board of directors held on november,before judgment had been entered in the pending foreclosure action,the members of the board of directors adopted a resolution to sell parcels and in a tax sale process for nonpayment of special assessments.the tax sale was to occur on january.the resolution,referred to as resolution,was allegedly with the number of votes to the meeting itself 
based on the above and other allegations,galbiso complaint proceeded to set forth the following causes of action 
first cause of action.in the first cause of action,galbiso claimed that resolution and the tax sale authorized thereby were null and void on the ground that the resolution was approved in violation of the requirements of the brown act,which statute provides,among other things,that a ll meetings of the legislative body or local agency shall be open and public,and all persons shall be permitted to attend any meeting of the legislative body of a local agency.in her prayer for relief,galbiso sought injunctive relief to prevent opud from taking further action to sell parcels and pending the outcome of appeal in the foreclosure action.
the specific violations of the brown act alleged in the first cause of action included the following resolution was allegedly moved,seconded and passed and votes recorded prior to the november,meeting at which it was supposed to be publicly considered,and the members of the board of directors admitted at the meeting they never saw the resolution even though their vote was recorded in favor of it and resolution was allegedly not the proper subject of a private,closed meeting.the first cause of action further alleged that opud improperly sought to sell galbiso property at a tax sale as a means of avoiding the jurisdiction of the court over the same dispute in the foreclosure action,including galbiso right of appeal therein.
second cause of action.in the second cause of action,galbiso sought injunctive relief to prohibit opud from continuing to violate the brown act.it incorporated the prior allegations and raised other violations of the brown act,including the following resolution was passed in a summary fashion at the november,meeting without allowing for public comment,in violation of sections and opud refused to let galbiso speak during the public comment portion of the november,meeting and called the police in an attempt to prevent her from speaking,in violation of section and opud held a closed session on november,regarding the sale of parcels and,but failed to make the necessary public disclosures.
third cause of action.galbiso third cause of action alleged that opud violated the public records act by denying to her the same access to public documents that other owners of property within the boundaries of opud would be entitled to.specifically,on several occasions opud superintendent,fred boyles,denied galbiso access to records by allegedly ordering her to leave opud office.galbiso sought an injunction to prohibit opud from denying or interfering with galbiso right under the public records act to inspect and copy such records.
fourth cause of action.under the fourth cause of action,entitled quiet title,galbiso sought a judgment that she was owner in fee simple of parcels and,and that opud had no right or interest therein.
fifth cause of action.the fifth cause of action for declaratory relief asserted,among other things,that t he disputes between galbiso and opud over special sewer assessments for which galbiso receives no sewer service is properly before the court in opud action for foreclosure and sale in orosi galbiso,appeal pending.italics added,underscoring omitted.a judicial determination was sought that said court jurisdiction can not be contravened by other attempts by opud to use other methods to sell parcels and in contravention thereof.additionally,galbiso prayed for a determination that she was owner in fee simple of parcels and and that opud lien was invalid.galbiso prayer for relief further requested that opud be enjoined from taking any action to enforce the special assessments on parcels and.
preliminary injunction issued on february,
on february,the trial court issued a preliminary injunction pending trial of this matter.the preliminary injunction enjoined opud from taking any action to commence or proceed with a tax sale of parcels and the trial court denied the request for preliminary injunction under the brown act because galbiso failed to adequately demonstrate that in the future she will not be permitted to speak during the public comment period at opud board meetings.the trial court granted galbiso request that opud be required to provide access to its public records,with the exception of records that come within the litigation exception to disclosure under the public records act.the trial court explained the litigation exception was narrow and only applied to documents that were specifically prepared for use in litigation.
demand for inspection and production of maps 
in her cause of action based on the public records act,galbiso alleged that fred boyles denied her access to public records when he ordered her on more than one occasion to leave opud office.by letter of december,approximately one week before galbiso filed her complaint,opud new counsel,carlson,notified galbiso counsel,roesti,that opud would produce documents requested under the public records act,unless exempt from production,provided that galbiso submitted her document request in writing.according to carlson,extensive efforts were made afterwards to respond to various public records act requests by galbiso.however,it was later admitted by fred boyles that he asked galbiso to leave the opud office after galbiso repeatedly and loudly requested that he produce documents which he did not produce based on his understanding of advice of counsel.
on july,roesti made a written public records act request to opud on galbiso behalf,seeking,among other things,plans,drawings,diagrams and maps of the opud sewer pipes as they existed prior to and after the formation of the sewer special improvement district.opud responded that all maps,drawings,plans and specifications regarding the special sewer improvement district had been made available and opud does not have a specific before and after map.galbiso then brought a motion to allow the deposition of opud engineer,dennis keller,after the discovery cutoff date pursuant to code of civil procedure sections,and the trial court granted the motion.according to roesti,keller produced a map at his october deposition that opud claimed did not exist,showing sewer pipes before and after the sewer improvements.the purported map was not part of the record on appeal.
d.the settlement agreement 
on november,the parties met with judge lloyd hicks in a settlement conference and a settlement agreement was reached in open court.the relevant terms of the settlement,as expressly recited on the record,were as follows 
opud agrees not to take any action to commence or proceed with a tax sale of parcels and or to interfere with,encumber,or attempt to enforce any special assessment on parcels and that is subject to judgment on appeal in orosi versus galbiso,tulare county superior court case number during the pendency of its appeal.

opud agrees that it will not interfere with,attempt to deny,or attempt to censor galbiso right to speak as allowed by law at its regular meetings on nonagenda items during the time for public comment and for the amount of time allowed each speaker.
pursuant to government code section,comments at special meetings are limited to the subject of the special meetings.

opud agrees that at the end of a closed session,it will immediately reconvene a public session,at which it will announce in public those actions taken which the law requires to be reported out.
opud agrees to rewrite its agenda description regarding public comments so that the agenda description clearly notifies the public of the time allowed for comment.
opud agrees to allow galbiso access to its public records in accordance with opud public records request policy under the public records act,unless the record comes under the litigation exemption to disclosure under government code section subdivision b,which only exempts documents specifically prepared for litigation,or unless the record comes within any other exemption allowed by law.
the issue of attorneys fees and costs shall be submitted to the court in a motion for fees and costs,at which either party may raise any argument for or against fees and costs to galbiso or opud.
upon determination of the motion for fees and costs,galbiso shall dismiss this complaint with prejudice.
this agreement and the terms of the agreement shall have no other effect on any other litigation between galbiso and opud.
it is expressly agreed that the fact the parties reached this settlement agreement and the terms of this settlement agreement can not and should not be construed as an admission or indication on the part of opud that they have in any way acted in a careless,negligent,or otherwise improper manner or failed to do anything set forth in the allegations contained in the complaint on file in this litigation.
galbiso agrees,therefore,this settlement is not and shall not be treated as an admission of liability on the part of opud regarding any of the allegations and prayers of the complaint or terms of this settlement in this matter.
however,it is understood that independent of this settlement agreement,galbiso and opud may,for the purposes of the fee and cost motion,identify by declaration those facts that support or oppose any fee or cost motion.
galbiso motion for attorney fees 
on december,galbiso filed her motion for attorney fees.the motion was made on the ground that she was the prevailing party under the brown act and the public records act,and that both statutes have provisions authorizing the recovery of attorney fees to a prevailing party.in support of the motion,roesti attached a number of exhibits to his declaration in an effort to establish that galbiso had in fact prevailed in her claims under the brown act and the public records act.
on december,opud filed its declarations and points and authorities in opposition to the attorney fees motion.opud asserted that galbiso was not a prevailing party,but merely succeeded in obtaining an agreement by opud to follow the law,which opud was doing anyway.opud opposition asserted that it had not violated the relevant statutes in any substantive way,and even if there arguably had been some minor shortfalls,they were cured before the litigation was filed.thus,according to opud,an award of attorney fees under either the brown act or the public records act was unwarranted.
the trial court denied galbiso motion for attorney fees.the trial court explained at the hearing on january,that it denied a recovery of attorney fees under the brown act because no violation had been established.the trial court further explained that it denied a recovery of attorney fees under the public records act because,even though galbiso prevailed on her denial of access theory,it was not shown that the lawsuit resulted in opud releasing a copy of a previously withheld document.thereafter,galbiso filed a motion for reconsideration,which was also denied.galbiso timely appeal followed.
discussion 
in her appeal,galbiso contends the trial court abused its discretion when it decided that she was not entitled to an award of attorney fees under the brown act and the public records act.she further contends the trial court abused its discretion when it denied her motion for reconsideration.we now consider these contentions.
attorney fees under the brown act 
we begin with galbiso claim that the trial court erred when it denied her motion for attorney fees under the brown act.
overview of brown act 
the brown act requires that most meetings of a local agency legislative body be open to the public for attendance by all.los angeles times communications los angeles county bd.of supervisors th,d.its objectives include facilitating public participation in local government decisions and curbing misuse of the democratic process by secret legislation.fischer los angeles unified school dist.th,d.the legislature declared its intent in enacting the brown act as follows in enacting this chapter,the legislature finds and declares that the public commissions,boards and councils and the other public agencies in this state exist to aid in the conduct of the people business.it is the intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly.the people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies which serve them.the people,in delegating authority,do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know.the people insist on remaining informed so that they may retain control over the instruments they have created.
to implement these important legislative purposes,section provides that a ll meetings of the legislative body of a local agency shall be open and public,and all persons shall be permitted to attend any meeting of the legislative body of a local agency,except as otherwise provided in this chapter,subd.a.the same section states that n o legislative body shall take action by secret ballot,whether preliminary or final,subd.c.to ensure a right of public comment,section provides that at regular meetings,members of the public shall be given an opportunity to directly address the legislative body on any item of interest to the public within the subject matter jurisdiction of the legislative body,before or during the legislative body consideration of the item,and at special meetings on any item that is described in the notice for the meeting,before or during the consideration of that item,subd.a.although a legislative body may reasonably regulate and limit the amount of time allocated to each speaker,it must ensure that the right of public comment is carried out,subd.b and may not prohibit public criticism of the policies or actions of the legislative body,subd.c.
the brown act expressly allows a legislative body to consider certain matters in closed session,such as discussions with legal counsel regarding pending litigation see trancas property owners city of malibu th,d settlement agreement discussed and agreed to in closed session and sensitive employment or personnel issues,subd.b.section seeks to curb the misuse of closed sessions.subdivision a of section states that p rior to holding any closed session,the legislative body of the local agency shall disclose,in an open meeting,the item or items to be discussed in the closed session.subdivision b of section states that a fter any closed session,the legislative body shall reconvene into open session prior to adjournment and shall make any disclosures required by section of action taken in the closed session.
finally,recourse to the courts for judicial relief is authorized in the event a legislative body violates the brown act.section,subdivision a,provides that any interested person may commence an action by mandamus,injunction or declaratory relief for the purpose of stopping or preventing violations or threatened violations of this chapter by members of the legislative body of a local agency section,subdivision a,provides that any interested person may commence an action by mandamus or injunction for the purpose of obtaining a judicial determination that an action taken by a legislative body of a local agency in violation of section,or is null and void under this section.
attorney fees statute and standard of review 
the brown act gives discretion to the trial court to award attorney fees.the operative provision,section,states in relevant part as follows 
a court may award court costs and reasonable attorney fees to the plaintiff in an action brought pursuant to section or where it is found that a legislative body of the local agency has violated this chapter.the costs and fees shall be paid by the local agency and shall not become a personal liability of any public officer or employee of the local agency.italics added.
a condition precedent to a plaintiff recovery of such attorney fees and costs is a violation of the brown act.bell vista unified school dist.th,d.where a violation of the brown act is found,an award of attorney fees is not mandatory,but is entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial court.frazer dixon unified school dist.th,d.in exercising its discretion as to whether to award fees under this provision,the trial court should consider among other matters the necessity for the lawsuit,lack of injury to the public,the likelihood the problem would have been solved by other means and the likelihood of recurrence of the unlawful act in the absence of the lawsuit.citations.bell vista unified school,supra,at,d.although a fee award is not mandatory,the discretion of the trial court to deny fees to a successful plaintiff is fairly narrow.t he trial court has the discretion to deny successful brown act plaintiffs their attorneys fees,but only if the defendant shows that special circumstances exist that would make such an award unjust.los angeles times communications los angeles county bd.of supervisors,supra,th at,d.
a trial court exercise of discretion concerning an award of attorney fees will not be reversed unless there is a manifest abuse of discretion.plcm group,drexler cal th,d.an abuse of discretion occurs if,in light of the applicable law and considering all of the relevant circumstances,the court decision exceeds the bounds of reason and results in a miscarriage of justice.mejia city of los angeles th,d.
when two or more inferences can reasonably be deduced from the evidence,the reviewing court has no authority to substitute its decision for that of the trial court.shamblin brattain cal d.in this connection we employ the equivalent of the substantial evidence test by accepting the trial court resolution of credibility and conflicting substantial evidence,and its choice of possible reasonable inferences.in re executive life ins.th,d.even though contrary findings could have been made,an appellate court should defer to the factual determinations made by the trial court when the evidence is in conflict.this is true whether the trial court ruling is based on oral testimony or declarations.shamblin brattain,supra.
trial court denial of attorney fees under the brown act was based on erroneous finding of no violation 
the trial court found that no violation of the brown act occurred and therefore denied galbiso request for an award of attorney fees under that statute.we disagree with the trial court finding that no violation was shown.in at least two respects,the uncontroverted evidence revealed clear violations of the brown act by opud.hence,the trial court order must be reversed and remanded for further proceedings on the issue of attorney fees under the brown act.we now explain our conclusions.
we begin by briefly noting the aspects of the trial court ruling that were supported by substantial evidence,and thus were not an abuse of discretion even if contrary findings could have been made.with regard to opud use of a preprinted form to memorialize its adoption of resolution,the trial court accepted as reasonable the explanation offered by opud,that the resolution was typed in advance of the meeting as a convenience only and that the inclusion in the pretyped form of specific voting information such as who made and seconded the motion and the votes cast was an inadvertent error.the trial court determination of this issue was supported by the fact that resolution was in identical form,including the voting information,to resolution that had been previously voted on by the opud board at a prior meeting.under the circumstances,it was a reasonable inference that the voting information was inadvertently carried over from the prior version as a clerical error.
with regard to galbiso allegation that the action described in resolution was taken in a closed session,the trial court found that it was simply not borne out by the record.in fact,as pointed out by counsel for opud at the fee hearing,the transcript of the november,meeting clearly reflected that the resolution was passed in public session the trial court so held,and its assessment of the meeting was adequately supported by the record.
in regard to other brown act issues,however,the trial court erred.at the heart of galbiso claim under the brown act was her allegation that opud denied or interfered with her right to speak at opud board meetings.the trial court held there was no violation of galbiso right to public comment under the brown act because she actually succeeded in speaking a number of times at the november,meeting,and because she was only told to refrain from speaking when her public comments related to matters that the opud board was entitled to address in a closed session,the parties pending litigation 
addressing the second point first,we conclude the trial court erred in its interpretation of the right to make public comment under the brown act.section,subdivision a,provides every agenda for regular meetings shall provide an opportunity for members of the public to directly address the legislative body on any item of interest to the public,before or during the legislative body consideration of the item,that is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the legislative body this language has been construed to mean that for each agenda of a regular meeting,there must be a period of time provided for general public comment on any matter within the subject matter jurisdiction of the legislative body,as well as an opportunity for public comment on each specific agenda item as it is taken up by the body.chaffee san francisco library commission th,d.in regard to special meetings,an opportunity for public comment must be provided for members of the public to directly address the legislative body concerning any item that has been described in the notice for the meeting before or during consideration of that item,subd.a.
assuming that public comments are within the parameters described in section with respect to regular or special meetings,there is no provision in the brown act that we are aware of that would allow a legislative body to prohibit a member of the public from making public comments at the appropriate time during a public meeting merely because the comments would likely relate to pending litigation.it is true that section permits a legislative body to hold a closed session in order to privately discuss pending litigation with its legal counsel when it is deemed necessary to do so.however,we must construe the exceptions to the open meeting provisions of the brown act narrowly and the provisions calling for open meetings and public participation broadly to effectuate the important purposes of the brown act.shapiro san diego city council th,d san diego union city council d.thus,the fact that the public body is entitled to meet and confer privately with its attorney to discuss legal issues and receive confidential legal advice in connection with pending litigation does not preclude a member of the public from expressing comments or concerns relating to the pending litigation during a public session.
we note,concerning an analogous provision of the brown act authorizing closed sessions to discuss personnel matters,it has been held w hile the brown act permits governing bodies to hold closed sessions about personnel matters,nowhere does it grant those bodies the exceedingly broader authority to silence public speech that may also touch upon related employment issues.as noted above,the sections of the brown act that require the board to hold public meetings grant the public a right to speak on any item of interest to the public that is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the board,without exception.leventhal vista unified school dist,accord,morrow los angeles unified school dist.th,d.similarly here,opud ability to go into a private,closed session as needed to consult with its attorney on pending litigation did not trump galbiso right to make public comments at opud public meetings on matters related to the same pending litigation.
we agree with the general proposition expressed by the trial court that an individual may not,under the guise of exercising his or her right to make a public comment,force a legislative body in open session to then and there engage in public settlement discussions with him or her concerning pending litigation when the legislative body is entitled to meet in closed session with its attorney to privately consider and discuss any settlement proposals.while this proposition is no doubt correct,and hence the legislative body would not be required to respond in open session to such settlement proposals,that does not mean it may prohibit the individual from presenting his or her public comments simply because the comments relate to pending litigation or a possible basis for settlement thereof 
yet that was precisely what opud did,as the record plainly shows.prior to the november,meeting,galbiso sent a letter to fred boyles asking for an opportunity to discuss her settlement proposal regarding the foreclosure action,and also requesting that opud take specific action at its november,meeting to guarantee reserve sewer capacity for all sewer connections that she was being assessed for on parcels and.a similar letter was sent on behalf of galbiso by roesti to sullivan,indicating that galbiso would be attending the november,meeting and that she would speak concerning the sewer capacity issue.by these letters,the opud board was apprised that galbiso would attempt to speak at the november,meeting on issues related to the pending litigation.
the agenda for the november,meeting specified that the time for public comment on any item not appearing on the agenda was at the beginning of the meeting.however,the transcript of the meeting reveals that although opud was willing to allow galbiso to speak regarding a specific agenda item,resolution,which would authorize a tax sale of parcels and,she was instructed to refrain from making any public comment on issues concerning the parties pending litigation.in fact,when sullivan ascertained that galbiso remarks during the public comment period were related to pending litigation and that galbiso insisted on her right to speak on that subject,he directed that the sheriff be called and the meeting was abruptly recessed to await the arrival of a sheriff deputy.when a member of the public asked why galbiso did not have a right to make public comments,sullivan responded that it was because what she wants to talk about we are in litigation over.similarly,in a letter sent to galbiso attorney prior to the january,meeting of opud board,opud new attorney,carlson,stated that a ny attempts by galbiso or others to raise these issues or any other issues related to the pending litigation involving galbiso and opud at the january,meeting will be deemed disruptive and those persons will be asked to leave.at the january,meeting,when galbiso was about to begin her public comments,carlson warned galbiso that although general comments may be presented,y ou can not talk about your ongoing litigation.we conclude,for the reasons explained above,that these actions by opud to prevent galbiso from expressing public comments constituted a violation of the brown act provisions.
the trial court determination that there was no brown act violation was made on the additional ground that galbiso was able to speak several times at the november,meeting.we disagree.our review of the transcript of the november,meeting only confirms the fact that opud violated the brown act.as explained,the brown act required that opud provide an opportunity at the november,meeting for members of the public to comment on any item within its subject matter jurisdiction.contrary to this requirement,galbiso was told that she could not make any public comment that related to her pending litigation.when she insisted on her right to do so,the sheriff was summoned by opud and the meeting was temporarily stopped.during the interlude,there was a brief exchange between galbiso and sullivan,primarily in response to inquiries by the sheriff deputy,in which galbiso was able to briefly explain the nature of her proposed comments.when the meeting was resumed,the president of the board proceeded to specific agenda items without providing galbiso an opportunity to state her public comments regarding the pending litigation.later,following a closed session,the meeting got out of control when galbiso and others in the audience realized that opud summarily voted on resolution to proceed with a tax sale of galbiso two parcels at a time when galbiso and others were not aware of it,and without any invitation for public comment on that agenda item.most of galbiso comments at the meeting were in the nature of demands for an explanation after the summary vote on resolution occurred.contrary to the trial court ruling,we do not believe that these incidents,considered in isolation or cumulatively,could reasonably be viewed as showing that opud complied with the public comment requirements of the brown act.
finally,a review of the transcript of the november,hearing shows that the opud board went into closed session in violation of the disclosure requirements of section.that section provides that p rior to holding any closed session,the legislative body of the local agency shall disclose,in an open meeting,the item or items to be discussed in the closed session,subd.a.although the opud board referred to the item numbers on the agenda that would be taken up in closed session,such reference was inadequate because the agenda description of the items was not in substantial compliance with section,and because prior to going into closed session to discuss pending litigation pursuant to section,a public body is required to publicly state the title of or otherwise specifically identify the litigation to be discussed,unless the body states that to do so would jeopardize the agency ability to effectuate service of process or that to do so would jeopardize its ability to conclude existing settlement negotiations to its advantage.no such disclosure ever occurred.thus,opud failed to make the required public disclosures prior to going into a closed session at the board meeting on november.this constituted an additional violation of the brown act that was established by uncontroverted evidence in connection with galbiso attorney fees motion.
in conclusion,we hold that the trial court erred in its determination that no brown act violation was shown.as discussed above,galbiso established that opud violated the brown act by failure to provide an opportunity for public comment,and failure to make the required disclosures prior to going into closed session.since the trial court assumed that no violation occurred,it never properly exercised its discretion whether to grant attorney fees to galbiso as a prevailing party.we therefore remand the matter to the trial court to consider whether to award attorney fees and costs to galbiso on her brown act claims pursuant to section.
in so doing,the trial court should consider among other matters the necessity for the lawsuit,lack of injury to the public,the likelihood the problem would have been solved by other means and the likelihood of recurrence of the unlawful act in the absence of the lawsuit.citations.bell vista unified school,supra,th at,d.t he trial court has the discretion to deny successful brown act plaintiffs their attorneys fees,but only if the defendant shows that special circumstances exist that would make such an award unjust.los angeles times communications los angeles county bd.of supervisors,supra,th at,d.

we now consider galbiso contention that the trial court improperly denied her request for attorney fees under the public records act.
