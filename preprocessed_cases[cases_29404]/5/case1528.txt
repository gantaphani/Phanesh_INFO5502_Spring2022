the director of the office of personnel management opm petitions this court pursuant to d for review of the final decision of the merit systems protection board mspb or board,nos,interpreting m to authorize an award of attorney fees to a prevailing employee who is found to be substantially innocent of charges made by the office of special counsel osc in a complaint to the board.because we conclude that the board acted permissibly and lawfully in adopting the substantially innocent standard,we affirm.
in,the osc,an independent agency authorized to investigate and prosecute allegations of prohibited personnel practices,filed a complaint against federal employees frank santella and joseph jech,charging retaliation in violation of the whistleblower protection act the wpa,b.the charges against santella and jech collectively santella were initially sustained by the mspb chief administrative law judge hereinafter administrative judge.however,due to the intervening decision of this court in eidmann merit systems protection board,holding that the significant factor rather than the contributing factor standard applies to osc disciplinary actions that allege violations of the wpa,the board vacated the administrative judge initial recommended decision and remanded the case for a new determination under the appropriate standard.special counsel santella,santella i.the board also directed that additional findings be made with respect to certain issues.id.at.on remand,the administrative judge made the factual findings directed by the board and,applying the correct significant factor standard,concluded that none of the four counts charged in the osc complaint could be sustained.the board adopted the second recommended decision and dismissed osc complaint.special counsel santella,santella ii.
santella subsequently filed a motion pursuant to m contending that he was entitled to attorney fees because he was the prevailing party and had been proven substantially innocent of the charges.the administrative judge,in an addendum initial decision,awarded a portion of the attorney fees sought.osc filed a petition for review,arguing for a narrower standard that would make it more difficult for prevailing parties to qualify for attorney fees.the board affirmed the administrative judge decision as modified,holding that a prevailing employee found substantially innocent of the charges against him in an osc disciplinary action may be awarded attorney fees under m.santella special counsel,santella iii.
in reaching its determination,the board recognized that m specifically required that,in order to establish entitlement to attorney fees,the prevailing party must demonstrate that the fees are warranted in the interest of justice.santella iii,at.based largely on the fact that the language of m is virtually identical to that of another attorney fee provision administered by the g the board reasoned that it was appropriate to look to the manner in which warranted in the interest of justice had been construed in the context of section g as a guide for defining the identical language in section m.thus,it concluded that the substantially innocent category,adopted in allen united states postal service,mspb,for cases arising under g,is applicable to cases arising under m.santella iii,at.accordingly,because it found santella to be a prevailing party as well as substantially innocent,the board upheld the grant of attorney fees.id.at.
after the board denied opm petition for reconsideration,santella special counsel,santella iv,opm petitioned this court for review pursuant to d.by order dated february,this court granted review.

the crux of opm argument on appeal is that the board unlawfully construed m by concluding that the substantially innocent category articulated in allen united states postal service,mspb,in the context of g,is an appropriate standard for determining whether a grant of attorney fees is warranted in the interest of justice.in essence,opm advocates a more stringent test here,which would make it much more difficult for prevailing parties to qualify for attorney fees.in the course of making this argument,opm challenges the adequacy and correctness of the board basic statutory construction analysis,and then goes on to offer several more specific arguments as to why,in its view,the board ultimate conclusion can not be sustained.thus,we begin with a discussion and analysis of the statute and the board statutory construction before turning to opm more specific arguments.
as noted above,section m was enacted as part of the osc reauthorization act.this section provides that 
except as provided in paragraph of this subsection,the board,or an administrative law judge or other employee of the board designated to hear a case arising under section,may require payment by the agency involved of reasonable attorney fees incurred by an employee or applicant for employment if the employee or applicant is the prevailing party and the board,administrative law judge,or other employee as the case may be determines that payment by the agency is warranted in the interest of justice,including any case in which a prohibited personnel practice was engaged in by the agency or any case in which the agency action was clearly without merit.
m emphasis added.
the language of this provision is virtually identical to that of g,which authorizes attorney fees to prevailing employees who successfully challenge certain adverse actions taken by their employing agencies in dispute here is the proper interpretation and application of the phrase warranted in the interest of justice,which,along with being a prevailing party,is one of the two statutory criteria for the award of attorney fees under both sections g and m.the phrase warranted in the interest of justice is not statutorily defined as to either provision.
the board summarized its reasons for concluding that allen substantially innocent category could be applied to section m in santella iv as follows 
in the reauthorization act,congress enacted an attorney fees provision for osc disciplinary actions that is substantially identical to the attorney fees provision applicable to cases arising under the board appellate jurisdiction.compare m with g.generally,words or phrases in a statutory provision that were used in a prior act pertaining to the same subject matter will be construed in the same sense.marks united states.sutherland stat.const.ed.congress is presumed to have been aware of the existing interpretations of section g when it enacted section m.lorillard pons,d.further,the legislative history of the new attorney fees provision identified section g as the model for that provision.
santella iv,at.
from this analysis,the board concluded that the substantially innocent standard that had been adopted in the context of section g provides an appropriate basis for an award of fees under the interest of justice requirement in section m.id.at.in doing so,however,the board clarified that it did not mean to suggest that the board will automatically apply every interpretation of the interest of justice standard under section g to cases under section m.
we conclude that the statutory construction does not preclude the application of the allen categories to cases brought under section m.as noted above,the phrase warranted in the interest of justice is not statutorily defined,and this phrase might therefore appropriately be subject to any number of different interpretations and applications.however,as the board noted,we can not ignore the fact that congress,in enacting section m,chose to use language that is virtually identical to that of section g thus,although we do not conclude that congress intended to dictate that the two provisions be applied in precisely the same manner,there is certainly nothing to suggest that congress intended to preclude this outcome.therefore,in our view,in enacting section m congress left the precise definition and application of warranted in the interest of justice to the board discretion.we accord deference in this particular case to the board interpretation of a statutory provision authorizing it to grant attorney fees.we therefore apply that deference as we turn to opm more specific challenges and consider whether the board decision was reasonable and permissible.
opm makes three principal,and to a certain extent overlapping,arguments as to why the board application of the substantially innocent category from the allen framework to section m was erroneous first,opm contends that the contexts in which sections m and g apply are so fundamentally different that the board was precluded from adopting the significantly innocent standard of section g for application to section m.second,opm argues that,in the context of osc disciplinary actions,the prerequisites for a finding of substantial innocence which under allen satisfies the warranted in the interest of justice be identical to those necessary to demonstrate prevailing party status.thus,according to opm,the result is an unlawful conflation of the distinct statutory requirements that an employee be a prevailing party and that an award of attorney fees be warranted in the interest of justice.third,opm argues that application of the substantially innocent standard will chill enforcement of the wpa by subjecting osc to potential liability for attorney fees,thereby contravening congress intent in enacting the osc reauthorization act of ensuring vigorous enforcement.
in an additional fourth contention,opm,in reasoning first fully articulated at oral argument,argues that employees who succeed in defending osc enforcement actions can not,as a matter of law,be prevailing parties because the board failure to sustain charges does not result in the type of material alteration in the legal relationship between the charged employee and osc that is necessary to permit an award of attorney fees.see buckhannon bd.care home.dep t of health human,d articulating this requirement.we address these arguments in turn.
on appeal,opm first contends that the board erred in adopting the substantially innocent allen criterion because the board did not sufficiently take into account the materially different contexts in which sections g and m apply.opm main assertion in support of its argument appears to be that the board viewed the language of the two statutes in a vacuum,overlooking the materially different contexts within the civil service system in which these two statutes operate,resulting in the board adoption of an unlawful standard.
we conclude that opm has failed to demonstrate that the differences between cases brought under section g and those brought under section m preclude application of the substantially innocent standard in section m cases.we agree with the board that,while osc interests in bringing a disciplinary proceeding under differ somewhat from the interests of an employing agency,the nature of charges an employing agency brings against its own employee may be quite similar to the nature of charges osc may bring.santella iii,at.we find that,after analyzing the various similarities and differences between the actions brought by employing agencies and well as osc distinct role in the civil service board reasonably concluded that the differences were not sufficiently significant to preclude application of the substantially innocent allen category.id.at.we therefore reject opm arguments to the contrary.
we also reject opm related argument that the board was required to adopt a different standard here because its precedents demonstrate a practice of modifying its application of allen to fit the unique characteristics of certain types of cases.opm relies on,inter alia,cases in which the board has recognized that the concept of substantial innocence is inapplicable in the appeal context,where no charges of misconduct are leveled against the employee.opm also cites cases in which the board ruled that it would interpret the warranted in the interest of justice language of section g differently in certain actions,such as disability retirement cases,when the employee has brought the burden of litigation on himself 
we are not persuaded that the board modification of how it applies allen in the cases cited by opm precludes it from applying the substantially innocent standard in section m cases.unlike the appeals in which an employee guilt or innocence is simply not a rendering an inquiry into substantial innocence osc disciplinary action is based on charges of malfeasance of which the employee must be found either guilty or innocent to resolve the case.also,because osc initiates disciplinary actions,it is impossible for employees to be responsible for the costs of litigation in the same manner as the disability retirement cases cited by opm.additionally,osc disciplinary actions clearly have the potential to force employees to defend themselves against unsubstantiated accusations,imposing precisely the type of burden that is intended to ameliorate.accordingly,we find that the board correctly concluded that the cases cited by opm do not require that the board abandon or modify the substantially innocent category in the manner urged by opm therefore,we reject opm arguments to the contrary.
for the same reasons,we reject opm further argument that the board was required to adopt a more stringent standard in section m cases,such as the the standard applicable in title vii cases or under the equal access to justice act moreover,we find that the attorney fee provisions cited by opm as providing more appropriate standards are so different from section m in both language and purpose that the board acted reasonably in declining to adopt a standard derived from one of these other provisions.
we next address opm second and related contention that the board application of the substantially innocent standard to section m necessarily collapses the distinction between the statutory requirement that an employee be a prevailing party and the separate statutory requirement that a fee award be warranted in the interest of justice.opm argues that because osc disciplinary actions are all or nothing propositions,without the possibility of partial victories or mitigation of penalties,an employee can not prevail in such actions without also being automatically found substantially innocent.thus,opm asserts that,by conflating these two statutory requirements,the board interpretation effectively renders superfluous the warranted in the interest of justice requirement of section m,thereby violating the general rule against construing a statute in a way that renders one of its parts inoperative.see,duncan walker,d counseling against statutory constructions that have this effect.
we find opm argument unpersuasive for at least two reasons.first,osc clearly may bring multiple charges against an employee in an enforcement action.it is not clear to this court why in cases where osc brings multiple charges it is not even at least some charges will sometimes be sustained when others are not,resulting in only a partial victory for the charged employee that would not automatically result in either prevailing party status or a finding of substantial innocence.opm has not explained why the board decision would preclude an employee from being found to be a prevailing party but not substantially innocent in such cases.
in addition to the possibility of such partial victories,the board in its brief points to precedents of this court demonstrating various circumstances in which an employee might be found to be a prevailing party but not substantially innocent.for example,in sterner department
