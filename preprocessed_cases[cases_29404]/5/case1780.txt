appellant argues the awards of monetary sanctions and fees are unsupported by statutory authority or the record,in the form of a proven violation of an existing lawful court order,as opposed to a different finding by the probate court of her violation of a rule of professional conduct that could lead to attorney disciplinary proceedings,bus,et under all the relevant circumstances,we agree that the probate court failed to follow proper procedures in giving notice of the proposed sanctions and in awarding them for the express or implied reasons disclosed by the record.the orders are legally unsupportable and must be reversed with directions.
factual and procedural background 
the background facts for this continuing proceeding are well known to the court and parties,and since the merits of the conservatorship issues are not before us,only a brief summary need be given here.we previously issued an unpublished opinion in conservatorship of becerra,wl,the conservatorship case,describing his brain injury sustained in an industrial accident.we also concurrently resolved an appeal in a related case involving the removal of appellant as trustee of a trust holding his personal injury settlement proceeds donnelly negrete,wl nonpub.opn.in another nonpublished opinion,conservatorship of becerra june,wl,we upheld an attorney fees award to the caa,payable from the trust.all these are referred to as our previous opinions.
the original petition for conservatorship was filed in november by vida negrete,a professional fiduciary and the client of appellant referred to here as negrete.by court appointment,the caa began to appear for conservatee in february.eventually,in march,negrete withdrew her petition,but after contested proceedings by a different petitioner who was supported by different family members,gerry donnelly was appointed as conservator.the court then appointed donnelly to replace negrete as trustee of conservatee assets.while those hearings were still going on,the events giving rise to these sanctions orders took place.
on april,appellant,acting for negrete,attended a hearing on her motion to have an expert witness appointed to determine conservatee true preferences and wishes.at that time,the other conservatorship petition was still pending,and the caa had filed a report dated march,for a proposed hearing of march,which had been continued until april.there were conflicting expert opinions on the extent to which a conservatorship should be established,based on the mental state of conservatee,who was consenting to the procedure in general,but remained unclear about who he wanted to act as his conservator.at the april hearing,the court denied appellant request on behalf of negrete to have the expert witness appointed,ruling there was no justification for the expense and no current contested trial set.another conservatorship hearing was scheduled for april.
on april,the caa filed a supplemental report for the april hearing,stating that at the april hearing,appellant had contacted conservatee without obtaining permission from his attorney,the caa,although the caa had requested that all contacts with him be made through her.appellant had obtained translations into spanish of the conservatorship reports and showed them to conservatee,since she disagreed with them,and she did so without the consent or knowledge of the caa.the caa contended in her supplemental report that this conduct interfered with her representation of conservatee,and therefore she requested an order to show cause for sanctions or a contempt ruling,on the grounds that appellant had violated rules of professional conduct in that manner.rule a.
at the april hearing,the caa explained to the probate court that conservatee was present at the courthouse but was staying out in the hall and did not want to attend the hearing,because he was frustrated and upset by being questioned by appellant and other family members,so that he did not feel the caa was protecting him.
based on the caa representations at the april hearing about appellant contacts with conservatee,the court judge brown announced that an order to show cause regarding sanctions against appellant would be heard may,and that opposition would be allowed.on april,the court clerk served two written notices of the order to show cause regarding sanctions,citing sections.both orders were dated april and signed by judge cline.one order was printed on a court form and stated that the hearing would be held in department judge cline,but it did not fill in the blanks regarding the basis for the sanctions.the typed order gave similarly general notice,except that the matter would be heard in department judge brown regarding the issuance of sanctions.other hearings on the conservatorship issues were set for april and may,as shown by augmented material in the record.
meanwhile,beginning may,appellant was making efforts to disqualify judge brown,pursuant to section,contending in her statement that his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.on may,judge brown struck the statement of disqualification for lack of service in accordance with the statutory requirements or for an inadequate showing of legal grounds for disqualification.most of the record in this case is supplied as exhibits to appellant statements of disqualification.
on may,appellant filed her opposition to the sanctions request,arguing that the notices of hearing were defective because they were blank with regard to the reasons sanctions were being considered.she also contended that no specific orders had been violated,and her acts of advocacy as counsel were not properly the subjects of sanctions under section.in response,the caa filed objections to the opposition,relying on section and claiming that appellant was making it difficult for her to represent conservatee,appellant must have known the reasons for her sanctions request,and appellant had harassed her by filing and serving a state bar complaint against her,in retaliation.the caa submitted a fees request for hours of time at per hour.see also.
