the governing board of selma community hospital also sch terminated the hospital privileges of brenton smith,and smith filed a petition for writ of mandamus seeking to have his hospital privileges reinstated.smith prevailed in the writ proceeding and also won when the hospital appealed.smith selma community hospital th superior court issuance of writ affirmed.after the appeal,smith filed a motion for attorney fees pursuant to business and professions code section the trial court denied the motion,and smith appealed.
section provides that the court shall award attorney fees to a substantially prevailing party in a peer review lawsuit if the other party conduct in bringing,defending,or litigating the suit was frivolous,unreasonable,without foundation,or in bad faith.the parties disagree on the interpretation of section,the proper application of the opinion in mir charter suburban hospital th mir,the evidence that is relevant to the determination of bad faith,and whether this court can determine as a matter of law that the hospital conduct meets one of the four grounds stated in section.
we conclude that when the conditions contained in section are shown,the prevailing party is entitled to attorney is,the award of fees is not discretionary the statutory phrase frivolous,unreasonable,without foundation,or in bad faith sets forth separate grounds for an award of attorney fees the terms frivolous,unreasonable,and without foundation are objective standards that might overlap the term bad faith is a subjective standard concerned with a defendant motives for defending or litigating a lawsuit because a defendant subjective state of mind is usually proven by circumstantial evidence,a defendant prelitigation conduct and postlitigation conduct are relevant evidence from which inferences can be drawn regarding its motives in defending or litigating a lawsuit and this matter will be remanded so the legal standard for bad faith adopted in this opinion can be applied to the evidence relevant to that determination.
background 
a fundamental issue in this appeal is the motivation for the conduct of sch and its affiliates toward smith.because motive,which is one aspect of state of mind,usually is shown by circumstantial evidence,we will describe in detail the circumstances of smith relationship with sch and its affiliates 
smith is a licensed physician with certified specialties in family practice and emergency room medicine.he moved to fresno county in and grew his practice until his corporation owned clinics in the central valley.smith clinics compete with clinics owned by adventist health in the same area.
in the,smith became a member of the medical staffs of three hospitals,which are now named selma community hospital,hanford community medical center,and central valley general hospital.
smith conflicts with the parent and affiliates of appear to have begun in october when smith planned to open a birthing center in hanford,california that would have competed directly with the hanford hospitals.around that time,darwin remboldt who smith believed was the chief executive officer of central valley general hospital and an attorney summoned smith to a meeting at remboldt offices.at that meeting,according to smith,remboldt was blunt 
remboldt informed me that he was not going to allow me to build the birthing center.remboldt said to me either you become a physician in kings health a medical group run by one of the hanford hospitals or we are going to run you out of town.
then,in,a representative of the hanford hospitals approached smith with an offer to purchase his practice,which smith declined.after smith declined the offer,sch instituted proceedings to terminate his hospital privileges,claiming smith had an altercation with a nurse in front of a patient and the patient family in april.smith attorney sent a private investigator to interview the patient and her family,interviews which had not been conducted by sch.smith and his attorney submitted the witness statements to sch and the hospital withdrew the claim and agreed to purge smith file of all documents related to the matter.
in late,remboldt approached smith again about purchasing his practice.by march,smith and central valley general hospital had entered into a letter of intent for the hospital purchase of smith practice and clinics for million.among other things,the letter of intent provided that smith would be paid for managing the clinics and consulting with the hanford hospitals after the purchase and that he could not compete with them.
during the due diligence period specified in the letter of intent,central valley general hospital became concerned with alleged billing irregularities at smith clinics.about this time late march,a subcommittee of the medical executive committee of the hanford hospitals convened and was charged with investigating a series of complaints against smith.the complaints included allegations of unprofessional conduct,disruptive behavior,abuse of staff,falsification of medical records,and substandard patient care.smith contends these charges were pursued to gain leverage in the purchase of his clinics and thereby eliminate him as a competitor 
on may,smith met with representatives of adventist health about the sale.they demanded changes in the terms of purchase to make them significantly more favorable to central valley general hospital,including the elimination of payments to smith for management and consulting services and prohibiting smith from practicing medicine in fresno and kings counties.smith rejected the offer.
immediately after the meeting,adventist health terminated contracts with smith for the provision of emergency room and clinic services,which represented over million in revenue to his practice,and a management agreement.adventist health also accused smith of systematic billing fraud.
also near the time of the meeting,adventist health sent smith a letter accusing him of using foul language in speaking to a nurse in front of a patient.as he did in response to sch accusation in,smith hired an investigator who interviewed the patient who stated the alleged incident never happened.like the accusation,the hospital had not interviewed the patient about the alleged incident.
on june,smith attended a meeting with representatives of adventist health and its lawyers.they offered to purchase smith practice on the same terms presented to smith about a month earlier and told him the terms were not negotiable.again,smith rejected the offer.
on july,before the discussions concerning the sale of smith clinics were terminated the hanford hospitals orally informed smith that his privileges had been suspended and he had been granted temporary privileges until july.
on friday,july,smith met with remboldt about the sale of smith clinics.remboldt mentioned smith retirement,his financial security,recognition of smith contributions to the community,the placement of a plaque to smith in the nursery of a planned new birthing hospital,job security for smith employees,and the continued operation of the clinics he started.remboldt also told smith that adventist health had set aside to million to complete the acquisition of his practice.remboldt told smith they needed to wrap up the sale and emphasized the need for smith to call adventist health representative before the close of business on july,which was the day before the decision was to be made about extending smith privileges.remboldt told smith the offer to acquire his practice essentially was a take it or leave it,nonnegotiable offer that would expire on monday,july.
smith left the meeting with the belief that the purpose of the meeting had been to force him to sell his practice on the terms offered or face the loss of his privileges.smith did not intend to sell on those terms and,fearing the loss of his privileges and practice,he instructed his attorney to seek a temporary restraining order.
on july,smith filed in kings county a verified complaint for preliminary and permanent injunctive relief that requested the hanford hospitals be enjoined from terminating or suspending his privileges unless they first afforded him fair procedure rights in accordance with section et.
on july,the parties stipulated in open court that,in lieu of obtaining a ruling from the superior court on the merits of the temporary restraining order requested by smith,the superior court would enter the following order the hanford hospital s will do nothing to revoke,suspend or modify smith staff privileges prior to september,unless such modification,revocation or suspension is in full compliance with section,et.
after the court hearing,smith received a letter from the hanford hospitals questioning the medical care he provided to a patient who had been discharged in january,approximately two and a half years earlier.
two days after the stipulation was entered,central valley general hospital sued smith over the sale of the clinics and sought the return of delivered to smith when the letter of intent was executed see central valley general hospital smith,supra,th at.
later in july,smith attempted to learn the reasons for the allegations regarding his care of the patient discharged in january.his efforts led to a july,telephone conversation between his lawyer and a lawyer representing the medical staff.the declaration of smith attorney described the telephone conversation as including a threat 
van hall said to me smith should be careful what he asks for in requesting to know the basis of the charges against him.she said when the medical executive committee makes charges those charges will be reportable to the national practitioner data bank even if smith thereafter sells his practice and later withdraws his application for reappointment.van hall told me that if smith sells his practice before the medical executive committee provides smith with the charges that the charges will not be reportable.it was my impression that the phone call from van hall was for the purpose of threatening smith that if he did not sell his practice to adventist health,they were going to ruin him by taking away his hospital privileges.
the next day,smith attorney had a telephone conference with attorneys and consultants representing adventist health.again,smith attorney was informed about the timing of the notice of charges and the related reporting obligation.in addition,van hall stated if smith waits to sell his practice until after the ad hoc committee provides him with notice of the charges against him,by law,the hospitals would be obligated to report the proposed disciplinary action to the medical board of california.
the referenced ad hoc committee was appointed by the medical executive committee of the consolidated medical staffs of the hanford hospitals for the purpose of continuing the investigation of smith a letter dated august,advised smith that the ad hoc committee had identified a number of concerns,that he could submit a written response and appear for a personal interview,and that he should submit a written plan of correction to address the problems and deficiencies noted in an enclosure.
smith sought a temporary restraining order to prevent the hanford hospitals from limiting or restricting his privileges based on the grounds identified in the august,letter.on september,the superior court filed an order denying smith application for temporary restraining order.the superior court stated it would not enjoin the peer review process and that there were other remedies for the concerns raised by smith about the process.despite its denial of smith application,the superior court characterized as troubling central valley general hospital using the possibility of loss of hospital privileges as a bargaining chip in its efforts to secure favorable terms for the purchase of the licentiate practice 
also on september,the medical executive committee of the hanford hospitals voted to summarily suspend smith privileges.the incidents relied upon for the summary suspension occurred in august and involved six patient charts.
smith notified sch once he learned of his summary suspension at the hanford hospitals.on september,stanley louie,the chief of staff of sch,wrote to both smith and the chief of staff at the hanford hospitals to request written information explaining the reasons for the suspension.
smith responded by letter and included the written opinions of two doctors who had reviewed the six patient charts.the hanford hospitals did not respond to sch request.based on the information provided and smith practice at sch,louie did not believe that smith posed an imminent danger to patients at sch and did not feel the need to investigate or take other action at that point.as a result,sch took no action to limit smith privileges at sch,and smith moved all of his hospital cases to sch,delivering about babies a month.
in october,the medical executive committee of the hanford hospitals reviewed the report of the investigation of smith and voted to continue his summary suspension and to deny his reappointment.the matter then went before the judicial review committee of the hanford hospitals.its formal hearing took place over sessions beginning on april,and ending september.
in may,while the judicial review committee proceeding was pending at the hanford hospitals,smith applied for reappointment to the medical staff at sch because his appointment was scheduled to expire.
louie testified that,in accordance with its bylaws,sch conducted a review when it evaluated smith application the june,minutes of sch medical executive committee included its recommendation that the credentials committee evaluate smith application without information from the hanford hospitals.as a result,the credentials committee recommended the reappointment of smith based only on his activity and outcomes at sch and left open a review of his privileges upon receipt of additional information.
in july,notwithstanding his summary suspension by the hanford hospitals,sch notified smith that the governing board of sch ratified the approval of your to the active medical staff for the next two year period,ending june.
meanwhile,the judicial review committee of the hanford hospitals completed its proceedings.in november,it issued its decision and report on the charges of smith substandard patient care,abusive behavior towards patients and staff,and falsification of records,from january,to august.
the decision and report listed of the instances of alleged substandard care as proven,eight as proven in part,two as not proven and one as proven,but of minimal importance.seven out of charges of abusive behavior were listed as not proven.five charges of falsification of records were listed as proven,two were listed as not proven,two were listed as proven with extenuating circumstances,and one was listed as proven but not serious 
based on these findings,the judicial review committee of the hanford hospitals found that the summary suspension of smith and the recommendation that he not be reappointed were reasonable and warranted.
in november,smith provided sch with a copy of the decision of the judicial review committee of the hanford hospitals.
in december,smith notified sch that he was going to take a leave of absence from the medical staff of sch,starting january.smith took the leave of absence to help with the lawsuit concerning central valley general hospital failed attempt to purchase his practice 
also in december,smith appealed the decision of the judicial review committee to the appeal board of the hanford hospitals.smith ground for appeal was substantial noncompliance with the procedures required by statute and by the bylaws of the medical staff of the hanford hospitals.among other things,smith asserted that an unbiased panel had not presided over the hearing and that he had not been given an opportunity to present all relevant evidence of the matters charged.
on january,the governing board of hanford community medical center affirmed the decision of the consolidated judicial review committee of the hanford hospitals.on february,the governing board of central valley general hospital affirmed the same decision.the written decisions of the governing boards were the final peer review decisions of the hanford hospitals and both stated they became effective january.
in february,smith requested reinstatement to sch medical staff with his prior privileges.sch requested and received from smith a copy of the governing boards final decisions in the hanford peer review proceeding.smith also provided sch with a copy of a letter from his attorney stating that,within the next month,she anticipated filing a petition for writ of mandamus challenging the final administrative decision of the hanford hospitals peer review proceeding 
on march,smith met with darrick wells,who had replaced louie as chief of staff at sch.wells told smith that his privileges would be summarily suspended if he did not resign his membership or request an additional leave of nine months.after that meeting,smith sent wells a confirming letter,which stated you noted that both you and the mec medical executive committee had received legal advice from both mec attorney s and hospital attorney s that the mec had to act on the final decision from hanford and take action.
the letter is consistent with winkelman testimony before sch judicial review committee regarding his conversation with wells concerning smith privileges 
i was told,very clearly,that hospital counsel or mec counsel or both,that is the counsel that the mec was getting advice from,had advised the mec and wells that they were obligated to either suspend smith privileges or in some other manner prevent him from practicing here,because of the liability associated with having him continue to practice,due to the action taken at central valley general hospital.and this followed the discussion of the fact that wells was not aware of any adverse events at selma district hospital that was calling his privileges into question.
smith did not resign or request another leave of absence.consequently,on march,sch medical executive committee notified smith that it had voted to summarily suspend his privileges effective march.smith sued,challenging the suspension.on april,he obtained a temporary restraining order enjoining sch from taking any action to suspend,restrict or otherwise impede smith staff membership or privileges at sch.
on may,sch medical executive committee met with a representative of sch governing board,sch director of administration,and richard rawson,the president of sch,who also was president of the hanford hospitals.the medical executive committee discussed the temporary restraining order,the trial court view that the information presented was insufficient to demonstrate smith was a potential threat to patient and staff,and the summons regarding smith suit against the hospital for interference with his right to pursue a lawful occupation,intentional interference with prospective business advantage,and unfair competition.sch medical executive committee approved making an offer,contingent upon smith dismissing with prejudice his lawsuit against sch in its entirety,to rescind smith summary suspension rescind the recommendation to terminate his medical staff membership and clinical privileges not use the findings in the hanford hospitals proceedings as the basis for either future corrective action or denial of reappointment to sch base future corrective action against smith on events occurring after may,and submit corrected reports to the california medical board and the national practitioner data bank.smith did not accept the offer,which he characterizes as a blatant attempt to trade hospital privileges for dismissal of his is,the use of peer review proceedings as a cudgel to force him to dismiss the suit.
on june,sch medical executive committee voted to rescind the summary suspension,which was no longer in operation because of the temporary restraining order,and continue with the recommendation to terminate smith medical staff membership and clinical privileges.the written notice of charges that sch medical executive committee provided to smith stated that the mec determined that your conduct,as finally determined after extensive hearings at the hanford hospitals,was reasonably likely to be detrimental to patient safety and to the delivering of quality patient care within the hospital,unethical,contrary to the medical staff bylaws and rules and regulations,and below applicable professional standards.
the written notice also advised smith of sch selection of individuals to serve as sch judicial review committee.smith objected to the four individuals on the ground they had significant economic ties to sch.the hearing officer,retired judge frederic jacobus,subsequently sustained the objections and struck the entire panel.a new judicial review committee was formed with physicians who were associated with the medical society and were not members of sch medical staff.
the judicial review committee held hearings in february and march in which each side called witnesses.for example,wells testified at the hearing that over the prior year or months he had been reviewing every one of smith charts and admissions to sch and t here has been no fallout of medical care of those charts to this point.wells also testified that he relied on the final decision of the hanford hospitals,that he would not dispute the findings,and that he was not concerned about the fairness of the proceeding at the hanford hospitals.
on march,the judicial review committee issued a written decision in smith favor.it specifically found that the medical executive committee had not proven by a preponderance of the evidence that its recommendation was reasonable and warranted.consequently,the judicial review committee rejected the action proposed by sch medical executive committee.
the written decision of the judicial review committee discussed the relationship between sch and the hanford hospitals,the close relationship between the two hanford hospitals that terminated smith privileges,the failure of the proposed transaction between smith and one of the hanford hospitals for the sale of his practice and clinics,the charges and results of the peer review proceedings at the hanford hospitals,and sch medical executive committee offer to compromise sch peer review proceeding against smith.
the judicial review committee observed that smith was reappointed to sch medical staff in june after his suspension by the hanford hospitals and that the retrospective peer review of his work at sch apparently did not identify his clinical practices as an outlier.the judicial review committee noted that the interval examined by sch before reappointing smith was the interval when the events occurred that were the basis for the findings of the hanford hospitals.as to matters occurring after smith was reappointed to sch medical staff in,no outlying outcomes from smith practice at sch were identified in the testimony presented to the judicial review committee.
the judicial review committee decision included an explanation of its conclusion to reject the recommendation of the medical executive committee 
we do not believe sch medial sic staff through its mec and attorney has produced evidence to convince us that the action of selma adventist hospital mec is reasonable or warranted.we believe that sch must do their own investigation of smith,and follow accepted guidelines such as those outlined in the model medical staff as presented by jack rötenberg,md,and california medical association.the information from the hanford hospitals may be used as a part of a reason to monitor smith by accepted peer review mechanisms such as case monitoring,proctoring at surgery and a more intensive review of patients admitted to sch.after doing their own investigation of smith performance at sch,then the experiences at the hanford hospitals may be used as additional evidence of his need to be dismissed.
in april,sch medical executive committee appealed the decision of the judicial review committee to the governing board of sch.the governing board exercised its authority under its bylaws to appoint a committee composed of three members of the governing board to sit as the appeal board.
the appeal committee of the governing board issued a written document that included its conclusions that the judicial review committee noncompliance with the procedures required by the bylaws was prejudicial and the judicial review committee decision was not supported by substantial evidence.based on these conclusions,the appeal board ultimately recommended that the governing board of selma community hospital reverse the judicial review committee and affirm the mec recommendation to terminate smith medical staff membership and clinical privileges 
sch governing board agreed with the recommendation and adopted a resolution,effective july,implementing the medical executive committee recommendation to terminate the membership and privileges of smith.on july,smith filed the petition for writ of mandamus that started the lawsuit involved in this appeal.
in june,the superior court filed a judgment granting a peremptory writ of mandamus.the writ directed sch to set aside the decision of the appeal board of july,and reinstate the decision of the judicial review committee.smith selma community hospital,supra,th at.
on july,sch filed an appeal.five days later,it filed a return in the superior court stating it could not comply with the writ because there was no sch medical staff to which smith could return.this statement was based on adventist health reorganization of its hospital subsidiaries and their medical staffs,which had occurred the preceding fall.smith adventist health,supra,th at.after that reorganization,the medical staff of the hanford hospitals and sch was a single entity ibid.
within a day or two of filing its return,sch filed a petition for a writ of supersedeas and a request for an immediate stay with this court.the petition misinterpreted the trial court decision by asserting it held that california hospitals may never base termination decisions solely on a physician substandard medical care inappropriate behavior at another facility,no matter how egregious.in august,this court denied the petition for a writ,stating that a party seeking a writ must convincingly show that substantial questions will be raised on appeal and must demonstrate it would suffer irreparable harm outweighing the harm that would be suffered by the other party and sch had failed to carry its burden.
in,frustrated by sch failure to comply with the writ of mandate issued by the trial court,smith sought to regain his privileges at sch by filing a motion for issuance of an order to show cause regarding contempt.the trial court held two hearings on the motion.
the controversies raised in the hearings included a dispute over the inferences that should be drawn from this court denial of sch petition for a writ of supersedeas.sch argued that the fact smith was not exercising privileges was the basis for this court finding of no imminent harm to it and,therefore,the trial court should not reinstate smith because that would upset the balance struck by this court.the trial court correctly rejected sch characterization of this court order denying the writ.
besides matters raised at the two hearings,other controversies arose.a week after the second hearing,sch filed a declaration to support its position that smith should not be reinstated pursuant to the writ of mandate.the declaration referenced an accusation filed against smith by the california medical board in august and a criminal investigation conducted by the attorney general office.sch asked the court to delay ruling until after the attorney general office had decided whether to file criminal charges,which sch represented would occur in late november or the first week of december 
on december,the trial court issued an order that found no contempt,ordered the reinstatement of the judicial review committee decision as required by the court june,writ,directed that smith submit an application for consolidated medical staff privileges,and ordered that smith shall be permitted to practice on the consolidated medical staff at selma community hospital for a period of one year following the submission of his application,and then must reapply for privileges,as would any other physician practicing there.
sch reacted to this order by filing a second petition for writ of supersedeas and a request for an immediate stay.four days later,on december,this court denied the petition.as a result,smith resumed practicing at sch on december.he points out that his reinstatement had been delayed for almost six months.
in july,this court affirmed the trial court decision to issue the writ of mandamus,stating 
the governing board decision includes several errors of law.it misinterpreted the decision of the judicial review committee,misapplied the collateral estoppel or the exhaustion of remedies doctrine,erroneously decided certain evidence was irrelevant,and misapplied the substantial evidence test.smith selma community hospital,supra,th at.
proceedings 
in december,smith filed a motion seeking attorney fees in the amount of.
the motion for attorney fees was heard and taken under advisement on february.on april,the trial court issued its order stating the following 
smith motion for attorney fees in the amount of is denied,pursuant to the court holding in mir,supra,th as the hospital position was not frivolous,unreasonable,without foundation,or in bad faith pursuant to section.underscoring in original.
in may,smith filed a timely notice of appeal from the order denying his motion for attorney fees.
discussion 
the parties dispute how section should be interpreted and applied in this case.part of this dispute concerns the role that the majority opinion in mir,supra,th should play in the analysis of these questions.we begin our discussion by setting forth the text of section and the rules of statutory construction.
statutory text and rules of construction 
statutory text 
section provides 
in any suit brought to challenge an action taken or a restriction imposed which is required to be reported pursuant to section,the court shall,at the conclusion of the action,award to a substantially prevailing party the cost of the suit,including a reasonable attorney fee,if the other party conduct in bringing,defending,or litigating the suit was frivolous,unreasonable,without foundation,or in bad faith.for the purpose of this section,a plaintiff shall not be considered to have substantially prevailed when the plaintiff does not obtain an award of damages or permanent injunctive or declaratory relief.italics added.
rules of statutory construction 
issues of statutory construction are questions of law subject to independent review by the appellate court.coburn sievert th.the general principles of statutory construction that guide our independent review have been set forth by this court in a number of opinions,id.at people haynie th,california teachers governing bd.of hilmar unified school dist.th.those principles are summarized here.
a reviewing court fundamental task in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute.citation.day city of fontana cal th.this task begins by scrutinizing the actual words of the statute,giving them their usual,ordinary meaning.garcia mccutchen cal th.

ambiguous statutory language

in the present case,the parties have not requested that we examine any legislative history concerning section 
ii.role of mir as precedent 
summary of mir 
in mir,supra,th,a hospital peer review proceeding resulted in disciplinary action against the physician.id.at.the physician filed a petition for mandamus relief,seeking to vacate the disciplinary decision.ibid.the trial court granted the writ,determining that there was no substantial evidence to support the disciplinary decision of the hospital.id.at.also applying the substantial evidence test,the appellate court affirmed the decision of the trial court.id.at.
after the appeal of the mandamus proceeding was resolved,the physician filed a motion for attorney fees under section.mir,supra,th at.the trial court granted the motion,concluding that the hospital had opposed mandamus unreasonably and without foundation.ibid.the hospital appealed.ibid.
the appellate court addressed the following issue whether a physician who succeeds on mandamus in overturning a disciplinary action by a hospital on the ground of insufficient evidence is necessarily entitled to recover attorney fees under section.mir,supra,th at.the majority concluded the determination that no substantial evidence supported the hospital disciplinary decision did not automatically establish that the hospital defense of the mandamus proceeding was unreasonable or without foundation so as to merit an award of attorney fees.id.at.based on this conclusion,the majority reversed the order awarding attorney fees and remanded the matter for a new hearing on the issue whether the hospital opposition to mandamus was unreasonable or without foundation.id.at.
contentions of the parties here 
at the hearing on the motion for attorney fees here,counsel for smith argued that the judicial review committee finding that sch proposed termination of smith privileges had not been shown to be reasonable and warranted for purposes of,subd.b established by res judicata or collateral estoppel that the hospital defense of the mandamus proceeding was unreasonable for purposes of section.counsel also argued mir was distinguishable because it involved the lack of substantial evidence to support the disciplinary action.
at the same hearing,counsel for sch argued smith case was on all fours with mir,and the trial court was required by auto equity sales,superior court cal d,to follow that precedent.he argued that,in effect,counsel for smith was asking the trial court to overrule mir and agree with justice croskey dissent in that case.
precedential value of mir 
the court in mir decided a narrow legal issue whether a court decision that a hospital disciplinary decision was not supported by substantial evidence automatically results in the conclusion that the hospital position was unreasonable or without foundation for purposes of section.mir,supra,th at.the majority opinion concluded that a finding of insufficient evidence is not tantamount to an affirmative finding the hospital conduct in resisting mandamus was unreasonable or without foundation.id.at.
here the question presented is different.smith does not rely on a court determination that the hospital disciplinary decision was not supported by substantial evidence.rather,smith relies on the determination of the judicial review committee that acted as the trier of fact in the peer review proceeding conducted by sch.see smith selma community hospital,supra,th at.and the determination made by that judicial review committee,as the trier of fact,did not involve the application of the substantial evidence test.smith relies on the judicial review committee determination under section,subdivision b we do not believe sch medical staff through its mec and attorney has produced evidence to convince us that the action of selma adventist hospital mec is reasonable or warranted.the judicial review committee reiterated its finding on the question of ultimate fact by stating 
in our view,the sch mec did not persuade this jrc,by a preponderance of the evidence,that its action or recommendation summary from the sch staff reasonable and warranted.
based on our comparison of the determination regarding substantial evidence relied upon by the physician in mir with the judicial review committee determination relied upon by smith,we conclude that the legal issue presented in this case is not the same as that decided in mir.a finding regarding the reasonable and warranted requirement in section,subdivision b is not the same as a conclusion of law that a disciplinary decision is not supported by substantial evidence accordingly,mir is not binding precedent in this case 
based on our conclusion that mir is not binding precedent,we further conclude that the question whether the judicial review committee finding here entitles smith to attorney fees under section,as a matter of law,must be resolved by applying the requirements of the legal doctrine of collateral estoppel.smith argues the judicial review committee finding collaterally estops sch from asserting that its defense of the mandamus proceeding was reasonable and warranted.
iii.collateral estoppel and the judicial review committee findings 
background and contentions 
the peer review proceeding prosecuted against smith by sch was governed in part by section,subdivision b,which provides that the peer review body shall bear the burden of persuading the trier of fact by a preponderance of the evidence that the action or recommendation is reasonable and warranted.in the smith matter,the peer review body was sch medical executive committee and the trier of fact was the judicial review committee.thus,sch medical executive committee had the burden of persuading the judicial review committee that its recommendation to terminate smith privileges was reasonable and warranted.
the judicial review committee specifically found that the medical executive committee had not persuaded it by a preponderance of the evidence that the proposed termination of smith privileges was reasonable and warranted.this is the finding that smith argues now binds sch and entitles him to attorney fees as a matter of law.relying on the doctrine of collateral estoppel,smith argues 
if sch proposed conduct to terminate smith privileges was unreasonable,then ergo its subsequent conduct in terminating smith privileges despite the judicial review committee decision was unreasonable.likewise,its subsequent defense of its unreasonable conduct in response to smith writ petition was unreasonable or without foundation.accordingly,smith is entitled to his attorneys fees under section,as a matter of law.
in response,sch contends that the judicial review committee finding can not bind the trial court in the fee determination because the judicial review committee considered and decided a completely different question.
application of doctrine of collateral estoppel 
the doctrine of collateral estoppel applies only if the following elements have been shown 
first,the issue sought to be precluded from relitigation must be identical to that decided in a former proceeding.second,this issue must have been actually litigated in the former proceeding.third,it must have been necessarily decided in the former proceeding.fourth,the decision in the former proceeding must be final and on the merits.finally,the party against whom preclusion is sought must be the same as,or in privity with,the party to the former proceeding.citations.lucido superior court cal d.
the doctrine of collateral estoppel is designed to limit litigation by preventing a party who has had one fair adversary hearing on an issue from again drawing it into controversy.heiser,california confusing collateral estoppel issue preclusion doctrine san diego,fn.omitted.three public policies are served by the,preservation of the integrity of the judicial system,promotion of judicial economy,and protection of litigants from harassment by vexatious litigation.lucido superior court,supra,cal d at.
in this appeal,the parties dispute whether the identical issue was litigated.the identical issue element requires that identical factual allegations are at stake in the two proceedings,not whether the ultimate issues or dispositions are the same.lucido superior court,supra,cal d at.
we conclude the judicial review committee did not decide the identical issue that was presented to the trial court by smith motion for attorney fees.the issue decided by the judicial review committee was whether it was persuaded by a preponderance of the evidence that the proposal by sch medical executive committee to terminate smith privileges and membership was reasonable and warranted.the issue presented by the motion for attorney fees was whether sch conduct in defending or litigating the mandamus proceeding was unreasonable or without foundation.although the former issue is intertwined with the latter,they are not identical.
whether sch conduct in defending or litigating the mandamus suit was reasonable depends in part on the positions it took during the litigation.as these facts did not exist at the time the judicial review committee made its decision,identical factual allegations were not at stake in the two proceedings.
the lack of identity between the issues is further demonstrated by the judicial review committee phrasing its finding in terms of what the preponderance of the evidence showed and whether it was persuaded.the issue of whether the medical executive committee carried its burden of persuasion is not the same issue that determines whether sch was liable for attorney fees.
accordingly,we reject smith contention that,when the trial court decided his motion for attorney fees,it was required by the judicial review committee finding regarding reasonableness to find that sch conduct in defending or litigating smith lawsuit was unreasonable for purposes of section.
iv.duty or discretion of the trial court 
contentions 
sch contends an abuse of discretion standard of review applies to the trial court denial of attorney fees.it also contends the trial court determinations regarding the factors set forth in section are findings of fact that should be reviewed for an abuse of discretion.in contrast,smith contends the application of section in this case is subject to de novo review because the relevant facts are undisputed.
the question whether section grants discretionary authority to award attorney fees is a question of statutory construction.the language in section is not ambiguous on the question whether the award of fees is mandatory or discretionary.the legislature use of the phrase court shall award in section plainly indicates that the trial court is required to award attorney fees when the criteria set forth in the statute are satisfied.see county of sacramento superior court d,usually shall connotes mandatory action and may connotes discretionary action.
sch has not discussed the legislature use of the word shall in section and has cited cummings benco building services th to support its position that an abuse of discretion standard applies.the cummings case involved the attorney fees provision in california fair employment and housing act feha.cummings,at.that section states the court,in its discretion,may award to the prevailing party reasonable attorney fees and costs,subd.b.the phrase in its discretion may plainly grants discretion to the trial court and easily is distinguished from section mandatory language.therefore,the court conclusion in cummings that an abuse of discretion standard applied to an attorney fees award under the feha has no value as precedent in this case.see also code civ,trial court may order a party to pay sanctions tenderloin housing clinic,sparks th,award of sanctions under code civ,is a discretionary act on the part of the trial court.
similarly,the two federal decisions cited by sch that state a district court decision to award attorney fees under the health care quality improvement act of is reviewed for an abuse of discretion are not persuasive authority for how section should be construed.see smith ricks cir,johnson nyack hospital cir.those decisions contain no textual analysis of the federal attorney fee provision and fail to acknowledge that the provision,like section,uses the word shall.
based on the plain language of the statute,we interpret section as imposing a mandatory obligation on trial courts to award attorney fees when the criteria set forth in the statute are satisfied.therefore,we will not review the trial court denial of attorney fees under the deferential abuse of discretion standard of review.instead,we will subject questions of law to an independent review and will review findings of fact under the substantial evidence test,except where those findings can be made as a matter of law.
conduct that is the basis for an award of attorney fees 
sch interprets smith attorney fees motion as including conduct that took place prior to and during the peer review process underlying the mandamus action.sch argues that smith is seeking his attorneys fees for prosecution of the mandamus action as damages for alleged bad faith peer review.but he is in the wrong forum,and using the wrong vehicle.
sch made the same argument below.there,sch also argued that the temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions that smith obtained in other cases established nothing about the alleged invalidity of sch litigation position in this case.sch written opposition to the motion concluded 
finally,smith offers,as evidence that sch defense of the mandamus petition was frivolous or in bad faith,the fact that at three different stages,adjudicators have expressed concern about economics driving the illegal privileging decisions.motion at.but again,if smith has been subjected to bad faith peer review and he has not,that is not before this court.the sole issue before this court is whether certain litigation conduct of sch is sanctionable within the meaning of section.
smith replies that section applies to more than litigation conduct because its plain terms also apply to the decision to defend the lawsuit.smith does not argue that he is entitled to recover attorney fees incurred in the peer review proceeding or in other lawsuits against sch or its affiliates.
the pertinent statutory language states that an award of attorney fees against a defendant is based on the defendant conduct in defending,or litigating the suit.we conclude that the legislature use of the terms defending and litigating in tandem demonstrates it was concerned with both the general and the specific.the phrase conduct in defending reflects a concern with the broad decision to defend a lawsuit,just as the phrase conduct in bringing reflects a concern with the plaintiff broad decision to pursue a lawsuit.the phrase conduct in litigating the suit indicates a concern with the specific tactical decisions made as the suit proceeds.
in the context of this case and the arguments raised by smith,we conclude that the phrase conduct in defending the suit includes sch decision to defend the petition for writ of mandate filed by smith.consequently,that decision must be evaluated to determine if it meets any of the four grounds listed in section.in addition,we conclude that conduct in litigating the suit includes acts taken on specific issues and motions,as well as on postjudgment matters,such as sch claim that it no longer had a medical staff to which smith could return and its two unsuccessful writs of supersedeas filed with this court.the attorney fees incurred by smith in connection with such postjudgment matters would be recoverable as part of any fees awarded under section.
because of sch arguments about prelitigation conduct,however,we explicitly state that any attorney fees awarded to a plaintiff under section must have been incurred by the plaintiff in the suit referenced in the statute.thus,attorney fees incurred by smith before this suit was filed,or in other matters,can not be recovered in the section motion he filed in this case.at the same time,this conclusion does not mean that sch conduct outside the suit does not constitute evidence relevant to the application of section in this case.sch argument about relevancy will be addressed in part,post.
vi.meaning of the statutory phrase frivolous,unreasonable,without foundation,or in bad faith 
before applying section to sch conduct in defending or litigating the mandamus proceeding and determining whether smith is entitled to a fee award,we first determine the meaning of the applicable statutory terms.
section requires an award of attorney fees where the losing defendant conduct in defending or litigating the suit was frivolous,unreasonable,without foundation,or in bad faith.
a.the four grounds for an award are separate 
smith contends that section requires the court to award attorneys fees to the substantially prevailing party under four alternative grounds based on the statute use of the disjunctive or,smith argues that e ach alternative ground represents a separate category for an award 
the plain and ordinary meaning of the word or is well established.when used in a statute,the word or indicates an intention to designate separate,disjunctive categories.white.county of sacramento cal d,see kobzoff los angeles county medical center cal th,or is disjunctive.therefore,the use of or in section means that an award of attorney fees to a substantially prevailing party is required if any one of the four grounds listed is shown.
overview of the four grounds and their relationship to one another 
the four criteria for an award of fees listed in section are not defined by the statute.they are general terms subject to a variety of interpretations,which range from narrow to broad.because of the lack of statutory definitions and the inherent ambiguity of the four terms,it is difficult to determine precisely where one term ends and another term begins and what overlap,if any,exists among them.
this set of circumstances leads us to draw two pragmatic inferences regarding legislative intent.first,the legislature used the four terms together and connected them with the disjunctive or to avoid any single term being interpreted too narrowly.thus,from a practical point of view,the scope of a particular term is not as important as the scope of the statute.for example,whether a particular position is characterized as unreasonable,without foundation,or both is not as important as whether that position falls within the scope of section.see the last paragraph of pt,post.
second,the legislature intended to impose liability for attorney fees if the relevant conduct was either qualitatively deficient under an objective standard or inappropriate under a subjective standard.this point is discussed further in part,post,which concerns the ground of bad faith.
without foundation 
in scrutinizing the words of a statute,courts generally give them their usual,ordinary meaning,which in turn may be obtained by referring to a dictionary.garcia mccutchen,supra,cal th at stores,city of turlock th.webster third new international dictionary page defines foundation to mean the basis on which something is founded the basis upon which something stands or is supported thus,we interpret the term without foundation as meaning baseless,groundless,or without support.see cummings benco building services,supra,th at quoting a case that treated the terms meritless,groundless and without foundation as synonyms.
notwithstanding this definition,the term without foundation remains ambiguous because there are different types of foundations for the positions a party takes in defending and litigating a suit.at its most fundamental level,a party conduct in litigating a suit involves assertions of fact and contentions of law,which lead to further party arguments regarding the application of law to the facts.we will assume for purposes of this appeal that the term without foundation refers to both the factual and the legal bases for the positions taken by a party.
the foundation for an assertion of fact is evidence,which can be either direct or circumstantial.caci.thus,a party that asserts a fact without direct or circumstantial evidence to support it has engaged in conduct that is without foundation for purposes of section.
the foundation for a contention of law is legal authority such as a statute,regulation,or case law.see finnie town of tiburon d,in applying code civ.proc,court discussed separately lack of legal grounds and want of evidentiary showing.therefore,a party that takes a legal position without supporting authority,either direct or indirect,has engaged in conduct that is without foundation.
whether evidence is present in the record to support a factual assertion and whether authority has been presented to support a legal position are questions that both trial and appellate courts handle routinely in administering their caseload.the record of the proceeding will contain a party factual assertions and references to the evidence that supports those assertions and legal positions and the authority cited to support those positions.based on the nature of the inquiry and the record available,the existence of supporting evidence and authority can be determined as a matter of objective fact.accordingly,we conclude that the question whether a party conduct in litigating a suit was without foundation is an issue that the courts must decide as a matter of law under an objective test.as such,the issue is subject to independent review on appeal.laabs city of victorville th,application of objective test of reasonableness was subject to independent review on appeal.
unreasonable 
the edition of black law dictionary that was current when section was enacted defines unreasonable to mean n ot reasonable and i rrational.black law dict.ed.its definition of reasonable provides in part 
having the faculty of reason rational governed by reason under the influence of reason agreeable to reason.thinking,speaking,or acting according to the dictates of reason.id.at.
the terms reasonable and unreasonable are used in a variety of legal contexts and do not always designate the same legal standard.often,the terms reflect a negligence is,the failure to exercise the care a reasonable person would exercise under the circumstances,massey mercy medical center redding th,see baji definition of negligence and ordinary care caci standard of care for negligence see also in re marriage of flaherty cal d,the term frivolous could impose an objective standard that looks at the merits of the appeal from a reasonable person perspective.typically,the existence of negligence the failure to exercise reasonable care is regarded as a question of fact,and a finding of negligence is reviewed on appeal under the substantial evidence standard.ermoian desert hospital th.similarly,the application of a reasonableness standard in other situations is deemed a question of fact and reviewed for substantial evidence.e,positas partners bollag th,objective reasonableness in performing contract a question of fact substantial evidence supported trial court finding defendant position was unreasonable in re joseph th,whether officer use of force was objectively reasonable was a pure question of fact reviewed for sufficiency of the evidence.
in other contexts the term reasonable has led to the adoption of a more specific standard of care and a different level of scrutiny when application of that standard is reviewed on appeal.california tort claims act,et provides an example.under that act,a defendant is entitled to recover its costs of defense if a claim is brought without reasonable cause.code civ,subd.a.using the perspective of a hypothetical reasonable attorney,courts decide whether reasonable cause exists by analyzing the facts known to the plaintiff when he or she filed or maintained the action and determining whether any reasonable attorney would have thought the claim tenable.laabs city of victorville,supra,th at.this standard is an objective standard that is applied as a matter of law.id.at.as such,its application is subject to independent review on appeal.ibid.
the parties here do not advocate for any particular standard for use in determining whether conduct was unreasonable for purposes of section.given this lack of argument from the parties,we will conduct an independent review and apply the standard as a matter of law.if the conduct in question meets this standard,then the record also would contain substantial evidence supporting a finding of fact that the conduct was reasonable under an ordinary negligence standard.
we recognize that,under the definitions we have adopted for the terms without foundation and unreasonable,it is possible for a party litigation conduct to qualify as both.in other words,the terms partially overlap.for example,when a party,after investigation and discovery,makes an assertion of fact without any direct or circumstantial evidence to support that fact,that conduct lacks foundation is baseless or groundless and is unreasonable fails the standard for purposes of section.it appears that the terms without foundation and unreasonable were used together to emphasize two different aspects of litigation conduct.the term without foundation seems to focus primarily on the base or grounds that underlie a party position on a factual or legal matter.as a result,the term unreasonable appears to be concerned chiefly with the logic,rationale,or reasoning process that connects the underlying foundation with the conclusions advocated by the party.
webster third new international dictionary,supra,page defines frivolous to mean of little weight or importance having no basis in law or fact light,slight,sham,irrelevant,superficial we find this term ambiguous,because its plain and ordinary meaning does not indicate whether it imposes an objective standard,a subjective standard,or both.see in re marriage of flaherty,supra,cal d at.furthermore,california case law has adopted more than one standard for the term frivolous.under code of civil procedure section,for example,frivolity is determined using an objective standard.burkle burkle th.elsewhere,courts have stated that the term includes both objective and subjective standards.see millennium corporate solutions peckinpaugh th,sanctions imposed for frivolous appeal.
the ambiguity,however,has little practical significance in the context of the arguments presented by the parties here.for purposes of this appeal,we will adopt the definition used by smith.in his view,a matter is frivolous if any reasonable attorney would agree it is completely without merit in the sense that it lacks legal grounds,lacks an evidentiary showing,or involves an unreasonable delay.
ambiguity in the term 
black law dictionary states that bad faith is the opposite of good faith and that bad faith conduct is not prompted by an honest mistake as to one rights or duties,but by some interested or sinister motive.black law,supra.it also states bad faith is not simply bad judgment or negligence,but rather it implies the conscious doing of a wrong because of dishonest purpose or moral obliquity it is different from the negative idea of negligence in that it contemplates a state of mind affirmatively operating with furtive design or ill will.ibid.
despite this definition reference to the person state of mind in general and the person motive in particular,not all courts have construed the term bad faith as imposing solely a subjective standard.for example,the attorney fees provision of the california uniform trade secrets act uses the term bad faith and courts have interpreted it as imposing a standard objective speciousness and subjective bad is,an improper motive.flir systems,parrish th,refers to a claim of misappropriation made in bad faith.
alternatively,courts have referred to bad faith in other contexts as imposing a subjective standard and expressly distinguished it from an objective standard.summers city of cathedral city d.the definition of bad faith in the test for willful judicial misconduct sets forth a subjective standard that entails either an intent,motivated by actual malice,to commit an act that he knows or should know is beyond his lawful power or an intent to commit an act,even within his lawful power,for a corrupt purpose,for any purpose other than the faithful discharge of judicial duties.citations.doan commission on judicial performance cal th.
based on these different approaches to bad faith,we conclude that section use of the term is is,reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation.coburn.sievert,supra,th at ambiguous means susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.
bad faith is a subjective standard 
sch asserts that bad faith is a subjective standard and cites doran magan th for the proposition that a subjective standard looks to the motives of the party and his or her counsel.id.at.smith asserts that bad faith results from a party improper motive.based on the positions of the parties,and because objective standards are contained in the other three grounds listed in section,we conclude that the term bad faith establishes a subjective standard concerned solely with whether the motive underlying the losing party conduct was improper.we further conclude that a party conduct can be attributed to improper motives and,thus,constitute bad faith for purposes of section even if that party conduct could otherwise be found acceptable under the three objective criteria of section.
what motives are improper 
black law dictionary definition of bad faith refers to some interested or sinister motive and states bad faith contemplates a state of mind affirmatively operating with furtive design or ill will.black law,supra.
based on these definitions and the case law that adopts a subjective standard for bad faith,we conclude that conduct is improperly motivated for purposes of a bad faith standard under section if it involves actual malice,ill will,or a purpose not related to the legitimate functioning of the hospital and its staff.applying this definition to the facts in this case,we conclude that improper purposes would include,without limitation,personal animosity towards smith,the intent to eliminate or hinder smith as a competitor,and the intent to inflict harm,cost,and inconvenience on smith because of his failure to sell or donate his clinics to adventist health.
effect of reasonable conduct 
one consequence of interpreting bad faith as imposing only a subjective standard is that a substantially prevailing party will be entitled to attorney fees and costs under section when the losing party conduct in defending or litigating the suit was taken because of an improper motive,even if the conduct could be seen as reasonable or supported by an adequate evidentiary and legal foundation.in other words,a hospital that defends a mandamus proceeding because it is motivated by improper considerations can not avoid liability for attorney fees and costs simply by asserting legal positions for which it can find support.
this conclusion about the application of section relates to a point raised during the hearing on the motion for attorney fees.counsel for smith argued that the defense of the mandamus proceeding was very much in bad faith.the trial court responded 
did they prevail,though,on some of their opposition you prevailed ultimately on the major issues,i guess,at the court of appeal,but for example,the cost bill,for example,there was an sic modification to that.there was,you brought some contempt issues,i did not find contempt.
the fact that a hospital won some of the positions that it took during the litigation of the mandamus proceeding does not necessarily show that its defense of the mandamus proceeding was not in bad is,motivated by an improper purpose.first,we have interpreted section to mean that the subjective standard of bad faith is separate and independent of the objective standards set forth in the other three terms.second,if partial success on some issues was a reason for denying a motion under section,the statute would not have used the term substantially prevailing party.the modifier substantially indicates that a party can be entitled to fees and costs without prevailing on all of the points raised in the litigation.
evidence relevant to the factual question of motive 
an inquiry into a party state of mind and motives is a subjective one that poses a question of fact.hailey california physicians service th,triable issue of fact existed regarding whether insurer revoked health plan in bad faith gemini aluminum california custom shapes,th,bad faith involves factual inquiry into party subjective state of mind.
the parties here disagree over a subsidiary question does the evidence relevant to proving sch defended the mandamus proceeding in bad faith include sch prelitigation conduct see pt.v,ante.during the hearing on the section motion,sch argued that the summary suspension of smith privileges at the hospital was completely irrelevant to the motion for attorney fees.in contrast,counsel for smith argued the summary suspension was relevant to show it was a bad faith defense we agree with smith.
we begin with the basic proposition that a subjective state of mind will rarely be susceptible of direct proof usually the trial court will be required to infer it from circumstantial evidence.knight city of capitola th.circumstantial evidence is relevant if it has any tendency in reason to prove or disprove the disputed fact,here sch state of mind in defending the writ proceeding.
in the circumstances of this particular case,we conclude that evidence of prelitigation conduct is relevant to the question of bad faith.in particular,evidence of the prior relationships and dealings between smith and sch and its affiliates is relevant to prove sch state of mind towards smith and its motives for defending the mandamus action.that evidence includes the conflicts that existed between smith and adventist health,which the record in this case indicates began in.thus,contrary to the assertions sch made at the hearing on the motion for attorney fees,prior misconduct toward smith is admissible as relevant evidence of sch improper motives or state of mind in the present proceeding.see fox valley const.workers pride of fox masonry cir,defense attorney conduct in prior lawsuit against defendant was admissible to show strikingly similar practice in present lawsuit was done with sanctionable intent.
furthermore,the standard of evidentiary relevance does not exclude evidence of conduct by sch that occurred after the litigation of this suit.evidence of subsequent conduct also might support reasonable inferences regarding whether sch defended the mandamus proceeding because of ill will,a desire to lessen the competition from smith,or a desire to punish him for not selling his clinics on the terms proposed by adventist health.
vii.application of the objective standards of section 
conduct subject to scrutiny 
whether sch conduct in defending the mandamus proceeding had a foundation,was reasonable,and was not frivolous depends on the positions it took in that proceeding.
in smith selma community hospital,supra,th,this court identified four legal errors that sch committed in deciding to terminate smith privileges.we summarized those errors as follows 
first,the governing board misinterpreted the judicial review committee decision in a number of respects.for example,it wrongly concluded that the judicial review committee did not make the findings of fact required by the bylaws.second,it erred in concluding that the judicial review committee considered irrelevant and inappropriate evidence.third,it erred in concluding that the judicial review committee was obligated to accept as true the findings of the hanford hospitals.fourth,it misapplied the substantial evidence rule.smith selma community hospital,supra,th at.
with respect to the mandamus proceeding,we stated that t he most significant controversy between the parties concerns the legal effect of the findings of the hanford hospitals.smith selma community hospital,supra,th at.sch position on this controversy was significant because it was intertwined with its commission of the four legal errors listed ante.consequently,our analysis of sch conduct in defending or litigating the suit will begin with its position on that issue,which it stated as follows 
t he selma judicial review committee was obligated to consider the hanford factual findings as conclusively proven.though this was set forth before the selma judicial review committee,the committee disregarded that position this required reversal by the selma governing board.smith selma community hospital,supra,th at.
this is among the positions that we will analyze to determine whether a sufficient factual and legal foundation exists and whether the conclusions derived from those positions are reasonable.
analysis of foundation 
factual foundation 
the primary factual assertions included in sch litigation position were the facts that the hanford hospitals reached decisions regarding privileges that were unfavorable to smith,the medical executive committee of sch relied on those decisions in recommending the termination of smith privileges,and the judicial review committee did not treat the decisions of the hanford hospitals as conclusive.there is no dispute that these factual assertions were supported by an adequate factual foundation 
therefore,we find that the factual assertions by sch were not without foundation for purposes of section.
legal foundation 
the legal foundation for the positions taken by sch in conducting the litigation includes the rules set forth in the bylaws of the medical staff of sch,the rules of law that govern the interpretation of written documents,and case law concerning the peer review process,the exhaustion of administrative and judicial remedies,and collateral estoppel.
the case law is identified in the declaration of jerry casheros,the attorney who represented sch in opposing the petition for writ of mandate before both the trial court and the court of appeal.those cases are johnson city of loma linda cal th,westlake community hosp.superior court cal d,hongsathavij queen of angels.medical center th,oskooi fountain valley regional hospital th,and webman little of mary hospital th.
neither the rules nor the case law relied upon by sch provides direct authority to support its position that the termination of a physician privileges based solely on another hospital peer review proceedings is per se reasonable and warranted for purposes of section,subdivision b.conversely,however,no published california case has stated that it is always unreasonable and unwarranted for a hospital to terminate a physician privileges based solely on another hospital peer review proceedings.
the absence of direct authority authorizing or prohibiting sch termination of smith privileges based solely on the results of the peer review proceedings by the hanford hospitals meant the parties had to support their specific position by presenting an analysis founded on general principles.we will evaluate the question whether that analysis was supported by an adequate legal foundation under the unreasonable criterion.we previously have recognized that there could be overlap between the three objective standards of section.see pt,ante.
reasonableness of sch legal analysis 
sch argued that the bylaws,specifically section of the sch medical staff regulations approved june,bylaws,granted its medical executive committee the discretion to consider a physician conduct at another hospital its medical executive committee acted within that discretion when it based its recommendation solely on the results of the peer review proceeding of the hanford hospitals and because the medical executive committee acted within its discretion,it follows that its recommendation was reasonable and warranted for purposes of section.
based on the discussion that follows,we conclude the reasoning process contained in this argument by sch is objectively reasonable because,at the time the argument was made,a reasonable attorney would have thought the argument tenable.
section of the bylaws states that r equests for clinical privileges shall be evaluated based on a number of listed factors,including information concerning clinical performance obtained from other institutions.sch argued that this provision authorized the medical executive committee to terminate a physician privileges based solely on occurrences at other institutions.
first,we conclude that section of the bylaws was ambiguous regarding the authority of the medical executive committee to rely solely on performance at other institutions in deciding whether to terminate a physician privileges.second,sch interpretation of the ambiguous provisions was neither unreasonable on its face nor rendered unreasonable by extrinsic evidence relevant to the meaning of section of the bylaws.although sch interpretation did not prevail,it was reasonable nonetheless and represented a tenable argument for why the medical executive committee recommendation was reasonable and why the judicial review committee erred in finding that the recommendation was unreasonable and unwarranted.
interpretation of judicial review committee decision 
in smith selma community hospital,supra,th,we upheld the judicial review committee finding that the results of peer review proceedings at the hanford hospitals,standing alone,did not provide a reasonable and warranted basis for terminating smith privileges.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,we interpreted the judicial review committee written decision as meaning that,in the circumstances of smith case,it was unreasonable to rely solely on the other hospital decision.id.at.we rejected a contrary interpretation of the judicial review committee sch medical executive committee could never revoke a physician privileges based solely on the adverse findings of another hospital.we discussed the ambiguity in the decision of the judicial review committee,however,and explicitly acknowledged that certain sentences in that decision could be interpreted as sch contends ibid.in other words,the ambiguity was reasonably susceptible to the interpretation advanced by sch.thus,it follows that the interpretation can not be deemed objectively unreasonable for purposes of section.
conclusive effect of decisions of hanford hospitals 
when sch opposed the petition for a writ of mandate and appealed the grant of the writ,there was no california authority explicitly authorizing or prohibiting an acute care hospital from terminating a physician privileges based solely on the results of the peer review proceedings of another hospital.the question presented here is whether sch position regarding the conclusive and binding effect of the decisions of the hanford hospitals was justified by a reasonable argument for the extension of existing law.
based on the argument presented in this appeal and this court familiarity with the positions taken by the parties in the appeal on the merits of the writ petition,we conclude that sch presented a tenable argument to support its position on an unresolved question of law.the advocated result was consistent with language used in some cases,and it was arguable whether that language should be applied to the context presented in this case.therefore,its positions were not unreasonable for purposes of section.
smith argues sch defense of the writ petition was frivolous because it lacked legal grounds and an evidentiary showing.as we have stated in a previous part of this opinion,however,sch arguments concerning the conclusive effect of the hanford decisions were not completely without merit.we therefore conclude the arguments also were not frivolous.
smith also contends that sch defense was frivolous because sch pursued the peer review proceeding solely because smith refused to dismiss his lawsuit against it.smith argues that this conduct violated the statutory requirement that a governing body and the medical staff shall act exclusively in the interest of maintaining and enhancing quality patient care,subd.d,italics added.in support,smith argues the judicial review committee found the hospital pursuit of the peer review proceedings was potentially financially motivated,which amounts to a finding that it was frivolous.
these arguments concern sch motives for defending the mandamus proceeding.consequently,they will be addressed in our discussion of improper motives under the bad faith criterion that follows.
viii.trial court determination of bad faith 
the trial court stated that smith motion for attorney fees was denied pursuant to the court holding in mir as the hospital position was not frivolous,unreasonable,without foundation,or in bad faith pursuant to section.
our review of the trial court determination regarding bad faith begins with considering whether the trial court applied the correct standard for bad faith and whether the trial court considered all of the evidence relevant to the inquiry into sch motives.neither of these questions was addressed in the court written order denying the motion.for the reasons that follow,we are concerned that the court may not have applied the correct standard and may not have considered relevant evidence.
application of correct legal standard 
no published decision,including mir,has defined the legal standard used to determine whether a defendant conduct in defending or litigating a lawsuit constitutes bad faith for purposes of section.as a result,the trial court did not have the benefit of precedent in deciding what standard to apply when making its determination regarding bad faith.
at the hearing on the motion for attorney fees,the trial court expressed concern that a hospital served with a mandamus action would be faced with the dilemma of capitulating or incurring liability for attorney fees.the court stated to avoid attorney fees they would have had to say,oh,my god,i cave in.i do oppose it.that ca be.
under the subjective standard of bad faith contained in section,however,this is exactly the position in which a hospital that defends the lawsuit based on an improper motive is placed.if it chooses to defend the mandamus proceeding for an improper motive,then it is liable for the attorney fees and costs that the plaintiff incurred as a result of that defense,even if it is able to find objectively reasonable support for its conduct.
contrary to this standard,the trial court may have believed that liability for attorney fees was negated if the defendant won on some of the points taken during its opposition of the mandamus proceeding.during the hearing,the trial court asked counsel for smith did they prevail,though,on some of their opposition the court then mentioned the cost bill and the contempt proceeding and asked are you saying that was all frivolous and in bad faith,too under the standard of bad faith adopted in this opinion,a defendant victories on some points raised during the lawsuit do not establish that the lawsuit was not defended for improper motives.
in addition,the court noted the lack of guidance as to the applicable legal standard when it stated that it was not clear from the majority and dissenting opinions in mir whether the elements set forth in section were separate and independent.although sch acknowledged that bad faith presented a subjective inquiry,it then mixed in an objective component by arguing that it had a reasonable belief that its positions had merit again,even if we assume that sch reasonably believed some or all of its positions had merit,it does not necessarily follow that it defended the mandamus proceeding for proper motives.
based on the lack of guiding precedent,the arguments presented to the trial court,and the transcript of the hearing,it appears that the trial court did not anticipate the legal standard for bad faith that is adopted in this opinion.consequently,we will remand so that the trial court can apply that legal standard to the relevant evidence.
consideration of relevant evidence 
the parties do not agree on how the trial court treated evidence of sch prelitigation conduct in reaching its decision to deny the motion for attorney fees.from our review of the hearing transcript and the trial court written order,we are unable to provide a definitive answer to this question.because this matter will be remanded for further proceedings,it is not necessary for this court to decide this question.on remand,the parties and the trial court can be guided by our discussion of relevant evidence set forth in part,ante.
determination of bad faith as a matter of law 
smith contends the undisputed facts establish that both sch conduct in defending the writ proceeding and its postjudgment conduct were in bad faith.in effect,smith is asking this court to apply a de novo standard of review and decide the issue of bad faith as a matter of law.thus,smith is requesting this court decide he is entitled to attorney fees and costs and remand only for a determination as to the amount of the fees.
based on these contentions raised by smith,we will address whether the evidence of improper motives is so strong that it can be determined as a matter of law.
this is not one of those rare cases in which direct proof of the defendant subjective state of mind was presented.instead,the determination of sch motives will depend upon inferences drawn from circumstantial evidence.see knight city of capitola,supra,th at.
in smith view,t he conclusive or indisputable facts demonstrate that sch had an improper motive in both defending and litigating the writ proceedings.the facts smith asserts are not in dispute include the bargain sch attempted to make in to obtain smith dismissal of a lawsuit in exchange for the hospital agreeing not to use the results of the hanford hospitals disciplinary proceeding against smith,the decisions of four courts to reinstate smith privileges at hospitals operated by adventist health,and the september decision of the superior court that characterized as troubling central valley general hospital using the possibility of loss of hospital privileges as a bargaining chip in its efforts to secure favorable terms for the purchase of the licentiate practice 
although these facts support the inference that sch decided to defend the mandamus proceeding based on an improper motive,we conclude that the inference is not necessarily compelled by the evidence.for example,the terms of the settlement offer reflected in the may,minutes of sch medical executive committee are difficult to reconcile with its later position in this litigation that patient safety required it to treat the findings made in the disciplinary proceeding of the hanford hospitals as binding.nevertheless,at least two inferences are possible.one inference is that the motives underlying the settlement offer were improper,but by the time sch had to decide whether to defend this lawsuit,its motive had changed to a proper one.alternatively,as argued by smith,one can infer that the motives underlying the settlement offer were improper and that the same improper motives caused sch to defend this lawsuit.
we will not decide that the inferences urged by smith should be adopted as a matter of law on the record presented.instead,the trial court,sitting as the trier of fact,should decide which inferences to draw in determining the factual question of motives after the parties have had the opportunity to present arguments using the legal standard for bad faith adopted in this opinion.
proceedings on remand 
in mir,the majority decided that the question whether the hospital defense of the mandamus proceeding was unreasonable or without foundation for purposes of section would be redetermined pursuant to a noticed motion.mir,supra,th at.as guidance,the court stated that,like motions generally,the conduct of the hearing on the motion was within the trial court discretion and the hospital was not prevented from subpoenaing and producing evidence and witnesses or otherwise defending against the request.id.at.
here,we conclude that a similar approach should be employed.prior to the first hearing,neither the parties nor the trial court had notice of the legal standard for determining bad faith and the evidence relevant to the application of that standard.as a result,the arguments and evidence were not developed using the subjective standard that focused on the defendant motives.for example,sch argued its settlement proposal was not relevant.consequently,it did not offer any evidence of the motives underlying the proposal,any explanation for how that proposal was consistent with its later position that patient safety necessitated the termination of smith privileges,or any evidence regarding a change in motives between when the proposal was made and when the decision was made to defend the lawsuit.by remanding this matter for a hearing on a noticed motion,sch will not be disadvantaged by not knowing the exact standard that will be applied and will have an opportunity to present evidence that may affect the inferences that are drawn from their settlement proposal and other prelitigation conduct.similarly,on remand neither the trial court nor smith will labor under uncertainty regarding the applicable standard.
therefore,in remanding this matter,we will direct the trial court to address the question of bad faith pursuant to a noticed motion that gives both parties the opportunity to present evidence relevant to the motives of sch in defending the lawsuit and taking specific conduct in litigating the lawsuit.
ix.judicial notice of entire record of prior appeal 
in an order filed april,this court notified the parties that it proposed,on its own motion,to take judicial notice of the entire appellate record in case no,which resulted in the opinion published as smith selma community hospital,supra,th.the order gave the parties an opportunity to respond.see,subd.a.smith stated that he had no objection.sch responded by asserting to the extent that the appellate record includes the administrative record,such materials are irrelevant and not properly considered by this court.
we reject sch theory of irrelevance as objectively unreasonable.first,the administrative record is relevant because it provides the factual foundation for the positions taken by the parties in the litigation.second,it is relevant to the question of bad faith because sch conduct during the administrative proceeding provides circumstantial evidence regarding its motives in defending the mandamus proceeding.accordingly,we grant our own motion and take judicial notice of the entire appellate record in the case no.
disposition 
the order denying attorney fees is reversed and the matter remanded to the trial court for further proceedings on the question whether smith is entitled to attorney fees and costs under section on the ground of bad faith.the further proceedings shall include a noticed motion at which the parties shall have the opportunity to present evidence and arguments relating to the application of the subjective standard of bad faith set forth in this opinion.smith shall recover his costs on appeal.
all further statutory references are to the business and professions code unless otherwise indicated.
this description,however,should not be read as containing all of the facts and circumstances from which inferences can be drawn regarding state of mind or motive of sch and its affiliates.
the parent company,adventist health,owns many hospitals,including sch,hanford community medical center,and central valley general hospital collectively,adventist health.for purposes of this opinion,we will refer to hanford community medical center and central valley general hospital,both of which are located in hanford,as the hanford hospitals.
the threat of join us or suffer the consequences is not new in the medical profession.see,patrick burget.
in smith view,adventist health pursued a course of action designed to eliminate him as a competitor.adventist health started by telling him to join their medical group or be run out of town.next,it offered to buy him out.when that offer was rejected,it attempted to revoke his privileges at sch.when that attempt failed,it reverted to the plan of buying out his practice.
the discussions were heated.for instance,adventist health told smith that it would see him in a federal penitentiary within six months.smith adventist health th.
