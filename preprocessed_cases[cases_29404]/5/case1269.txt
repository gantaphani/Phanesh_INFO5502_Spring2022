the equal access to justice act eaja,b,authorizes a district court to award attorney fees against the government under the bad faith exception to the common law american rule that each party bear the financial burden of civil litigation regardless of its outcome.the government acts in bad faith when its claim is entirely without color and has been asserted wantonly,for purposes of harassment or delay,or other improper reason.federal deposit ins.schuchmann,cir.in this case,we must decide whether b bad faith exception justified a limited award of attorney fees against plaintiff federal trade commission ftc and in favor of defendant mark haroldsen haroldsen.the district court thought so we do not,and reverse.
the ftc brought this action in.in its first amended complaint,the ftc alleged defendants,a group of interrelated corporations and individuals including haroldsen,had engaged in unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of,a,of the federal trade commission act ftc act codified at according to the ftc,defendants from january onward made a variety of misrepresentations likely to mislead consumers regarding projected income from numerous business ventures which defendants promoted and sold.defendants sold,among other things,small vending machines which offered a handful of candy for a quarter.defendants sales approached million per year at their peak.counts i through viii of the ftc complaint alleged defendants provided fraudulent income projections to consumers in various infomercials,print ads,and seminars.counts ix and x alleged defendants engaged in false or deceptive consumer telemarketing.counts xi through xvi alleged defendants used atypical,false,inapplicable success stories and testimonials to reflect the ordinary experiences of satisfied consumers.the ftc sought injunctive relief and consumer redress against defendants under b of the ftc act,b.
the ftc complaint further alleged haroldsen,as the majority shareholder of all corporate defendants by way of a family trust,had the authority to control the acts and practices of each of the corporate defendants,including the content of sales materials and presentations.the ftc specifically averred 
at all times relevant to this complaint,haroldsen has had or should have had knowledge of the content of the sales materials and sales presentations described including specifically the language cited in counts one through sixteen,and has known or should have known that the representations described in counts one through sixteen were and are false and misleading.haroldsen has failed to exercise his authority over the acts and practices described in counts one through sixteen.defendant mark haroldsen is,therefore,liable for redress to all persons who purchased a business starter kit or related product or service from any of the corporate defendants at any time from january,to the present.
between may and october,the ftc entered into consent judgments with ten defendants.an eleventh defendant filed bankruptcy.the judgments imposed injunctive relief upon each defendant.defendants also were required to submit financial statements that established their inability to pay consumer redress.furthermore,each judgment provided the court would impose a dollar judgment against any defendant that submitted a false financial statement.
with an october,bench trial looming,the ftc and only remaining in settlement discussions.counsel for the two parties tentatively agreed on a settlement consisting of injunctive relief and in consumer redress.the ftc board,however,rejected the settlement.subsequently,the district court entered an order on october,directing all parties and counsel with final authority to appear at the court and participate in a mandatory settlement conference counsel and parties will be requested to report to the court throughout the day on any progress made.on october,the date of the conference,counsel appeared on behalf of the ftc.no member of the ftc board authorized to settle the case appeared.rather,the ftc board authorized counsel to settle only if haroldsen would pay million in consumer redress.haroldsen rejected the ftc offer and the case did not settle.
on october,five days prior to trial,haroldsen moved to dismiss counts ix through xvi of the ftc complaint.haroldsen argued the counts failed to plead fraud with particularity under.b.in the alternative,haroldsen filed a motion in limine seeking to severely restrict the ftc trial evidence on all counts.the district court denied haroldsen motion to dismiss as beyond the deadline for dispositive motions,but granted his motion in limine.the court concluded counts ix through xvi are not alleged with the specificity or particularity required by.b.the court thus barred the ftc from introducing any evidence in support of those counts.the court concluded the ftc had pled counts i through viii with particularity.nevertheless,the court restricted the ftc evidence only to those acts and practices alleged with particularity in the first amended complaint.
on the first day of trial,the ftc sought to introduce the testimony of four consumers who had purchased businesses from the corporate defendants after listening to their sales pitch.the court excluded three of the consumers testimony,however,because none of the three could verify they actually heard the allegedly misleading statements specifically pled in counts i through viii of the complaint.the fourth consumer testified he did not earn near the income which defendants represented he would earn.on the second day of trial,the ftc presented three witnesses.the first two witnesses testified regarding defendants allegedly false statements that individuals purchasing vending machine businesses could expect monthly income of per machine.the third witness testified regarding haroldsen involvement in defendants corporate affairs.the ftc again presented three witnesses on the third day of trial.two witnesses testified regarding haroldsen involvement in corporate affairs.the third witness testified regarding the basis for the income figure.on the final day of the ftc,the ftc presented the testimony of two corporate officers.the officers testified haroldsen was well aware of defendants alleged misrepresentations.the ftc final witness was defendants human resources director.he testified haroldsen was involved in many aspects of defendants business operations.
at the close of the ftc case,haroldsen moved for judgment on partial findings pursuant to.c.the district court granted haroldsen motion and subsequently entered written findings and conclusions.the court found the ftc failed to introduce any credible evidence that haroldsen engaged in deceptive acts or practices by misrepresenting the income potential of defendants products and services,had authority to control any alleged deceptive acts or practices of defendants,and either knew or should have known of any material misrepresentations made by defendants.
notably,the district court order concluded with findings the ftc refused to participate in good faith in settlement discussions prior to the trial in disregard of the court orders,and the ftc prosecution of this case has been conducted in bad faith,vexatiously,wantonly and for oppressive reasons.the court reiterated the latter finding in its conclusions of law.the district court separate judgment specifically stated the ftc prosecution of this action has been undertaken in bad faith,vexatiously,wantonly and for oppressive reasons.the ftc moved the court to amend the judgment by deleting this language,and to delete the latter two findings from its findings and conclusions as beyond the scope of the evidence and contrary to procedural safeguards.the district court amended the judgment,but did not,based on the record,disturb its findings 
haroldsen subsequently moved for attorney fees and expenses pursuant to b.the ftc response addressed both the course of the litigation and the evidence it was prepared to introduce absent the court order granting haroldsen motion in limine.following a hearing,the court imposed attorney fees against the ftc,explaining 
c ontinued pursuit of the ftc claims against defendant haroldsen may have been deemed appropriate through the close of discovery july.however,after said closure,the ftc evaluation of the evidence is found to be unreasonable,and any further pursuit of haroldsen is found to be based upon his ability to pay rather than upon the merit of any appropriate claim,and is accordingly found to be an improper purpose and in bad faith.
the court is persuaded further by haroldsen statement that after contact with hundreds of consumers,identified by the ftc as injured parties,none had been contacted by the ftc or claimed injury nor were planning or subpoenaed to come to trial.without consumer injury,the ftc had no claim and no basis upon which to proceed against haroldsen,thus the court conclusion of an improper motive 
thereafter,the court entered written findings and conclusions.a large portion of the court findings addressed settlement negotiations between the ftc and haroldsen.according to the court,the ftc made exorbitant and unsupported settlement demands based on false claims it could prove damages against haroldsen in the amount of million through the testimony of hundreds of injured consumers prepared to testify as to defendants deceptive acts and practices.the court further noted no one from the ftc with final authority appeared at the mandatory settlement conference in october.
as to the ftc substantive case against haroldsen,the court found the ftc utterly failed to introduce sufficient probative evidence in support of its allegations.the court reiterated many of its findings previously entered on haroldsen rule c motion,including its finding the ftc failed to introduce any evidence of consumer injury.the court concluded 
after july,at the latest,the evidence,or lack of it,demonstrates that this action was maintained maliciously and without probable cause because the ftc allegations could not be reasonably supported by the evidence.instead,the ftc acted with knowledge of the absence of evidence,particularly after the ftc had closed discovery,and apparently maintained the action for the purpose of annoying,embarrassing and threatening haroldsen evidently as a means of gaining leverage to demand settlement monies.
the court awarded haroldsen in fees,expenses,and costs,from which the ftc appeals.the ftc agrees to costs totaling.thus,the ftc actually objects to of the award.we have jurisdiction under.

a claim is entirely without color when it lacks any legal or factual basis.conversely,a claim is colorable when it has some legal and factual support,considered in light of the reasonable beliefs of the party making the claim.the question is whether a reasonable plaintiff could have concluded that facts supporting the claim might be established,not whether such facts actually had been established.thus,we note that a claim that fails as a matter of law is not necessarily lacking any basis at all.a claim is colorable when it reasonably might be successful,while a claim lacks a colorable basis when it is utterly devoid of a legal or factual basis.

in this case,the ftc charged haroldsen with sixteen counts of violating of the ftc act through defendants use of infomercials,print ads,seminars,telemarketing,and testimonials.among other things,declares unlawful deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.see california state bd.of optometry federal trade comm n,tracing history.the primary purpose of is to lessen the harsh effects of caveat emptor.such rule can no longer be relied upon as a means of rewarding fraud and deception and has been replaced by a rule which gives to the consumer the right to rely upon representations of facts as the truth.federal trade comm sterling drug,cir internal citation omitted see also federal trade comm standard educ.soc y.consumer protection laws are made to protect the trusting as well as the suspicious.because the primary purpose of is to protect the consumer public rather than to punish the wrongdoer,the intent to deceive the consumer is not an element of a violation.see federal trade comm amy travel,cir united states johnson,cir.instead,the cardinal factor in determining whether an act or practice is deceptive under is the likely effect the promoter handiwork will have on the mind of the ordinary consumer.sterling drug,at 
in the court pretrial order signed and entered on the first day of trial,the ftc specifically sought both injunctive relief and ancillary relief in the form of consumer redress against haroldsen under b of the ftc act to obtain injunctive relief against an individual for a business entity acts or practices,the ftc first must prove the entity violated.see federal trade comm think achievement,d,aff,cir.the ftc must further show the individual participated directly in the business entity deceptive acts or practices,or had the authority to control them.see federal trade comm publishing clearing house,cir.to obtain consumer redress against an individual subject to injunctive relief under b,the ftc must proffer evidence tending to show consumers actually relied on the entity deceptive acts or practices to their detriment.see federal trade comm figgie int l,cir.the ftc also must establish the individual knew or should have known of the entity misrepresentations.see amy travel,at.we discuss these elements of the ftc case against haroldsen in turn and apply each to the ftc evidence in this case.
to hold an individual personally liable for a business entity misrepresentations,the ftc first must prove an underlying violation.see think achievement,d at.section,consistent with its purpose,requires the ftc to show the business entity made material representations likely to mislead ordinary consumers to their detriment.see federal trade comm tashman,cir federal trade comm world travel vacation brokers,cir southwest sunsites,federal trade comm n,cir.misrepresentations concerning anticipated income from a business opportunity generally are material and likely to mislead consumers because such misrepresentations strike at the heart of a consumer purchasing decision.see federal trade comm kitco of nevada,citing goodman federal trade comm n,cir.neither proof of consumer reliance nor consumer injury is necessary to establish a violation.see think achievement,d at.otherwise,the law would preclude the ftc from taking preemptive action against those responsible for deceptive acts or practices,contrary to prophylactic purpose.
in this case,the record reveals defendants consistently represented the average monthly income from one small vending machine would approximate.the evidence,however,showed defendants figure was inflated.at trial,a consumer witness testified his machines earned considerably less than the amount defendants represented while the evidence did show some machines earned or better per month,depending on their location,such earnings were not the norm.gary buehner,an operator of a vending machine business independent of defendants,testified haroldsen personally contacted him in to substantiate the income figure.buehner testified his average monthly income per machine was.joe larkin,a market surveyor for defendants,testified the average income from defendants vending machines was in the low thirties.other witnesses,whose testimony we will not detail here,also testified the figure was inflated.certainly,the ftc claim that defendants violated by making material misrepresentations in the form of exaggerated income projections likely to deceive ordinary consumers is not without record support and thus not without color.compare federal trade comm wolf,wl,unpublished holding defendants violated by misrepresenting expected earnings from a vending machine business.
the district court finding that haroldsen never personally misrepresented the income to be derived from defendants products and services is beside the point because the law did not require the ftc to make such a such showing.to justify the imposition of injunctive relief against the individual,the ftc is required to show the individual participated directly in the business entity deceptive acts or practices,or had the authority to control such acts or practices.see publishing clearing house,at.a showing of participation or control justifies injunctive relief against an individual if in the public interest,notwithstanding the fact business operations deceptive acts and practices may have ceased.it is settled that an action for an injunction does not become moot merely because the conduct complained of has terminated,if there is a possibility of recurrence.allee medrano,d.otherwise the defendant is free to return to his old ways.united states grant.see also beneficial federal trade comm n,cir explaining a court may order a prior deceptive practice to cease and desist if the practice could be resumed fedders federal trade comm n,cir explaining injunctive relief may extend to a discontinued deceptive practice where the public interest requires.
once the ftc presented evidence defendants violated,it only had to show haroldsen had the authority to control defendants to establish its case for injunctive relief against him.see publishing clearing house,at think achievement,d at.sam burggraaf,defendants human resources director,testified that during the relevant time period,haroldsen attended marketing committee meetings frequently and everybody danced to his tune.in particular,burggraaf testified e verybody knew that haroldsen was the principal shareholder of the company and his opinions and advice and direction were listened to very carefully and were generally followed or heeded.haroldsen response in one particular instance where burggraaf established a company wide united way campaign without his knowledge is illustrative of haroldsen authority to control defendants 
a.after we had instituted it,haroldsen came into my office and was upset that we had instituted it without talking to him.he indicated that he did not have a favorable view of the united way and that he did not want that program in his company.
and what happened 
a.we discontinued the program.
emphasis added.burggraaf further testified haroldsen was extensively involved in the hiring of senior management and seminar directors.
despite haroldsen efforts to separate himself from defendants,haroldsen was the controlling shareholder of the corporate defendants in other words,he owned the corporate defendants.consequently,a substantial inference exists that haroldsen had the authority to control the deceptive acts and practices carried on in the name of his corporations.see standard educators,federal trade comm n.the district court finding the ftc failed to introduce any evidence that haroldsen had the authority to control the acts and practices of the defendant corporations with respect to any alleged deceptive act or practice is not supported by the record.emphasis added.the ftc evidence supports an inference that haroldsen had the authority to control defendants deceptive acts and practices.evidence of haroldsen authority to control defendants coupled with evidence suggesting defendants violated compels us to conclude the ftc presented both a legal and factual basis for injunctive relief against haroldsen in the district court.
to establish a right to consumer redress against an individual with the authority to control a business entity,the ftc faces a somewhat higher evidentiary burden.while proof of consumer reliance is unnecessary to establish a violation and the accompanying right to injunctive relief against the individual under b,such proof is necessary to establish the right to consumer redress.see figgie int l,at.the ftc is not required,however,to show any particular purchaser actually relied on or was injured by the unlawful misrepresentations 
proof of reliance by the consumer upon defendants misrepresentations is a traditional element of recovery under common law fraud actions.section of the ftc act differs from a private suit for fraud,however.section serves a public purpose by authorizing the commission to seek redress on behalf of injured consumers.requiring proof of subjective reliance by each individual consumer would thwart effective prosecutions of large consumer redress actions and frustrate the statutory goals of the section.
id.quoting kitco.at accord federal trade comm security rare coin bullion,cir.to raise a presumption of reliance,the ftc need only show the business entity made material misrepresentations likely to deceive consumers,those misrepresentations were widely disseminated,and consumers purchased the entity products.federal trade comm kuykendall,cir en banc see also mcgregor chierico,cir figgie int l,at security rare coin,at.
in this case,the ftc proffered evidence suggesting it could establish a presumption of consumer reliance.based on evidence of defendants misrepresentations,as discussed above,and enormous sales figures,we may safely assume defendants widely disseminated those misrepresentations and consumers purchased defendants products.haroldsen acknowledged more than consumers tested or used defendants business opportunity.by,defendants sales approached million.during the same period,attendance at defendants seminars approached consumers per week.such evidence,viewed in light of the applicable law,certainly suggests consumers relied on defendants misrepresentations see kuykendall,at.
as to the extent of injury resulting from consumer reliance,the court pretrial order stated the ftc was prepared to prove consumer injury in the amount of figure consistent with the ftc earlier injury claim.the ftc derived this figure from defendants tax documents which showed that from through,defendants net sales totaled over million.haroldsen acknowledges that b etween and sales grew from million to million.despite this evidence,the district court concluded no evidence of consumer injury existed and without consumer injury,the ftc had no cl
