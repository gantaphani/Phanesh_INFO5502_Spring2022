john warner appeals orders denying his motion for attorney fees on appeal under code of civil procedure section and taxing costs on appeal.we affirm.
background 
we are familiar with the background of this case through our review of two previous appeals in this action musaelian adams july,nonpub.opn.musaelian i and musaelian adams may,nonpub.opn.musaelian iii,and an appeal in the underlying action reiter musaelian june,nonpub.opn.reiter.
in musaelian ii,our supreme court summarized the background of this controversy as follows plaintiff mary musaelian is married to andrew musaelian.joseph reiter,represented by attorney william adams,brought suit against andrew musaelian and andrew musaelian business,attorney legal research alr,seeking damages for conduct relating to litigation between reiter and one of alr clients.reiter obtained default judgments against both andrew musaelian and alr.reiter then sought partial satisfaction of the judgments by means of a forced sale of a residence andrew musaelian owned jointly with plaintiff.plaintiff sought to avoid the sale by filing a third party claim of ownership of the residence,but the superior court denied her claim.plaintiff and andrew musaelian sought to protect their home by filing for chapter relief in the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of california.reiter 
plaintiff,represented by attorney john warner,then 
the trial court sustained defendants demurrers without leave to amend.it later granted the motions for sanctions,finding reiter had been the prevailing party throughout the state court proceedings,no reasonable person or party could have believed plaintiff lawsuit had merit,and it was clear the suit was 
warner and mary musaelian appealed the sanction order.mary musaelian thereafter reached a settlement with reiter,and this court dismissed the appeal as to her,leaving only warner as an appellant.musaelian i,supra,at.we reversed the award of attorney fees to adams,concluding that because adams had represented himself,he had not incurred attorney fees for purposes of sanctions under section.we also concluded mary musaelian action was not frivolous.our supreme court granted review,and affirmed our judgment musaelian ii,supra,cal th at.
a remittitur issued from this court,which provided that appellant was to recover his costs on appeal.warner thereupon submitted a memorandum of costs on appeal,seeking in costs.among the costs warner claimed was in attorney fees.warner also 
the trial court denied warner motion for attorney fees on the ground that the moving papers were inadequate,and granted in part the motion to tax costs,setting warner recoverable costs at.warner appealed these orders.
ii.discussion 
attorney fees 
warner contends attorney fees should have been awarded under section.section,subdivision b,provides that by presenting a pleading,petition,notice of motion,or other similar paper to the court,an attorney or unrepresented party is certifying that to the best of the person knowledge,information,and belief,after reasonable inquiry,the paper is not being presented primarily for an improper purpose,such as harassment or unnecessary delay or increase in cost the legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension,modification,or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law,the factual contentions have or are likely to have evidentiary support,and the denials are warranted either by the evidence or are reasonably based on lack of information or belief.
section,subdivision c,upon which warner relies for his claim of attorney fees,provides in pertinent part if,after notice and a reasonable opportunity to respond,the court determines that subdivision b has been violated,the court may,subject to the conditions stated below,impose an appropriate sanction upon the attorneys,law firms,or parties that have violated subdivision b or are responsible for the violation.in determining what sanctions,if any,should be ordered,the court shall consider whether a party seeking sanctions has exercised due diligence.a motion for sanctions under this section shall be made separately from other motions or requests and shall describe the specific conduct alleged to violate subdivision b if warranted,the court may award to the party prevailing on the motion the reasonable expenses and attorney fees incurred in presenting or opposing the motion.italics added.
the trial court based its denial on the request for attorney fees on warner failure to invoke section,describe the specific sanction being sought,or name the parties to whom it was addressed.the court stated,a judge ought not be required to search a memorandum of points and authorities or supporting declarations to determine the justification for making some order which is not specified in the moving papers,by which a potentially serious sanction might be imposed upon a lawyer or party not identified in the moving parties,supported by a mandatory code civ.proc,sub.e description of the conduct determined to justify the sanction imposed.this judge declines to do so.warner argues the trial court erroneously treated his request for attorney fees as an independent motion for sanctions rather than a request for fees incurred in opposing adams motion for sanctions and erred in failing to consider his request on the merits as a result of the procedural defects.he asks us to direct the trial court to consider the merits of his claim for attorney fees.
we reject warner invitation to reverse the trial court decision on this issue.first,as warner concedes,the notice of motion did not comply with california rules of court,rule d,under which a motion must identify the party or parties bringing the motion,name the parties to whom it was addressed,briefly state the basis for the motion and the relief sought,and state the specific portion of any pleading that is challenged.in particular,the notice of motion did not mention the statutory basis of the motion,section.
even assuming the trial court erred in not excusing these procedural defects,an award of attorney fees would not be proper.attorney fees may be awarded to the party prevailing on a motion for sanctions under section only i f warranted.ibid.the parties have drawn our attention to no california case discussing when such an award is warranted,and our own research has disclosed none.we may look for guidance,however,to cases construing the virtually identical provision of rule of the federal rules of civil procedure rule,upon which section was modeled.board of trustees superior court th.as stated in safe strap,koala d,in discussing the provision in question,the filing of a motion for sanctions is itself subject to the requirements of rule and can lead to sanctions.attorney fees incurred in defending against a rule motion are infrequently granted where the motion was not clearly frivolous,
although adams was ultimately unsuccessful in his motion for sanctions,his motion was not frivolous.we would be hard pressed to conclude otherwise,in light of the fact that the trial court ruled in his favor.see roberts sentry life insurance th,denial of summary judgment motion establishes probable cause to sue.moreover,in reversing the trial court order,we did not rely simply on established law rather,we disagreed with two published appellate decisions,concluding that a different result was compelled by an earlier decision of the california supreme court,and in musaelian ii our high court disapproved those decisions.musaelian ii,supra,cal th at,disapproving laborde aronson th and abandonato coldren th,and following trope katz cal th see also musaelian iii,supra,at.in the circumstances,attorney fees for warner costs in opposing the motion for sanctions are not warranted.
apportionment of costs 
among the costs on appeal claimed by warner were in filing fees and for preparation of the reporter transcript.the trial court reduced these amounts by half,to reflect the portion of the costs for which mary musaelian who had originally been an appellant before being dismissed voluntarily was responsible.warner contends the trial court exceeded its authority in apportioning costs in this manner.
the right to recover costs on appeal is governed by california rules of court,rule rule.see lavine jessup d,lavine.rule a provides in part except as provided in this rule,the party prevailing in the court of appeal in a civil case other than a juvenile case is entitled to costs on appeal in the interests of justice,the court of appeal may also award or deny costs as it deems proper.the right to recover costs depends on four conditions there must be a valid judgment awarding costs to the party claiming them the item must be one allowed by rule or statute the amount claimed must have been actually incurred the amount claimed must be reasonable.wilson board of retirement d,discussing entitlement to costs on appeal.
interpreting a predecessor to this rule,the court in ramirez paul fire marine ins.th,ramirez,faced the question of whether,when an appellate court simply awards costs to one of the parties to an appeal without further direction,the trial court on a motion to tax costs is empowered to apportion those costs among the opposing parties.id.at.the court concluded the authority to apportion costs among the opposing parties resided only in the court of appeal,stating,it has long been settled that an appellate court by its judgment determines the final award of costs on appeal who shall recover the same,and the trial court determines the specific judgment what items of costs the entitled party may recover under the general award citation.citation.when an appellate court directs in its opinion that the appellant is to recover its costs on appeal,no one,neither the lower court nor any of the unsuccessful respondents is entitled to overrule the court by analyzing its order awarding costs and in part setting aside the order for judgment.citation.consequently,a losing party seeking an allocation of costs on appeal must direct its request to the appellate court.further,the request should normally be made before the court loses its jurisdiction over the matter by issuance of the remittitur.citations.id.at.
the court in ramirez distinguished schwartz schwartz d schwartz,and other cases that concluded that a trial court,although not empowered to modify an appellate court award of costs,may nonetheless endeavor to resolve ambiguities in it ramirez,supra,th at on the ground that in those cases,the appellate court did not mention costs in its opinion.the court went on,the remittitur in those cases was found to be ambiguous and therefore subject to interpretation by the trial court.the ambiguity arose not from the remittitur itself but from the appellate court failure to address the subject of costs.see also schwartz,supra,d at the interpretation of a remittitur requires that the court opinion be consulted,especially in case of ambiguity citations,and that meaning given to it which harmonizes with the court ruling.accord in re marriage of jovel th,where appellate court awarded costs to prevailing party,trial court did not have authority to apportion costs among opposing parties.
warner contends this case is governed by the rule of ramirez,and that the trial court lacked authority to apportion costs on appeal between himself and mary musaelian.this case differs from ramirez in at least one important respect the issue here is not whether the trial court has authority to apportion costs among losing parties,but whether the trial court has authority to interpret the remittitur to allow to the prevailing party only those costs that were reasonably attributable to that party as we have noted,mary musaelian was originally a party to musaelian i,but was dismissed from the appeal at her request after the record on appeal had been 
interest on cash deposit in lieu of appeal bond 
procedural background 
after appealing from the award of sanctions at issue in musaelian i and musaelian ii,mary musaelian and warner on january,deposited in lieu of a bond,pursuant to section,subd.a.as part of his memorandum of costs on appeal,warner sought as o ther expenses reasonably necessary to secure surety bond.the attached worksheet showed that the claimed costs were based on interest on the cash deposit at the rate of percent a year adams challenged this item in his motion to tax costs on the ground that interest on a cash deposit was not recoverable,arguing warner had not obtained a loan or incurred interest expenses in tendering the cash deposit to the court 
in his opposition to the motion to tax costs,warner argued that he was entitled to interest at the legal rate of percent per year in support of his opposition,he submitted a declaration attaching redacted statements from washington mutual bank,which he said showed that the average rate of interest charged by the bank for his line of credit during the relevant period of time was percent per year.the statements included a statement with the account number redacted out,and an entry for a check advance in the amount of on february.they also included three statements for warner wamu equity plus account one for the period of january,through february,showing the names and address of warner and geraldine warner,and an annual percentage rate of percent one for the period of january,through february,showing an annual percentage rate of percent and one for the period of february,through march,showing an annual percentage rate of percent.these statements are otherwise virtually fully redacted,and do not show what amounts were owed on the line of credit or how much interest was paid.neither do we see anything in these statements that show they are from the same account as the check.the opposition included two alternative memorandum of cost worksheets,one calculating the interest at the rate of percent,this time for a total of,and one using the washington mutual line of credit rate of percent,for a total of.
in his reply,adams argued that warner had not presented admissible evidence showing he borrowed the cash deposit or the actual interest expense he incurred.after adams had 
the motion was argued on june.at the hearing,the judge indicated he had not yet received warner supplemental declaration.two weeks later,on june,warner 
the trial court issued its order taxing costs on appeal on june,the court stated that it was disregarding warner may,supplemental declaration as untimely.the court went on notwithstanding the foregoing,however,the conclusion is reached that there has not been provided an evidentiary showing of sufficient clarity and reliability to demonstrate that the claimed item for interest represents an expense reasonably and necessarily incurred by warner in order to fund the deposit in lieu of undertaking on appeal given for the support of his appeal,as differentiated from the appeal of mary musaelian.accordingly,the component of is disallowed in its entirety.the second component of item is remaining deposit of.this claim appears to be a claim for the remainder of a cash deposit in lieu of an appeal bond given by musaelian and warner on january,after its partial appropriation pursuant to an order 
warner contends on appeal that this ruling was error,and the trial court should have awarded him interest on the deposit.as we have explained,the right to recover costs on appeal is governed by rule,which does not mention interest on a loan used to fund a cash deposit as a cost item.however,one recoverable item is t he cost to procure a surety bond,including the premium and the cost to obtain a letter of credit as collateral,unless the trial court determines the bond was unnecessary.rule d f.
the court in cooper westbrook torrey hills th cooper,concluded that,although the expense of making a cash deposit was not explicitly mentioned in the governing rule,the appellant there was nevertheless entitled to the reasonable and necessary interest expenses associated with making his cash deposit in lieu of a bond.under former rule c a predecessor to rule,among the recoverable costs on appeal we
