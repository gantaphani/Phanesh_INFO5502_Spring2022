lucent technologies lucent appeals the district court order confirming an arbitration award entered in favor of schoenduve corporation schoenduve.lucent asks this court to vacate or modify the arbitration award claiming that the arbitrator exceeded his authority by ruling on an issue not submitted by the parties,modified or expanded the unambiguous language of the agreement requiring arbitration,and failed to provide lucent an opportunity to rebut schoenduve claim for commissions under a or estoppel theory.lucent also asks us to vacate the portion of the arbitrator decision awarding attorneys fees to schoenduve as a manifest disregard of the law.because the arbitrator stayed within the bounds of his authority in applying new york substantive law as the parties had contractually agreed,and made a good faith effort to apply the applicable provisions of the california civil code to the award of attorneys fees,we affirm.
lucent is a manufacturer of wireless communication products and schoenduve is a manufacturer sales representative.on august,lucent entered into a manufacturer representative agreement mra with schoenduve,authorizing schoenduve to solicit orders for lucent wireless communication products from original equipment manufacturers oems in northern california and nevada.
beginning in december,schoenduve worked to procure a sale of lucent wireless communication products to apple computer on december,two days before it signed an initial agreement with apple computer,lucent terminated the mra and its relationship with schoenduve lucent and apple computer finalized the agreement for the sale and purchase of lucent wireless communication products in july.the supply contract was worth millions of dollars to lucent.
schoenduve filed suit in santa clara county superior court on may,seeking unpaid commissions for its role in procuring the apple transaction.the mra contained an arbitration clause that applied to any dispute aris ing out of or relat ing to th e mra,or its breach.lucent removed the case to federal court,where the district court granted lucent motion to compel arbitration.
as required by the commercial arbitration rules of the aaa,schoenduve filed a demand for arbitration in order to initiate the arbitration proceedings.the demand for arbitration was very broad,describing the nature of the dispute as an action to recover those commissions,interest and other damages arising from the wrongful conduct of lucent.schoenduve claimed to ha ve substantial damages arising from breach of contract and other claims against lucent,including lucent failure to disclose and account for substantial monies owed to schoenduve.
throughout the arbitration,lucent argued that the mra governed the entire transaction and that,pursuant to the termination provisions of the mra,schoenduve was not entitled to any commissions for the apple transaction.schoenduve disagreed.it argued that the boilerplate provisions of the mra did not apply to the design win apple transaction rather,it argued that only the appendices of the mra,which contained no termination provision,governed this transaction.
the parties participated in days of arbitration hearings spread out over approximately eight months in new york,new york,the venue established by the mra.the arbitrator issued his written opinion on july.he rejected schoenduve claim for commissions under the unambiguous terms of the mra.furthermore,the arbitrator ruled that lucent had an unfettered contractual right to terminate schoenduve representation on days notice and that this precluded any argument that lucent acted in bad faith or had breached a duty of good faith and fair dealing.
although lucent prevailed on all claims specifically arising out of the mra,the arbitrator subsequently concluded that the mra did not apply to this type of whale sized transaction.consequently,he found that since lucent form of mra was not intended to cover this type of transaction,and did not in fact cover it,schoenduve wa s entitled to recover compensation pursuant to the legal doctrine recognized in new york of.alternatively,the arbitrator ruled that because lucent had excluded schoenduve from the negotiations only after lucent sales manager had become involved,lucent should be estopped to deny schoenduve entitlement to commissions it worked for and earned.
the arbitrator held that although lucent did not willfully fail to enter into a written contract,it did fail to enter into a written contract that covered the apple transaction.lucent therefore violated california civil code,which requires all manufacturers to enter into a written contract with their representatives.because schoenduve was the prevailing party,the arbitrator also awarded schoenduve attorneys fees and costs under california civil code.

the strict procedural requirements that govern litigation in federal courts do not apply to arbitration.arbitration offers flexibility,an expeditious result,and is relatively inexpensive when compared to litigation.gilmer,at.b y agreeing to arbitrate,a party trades the procedures and opportunity for review of the courtroom for the simplicity,informality,and expedition of arbitration.quoting mitsubishi motors soler,d kyocera trade,cir en banc stating that arbitration was designed to respond to the wishes of the parties more flexibly and expeditiously than the federal courts uniform rules of procedure allow pack concrete,cunningham,cir describing congressional policy in favor of expeditious and relatively inexpensive means of settling disputes internal quotation marks omitted.
to protect the overall purpose of arbitration and avoid any tendency of a court to impute its own strict and rigid practices onto arbitration proceedings,congress has limited the ability of federal courts to review arbitration awards.see see also pack concrete,at stating that permitting a plenary review of arbitration would undermine congress policy of favoring arbitration as an expeditious and relatively inexpensive means of resolving disputes kyocera,at congress decision to permit sophisticated parties to trade the greater certainty of correct legal decisions by federal courts for the speed and flexibility of arbitration determinations is a reasonable legislative judgment that we have no authority to reject.
we must affirm an order to confirm an arbitration award unless it can be vacated,modified,or corrected as prescribed by the faa.see kyocera,at hold ing that a federal court may only review an arbitral decision on the grounds set forth in the faa and that the parties have no power to alter or expand those grounds.a federal court may vacate an award if the arbitrator engages in misbehavior that prejudices a party,or if the arbitrator exceeds his powers in rendering such an award.a.a rbitrators exceed their powers in this regard not when they merely interpret or apply the governing law incorrectly,but when the award is completely irrational,or exhibits a manifest disregard of law.kyocera,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.

the scope of the arbitrator authority is determined by the contract requiring arbitration as well as by the parties definition of the issues to be submitted in the submission agreement.piggly wiggly operators warehouse,piggly wiggly operators warehouse indep.truck drivers union,local,cir holding that the court must look at both the contract requiring arbitration as well as the submission agreement to determine the arbitrator authority see also executone info,davis,cir t he parties may agree to arbitration of disputes that they were not contractually compelled to submit to arbitration.in other words,the initial contract to arbitrate may be modified or expanded by the submission agreement.piggly wiggly operators warehouse,at.the demand for arbitration served as lucent and schoenduve submission agreement.because lucent did not object to the breadth of the demand for arbitration,the scope of the arbitrator authority is determined not only by the mra,but also by the demand for arbitration.see id.at.
intending to reach all aspects of their relationship,lucent required the parties to arbitrate any dispute arising out of or relating to the mra.see valentine sugars,donau,cir stating that when the arbitration clause calls for any dispute relating to or arising out of the agreement to be submitted to arbitration,the parties intend the clause to reach all aspects of the relationship.here,the mra,which required arbitration if a dispute arises out of or relates to this agreement,was broad enough to include a claim for commissions based on or estoppel.therefore,we turn to the demand for arbitration to determine whether the parties chose to limit the scope of the arbitrator authority.see id.at rejecting the argument that the arbitrator exceeded his authority when the parties submitted everything related to the dispute to the arbitration panel and there was no contractual provision removing the issue from the arbitrator jurisdiction.
in the demand for arbitration,schoenduve identified its claim as an action to recover those commissions,interest and other damages arising from the wrongful conduct of lucent.it sought substantial damages arising from breach of contract and other claims against lucent,including lucent failure to disclose and account for substantial monies owed to schoenduve.by not objecting to the demand for arbitration,lucent essentially agreed to arbitrate all issues surrounding schoenduve claim for commissions.the arbitrator necessarily had the authority to decide whether schoenduve was entitled to damages based on or estoppel because those issues were implicit within the submission agreement.see.mut.ins.unigard sec.ins,cir holding that the arbitration panel did not exceed its authority when the question of the conditions of reimbursement was implicit in the submission agreement and the contract requiring arbitration did not preclude the arbitration panel from resolving issues implied in the submission agreement and did not limit the form or content of the award.
the scope of the arbitrator jurisdiction extends to issues not only explicitly raised by the parties,but all issues implicit within the submission agreement.mut.ins,at.schoenduve sought the commissions for which it claimed it was entitled.it argued,among other theories,that only a portion of the mra applied to the transaction.the arbitrator found that the mra did not apply to the apple transaction.consequently,with no applicable written agreement,the question of necessarily arose.it was implicit within the issues presented in the demand for arbitration.
furthermore,the arbitrator interpretation of the scope of his powers is entitled to the same level of deference as his determination on the merits.pack concrete,at see also valentine sugars,at in determining whether the arbitrator exceeded his jurisdiction,we resolve all doubts in favor of arbitration.the policy concerns requiring deference to the arbitrator decision on the merits are equally applicable when reviewing the arbitrator interpretation of the submission agreement.pack concrete,at stating that permitting a plenary review would impede the expeditious and inexpensive nature of arbitration proceedings and,f urthermore,interpreting the issue submitted often requires construction of the agreement itself,a job clearly for the arbitrator.
while we recognize that the demand for arbitration was broad,t he parties agreed to arbitration and must accept the loose procedural requirements along with the benefits which arbitration provides.valentine sugars,at see also gilmer,at.federal law does not impose any requirements as to how specific a notice of arbitration must be.valentine sugars,at.accordingly,we will follow the lead of the fifth circuit i n the absence of a congressional mandate,we will not develop a code of pleading here.id the arbitrator award arose implicitly from schoenduve claim for commissions.therefore,we hold that the arbitrator did not exceed his authority by awarding schoenduve damages based on or estoppel,both theories recognized under new york commercial law.
lucent also challenges the arbitration award on the basis that the arbitrator deprived it of the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner by ruling on a claim not properly presented by the parties.under a,we may vacate an arbitration award if the arbitrator was guilty of misconduct in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced.
as discussed above,the and estoppel issues were properly before the arbitrator.lucent was never denied an opportunity to argue these claims in fact,it did so not only in its opening statement,but also in a letter to the arbitrator requesting summary judgment because the arbitrator did not abuse his powers by ruling on a issue implicitly submitted to him,and because lucent was never denied an opportunity to present evidence as to that issue,the arbitrator did not engage in any misbehavior under a.we see no due process violation here where the dispute has always been whether schoenduve was entitled to commissions from the transaction.
in addition to arguing that the arbitrator exceeded his authority by ruling on an issue not submitted to him,lucent claims that the arbitrator exceeded his authority by ignoring the plain language of the mra.because the mra stated that the arbitrator may not limit,expand or otherwise modify the terms of the agreement,lucent argues that the arbitrator exceeded his authority by awarding schoenduve commissions on a theory after ruling that the limited circumstances in which schoenduve could recover commissions under the mra did not apply.
the arbitrator did not modify,change or expand the agreement.instead,he ruled that the mra simply did not apply to the apple transaction.the fact that the arbitrator lacks the power to modify the agreement does not compel the conclusion that he also lacks the power to determine which provisions are in fact a part of the contract.leyva certified grocers of,cir holding that the arbitrator does have the power to determine whether various provisions in the contract are void.as recognized by our court in leyva 
a necessary first step in interpreting any contract is to determine exactly what language is controlling in the case.absent a clear limitation on the arbitrator authority,the court should decline to read the exception clause in this contract to limit the arbitrator power in the manner suggested by appellants.
