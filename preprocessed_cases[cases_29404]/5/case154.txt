background

at the time the involuntary bankruptcy petitions were filed,the creditors were directly or indirectly involved in multiple lawsuits to recover on the notes,including four actions in new york state supreme court seeking to recover on the notes from the hellas companies and other defendants,including the troy entities two actions in california and two in delaware,all subsequently dismissed pending a decision on the new york state supreme court actions three actions in the southern district of new york,two of which were dismissed for lack of standing and two european actions seeking to recover on the notes.

jurisdiction.
on july,the creditors moved to dismiss their own appeal for lack of jurisdiction.the creditors argued that because the district court affirmed both the bankruptcy court holdings on the existence of a bona fide dispute and abstention,this appeal is moot because the district court decision to abstain under section a is unreviewable by our court pursuant to c.see c an order under subsection a of this section dismissing a case or suspending all proceedings in a case,or a decision not so to dismiss or suspend,is not reviewable by appeal or otherwise by the court of appeals or by the supreme court of the united states.the creditors also sought to vacate both the finding of a bona fide dispute and the award of attorneys fees and costs,on the ground that judgments that rely on moot issues should be vacated.a panel of our court denied the motion
