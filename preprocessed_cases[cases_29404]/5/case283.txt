background 
this appeal challenges a reparations award under the perishable agricultural commodities act paca,et,in favor of respondent dimare homestead,against petitioner koam produce,for price adjustments that koam received on five shipments of tomatoes purchased from dimare in april.koam and dimare agreed to the price adjustments following inspections of the tomatoes by the united states department of agriculture the usda.unbeknownst to dimare at the time of the inspections,in other transactions the usda inspectors had accepted bribes from wholesalers,including koam,to downgrade the quality of the produce they inspected.
koam sells produce at the hunts point wholesale produce market in the bronx,new york,and dimare supplies produce to wholesalers such as koam.when koam received each of the five shipments of tomatoes,it claimed that they did not conform to the parties contracts,and requested that the usda inspect each shipment.paca authorizes such inspections with respect to the class,quality,condition of any lot of any perishable agricultural commodity when offered for interstate or foreign shipment or when received at places where the secretary of agriculture shall find it practicable to provide such service.a.three different usda inspectors examined the five shipments,and on all five occasions the inspectors found the tomatoes to be substandard.as a result of these findings,koam and dimare agreed to reduce the price for each shipment.the price reductions totaled.
in october,nine usda inspectors at the hunts point the three who inspected the tomatoes at issue in this arrested and later pleaded guilty to accepting bribes from wholesalers employees in exchange for reducing the grade of produce that they inspected,thereby permitting the wholesalers to pay lower prices for acceptable goods.koam employee marvin friedman,along with a number of other wholesalers employees,was arrested and pleaded guilty to bribing the usda inspectors.none of the counts to which friedman or the inspectors pleaded guilty involved the transactions between dimare and koam that are the subject of this appeal.
following the criminal proceedings,the usda sent letters to members of the produce industry,including dimare,informing them of the hunts point bribery scandal and of the administrative process whereby injured parties could file reparations claims for damages under paca.dimare thereafter instituted a reparations proceeding with the secretary of agriculture the secretary,seeking to recover the in price adjustments that koam had received as a result of the usda inspections.the parties submitted verified pleadings,briefs,affidavits,and documentary evidence the office of the secretary william jenson,judicial officer made a number of findings of fact,determining that,with respect to each of the five shipments at issue,the parties agreed to price adjustments o n the basis of the damage reported in the federal inspection.the secretary also found that t here is no showing on this record that falsified inspections were issued as to the specific lots of tomatoes.the secretary nevertheless concluded that all five of the parties price adjustment agreements were voidable because of dimare unilateral mistake and koam misrepresentations regarding the integrity of the inspection process and koam failed to prove that dimare had breached the parties sales contracts by shipping substandard tomatoes.
koam appealed to the united states district court for the southern district of new york,where it was entitled to de novo review of the secretary decision.see c.following a bench trial,at which the parties introduced documentary evidence but no live witnesses testified,the district court louis stanton,judge affirmed the decision of the secretary.koam produce,dimare homestead,d koam i.the court determined that the doctrine of mistake rendered the price adjustments voidable,and it rejected koam various arguments in favor of the truthfulness of the inspection certificates.id.at.in a subsequent ruling,the district court granted dimare motion for in attorneys fees.koam produce,dimare homestead,d koam ii.koam appealed.we now affirm.
discussion 
contrary to koam suggestion,our review of the district court factual findings is not de novo.following a bench trial,we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo,even where,as here,the district court did not hear any live witnesses.see connors.life ins,cir holding that findings of fact in a bench trial based on written submissions are accorded the same deference as factual findings that are otherwise determined.a findings of fact,whether based on oral or documentary evidence,shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous.
koam raises two issues on appeal.first,koam argues that the secretary and the district court erred in voiding the five price adjustments because dimare failed to show that falsified inspection reports were issued with respect to the five shipments.second,koam argues that the district court award of in attorneys fees to dimare was unreasonable,especially in light of the size dimare reparations award.
i.the price adjustments 
as noted above,the secretary voided the five agreements on the basis of the doctrines of misrepresentation and mistake,and concluded that koam failed to prove that the tomatoes dimare sold did not conform to the contracts.the district court agreed with the secretary that the doctrine of mistake rendered the price adjustments voidable and that koam had failed to prove that dimare breached the supply contracts,but the court did not address the doctrine of misrepresentation.on appeal,dimare defends the judgment of the district court on all three grounds,and koam argues only that it satisfied its burden of proving that dimare supplied nonconforming tomatoes.
we agree with the secretary and the district court that the five agreements are voidable under the doctrine of mistake a mistake is a belief that is not in accord with the facts.restatement second of contracts.the restatement provides 
where a mistake of one party at the time a contract was made as to a basic assumption on which he made the contract has a material effect on the agreed exchange of performances that is adverse to him,the contract is voidable by him if he does not bear the risk of the mistake under the rule stated in,and 
a the effect of the mistake is such that enforcement of the contract would be unconscionable,or 
b the other party had reason to know of the mistake or his fault caused the mistake.
id.it is clear that,when the parties agreed to the price adjustments,dimare was mistaken as to both whether koam had paid bribes to usda inspectors to influence the outcome of inspections and whether the usda inspectors who examined the tomatoes had accepted bribes.
it is equally clear that these mistakes impacted the basic assumptions on which dimare made the price adjustments and that the effect of the mistakes was both material and adverse to dimare.with respect to materiality,dimare argues that,if it had known that a koam employee had bribed usda inspectors to downgrade produce,it would not have agreed to the price adjustments.koam seems to contest this factual assertion,arguing that dimare agreed to price adjustments on other shipments without the benefit of any usda inspections at all.but this fact only reinforces dimare point where as here dimare did not agree to price adjustments in the absence of usda inspections,dimare was obviously relying on the integrity of those inspections.that dimare agreed to adjust its prices on other shipments is irrelevant.it is also apparent that the reliance on the integrity of the usda affected dimare,as the inspections resulted in koam paying lower prices than it otherwise would have paid.
it is also clear that dimare did not bear the risk of the mistake under of the restatement.section provides 
a party bears the risk of a mistake when 
a the risk is allocated to him by agreement of the parties,or 
b he is aware,at the time the contract is made,that he has only limited knowledge with respect to the facts to which the mistake relates but treats his limited k
