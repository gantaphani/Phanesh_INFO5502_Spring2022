signature fruit company petitions this court to review a decision of the workers compensation appeals board awarding one of its seasonal employees,eva ochoa,temporary disability benefits.we recognize that,effective january,an amendment to the workers compensation laws established a minimum level of average weekly earnings.this case presents a unique twist to what otherwise might be a fairly simple calculation.the parties stipulated that ochoa would be employed only during the season,from july through september.the record supports the stipulation by revealing that ochoa could only recall working as a seasonal employee with signature fruit company in recent years.under these unique circumstances,we conclude that ochoa is not entitled to receive temporary disability payments for a time when there is no question that she would not have been working and earning injured or not.
to illustrate the point,we will assume ochoa remained temporarily disabled throughout all of.if she did,the wcab award would result in her receiving well over percent of her regular annual income for a time when there is no question that she would not have been working.in enacting workers compensation reform,we do not believe the legislature intended this result.that said,our decision is a narrow one.we express no opinion on calculating a seasonal employee temporary disability where the employee maintains earnings below the minimum average weekly earnings rate.
procedural and factual histories 
eva ochoa worked as a seasonal sanitation worker for signature fruit company signature since.the parties stipulated that ochoa employment ran from july though september with average weekly earnings of and she did not have any earnings or engage in any employment during her throughout the remainder of the year.
on september,ochoa was washing a floor at a signature worksite in modesto when a passing forklift jerked a water hose out of her hand.signature admitted ochoa suffered an industrial injury but disputed the nature and extent of the injury.she continued working for several days until she sought medical treatment at signature expense on september,with bradley tourtlotte,tourtlotte restricted ochoa to limited use of her right hand for up to eight hours per day and instructed her to return to check her condition on september.
signature was unable to accommodate ochoa work restrictions and paid her temporary disability from september through september,at a rate of per week based on of her average weekly earnings.there is no indication in the record that ochoa returned for follow up with tourtlotte on september,as directed.signature laid off ochoa at the end of her annual employment season on september,and stopped providing her with temporary disability payments.on october,ochoa commenced treatment with a chiropractor,pedram vaezi,who certified that she was totally temporarily disabled.the chiropractor referred ochoa to a physician,bal rajagopalan,at an orthopedic and sports medicine clinic,who described ochoa on february,as having subacromial tendonitis and frozen shoulder,but also noted that her muscle activity electromyogram results were negative and her mri was essentially normal.
ochoa believed she should have been awarded temporary disability payments during her in addition to the four days of temporary disability signature provided.she brought that limited issue before the workers compensation appeals board wcab for an expedited hearing on april.relying on a january,amendment to the workers compensation law recasting an employee minimum average weekly earnings at,the workers compensation administrative law judge wcj agreed with ochoa and concluded she was entitled to temporary disability payments at that minimum average weekly earnings rate,or per week,during her of regular unemployment,subd.a.
signature petitioned the wcab for reconsideration,claiming the medical evidence failed to demonstrate that ochoa was temporarily totally disabled beyond september,and that even if such evidence existed,ochoa was not entitled to temporary disability payments after her seasonal employment term ended.the wcj who issued the decision resigned from state service and did not prepare a report and recommendation to the wcab.the wcab granted signature petition and subsequently issued its own opinion and decision after reconsideration.the wcab concluded that the substantial evidence claim was not properly before it since it was not raised at the expedited hearing and concurred with the wcj that ochoa was entitled to temporary disability payments of per week during her.
discussion 
signature contends that the wcab misapplied the law,legislative intent,and public policy of the state by awarding ochoa temporary disability benefits during her of regular unemployment.lacking any dispute over the underlying facts,signature presents a pure question of law reviewable by this court de novo.department of rehabilitation workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d,lauher.questions of statutory interpretation are,of course,for this court to decide.western growers ins.workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.
in reviewing a workers compensation provision,we give great weight to the wcab interpretation unless it contravenes legislative intent as evidenced by clear and unambiguous statutory language.e j gallo winery workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.in addition,we look to the overall scheme of which a provision is a part and consider the consequences that will flow from a particular construction so as to achieve wise policy rather than mischief or absurdity.id.at,d.we must also consider fairness,reasonableness,and proportionality of an enactment and the purposes sought to be achieved.henry workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.as with other workers compensation provisions,statutes regarding temporary disability are construed liberally in favor of granting benefits to injured workers.lauher,supra,cal th at,d.even a liberal interpretation,however,will not extend temporary disability benefits where they are not authorized.id.at,d.
a temporary disability is an impairment reasonably expected to be cured or materially improved with proper medical treatment.western growers ins.workers comp.appeals,supra,th at,d.unlike permanent disability,which compensates an injured employee for diminished future earning capacity or decreased ability to compete in the open labor market,temporary disability is intended as a substitute for lost wages during a period of transitory incapacity to work.livitsanos superior court cal th,d.that purpose is inferable from section,which requires temporary total disability be calculated as of the average weekly earnings during the period of such disability,consideration being given to the ability of the injured employee to compete in an open labor market.lauher,supra,cal th at,d.average weekly earnings for purposes of both temporary and permanent disability payments are calculated according to various provisions of section.regardless of which provision applies,the ultimate concern is the employee earning capacity.pham workers comp.appeals.bd.th,d gonzales workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.
jimenez san joaquin valley labor 
in jimenez san joaquin valley labor jimenez,the wcab,sitting en banc examined the appropriate method of calculating the average weekly earnings of a seasonal farm worker injured in for purposes of temporary disability and former vocational rehabilitation benefits the wcab limited its analysis to true seasonal employees who work reasonably identifiable and defined seasons of reasonably identifiable and defined duration,and not intermittent employees where the duration of a particular project may be limited,but the evidence establishes that the employee has worked likely will work periodically throughout the year.jimenez,supra,at,fn.
relying on the supreme court decision in argonaut ins.industrial acc.com.cal d,montana,the wcab reasoned that the essential objective in determining earnings for purposes of a temporary disability award is to predict what the employee earnings would have been during his or her period s of temporary disability,but for the industrial injury.jimenez,supra,at.the applicant ability to work,his age and health,his willingness and opportunities to work,his skill and education,the general condition of the labor market,and employment opportunities for persons similarly situated are all relevant,quoting montana,supra,cal d at.given that temporary disability is designed to help replace lost wages,the wcab concluded that an industrially injured seasonal employee shall be awarded temporary disability indemnity at two rates an rate based on the employee earnings capacity and an rate based on the employee earnings capacity,taking into consideration such factors as the employee earnings history jimenez,supra,at.the wcab found this distinction significant because,for and other regular and employments,the employments but for the injury would normally have lasted as long as the period of temporary disability.this,however,is frequently not true for seasonal employments.id.at,fn.the wcab upheld the wcj determination that the injured employee was not entitled to temporary disability during her where the parties stipulated she did not have any earnings.id.at.
the wcab explained in jimenez that the wcj implicitly relied on section,subdivision c,in not awarding the employee temporary disability.jimenez,supra,at.unlike subdivision c through of section,which base average weekly earnings on actual earnings as evidence of earnings capacity under certain circumstances not relevant here,subdivision c requires an estimate of earnings capacity for employment or other situations where the first three formulae do not yield a fair result goytia workmen.bd.cal d,gonzales workers comp.appeals,supra,th at,d grossmont hospital workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.
regardless of whether average weekly earnings are calculated from actual earnings history or estimated earnings capacity,the result is subject to the limits set forth in section,subdivision a,for temporary and permanent total disability,subd.c.applicable under jimenez,the average weekly earnings limitations for temporary disability under section,subdivision a,were not less than the lesser of one hundred dollars or times the employee average weekly earnings from all employers,nor more than six hundred dollars for injuries occurring on and after july.
reading section,subdivisions a and c,in conjunction,the law at the time of jimenez provided that,in determining the average weekly earnings minimum for an employee who worked less than hours per week or where average weekly earnings otherwise could not reasonably and fairly be applied,the wcab was required to adopt the lesser of either the specified or the employee estimated earning capacity multiplied by.the resulting average weekly earnings were next multiplied by to determine the employee weekly temporary disability payment.the wcab reasoned in jimenez that,because of the alternate average weekly earnings calculation,a seasonal employee without any average weekly earnings would receive nothing in temporary disability during the period of regular unemployment.earnings capacity,subd.c x,subd.a x temporary disability.
ii.assembly bill 
effective january,the legislature enacted assembly bill amending section stats,ch.the legislative counsel digest explained that the bill would provide for increased temporary disability and permanent partial disability and death benefits for injuries or deaths occurring on or after january,with additional increases in benefits phased in over several years.legis.counsel,assem.bill,stats,see also legis.counsel,assem.bill,stats.among other changes,the legislation added subdivision a to section providing that the average weekly earnings for purposes of temporary disability shall be n ot less than one hundred dollars,nor more than nine hundred three dollars,for injuries occurring on or after january.assembly bill also set the same a higher weekly earnings rates for dates of injury occurring on or after january,subd.a.the enactment further establishes a formula for increasing both the minimum and maximum average weekly earnings rates based on the state average weekly wage beginning january,subd.a.none of the amendments to section,subdivision a,include the alternate method of calculating the minimum average weekly earnings by multiplying times the employee average weekly earnings.even so,the alternate method remains in section,subdivision a,for dates of injury between and,subd.a,but not for dates of injury before,subd.a.
iii.assembly bill and seasonal employment 
in response to signature petition for reconsideration,the wcab affirmed its holding in jimenez that temporary disability may be awarded at distinct and rates.the wcab also concluded that section,subdivision a,no longer permits an employee average weekly earnings to fall below the statutory minimum of 
w e conclude that the same analysis set forth in jimenez is still a valid analysis,and that in seasonal worker cases,temporary disability indemnity may be awarded at two different rates,an rate based upon actual earnings and an rate based upon the employee earning capacity taking into consideration such factors as the employee earning history,ability to work,age,and health,education,and skill as well as other employment opportunities and the general condition of the labor market.thus,in a situation where there is no earnings history or other factors to indicate that the applicant has an earnings capacity above zero to,the applicant is simply entitled to the minimum rate.the amendment to labor code section,a floor for the temporary disability indemnity rate,does not require a different analysis,but simply a minimum average weekly earning capacity rather than an earnings capacity that may fall to zero.
since the wcj found that applicant is entitled to the minimum rate of per week in the,that finding is consistent with the foregoing analysis of temporary disability indemnity being awarded at two different rates,with the floor of per week where the injured employee has no earning capacity.accordingly,we will affirm the wcj decision.
the wcab statement that the amendment to labor code section,a floor for the temporary disability indemnity rate references the former method of determining minimum average weekly earnings before when section,subdivision a,as well as prior versions of the statute,did not contain the alternate method of multiplying the employee actual earnings by.pham workers comp.appeals,supra,th at,fn,d.while the wcab acknowledged that assembly bill resurrected the former method of establishing an injured employee average weekly earnings for purposes of setting temporary disability,it did not address in its opinion how average weekly earnings would have been determined for seasonal employees under the prior scheme.
arguing that the law before would not have permitted a seasonal employee earnings to fall below the statutory minimum,signature relies on westside produce workers comp.appeals bd.d.avila,where the employer alleged that an injured seasonal worker regular employment period would have ended a week after she sustained an industrial injury to her wrist.id.at.former section,similar to current section,subdivision c,mandated that the employee average weekly earnings for purposes of temporary disability were to fall between and.avila,supra,d at.the avila court reasoned that,i n determining the earnings for purposes of temporary disability,the question is whether the injured would have continued working at a given wage for the duration of the disability.id.at.the court concluded that,because the employee was hired as a seasonal worker,temporary disability is payable based upon earnings at the time of injury only for that period the employment would have continued.id.at.after the employment would have terminated,the employee is entitled to temporary disability considering her past earnings history and her anticipated future earnings had she not been injured.ibid.
while avila supports the wcab application of separate and average weekly earnings rates for employees with distinct employment seasons,it does not answer the more specific question whether an employee temporary disability could fall below of the statutory minimum average weekly earnings before.avila simply did not ad
