factual and procedural background 
prior to moore arrest in this case,he had prior felony convictions for selling or delivering cocaine,three common law robberies,and two assaults with a deadly weapon on a government official in the case at bar,charlotte,north carolina police arrested moore on the street based on an outstanding warrant for assault with a deadly weapon.while searching moore incident to this arrest,the officers found a handgun and ammunition.moore told the police after his arrest that he carried the gun because of his fear of being robbed,such robberies being prevalent in the neighborhood in which he lived.he was then charged as a felon in possession of a firearm under g,and as an armed career criminal under the armed career criminal act acca,e 
moore filed a motion to dismiss on various constitutional grounds,which the district court denied.at that point,moore entered a conditional guilty plea,preserving for appeal the issue of whether g violates the second amendment in light of the supreme court ruling in district of columbia heller,d.
the district court sentenced moore under the acca to the statutory minimum,fifteen years imprisonment,to be followed by three years of supervised release.although the court found that moore was indigent and qualified for a attorney under and that he could not pay a fine or interest,it nonetheless ordered moore to reimburse the united states for the attorneys fees at a rate of per month beginning sixty days after his release from prison.the district court adopted the probation office recommendation that,because moore has a ged and some trade skills,he would be able to pay the per month after his release.moore objected to the fee reimbursement order.
on appeal,moore assigns error both to imposition of the attorneys fee reimbursement and the underlying g conviction.we have jurisdiction of this appeal pursuant to and.
second amendment claima.
we first consider,de novo,whether moore conviction under g violates the second amendment see united states bostic,cir.
moore argues that the supreme court held in heller that the second amendment guarantees an individual the right to bear arms in irrespective of his status as a convicted felon.moore contends that g is unconstitutional on its face because it infringes on the basic right of as applied to him,moore also argues that the statute is unconstitutional and that his prior convictions should not be deemed to disqualify him from exercising his second amendment right to protect himself.br.of appellant at.alternatively,moore asks for remand to the district court to develop an evidentiary record,arguing that procedure is required by this court decision in united states chester,cir.
in response,the government contends that the second amendment right to bear arms,like all other constitutional rights,is not absolute.emphasizing the violent nature of moore criminal record,the government points to language in heller characterizing felon dispossession laws as presumptively lawful.see heller,at.identifying the longstanding prohibition on the possession of firearms by felons as a presumptively lawful regulatory measure.based on this language,the government posits that moore challenges to g,as facially invalid,fail.as to moore challenge,the government argues that if the congress has sufficient interest in prohibiting any person from possessing a firearm,it is a person like moore,a violent felon.
we begin our analysis by noting the unanimous result reached by every court of appeals that g is constitutional,both on its face and as applied.the basis for the various decisions by our sister circuits has varied,but all have uniformly rejected challenges to g,usually based at least in part on the presumptively lawful language from heller.see,united states torres rosario,cir rejecting both facial and challenges to g based on heller and noting that a ll of the circuits to face the issue post heller have rejected blanket challenges to felon in possession laws and citing cases from the second,third,fifth,sixth,seventh,eighth,ninth,tenth and eleventh circuits united states barton,cir rejecting second amendment challenge to g because of presumptively lawful language united states rozier,cir,cert.denied,d same united states williams,cir,cert.denied,d rejecting facial second amendment challenge to g based on presumptively lawful regulations,and utilizing the intermediate scrutiny framework to address the defendant challenge without determining that it would be the precise test applicable to all challenges to gun restrictions united states vongxay,cir,cert.denied,d relying on heller to conclude that felons are categorically different from the individuals who have a fundamental right to bear arms united states khami,cir,cert.denied,d agreeing with other circuits that heller language is sufficient to dispose of the claim that g is unconstitutional united states mccane,cir,cert.denied,d flatly rejecting second amendment challenge to g based on heller united states anderson,cir,cert.denied,d same united states stuckey,cir same see also united states joos,cir rejecting a facial challenge to g and citing to a prior eighth circuit decision,which relied on heller to reject a facial challenge to g.apparently we are one of the few circuits yet to publish an opinion on this issue.we now join with our sister courts and hold g to be a constitutionally valid statute.
since the supreme court decision in heller,we have come to address claims of the constitutional invalidity of a firearms possession statute under the framework set out in chester.see united states staten,cir g united states chapman,cir g.these cases,unlike the case at bar,challenged statutory restrictions on domestic violence misdemeanants chester and staten,and certain persons subject to domestic violence protective orders chapman which the supreme court did not specifically identify as presumptively lawful regulatory measures in heller.our analysis in those cases thus had no reason to denote any specific difference in analysis between firearms restrictions which were specifically mentioned in heller as presumptively lawful regulatory measures and those that were not.
as we noted in chester,the supreme court explicitly stated in heller that nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons at citing heller,at.the supreme court further identified such felon in possession laws,like g,as presumptively lawful regulatory measures.heller,at.we believe this differentiation by the supreme court has some impact on the second amendment chester analysis when the regulatory measure at issue is such an identified presumptively lawful regulatory measure.in effect,the chester analysis is more streamlined when a presumptively lawful regulatory measure is under review.
to the extent that moore,or any similarly situated defendant,raises a facial challenge to the validity of g,the clear declaration in heller that such felon in possession laws are a presumptively lawful regulatory measure resolves that challenge fairly quickly.as we noted in chester 
it is unclear to us whether heller was suggesting that longstanding prohibitions such as these firearm possession by felons were historically understood to be valid limitations on the right to bear arms or did not violate the second amendment for some other reason.
id.at we then referenced a similar conclusion by the third circuit in united states marzzarella,cir 
we recognize the phrase presumptively lawful could have different meanings under newly enunciated second amendment doctrine.on the one hand,this language could be read to suggest the identified restrictions are presumptively lawful because they regulate conduct outside the scope of the second amendment.on the other hand,it may suggest the restrictions are presumptively lawful because they pass muster under any standard of scrutiny.
chester,at.
whichever meaning the supreme court had in mind negates a facial challenge to a felon in possession statute like g.if such restrictions were outside the scope of second amendment coverage at ratification,then obviously it is not within second amendment protection now.on the other hand,if a g type statute has some second amendment coverage,the fact it is presumptively lawful indicates it must pass muster under any standard of scrutiny.under the well recognized standard for assessing a facial challenge to the constitutionality of a statute,the supreme court has long declared that a statute can not be held unconstitutional if it has constitutional application.state grange.state republican party,d a facial challenge must fail where the statute has a plainly legitimate sweep.quoting washington glucksberg,d stevens,concurring in judgments see also united states salerno,d a facial challenge to a legislative act is,of course,the most difficult challenge to mount successfully,since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the act would be valid.since clearly there are cases where felon firearm possession is constitutionally limited,g survives a facial challenge.see.state grange,at.thus,we have no difficulty in concluding that g is constitutionally valid on its face.
determining that g is valid on its face,however,does not resolve moore challenge.as we recognized in chester,heller seemed to leave this issue open.in fact,the phrase presumptively lawful regulatory measures suggests the possibility that one or more of these longstanding regulations could be unconstitutional in the face of an challenge.united states williams,cir.at emphasis in chester.
in asserting his challenge,of course,moore can not obtain relief based on arguments that a differently situated person might present,united states skoien,cir en banc,or based on other situations not before the court.broadrick oklahoma,d.moreover,the supreme court declaration in heller that felon in possession statutes are presumptively lawful regulatory measures reinforces the fact that a litigant claiming an otherwise constitutional enactment is invalid as applied to him must show that his factual circumstances remove his challenge from the realm of ordinary challenges.
moore challenge relies heavily on his assertion that he was carrying a firearm on the day he was arrested to protect himself from being robbed in his sketchy neighborhood.he contends that the conduct underlying his conviction thus implicates the core right of the second amendment the right of a,responsible citizen to possess and carry a weapon for.chester,at citing heller,at.emphasis in chester.
we can not agree with moore argument that,because he was carrying the weapon for protection his conduct was therefore absolutely protected by the second amendment.moore simply does not fall within the category of citizens to which the heller court ascribed the second amendment protection of the right of responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.at.emphasis added.however the supreme court may come to define a responsible citizen for second amendment purposes,moore surely would not fall within that group.most notably,moore three prior felony convictions for common law robbery and two prior convictions for assault with a deadly weapon on a government official clearly demonstrate that he is far from a,responsible citizen.chester,at see also supra note summarizing moore extensive criminal history.
indeed,moore acknowledges that his argument is weaken ed by his prior convictions,including several convictions for assaults and robberies.br.of appellant at.particularly in light of his extensive and violent criminal history,moore conduct here is plainly outside the scope of the second amendment.see,torres rosario,at rejecting an challenge to g by a convicted felon with no violent felony convictions,and concluding that his two prior serious drug convictions were sufficient to support the ban against his possession of firearms,especially in light of the established connection between drug dealing and violence williams,at williams,as a violent felon,is not the ideal candidate to challenge the constitutionality of g.barton,at g is constitutional as applied to barton because he has presented no facts distinguishing his circumstances from those of other felons who are categorically unprotected by the second amendment.in short,moore has presented nothing to rebut the presumptive lawfulness of g as applied to him.
we do not foreclose the possibility that a case might exist in which an second amendment challenge to g could succeed.but while we acknowledge such a showing theoretically could be made,moore is not remotely close.as we just noted,moore undoubtedly flunks the responsible citizen requirement.moreover,moore proffered reason for possessing a firearm,his fear of being robbed,such robberies being prevalent in the neighborhood in which he lived is far too vague and unsubstantiated to remove his case from the typical felon in possession case.accordingly,moore has not rebutted the presumption that the presumptively lawful regulatory measure of the long standing prohibition on felon firearm possession is unconstitutional as applied to him.
therefore,we hold that g is constitutional as applied to moore and the district court did not err in denying moore motion to dismiss.
reimbursement of attorneys feesa.
we next consider whether the district court erred in ordering moore to repay his attorneys fees under.the interpretation of a statute,like the meaning of c and f in the case at bar,is reviewed de novo.united states weaver,cir an issue of statutory interpretation is one that we review de novo.citation omitted.in the context of sentencing,we review the district court legal determinations de novo,and its factual findings for clear error.united states osborne,cir.in reviewing the district court application of the factual findings,as in the reimbursement order here,we apply an abuse of discretion standard.see,united states holman,cir conditions of supervised release are reviewed for an abuse of discretion united states leftwich,cir district court restitution order is reviewed for abuse of discretion.in actual practice,this division of standards of review is not always easy to differentiate and is of limited practical import where the district court commits an error as a matter of law the district court made such an error in this case which requires the sentencing order,as it relates to the attorney fee reimbursement,be vacated and remanded.
the criminal justice act,cja,requires the government to provide adequate legal representation for criminal defendants unable to pay for such services when,like moore,they are charged with a federal felony offense.a a.there is no issue in this case that moore was,in fact,indigent and qualified for a court appointed attorney under the cja.
that statute also provides that i f,at any time after the appointment of counsel the court finds that the person is financially able to obtain counsel or to make partial payment for the representation,it may authorize payment as provided in subsection f,as the interests of justice may dictate.c.subsection f further authorizes a court to order repayment of attorneys fees under certain circumstances 
whenever the court finds that funds are available for payment from or on behalf of a person furnished representation,it may authorize or direct that such funds be paid to the appointed attorney or to the court for deposit in the treasury as a reimbursement to the appropriation,current at the time of payment,to carry out the provisions of this section.
moore argues that the order requiring him to repay his attorneys fees during his supervised release term is unlawful because f only allows a court to order reimbursement when it determines the defendant has funds that are currently available for payment.he points to the use of the present tense funds are available in the statute language to support that argument,as well as to authority.because the district court order was based on a speculative ability to pay in the future,moore argues that the order violates a f.
the government concedes that,in this circuit,there are no published cases upholding a reimbursement order based on future payments from assets not currently accessible.it relies on two unpublished cases,however,which upheld such reimbursement orders.see united states jackson,wl cir.june,unpublished united states moore,wl cir,unpublished.in neither of these cases was there an explicit finding that funds were then available to the defendant for a reimbursement payment.the government also argues that reimbursement orders are authorized because the cja generally vests significant discretion in district courts for sentencing purposes.thus,the government concludes,the order here should not be overturned.
in analyzing the district court order,we start with the plain language of the statute.weaver,at the starting point for any issue of statutory interpretation is the language of the statute itself.it is well established that when the statute language is plain,the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms.citations and quotation marks omitted.in the case at bar,subsection f allows the recovery of the cost of attorneys fees if the court finds that funds are available for payment from or on behalf of a person furnished representation.f.when read in conjunction with subsection c,then,which authorizes repayment under subsection f after the court finds that the person is financially able to make partial payment for the representation,the statute clearly requires a finding of a defendant ability to make payments as a condition precedent to an order of reimbursement.any such finding must be based on evidence before the court,and thus in the record,and not on speculation or hypothesis.given the statute plain language,then,we are compelled to hold that the district court must base the reimbursement order on a finding that there are specific funds,assets,or asset streams or the fixed right to those funds,assets or asset streams that are identified by the court and available to the defendant for the repayment of the attorneys fees.
our holding requiring a specific finding of ability to pay and identification of the source of payment is in accord with similar conclusions of our sister circuits.see,united states wilson,cir a thorough inquiry into the defendant finances,though not a full adversarial hearing,should precede any order requiring a repayment of attorneys fees united states danielson,cir affirming order denying reimbursement of fees where district court could not make any definitive finding as to the defendant ability to pay united states mcgiffen,cir requir ing that a district court make appropriate findings of availability,such as whether the contribution would impose an extreme hardship on the defendant,whether it would interfere with his obligations to his family,and whether there were third parties with valid claims to the funds,and noting that o ur sister circuits similarly require that there be evidence that the district court made specific inquiries into the defendant financial circumstances and obligations before requiring a defendant to repay funds pursuant to f united states evans,cir before entering a reimbursement order,a district court has a responsibility to inquire into the defendant current financial status united states fraza,cir reversing order of reimbursement where the district court failed to make findings as to defendant financial viability 
the sixth circuit decision in wilson is a case in which the district court made the required cja findings.in wilson,the defendant was ordered to repay in attorneys fees after his acquittal,having received free representation throughout his criminal proceedings,including a trial.at.although the defendant had received free representation,the court subsequently learned that wilson had significant assets at the time of trial.the repayment was based on specific findings that,in the year his trial began,for example,wilson had income of approximately and had spent over in restaurant and wine tabs.id.he also was currently out of prison and earning income.id.at.in reviewing the order of reimbursement,the wilson court stated the general rule that a thorough inquiry into the defendant finances,though not a full adversarial hearing,should precede an order of reimbursement.id.at.because the district court had performed the requisite inquiry,the sixth circuit affirmed the reimbursement order.
in contradistinction to the thorough inquiry conducted by the district court in wilson,the de minimis findings by the district court regarding moore financial capacity and ability to pay are stark effectively,the district court made no findings under c that moore is financially able to make partial payment for the representation or under f that funds are available for payment.instead,the court simply adopted the probation officer standing a month repayment plan.
the record,to the extent there is one,showed moore had virtually no income over a period of years and had no assets or other things of value.the mere fact that he has a ged and some work training although no steady work history does not support a finding that funds are available.unlike the income stream in wilson,which was a readily identifiable asset,the theoretical income stream here,years down the road after completion of a sentence,was based purely on speculation with no basis in fact.
of particular note in the case at bar is that the district court specifically found that moore,who was clearly eligible for a attorney,did not have the ability to pay a fine or interest.nonetheless,the court accepted the apparently standard and factually unsupported recommendation of the probation office that moore ged and training meant he would be able to earn an amount of money sufficient to repay per month and thus ordered moore to repay that amount while on supervised release.in so doing,the district court made no finding that there were any identifiable funds or assets available to moore.to the contrary,the district court expressly adopted the psr,which states that moore does not appear to have the financial resources to make an immediate monetary payment.
because the district court failed to make the specific findings required by c or f to support an order of reimbursement,its judgment at sentencing,insofar as it required a reimbursement of attorneys fees,was in error.
to provide additional direction to district courts,we caution that our holding should not be interpreted as imposing an overly restrictive definition of available,such as one that only permits an order of reimbursement if a defendant has cash or funds in a bank account which are immediately available to him to be withdrawn.put differently,availability is not limited only to currently liquid assets at the time reimbursement is ordered.instead,a repayment order may be based on identified funds and assets,even if those assets will not become liquid until a future date,such as the escrow payment from an upcoming sale of real property,the scheduled disbursement of proceeds from a trust,or continuing payments under a promissory note or contract.see wilson,at a court might find a defendant financially able to pay based on money pending in escrow even though those funds will not become available for payment until some future date.see also br.of appellant at moore acknowledging a reimbursement order can be based on a defendant income stream.the crucial factor in complying with the statutory mandates in c the court finds that the person is financially able and f the court finds the funds are available for payment is that the sentencing court indeed make a finding on the record identifying the
