background 
this is the second appeal to our court in this patent infringement lawsuit between bayer cropscience ag and bayer collectively,bayer and dow agrosciences llc.the relate to soybeans genetically engineered to tolerate herbicide,and,particularly,to the dmmg gene.the first appeal centered on the merits of a contractual dispute.the parties disagreed over the scope of bayer license of the to a dow business partner,technologies,llc ms tech,and,specifically,whether the license granted ms tech a broad license to commercialize and sublicense the soybean technology.ms tech sublicensed to dow whatever patent rights it received from bayer.when bayer sued dow for infringement of these patents,dow raised the ms tech sublicense as an affirmative defense.
on summary judgment,bayer argued that it had only licensed ms tech rights to exploitation of the dmmg patents,and thus,dow activity with ms tech in commercializing dmmg gene soybeans infringed the.dow countered that the bayer ms tech agreement conveyed to ms tech broad rights including commercialization of the by its terms,but especially in view of the facts surrounding the agreement negotiations.the parties agreed that english law governed the agreement,and under english law,the background or surrounding circumstances of contract formation are considered when interpreting the agreement.the district court agreed with dow interpretation of the bayer ms tech agreement and entered summary judgment in its favor.bayer cropscience ag dow agrosciences llc,no.cv,wl.our court affirmed that decision.bayer cropscience ag dow agrosciences llc,app x fed.cir.bayer i.
the case returned to the district court,where the court awarded dow attorney fees pursuant to.the magistrate judge who had managed the case,having been briefed on the issue by both parties and having conducted a hearing on the matter,issued a thorough report and recommendation declaring a firm conviction that this is an exceptional case and recommending under.bayer cropscience ag dow agrosciences llc,no.cv,wl,at.the district judge who entered summary judgment for dow then reviewed the magistrate recommendation and adopted it in a thorough opinion of her own.the district judge examined the full duration of the litigation and concluded that,in her view,bayer weak positions on the merits and litigation conduct supported a finding that this was an exceptional case.
specifically,the district judge emphasized that bayer own witnesses as well as key documents contradicted bayer contorted reading of the contract and that bayer conduct in litigating this case in the face of evidence that contradicted its contorted reading of the agreement was objectively unreasonable.bayer ag dow agrosciences llc,no.cv,wl,at,fees op.bayer had argued that it did not grant dow business partner,ms tech,commercialization rights to the dmmg gene patents,relying in large part on the emphasized exception clause in the license grant 
the seller bayer hereby grants to the purchaser ms tech a worldwide,fully,exclusive license with the right to grant sublicenses solely as set out in article and with the exception of the rights to increase,market,distribute for sale,sell and offer for sale,granted to stine by separate agreement 
emphasis added.the referenced stine agreement was a license bayer gave to stine seed farm,an entity working closely with ms tech which specifically granted the enumerated commercialization rights listed in the ms tech agreement,right to increase,market,distribute for sale,sell,and offer for sale.bayer argued that this exception in the ms tech agreement referencing the stine agreement carved all commercialization rights completely out of the ms tech license.dow posited instead that the provision simply indicated that the ms tech license was not exclusive with respect to the separate license rights stine had been granted.the parties each presented textual arguments citing other provisions in both the ms tech and stine agreements to support their respective positions.in addition,the parties relied on expert testimony to interpret the agreements terms,as well as extrinsic evidence regarding the parties understanding of the agreement because such evidence is highly relevant under the governing english law.
in its decision awarding attorney fees,the district judge found that bayer arguments were fallacious because they were implausible and made no business sense in light of the facts surrounding the agreements and their negotiation.fees,wl,at.for example,the district court noted that bayer was unable to adduce testimonial evidence from those involved in negotiating the agreement including those working for bayer that anyone understood the agreement as carving out commercialization rights from the ms tech agreement.to the contrary,the district court pointed to testimony of a bayer executive at the time of the deal that the value of these assets for ms was in the ability to make full use of them and further that i t seems incongruous that we would sell an asset to somebody,receive remuneration for the sale,and then somehow prevent the acquirer from making use of the asset he just acquired.id.at alterations in original emphases omitted quoting morgan,ll.ll.the district court also found bayer position in striking tension with remarks it made upon the agreement execution in a congratulatory email sent to individuals concurrently serving as executives of both ms tech and stine w e are convinced that in your capable hands these products will find their true worth in the market.id.emphasis omitted quoting.
the district court also expressed concern about the logical import of bayer argument.under bayer theory,it retained commercialization rights in the dmmg gene patents.the district court found this position to be in conflict with bayer own evidence.a bayer executive at the time of the deal testified that it was relatively black and white certainly in my mind that we were divesting these assets.id.quoting morgan,ll.emphasis omitted.further,the congratulatory email that the bayer executive sent had remarked we bayer wish you every success in capturing the intrinsic value that these assets promise.we were disappointed that bayer was unable to convert that potential given our lack of market presence id.quoting.
the district court identified other specific instances of bayer litigation conduct as supporting its exceptional case determination.specifically,the district court criticized bayer decision to add its dmmg gene patent allegations to an bayer dow lawsuit only a few days after ms tech and dow issued a joint press release,announcing the entities plans to pursue commercializing soybeans.the district court found bayer diligence lacking,observing the positions bayer took to support their contract interpretation arguments were directly contradicted by the record evidence bayer had obtained through early discovery and bayer should have made every effort to discover before filing suit.id.at.in the district court judgment,h ad bayer done any due diligence,it would have learned that no witness supported bayer construction of the agreement and this case should never have been filed.id.at.
the district court also found fault with bayer decision to move for a preliminary injunction against dow amidst targeted discovery on the dispositive contract dispute.that discovery,including depositions of bayer witnesses,would ultimately debunk bayer claims,according to the district court.id.at.thus,the district court found that bayer preliminary injunction motion was frivolous and unnecessarily increased the costs of litigation.id.the district court lastly criticized bayer for taking seemingly contradictory positions regarding ownership of a particular soybean enlist in this case and an ongoing arbitration between the parties.
after identifying these aspects of bayer case,the district co
