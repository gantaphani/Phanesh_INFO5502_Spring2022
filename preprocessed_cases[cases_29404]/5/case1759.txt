plaintiff and appellant robert davis davis appeals a judgment of dismissal following the sustaining without leave to amend of a demurrer interposed by defendant and appellant ford motor credit company llc ford to davis original complaint.
ford also appeals,seeking review of a postjudgment order denying its motion for attorney fees.
this litigation relates to ford billing practices under a retail installment sales contract.ford practice is to apply a customer payment to an earlier missed installment,rather than to the current month installment.as a result,the current month installment is unpaid,triggering a new late fee for the current month.davis theory is that these successive late fees are prohibited by the motor vehicle sales and finance act,et,subd.k,and are actionable under the unfair competition law ucl bus,et hereafter,section and under the consumers legal remedies act clra,et,subd.a.
we conclude the alleged conduct of ford in charging successive late fees for successive late payments does not violate civil code section,subdivision k prohibition on charging more than one late fee per delinquent installment.for example,if an payment received during the month of april is allocated to march because the march payment was missed,the result of allocating said payment to march is that the april payment was missed,so as to trigger a new late fee for the month of april.under those circumstances,the consumer has not been charged more than one late fee for the missed march payment.rather,the first late fee is for the payment missed in march,and the second late fee represents the payment missed in april.because davis failed to allege a statutory violation under,he has failed to allege ford billing practice is unlawful under the ucl.
we further conclude davis can not allege ford billing practice is an unfair business practice within the meaning of the ucl.guided by camacho automobile club of southern california th,d,which clarified the definition of unfair within the meaning of the ucl,we hold davis can not allege an unfair business practice because the alleged injury is one he reasonably could have avoided.id.at,d.simply stated,davis could have avoided the imposition of successive late fees for successive months by making his monthly payments timely,or within the grace period,in accordance with his obligations under the contract.
although ford was the prevailing party,it can not recover its attorney fees pursuant to reciprocal attorney fee provision,because the alleged violation was merely a predicate to the ucl claims,and a prevailing defendant can not recover attorney fees under the ucl.
therefore,the judgment of dismissal,as well as the postjudgment order denying ford motion for attorney fees,are affirmed.
factual and procedural background 
the complaint pertinent allegations.
on november,davis,individually and on behalf of others similarly situated,filed suit against ford alleging as follows 
in february,davis entered into a retail installment sales contract with worthington ford,the dealer for the purchase of a ford taurus for personal and family purposes the dealer sold and assigned said retail installment sales contract to ford.
under the contract,davis was required to make periodic installment payments in a specific preset amount for the life of the contract.for each installment that was in default for a period of not less than days,ford was entitled to assess a delinquency charge in an amount not to exceed five percent of the delinquent installment,which amount may be collected only once on any installment,regardless of the period during which it remains in default,subd.k.
ford applied certain of davis regular installment payments against past due installments to trigger multiple late charges where there was only one late payment,and has engaged and continues to engage in the same practice with respect to the members of the class.
based on these allegations,davis sought to plead the following six causes of action 
violation of the clra,specifically,civil code section,subdivision a,based on ford representation that it is entitled to apply monthly installments against prior outstanding installments so as to trigger multiple late payments and multiple late fees,contrary to the letter and spirit of the retail installment sales contracts which permit only one late fee per late installment payment.
violation of,subd.k,so as to constitute an unlawful business practice under the ucl.
violation of the clra,subd.a,so as to constitute an unlawful business practice under the ucl.
unlawful and unfair business practice within the meaning of the ucl,in that ford billing practices cause consumer injury by the assessment of late charges far in excess of the amounts actually expended by ford to collect its accounts consumers can not reasonably avoid the injury which flows from ford practice because ford interpretation is not apparent on the face of the contracts and consumers can not shop around in advance to avoid this undisclosed interpretation there are no countervailing benefits to consumers or competition from ford practice ford practice systematically breaches the contracts of plaintiffs and violates the letter and spirit of and has the same effect as a violation of the federal trade commission act,title united states code section and ford practice violates the letter and spirit and has the same effect as a violation of,civil code section,subdivision k.
unfair and deceptive business practices within the meaning of the ucl.
money had and received and unjust enrichment based on the unwarranted late charges 
ford demurrer.
ford demurred to the complaint in its entirety,asserting no cause of action was stated.
by way of background,the contract stated in pertinent part how we will apply payments.we may apply each payment to the earned and unpaid part of the finance charge,to the unpaid part of the amount financed and to other amounts you owe under this contract in any order we choose.italics added.
ford argued,inter alia,did not prohibit its exercise of its contractual right to allocate payments it receives to the oldest outstanding installment and charging a late fee if,as a result,the current installment is not paid timely.civil code section,subdivision k bans assessment of multiple charges for a single late installment.it does not dictate how a creditor must allocate a payment received when two or more installments are due and unpaid.it does not prohibit ford practice of attributing payments to the oldest outstanding installment.since ford may allocate a payment to the oldest outstanding installment,its imposition of late fees is also in keeping with the statute.ford charges only one late fee on any one installment.when multiple installments are due,each new payment is allocated to the oldest installment.if doing so leaves a newer installment unpaid,a late fee is assessed for that installment,but only one fee is assessed for any one installment.ford emphasized,h ad the legislature intended to prohibit ford practice,it could and would have done so expressly,as it did in civil code section governing late fees on home mortgage loans.section k contains no similar language.
ford further contended its practice did not violate the ucl,and that no claim was stated for violation of the clra because its representations were truthful,and further,civil code section,subdivision a was intended to proscribe misrepresentations,such as false advertising,not,exercises of creditors remedies.
davis opposition to the demurrer.
in opposition,davis asserted,inter alia,ford is correct that civil code section k does not specify how monthly installment payments may be applied and plaintiff does not,as ford argues,claim that section k requires any particular allocation of payments between principal and interest ford can allocate an april payment against a missing march payment,for example,applying the april payment to the outstanding interest from both the march and april payments and the remainder to unpaid principal under section k.what defendant can not do is then trigger a second late fee,since the only installment missed was march.certain italics added.
trial court ruling.
on june,the matter was argued and taken under submission.on september,the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,and set forth its rationale in an extensive written ruling.
in essence,the trial court held civil code section,subdivision k,permits a penalty to be charged for each installment in default for a period of not less than days.in the hypothetical pled in the complaint,when the consumer skips the september payment and makes an on time installment payment in october,ford is entitled to apply the october payment to the september delinquency.as a consequence,the september delinquency is satisfied but the installment due for october is late.thus,ford is entitled to impose a late charge for the october installment,which installment is in default.in this situation,the consumer is not being charged more than one delinquency charge on a late late fee is charged for the september installment and the second late fee is charged for the october installment,which installment is late as a consequence of the october payment having been applied to september.
the trial court concluded,the act does not preclude the conduct alleged in the complaint.insofar as the ucl and clra causes of action are premised on a violation of the act,these causes of action fail as well.insofar as plaintiff seeks to characterize ford practices alleged in the complaint as unfair or as unfair trade practices,these claims fail because,although the california legislature has comprehensively regulated lender practices in the area of automobile installment loans,the legislature has not seen fit to proscribe the practices alleged in the complaint.
on november,the trial court entered a judgment of dismissal following the sustaining of ford demurrer without leave to amend.on november,davis filed notice of appeal from the judgment.
subsequent proceedings.
on november,ford filed a motion for an award of in attorney fees.ford sought attorney fees pursuant to,specifically,civil code section,which provides for an award of reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party in any action on a contract or purchase order subject to the provisions of this chapter regardless of whether the action is instituted by the seller,holder or buyer.
in opposition,davis contended the action was not an action on a contract or purchase order subject to the provisions of.rather,the second cause of action,which alleged a violation of,was merely using that statute as the predicate for a claim under the ucl.
davis further argued the attorney fee provision of does not apply when a plaintiff primarily pleads causes of action under other consumer protection statutes that allow fee awards only to prevailing plaintiffs,and that under the ucl and crla only a prevailing party may obtain an award of attorney fees in the absence of litigation abuse.
on december,the matter came on for hearing.the trial court denied ford motion for attorney fees,stating here,the plaintiff was not seeking to enforce his contract with defendant.rather,he was seeking a remedy on the basis that the contract violated the law and should be avoided and that he should recover remedies for defendant violation of law.so in my judgment the attorneys fees provision does not apply 
on february,ford filed a timely notice of appeal from the postjudgment order denying its motion for attorney fees.
contentions 
davis contends the second cause of action under the ucl is properly predicated on a violation of ford late payment accounting practice violates and therefore is illegal under the ucl alternatively,ford practice violates the unfairness prong of the ucl and ford conduct is independently actionable under the clra.
ford urges affirmance of the judgment of dismissal and contends the trial court erred in denying its motion for attorney fees.
discussion 
davis.standard of appellate review.
on review of a demurrer,in addition to the allegations of the complaint,we may consider other relevant matters which are properly the subject of judicial notice and we may treat such matters as having been pleaded.we therefore treat the retail installment sales contract as having been pled in its entirety.city of hawthorne ex rel.wohlner h c disposal th,d coopers lybrand superior court d.marina tenants deauville marina development d.
in determining whether a plaintiff has properly stated a claim for relief,our standard of review is clear we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but not contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.citation.we also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.citation.further,we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.citation.when a demurrer is sustained,we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.citation.and when it is sustained without leave to amend,we decide whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment if it can be,the trial court has abused its discretion and we reverse if not,there has been no abuse of discretion and we affirm.citations.the burden of proving such reasonable possibility is squarely on the plaintiff.citations.zelig county of los angeles cal th,d.our review is de novo.ibid.
the alleged conduct of ford in charging successive late fees for successive months does not violate civil code section,subdivision k prohibition on charging more than one late fee per delinquent installment therefore davis can not predicate his ucl claim of an unlawful practice on a violation of.
a.the result of allocating a current payment to an earlier missed installment is that the current installment is unpaid,triggering a new late fee for the current month said practice is not barred by.
the contract provides in pertinent part how we will apply payments.we may apply each payment to the earned and unpaid part of the finance charge,to the unpaid part of the amount financed and to other amounts you owe under this contract in any order we choose.italics added.
ford practice is to attribute a customer payments to the oldest outstanding installment.as a result,if a payment is received on time during the current cycle,but the payment is attributed to an earlier missed installment,the current installment becomes past due,triggering a late fee for the current cycle.
davis contends this billing practice contravenes civil code section,subdivision k,which states in relevant part the contract may provide that for each installment in default for a period of not less than days the buyer shall pay a delinquency charge in an amount not to exceed in the aggregate percent of the delinquent installment,which amount may be collected only once on any installment regardless of the period during which it remains in default.italics added.
davis acknowledges the statute does not specify how monthly installment payments may be applied,and davis does not contend the statute requires any particular allocation of payments between principal and interest.davis concedes ford can allocate an april payment against a missing march payment,for example,applying the april payment to the outstanding interest from both the march and april payments and the remainder to unpaid principal under section k.davis asserts what ford can not do is then trigger a second late fee,since the only installment missed was march.there have not been any other installments in default.
davis argument does not withstand scrutiny.if an payment received during the month of april is allocated to march because the march payment was missed,the result of allocating said payment to march is that the april payment was missed,so as to trigger a new late fee for the month of april.under those circumstances,the consumer has not been charged more than one late fee for the missed march payment.rather,the first late fee is for the payment missed in march,and the second late fee represents the payment missed in april.
we agree with the trial court analysis in this regard and reiterate its ruling as follows as ford points out,however,under the hypothetical pleaded by way of example in the complaint,the first penalty is for a payment missed in september,and the second penalty is for a payment missed in october.when the consumer makes one payment in october,but does not bring the contract payments current by making up the september missed payment,the act does not preclude the automobile finance creditor from applying the october payment to the september delinquency.
plaintiff concedes that the act permits the automobile finance creditor to apply the october payment to the september delinquency for purposes of interest calculation plaintiff affirms that he does not challenge the way ford applies payments under section k.he does not seek to void the contract provision stating that ford may apply each payment to the earned and unearned part of the finance charge interest,to the unpaid part of the amount financed principal and to other amounts you owe under this section in any order we choose.plaintiff does not proffer a convincing argument for construing the statute to permit application of the october payment in the hypothetical to satisfy the september delinquency for purposes of calculation of interest,but not for purposes of calculating penalties.
the statutory language permits a penalty to be charged for each installment in default for a period of not less than days,k.in the hypothetical,when the consumer makes only one installment payment in october,he has satisfied the september delinquency but is late in making the october payment.ford is permitted to apply the october payment to the september delinquency.thus a late charge can be imposed for the october installment,which is in default.
we conclude davis has failed to allege ford practice of attributing a current payment to an earlier missed installment,so as to trigger a late fee for the current installment,violates.therefore,davis has failed to allege an unlawful practice under the ucl predicated on a violation of.
the vice which civil code section,subdivision k eliminates is the practice of pyramiding of late charges.by limiting the holder to one charge for each overdue installment,no matter how long it is overdue,the practice of pyramiding is eliminated.project,legislative regulation of retail installment financing ucla.an illustration of the practice of pyramiding of late charges is as follows assume a monthly payment of,with a late charge of per cent of the installment a month.in the first month,the failure to pay will result in a late charge of fifty cents.in the second month,a new payment is late,and an additional fifty cents is charged,but the first payment is now overdue an additional month,and a second fifty cents is charged for that.the buyer now owes in late charges.while this may not seem unreasonable,if the installment is not paid up by the sixth month,the late charges for the delinquencies will amount to per cent of the installment.thereafter,the charges continue to increase.if the buyer now resumes his monthly payments of,they will be attributed to the delinquency charges and not to the unpaid balance of the obligation.not only will the buyer never catch up,but he will continue to lose ground because the delinquency charge for each additional month becomes far in excess of the he is paying.id.at.
here,ford practice of attributing a payment to a previous missed installment,rather than to the current month,has the effect of leaving the current installment unpaid,so as to trigger a new late fee for the current month.however,irrespective of how long an installment is overdue,the consumer is assessed only a single late charge for each overdue installment,in compliance with civil code section,subdivision k.simply stated,davis allegations are not within the scope of the harm which the statute sought to address.
davis argument is more appropriately addressed to the legislature.
by way of comparison,civil code section,subdivision b,relating to mortgages,states in relevant part a late charge may not be imposed on any installment which is paid or tendered in full on or before its due date,or within days thereafter,even though an earlier installment or installments,or any late charge thereon,may not have been paid in full when due.for the purposes of determining whether late charges may be imposed,any payment tendered by the borrower shall be applied by the lender to the most recent installment due.italics added.
thus,as the trial court observed,if the hypothetical set forth in the complaint is translated to a home loan context,the creditor would be required to apply the payment made in october to the october installment,precluding a late charge in october.it appears,then,that when the legislature intends the result the plaintiff seeks here,the legislature expressly provides for that result.restrictions that are legislated for other consumer installment loan contexts should not be read into the act.plaintiff argues that civil code section was enacted after the act,and that the legislature simply was more complete in section.but the act was amended frequently after enactment of civil code section,and the legislature has not seen fit to add to the act the restriction adopted in the home loan context.
davis can not allege an unfair practice under the ucl.
in a backup argument,davis contends that even if,subd.k does not specifically prohibit ford accounting method,the practice is nonetheless independently actionable as an unfair business practice under the ucl.see communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d,practice that is not unlawful may nevertheless be unfair practice under ucl.
general principles the definition of an unfair practice in consumer cases.
because business and professions code section is written in the disjunctive,it establishes three varieties of unfair or practices which are unlawful,or unfair,or fraudulent.in other words,a practice is prohibited as unfair or deceptive even if not unlawful and vice versa,supra,cal th at,d.however,the ucl does not precisely define the term unfair and courts have struggled to come up with a workable definition.gregory albertson th,d gregory.
the state of the law on what constitutes an unfair business practice in consumer cases is somewhat unsettled in light of,supra,cal th,d,prior to,whether a practice was unfair under section required the court to engage in a balancing test.see,klein earth elements,th,d.determination of whether a business practice or act is unfair within the meaning of the uc l entails examination of the impact of the practice or act on its victim,balanced against the reasons,justifications and motives of the alleged wrongdoer.in brief,the court must weigh the utility of the defendant conduct against the gravity of the harm to the alleged victim citation.citation.id.at,d.progressive west ins.superior court th,d progressive.
in,our supreme court concluded that in the context of a dispute between business competitors,this balancing test was too amorphous and provide d too little guidance to courts and businesses,supra,cal th at,fn,d.thus,the court adopted the following test,w hen a plaintiff who claims to have suffered injury from a direct competitor unfair act or practice invokes section,the word unfair in that section means conduct that threatens an incipient violation of an antitrust law,or violates the policy or spirit of one of those laws because its effects are comparable to or the same as a violation of the law,or otherwise significantly threatens or harms competition.id.at,d.at the same time,the court declared,this case involves an action by a competitor alleging anticompetitive practices.our discussion and this test are limited to that context.nothing we say relates to actions by consumers or by competitors alleging other kinds of violations of the unfair competition law such as fraudulent or unlawful business practices or unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising.id.at,fn,d.thus,the court chose to leave for another day whether this test of unfairness applies to consumer cases as well.progressive,supra,th at,d,italics added.
the issue left open by has led to a split of authority on this question among the courts of appeal.see bardin daimlerchrysler th,d noting the split of authority and urging the california supreme court to resolve it.belton comcast cable holdings,llc,supra,th at,d see also lozano v.at t wireless services,cir,lozano noting split of authority with respect to definition of unfair in consumer cases.
one line of cases is represented by the decision of smith state farm mutual automobile ins.th,d smith,in which we applied the earlier balancing test in a consumer action,stating the test of whether a business practice is unfair involves an examination of that practice impact on its alleged victim,balanced against the reasons,justifications and motives of the alleged wrongdoer.in brief,the court must weigh the utility of the defendant conduct against the gravity of the harm to the alleged victim citations.citation.in people casa blanca convalescent homes,d,the court,acknowledging that the parameters of the term unfair business practice had not been defined in a california case,applied guidelines adopted by the federal trade commission and sanctioned by the united states supreme court in ftc sperry hutchinson,d.the court concluded that an unfair business practice occurs when that practice offends an established public policy or when the practice is immoral,unethical,oppressive,unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers.citation.citation.smith,supra,th at,d,italics added,fn.omitted.
another line of cases is represented by gregory,supra,th,d,which applied a more rigorous standard for unfairness.in gregory,supra,th,d,the appellate court disagreed with the use of the definition of unfair in smith,stating,however,may signal a narrower interpretation of the prohibition of unfair acts or practices in all unfair competition actions and provides reason for caution in relying on the broad language in earlier decisions that the court found to be too amorphous.fn.omitted.moreover,where a claim of an unfair act or practice is predicated on public policy,we read to require that the public policy which is a predicate to the action must be tethered to specific constitutional,statutory or regulatory provisions.see also schnall hertz th,d holding that any claims of unfairness under the ucl should be defined in connection with a legislatively declared policy also applied to ucl actions brought by consumers textron financial national union fire ins.th,d in consumer ucl action,court stated,given the supreme court disapproval of state farm fire casualty superior court th,d amorphous definition of unfair practices and its focus on legislatively declared public policy,reliance on general common law principles to support a cause of action for unfair competition is unavailing churchill village,general d,fn.holding definition of unfair also applies to consumer ucl actions byars scme mortgage bankers,th,d court applied test in consumer ucl action,stating t o show a business practice is unfair,the plaintiff must show the conduct threatens an incipient violation of an antitrust law,or violates the policy or spirit of one of those laws because its effects are comparable to or the same as a violation of the law,or otherwise significantly threatens or harms competition.bardin,supra,th at,d accord scripps clinic superior court th,d narrowed the expansive earlier interpretations of the term unfair to require that the public policy which is a predicate to the action must be tethered to specific constitutional,statutory or regulatory provisions.
b.a third approach camacho clarification of the definition of unfair in consumer cases.
camacho,supra,th,d,contains an excellent analysis of the issue and we adopt its definition of unfair in consumer cases.camacho states in relevant part 
the question is whether definition of unfair overrules appellate court opinions that use other definitions.we think that it does.definitions that are too amorphous in the context of anticompetitive practices are not converted into satisfactorily precise tests in consumer cases.this squares with the fact that,in disapproving appellate court opinions defining unfair in amorphous terms,the supreme court did not hold that the old definitions were appropriate in consumer cases.
we do not think,however,that this means that the finding,in a consumer case,that the practice is unfair must be tethered to specific constitutional,statutory or regulatory provisions,as one court of appeal has put it.gregory albertson,supra,th at,d in other words,we do not think that definition of unfair in cases involving anticompetitive practices applies to consumer cases.there are two reasons for this.
first,tethering a finding of unfairness to specific constitutional,statutory or regulatory provisions does not comport with the broad scope of section.tethering the concept of unfairness to existing positive law undercuts the principle that a practice is prohibited as unfair or deceptive,even if it is not unlawful or vice versa,supra,cal th at,d.as our supreme court has put it,the courts need to deal with innumerable new schemes that the fertility of man invention can contrive barquis merchants collection cal d,in the context of consumer cases,tethering to positive law undercuts the ability of the courts to deal with new situations,and new abuses.
second,anticompetitive conduct is best defined in terms of the policy and spirit of antitrust laws the same can not be said of a business practice that is unfair or deceptive in the terms of section.that is,cases involving anticompetitive conduct move in a far smaller,and more clearly defined,universe than unfair or deceptive business practices.it is therefore possible to tether anticompetitive conduct to the antitrust laws,while the universe of laws regulations that bear on unfair practices is so varied that it is not possible to achieve a consensus which of these laws and regulations might apply to define an unfair practice.
itself holds the key to the definition of unfair in consumer cases.holds that we may turn for guidance to the jurisprudence arising under section of the federal trade commission act,supra,cal th at,d.since,the factors that define unfairness under section are the consumer injury must be substantial the injury must not be outweighed by any countervailing benefits to consumers or competition and it must be an injury that consumers themselves could not reasonably have avoided.orkin exterminating cir.these factors have now been codified in title united states code section n.this definition of unfair is on its face geared to consumers and is for that reason appropriate in consumer cases.it is also suitably broad and is therefore in keeping with the sweeping nature of section.we will refer to this as the section test.camacho,supra,th at,d,italics added,fns.omitted.
davis can not allege unfairness under the section test for unfairness in a consumer case.
to reiterate,the factors that define unfairness under the section test are the consumer injury must be substantial the injury must not be outweighed by any countervailing benefits to consumers or competition and it must be an injury that consumers themselves could not reasonably have avoided.camacho,supra,th at,d.
in camacho,with regard to the third prong of the section test,the appellate court held the injury in this case is one that plaintiff could have reasonably avoided by complying with the law and obtaining insurance.thus,even if there is some theory under which plaintiff can claim that he was injured,the fact is that he could have avoided any and all action taken by defendants by obtaining and carrying insurance,as the law requires.camacho,supra,th at,d.
in the instant case,the alleged injury here,namely,the imposition of successive late fees for successive months,reasonably could have been avoided had davis made his monthly payments timely,or within the grace period,in accordance with his obligations under the contract 
because davis reasonably could have avoided the alleged injury,it is unnecessary to address the other elements of the section test.we conclude davis has not,and can not,state a claim under the unfairness prong of the ucl.
davis failed to state cause of action under the clra.
finally,davis contends ford conduct is independently actionable under the clra.
