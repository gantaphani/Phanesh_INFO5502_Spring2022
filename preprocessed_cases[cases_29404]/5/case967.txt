in civil rights cases,our normal rule provides for an award of appellate attorney fees to a prevailing party who successfully defends a verdict won in the district court.hutto finney,d corder gates,cir.the in this case,earnest cassell woods ii,qualifies as a prevailing party who would ordinarily be entitled to an award of attorney fees from a defendant who unsuccessfully appealed such a verdict.because woods is a prisoner,however,his award is subject to any applicable limiting provisions of the prison litigation reform act plra,d.
the,santos cervantes,argues that woods request for attorney fees is limited by d hereinafter d of the plra.this provision imposes a cap on the amount of attorney fees that a prisoner can recover from defendant prison officials in certain circumstances.the cap is percent of the monetary judgment.the cap applies to attorney fees incurred in conjunction with obtaining the award of a monetary judgment.we have held that it does not apply to attorney fees incurred in obtaining injunctive or other relief.dannenbergv.valadez,cir.in dannenberg,we held that the fee cap applied only to the portion of total fees that was incurred solely in order to obtain money damages.id.at.here,we follow dannenberg and hold that the cap in d does not apply to fees incurred on appeal by a prisoner who successfully defends the verdict that he obtained in the district court.in other words,the d cap applies only to fees incurred in securing the judgment in the district court and not to fees incurred in defending the judgment on appeal.
background 
recently,we affirmed a jury verdict awarding woods in compensatory and punitive damages against cervantes,an appeals coordinator at the california state prison,solano.the jury had found that cervantes violated woods eighth amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment by repeatedly screening out woods medical grievances,causing him to undergo pain and suffering for more than a year as the result of his inability to obtain dental care necessary to fix his broken partial dentures.cervantes appealed,arguing that the district court had erred in denying him qualified immunity.cervantes also asked this court to set aside the punitive damages award because it was unsupported by a showing of evil motive or intent.we rejected both of cervantes arguments and affirmed the judgment in a memorandum disposition.woods carey,app x,cir.
because woods was pro se before the district court,no attorney fees were sought in connection with the award of judgment.on appeal,woods was represented by counsel.after we rejected cervantes challenge to the verdict,woods filed a timely motion for attorney fees on appeal under b.he requested in attorney fees and in costs section b provides that,i n any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of section the court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney fee as part of the costs.b.cervantes concedes that woods qualifies as a prevailing party.cervantes argues,however,that he need pay only percent of the judgment of woods attorney fees because the plra fee cap provision applies to fees incurred defending a monetary judgment on appeal d.
the plra attorney fees provisions provide,in relevant part 
d attorney fees 
in any action brought by a prisoner who is confined to any jail,prison,or other correctional facility,in which attorney fees are authorized,such fees shall not be awarded,except to the extent that 
a the fee was directly and reasonably incurred in proving an actual violation of the plaintiffs rights protected by a statute pursuant to which a fee may be awarded under section of this title and 
b i the amount of the fee is proportionately related to the court ordered relief for the violation or 
ii the fee was directly and reasonably incurred in enforcing the relief ordered for the violation.
whenever a monetary judgment is awarded in an action described in paragraph,a portion of the judgment not to exceed percent shall be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney fees awarded against the defendant.if the award of attorney fees is not greater than percent of the judgment,the excess shall be paid by the defendant.
although our prior decision in dannenberg valadez,explained that d was limited to those fees incurred for the sole purpose of securing the monetary judgment,cir,we have not previously decided whether attorney fees on appeal incurred in order to preserve a district court award of damages against a prison official are subject to the percent statutory cap.
discussion 
woods and cervantes dispute whether d limits the amount that woods may recover from the defendant for attorney fees incurred in defending his judgment on appeal to percent of the monetary relief awarded to him at trial we begin our analysis as one of statutory interpretation.even so,because this is not the first time our court has been asked to determine the scope of d,our analysis must also take into account our prior decision in dannenberg.
if the statutory language provide d a clear answer,our task would come to an end.united states harrell,cir quoting hughes aircraft jacobson,d.if the statute terms are ambiguous,however,we may use canons of construction,legislative history,and the statute overall purpose to illuminate congress intent.jonah carmona,cir.a statute is ambiguous if it gives rise to more than one reasonable interpretation.degeorgev.dist.for cent.dist.of,cir quoting a z int l phillips,cir.
the language used in d is ambiguous with respect to the circumstances under which the fee cap is applicable.the section states whenever a monetary judgment is awarded in an action the fee cap shall be applicable.this section could be interpreted to mean either the fee cap applies to attorney fees awarded only in conjunction with the obtaining of a monetary judgment an award that occurs only once in the course of an action,following summary judgment or trial before the district court,or the fee cap applies to any attorney fees that are awarded for any reason during the course of an action in which a monetary judgment has been awarded by the district court woods urges the former construction of the statute cervantes,the latter.both are reasonable interpretation s of the statutory language.degeorge,at citations omitted.
in dannenberg valadez,we rejected the defendant interpretations of d that is,we rejected the application of the fee cap to fees awarded for any reason during the course of an action in which a monetary judgment has been awarded.cir.instead,we limited the applicability of the fee cap to those fees awarded only in conjunction with the obtaining of a monetary judgment.id.at.we held that the fee cap does not apply to attorney fees incurred in securing relief when a prisoner is awarded both a monetary judgment and a declaratory judgment or an injunction in the same proceeding.id.
in so holding,we looked to the whole of d and construed d in a manner that would be consistent with d.id.at citing united states fiorillo,cir statutes are to be interpreted as a whole and o ne provision of a statute should not be interpreted in a manner that renders other sections of the same statute inconsistent,meaningless or superfluous.citation omitted.we reasoned that in a case in which the court ordered both monetary and nonmonetary relief,it would be inconsistent with d,which provides for an amount of attorney fees proportionately related to the relief,to essentially ignore the attorney efforts in pursuing the relief by limiting the fee award to of the monetary judgment.dannenberg,at.thus,we held that the fee cap applied only to those fees incurred for the sole purpose of securing the monetary judgment.id.at.
our conclusion in dannenberg,that d applies only to those fees incurred for the sole purpose of securing the monetary judgment,is the proper interpretation of that provision and one we must follow here.just as dannenberg held that it would be inconsistent with d to apply the fee cap to attorney fees incurred for securing relief,it would likewise be inconsistent with d to apply the fee cap to attorney fees that are awarded,not in connection with securing the monetary
