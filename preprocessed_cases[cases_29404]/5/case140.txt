filmon and filmon chief executive officer,alkiviades david david,appeal from an august,judgment entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york buchwald,pursuant to a decision holding filmon and david in contempt of an august,consent order of judgment and permanent injunction the injunction.the injunction prohibited filmon from distributing copyrighted content owned by plaintiffs appellees collectively,the plaintiffs a group of television networks including cbs broadcasting,nbc studios llc,fox television stations,and abc holding company.on july,the district court ordered filmon and david to show cause why the district court should not hold filmon in contempt for violating the injunction because filmon had used its teleporter technology teleporter system to distribute the plaintiffs copyrighted television programs without the plaintiffs permission.the district court found that filmon had violated the injunction and held both filmon and david in civil contempt,sanctioned filmon,and awarded the plaintiffs attorneys fees.on appeal,filmon and david argue that the district court abused its discretion when it held them in contempt,sanctioned filmon,and awarded the plaintiffs attorneys fees.for the reasons stated below,we affirm the district court decision.
background 
in,filmon launched a service that allowed subscribers to use a computer or mobile device to stream an assortment of television stations over the internet.the plaintiffs sued filmon for copyright infringement and sought a temporary restraining order.in response,filmon argued that it was operating as a cable system and therefore it qualified for a section compulsory license under the copyright act,the district court granted the temporary restraining order,and in july the parties entered into a settlement agreement the settlement agreement which was executed by david in his personal capacity and on behalf of filmon.the district court approved the settlement agreement and then entered it as a stipulated consent judgment and the injunction.
the injunction prevents filmon and its affiliated companies,and all of its officers,directors,agents from infringing,by any means,directly or indirectly,any of plaintiffs exclusive rights under section of the copyright act,including but not limited to through the streaming over mobile telephone systems the internet.app.the injunction explicitly provides that any violation of its provisions would expose filmon to all applicable penalties,including contempt of court.id.
after consenting to the injunction,filmon began offering its subscribers a video on demand vod service which allowed users to access an archive of previously televised programs for streaming at any time.in july,the plaintiffs sought an order to show cause why filmon should not be held in contempt for violating the injunction.the district court found filmon and david in contempt for the unauthorized vod streaming of the plaintiffs programming.the district court issued a contempt judgment contempt judgment that required defendants to agree not to use the vod system to stream any of the plaintiffs copyrighted programming and to remove all broadcast programming identified by the plaintiffs.in addition,the contempt judgment awarded the networks in attorneys fees and provided that any further failure to comply with the injunction shall be punishable by a penalty of per day of noncompliance.app.
after the contempt judgment was entered,filmon filmon sister company deployed a new teleporter technology which filmon alleges was specifically designed to comply with the injunction and this circuit decision in cartoon network lp csc holdings,cir cablevision while still providing copyrighted content to users.in cablevision we held that a remote storage dvr system allowing users to record and store programming on hard drives did not violate the public performance rights of copyright owners.id.at.filmon teleporter system leveraged this remote storage dvr technology to allow consumers to view television content over the internet at essentially the same time that the content was being broadcast over the airwaves.
other companies began using similar technology in an attempt to comply with the law and to deliver copyrighted content to users over the internet.the television networks challenged the use of this technology this time by suing the company aereo,and this court determined that the technology did not infringe upon the networks copyrights because the technology was analogous to the technology in cablevision.wnet,thirteen aereo,cir aereo ii.because filmon teleporter system is essentially the same as aereo technology,this decision arguably made clear that filmon could deploy its teleporter system to distribute copyrighted material throughout the geographic scope of the second circuit.
in an attempt to prevent filmon from deploying this technology nationwide,the plaintiffs filed copyright infringement actions in california and in the district of columbia.the california district court enjoined filmon from using the teleporter technology within the ninth circuit,fox television stations,barrydriller content,plc,d,and on september,the district court issued another injunction enjoining filmon from deploying the teleporter technology nationwide,fox television stations,filmon x llc,d.due to our decision in aereo ii,the district court nationwide injunction explicitly did not apply within the geographic boundaries of the second circuit.id.after deployment of the teleporter system within the first circuit,the district court held filmon in contempt for violating its order.the district court warned that it would impose a fine of per day for any further violations of the injunction,noting that filmon had once violated the underlying injunction in this case.the court contempt order was never appealed.
on june,the supreme court,in american broadcasting companies,aereo,reversed this court decision that had arguably demarcated the second circuit as a safe haven for using the teleporter technology,d aereo iii.the supreme court agreed with the broadcast networks,including the plaintiffs,that aereo performs petitioners copyrighted works publicly,as those terms are defined in the transmit clause.id.at alteration omitted.the court held that the use of the remote storage dvr technology constituted a public performance of the petitioners protected programming and determined that aereo technology,which was previously permissible within the geographic scope of the second circuit,was now prohibited under the copyright act.id.at.
on june,a few days after the supreme court decision in aereo iii,aereo,ceased using the prohibited technology.filmon,however,continued to operate its teleporter system throughout the second circuit.on july,the plaintiffs filed the underlying order to show cause.four days later filmon canceled operations of its teleporter system.
the plaintiffs argue that,after the supreme court decision in aereo iii,filmon violated the injunction by using its teleporter system to broadcast the plaintiffs copyrighted content within the second circuit.the plaintiffs also contend that filmon transmitted the copyrighted programming to regions outside the second circuit.the district court agreed with the television networks and held filmon and david in civil contempt,sanctioned filmon,and awarded attorneys fees.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
filmon contempt order 
we first address whether the district court abused its discretion when it held filmon in contempt.b ecause the power of a district court to impose contempt liability is carefully limited,our review of a contempt order for is more rigorous than would be the case in other situations in which abuse of discretion review is conducted.local,cir quoting united states local,int l longshoremen ass n,cir.we review the district court interpretation of the terms of a consent decree de novo and the factual findings that were the basis for the contempt order for clear error.perez danbury,cir.
the contempt power serves to protect the due and orderly administration of justice and to maintain the authority and dignity of the court.roadway express,piper,d.a court may hold a party in contempt if the order the party failed to comply with is clear and unambiguous,the proof of noncompliance is clear and convincing,and the party has not diligently attempted to comply in a reasonable manner.paramedics electromedicina commercial,ge med.info,cir.
the injunction prohibits filmon,its affiliated companies,officers,and others 
from infringing,by any means,directly or indirectly,any of plaintiffs exclusive rights under section of the copyright act including but not limited to through the streaming over mobile telephone systems the internet of any of the broadcast television programming in which any plaintiff owns a copyright.
clear and unambiguous 
an injunction is sufficiently clear and unambiguous if it leaves no doubt in the minds of those to whom it was addressed precisely what acts are forbidden.drywall tapers pointers local,cir.here,a violation of the injunction is conditioned on any violation of the copyright.whether the injunction is clear and unambiguous is thus directly related to whether the plaintiffs exclusive rights under the copyright act were clear and unambiguous.we hold that they were.
filmon,nevertheless,argues that the injunction is unclear and ambiguous because the plaintiffs exclusive rights under the copyright act were in flux and were uncertain.in particular,filmon contends that aereo iii destroyed the state of clarity surrounding the plaintiffs copyrights and created confusion as to whether their teleporter system now qualified for a section license.given this confusion,it was unclear whether filmon continued deployment of the teleporter system would infringe on the plaintiffs rights.because aereo technology and filmon technology are nearly identical,filmon argues that dicta in the aereo iii decision comparing aereo to a cable company cast doubt on whether the current regulatory regime is properly classifying their technology.
filmon arguments are unpersuasive.regarding section,we note that at no point in time has filmon obtained a section license.although at some point in the future filmon technology may eventually qualify for a section license,under the current law of the second circuit internet retransmission services do not constitute cable systems under.wpix,ivi,cir ivi and whatever future door aereo iii may have opened regarding section licensing,there is no doubt that the supreme court holding explicitly slammed shut the possibility that filmon could continue deploying the teleporter system throughout the second circuit,absent a license,without violating the copyright act.aereo iii explicitly held that this type of technology performed petitioner copyrighted works publicly and therefore violated the copyright act.aereo iii at.the injunction,sufficiently clear and unambiguous on its own,became even more so after aereo iii such that there should have been no doubt in the minds of those to whom it was addressed that deploying the teleporter system was forbidden.drywall,at.
ii.clear and convincing proof of noncompliance 
the district court did not err when it determined that the proof of filmon noncompliance was supported by clear and convincing evidence.aereo iii made clear that deploying the teleporter system within the second circuit would violate the plaintiffs copyright.filmon admits that it deployed its teleporter system in the second circuit between june,and july.this admission belies any claim of error.
iii.diligent attempt to comply in a reasonable manner 
the district court also did not err when it found that filmon did not diligently attempt to comply with the injunction in a reasonable manner.filmon correctly understood that aereo iii materially changed the plaintiffs exclusive copyrights under the injunction.filmon incorrectly took it upon itself to interpret that change.if filmon,being already subject to an injunction barring it from infringing the plaintiffs copyrights,wanted to ensure that it remained in compliance with the injunction,it could have petitioned the district court for a modification,clarification or construction of the order.mccomb jacksonville paper.instead,it undertook to make its own determination of what the plaintiffs rights were.id.rather than petitioning the district court for clarification,filmon issued a press release announcing its plans to file for a section license,to continue deploying the teleporter system in new york and to expand its use nationwide.
irrespective of whether filmon will eventually qualify for a section license,the fact that it applied for a license is not evidence that it acted in a reasonable manner under the circumstances.as noted above,filmon did not possess a section license at the time it deployed its teleporter system,nor did it even apply for one until after the plaintiffs filed the underlying order to show cause.moreover,because the district court had already rejected filmon section argument before the injunction was initially issued,the only prudent decision would have been to approach the district court and argue that the law had changed in filmon favor.filmon took no such action.
considering filmon history of misreading changes in federal copyright law and being held in contempt for violating multiple federal injunctions both in this circuit and in the circuit,a response by filmon to the aereo iii decision that diligently attempted to comply with the injunction should have included proceeding with caution.rather than following aereo lead and suspending operations,however,filmon cavalierly doubled down and continued deploying the teleporter system throughout the second circuit with plans to expand.although it is true that aereo iii may have altered the plaintiffs exclusive rights under the copyright act,filmon response to this change was not a diligently reasonable attempt to comply with the injunction under which it was already required to operate.we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by holding filmon in civil contempt.
david contempt order 
we next address whether the district court abused its discretion when it held david in contempt.the injunction not only enjoins filmon but also all of its officers,directors,agents,servants and employees.app.a command to a company is in effect a command to those who are officially responsible for the conduct of its affairs.nlrb hopwood retinning,cir hopwood quoting wilson united states.even when corporate officers are not a party to the original action,if they prevent compliance or fail to take appropriate action within their power for the performance of the corporate duty,they,no less than the corporation itself,are guilty of disobedience,and may be punished for contempt.hopwood,at.
according to his own statement opposing the district court order,david had the ability to prevent filmon from deploying the teleporter system.in addition,filmon chief technology officer,mykola kutovyy,stated in a declaration that david,as ceo,had previously directed him to limit the geographic scope in which the technology could function.this evidence supports the district court conclusion that david both had the power to force filmon to comply and failed to take appropriate action within his power to prevent filmon from violating the injunction.id.at.the district court did not abuse its discretion by holding david in contempt for filmon violation of the injunction.
we now turn to the issue of sanctions.we review the district court award of sanctions for abuse of discretion.united states seltzer,cir this court reviews all aspects of a district court decision to impose sanctions for abuse of discretion.internal quotation omitted.a court interest in protecting the integrity of a consent decree justifies any reasonable action taken by the court to secure compliance.nlrb local,int l of elect.workers,cir local quoting united states local,cir.this inherent power to enforce a consent judgment extends beyond the remedial contractual terms agreed upon by the parties.id.internal quotation omitted.this power,however,has limits.a district court can not impose criminal sanctions without affording a defendant the constitutional procedural protections of a jur
