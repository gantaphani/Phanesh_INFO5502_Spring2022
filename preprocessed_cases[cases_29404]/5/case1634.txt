prior to entering into a subdivision improvement agreement sia with the city of palm springs city for the development of a private residential community called the avalon palm springs village project avalon,suncal psv,llc suncal,the owner of the property in a joint venture partnership with lehman brothers,obtained a maintenance and warranty bond,several faithful performance fp bonds,and seven labor and materials l m bonds from defendant and appellant bond safeguard insurance company safeguard to insure the project.suncal and city then entered into a sia which specifically required landscaping improvements to offsite areas bordering the project,which were owned by city city required the landscaping for the offsite areas be bonded.suncal had previously obtained a l m bond for off site landscaping traffic in the amount of,representing percent of the estimated cost of those improvements.
suncal entered into three separate contracts with plaintiff and appellant nissho of california,nissho for the landscaping of avalon.one of those contracts,for,covered labor and materials for the offsite landscaping required in the sia.nissho completed a substantial portion of the work in the offsite contract but never received payment.on january,nissho gave notice to suncal and safeguard that it had not been paid the sum of for work performed on the offsite landscaping contract.attached to the letter were copies of both the fp and l m off site landscape traffic bonds and the maintenance and warranty bond.
nissho filed suit against both suncal and safeguard seeking damages of as against suncal for breach of all three contracts and as against safeguard on the l m bonds after a bench trial,the court ruled in favor of nissho in the amount of,permitting it to seek recompense against all the l m bonds,regardless of their characterization.nissho filed a motion for attorney fees,which the trial court denied.safeguard appeals contending the trial court erred in awarding nissho damages in excess of the l m bond for off site landscaping traffic the offsite bond.nissho appeals maintaining it was entitled to an award of attorney fees.we reverse the judgment with respect to the trial court award of damages to nissho above the limit of the offsite bond.we affirm the judgment with respect to the trial court denial of nissho motion for attorney fees.
factual and procedural history 
director of public works and city engineer david barakian,testified it was city responsibility to make sure any proposed development was consistent with city general plan as adopted by the city council.barakian reviewed all plans for new developments in the city and had authority to accept or reject any proposed plans.if a developer was proposing a new development within the city,it was required to obtain security to pay for the improvements in case they were not completed by the developer in this instance,the security consisted of bonds.the form of the bond was dictated or approved by the city attorney.
developers were required to obtain bonds for both fp and l fp bonds ensured that if the developer refused or was unable to complete the project city could recover the costs for the improvements it deemed necessary.l m bonds cover the costs of labor and materials of vendors and subcontractors employed by the developer in performance of the contract.a maintenance and warranty bond covered improvements for a period after the city accepted the improvements.suncal asked city if it could break up the securities by category of the work to be performed.
between october,and,suncal obtained from safeguard fp bonds totaling or percent of the estimated cost for the proposed works of improvement.on the same dates,suncal obtained from safeguard seven l m bonds totaling,or percent of the estimated construction costs.the l m bonds were enumerated and valued as follows domestic water storm drain sanitary sewer system ac pavement aggregate base curb and offsite landscaping traffic.suncal additionally acquired a maintenance and warranty of improvements bond in the amount of.the offsite landscaping improvements were proposed by suncal in order that the surrounding public areas would match the landscaping of the development 
todd rohm,an independent insurance agent working for rohm insurance agency signed the offsite bond as for safeguard.it was on a city bond form.rohm testified separate bonds,rather than a single bond,were issued because it would narrow the scope of the work performed allowing the principal,suncal,to obtain releases from city under the individual bonds so that it would not continue to be liable for the total amount of improvements yet to be constructed.thus,if the curbs and gutters,landscaping,and streets were completed,suncal could be released by city for liability for the completed works while remaining liable only for those yet to be completed.the sia was entered into by the parties on december.rohm testified it very typical that the bonds have to be prepared and included within the agreements and submitted all at one time and then the the agreement is often times signed at a later date when everything is provided,security included,the bond security.
moreover,renewal premiums were required to be paid on all the bonds,so it would be less costly for a developer to have separate bonds,some of which might be completed and released,than it is to have one large bond that must continue to be renewed until the entire project is completed.once the work secured by a particular bond is signed off and accepted by the city,the bond is exonerated and the principal no longer is required to pay premiums on that bond.furthermore,if a claim is made on a single l m bond,the claimant could obtain an award for the entire amount of the bond to the exclusion of all other subcontractors,laborers,or suppliers who could potentially also make claims against the same bond thus,bonds separately designated for divergent areas of work would make it more likely that any particular subcontractor could obtain recompense against the bond if the developer became unable to pay.
each category of bond issued covered only work performed within the purview of that bond.construction estimates were created to enumerate what work would be covered by each particular bond.those estimates determined what entities could recover for any particular type of work designated under the separately characterized bonds.any work not performed on those worksheets would not be covered by that bond.carol templeton,an engineering associate for city who was involved in the sia and the bond calculations for avalon,testified the bond amounts were assessed using the amounts in the bond worksheets.she obtained the amount for the offsite bond by obtaining estimates from two subcontractors for the total amount of the work required the amounts were doubled to provide a cushion in case city had to perform the work itself.there was no requirement that suncal contractors or subcontractors pay prevailing wages for any of the project work,including the offsite landscaping.
marcus fuller,the assistant director of public works and assistant city engineer for city who prepared and reviewed all the bonds in the avalon project,testified none of the landscape improvements were ever accepted by city.he testified it is unusual for city to require landscaping bonds for such projects city only required landscaping bonds in the avalon project for offsite areas that city would later be required to maintain.city did not require that landscaping in areas,areas which would be within the community and not on city land,be bonded.nonetheless,even though the bonds covered offsite areas belonging to city,the bonds were not bonds associated with public work projects.
nabu kato,the owner and founder of nissho,testified he provided estimates to suncal for the landscaping work on avalon.his estimates did not include prevailing wages.nissho subsequently signed contracts with suncal for the landscaping work.kato defined offsite work as any work conducted on land that would eventually be turned over either to the homeowners association or city.
after trial,the parties agreed the primary dispute between nissho and safeguard was not whether nissho could and should recover money from one of the bonds,but which bond or bonds and up to what amount.safeguard contended nissho was limited to recovering the for work under the offsite bond.in fact,safeguard conceded nissho work was covered by the offsite bond nissho did landscape work,t hey entitled to recover under that bond up to it simply contested nissho ability to reach the other l m bonds.nissho argued it could recover for all its work,both offsite and,under all the l m bonds.
the court entered judgment in favor of nissho in the amount of plus costs and interest from january.the court found nissho had provided work in the amount of.the court further found,the sia only requires that a security instrument singular be provided for l therefore,suncal and safeguard contracted to split the l m requirement into seven separate bonds.no subcontractor was a party to this agreement.thereby,safeguard contracted with suncal to limit it s own liability to the detriment of the subcontractors.thus,the court finds that safeguard is liable to nissho up to an amount not exceeding million.the court additionally awarded nissho recovery of interest dating back to the date of its claim because the court found nissho was not limited to the amount of the l m landscape bond.finally,the court tentatively found nissho was not entitled to recover attorney fees because insufficient evidence established the l m bonds were public works payment bonds.thus,the fact that some of the areas would come under the control of city did not alter the private nature of the agreement at the time it was signed.
nissho later filed a motion for attorney fees as a direct obligee of the bond.the court denied the motion,expositing,nissho as the prevailing party is not entitled to attorneys fees under the labor and materials bonds government code section or civ il code sections et.the purpose of the labor and material bonds involved here is to protect city by providing for payment to the contractors subcontractors,laborers,materialmen,and all other persons employed in the performance of the work of improvement,for materials furnished or labor thereon of any kind.the bonds are not designed to establish a fund for payment of breach of contract damages beyond the reasonable amount of materials or labor provided.even if the contract between suncal and nissho provided for attorneys fees to the prevailing party the court would reach the same decision.
discussion 
introduction 
the subdivision map act is the primary regulatory control governing the subdivision of real property in california.citation.it has three principal goals to encourage orderly community development,to prevent undue burdens on the public,and to protect individual real estate buyers.citation.it seeks to encourage and facilitate orderly community development,coordinate planning with the community pattern established by local authorities,and assure proper improvements are made,so that the area does not become an undue burden on the taxpayer.citation.pacific palisades bowl mobile estates,llc city of los angeles cal th,d.
to accomplish its goals,the subdivision map act sets suitability,design,improvement,and procedural requirements,et,et.it also allows local governments to impose supplemental requirements of the same kind,et,et.citation.further,t he act vests the r egulation and control of the design and improvement of subdivisions in the legislative bodies of local agencies,which must promulgate ordinances on the subject.citation.the local entity enforcement power is directly tied to its power to grant or withhold approval of a subdivision map.thus,o rdinarily,subdivision under the act may be lawfully accomplished only by obtaining local approval and recordation of a tentative and final map citation.pacific palisades bowl mobile estates,llc city of los angeles,supra,cal th at,d.
by the enactment of this article,the legislature intends to accomplish the following objective c to ensure that local agencies have maximum discretion in the imposition of conditions on any approvals occurring subsequent to the approval or conditional approval of the vesting tentative map,whenever the furnishing of security is required it shall be in any form of security which is acceptable to the local agency including one or more bonds by one or more authorized corporate sureties,subd.a.

nissho was limited to recovering against the penal sum enumerated in the offsite bond in the amount of 
safeguard contends nissho was limited to recovering against the amount enumerated in the offsite bond.we agree.
here,the court resorted to the consideration of evidence extrinsic to the sia and the bond agreements.as such,we may consider such evidence in determining whether its interpretation of the sia was supported by substantial evidence.considering the uncontradicted parole evidence of the sia adduced below,we hold nissho was limited to recover only in an amount no greater than the penal sum specified in the offsite bond.
first,section et clearly provide for the legality of obtaining separate bonds to furnish security for projects such as the sia.section,subdivision a allows for a b ond or bonds by one or more duly authorized corporate sureties.section,which dictates the form of any l m bond issued under the statutes,provides a bond or bonds by one or more duly authorized corporate sureties for the security of laborers and material suppliers shall be in substantially the following form.thus,the issuance of multiple l m bonds for a development project was clearly envisioned under the statutory scheme.
second,it is notable all the avalon security bonds were issued more than a month prior to the execution of the sia.all the bonds were issued between october,and.the sia was not signed until december,at which time city had already accepted nissho provision of security,which the parties agree was incorporated into the sia.thus,the parties to the sia clearly intended the provision of multiple l m bonds to be acceptable.
the evidence adduced below established city consented to the issuance of separate securities characterized by the work to be performed.city was approached prior to issuance of the securities with a request that city permit suncal to obtain separate securities.city was intimately involved in determining the amounts of the bonds through the use of bond worksheets and contractor estimates specifically delineated by the type of work to be performed thus,not only was city aware that separate bonds would issue,it aided suncal in determining their scope.the security bonds were on forms supplied and approved by city.city reviewed the adequacy of the bonds prior to entering into the sia.thus,city exercised its statutorily invested maximum discretion in approving the sia with separate security bonds,subd.c.
third,contrary to the court ruling,it was undisputed below that suncal,not safeguard,requested issuance of separate securities.thus,contrary to the court characterization,safeguard did not attempt to limit it s own liability to the detriment of the subcontractors.indeed,safeguard did only what was requested of it issue separate securities in amounts and characterizations of the work to be performed as designated by suncal and city.since,as discussed ante,the bonds were on city forms and in amounts determined by city and suncal based on subcontractor estimates,it is difficult to assign nefarious intent to safeguard for doing exactly what was asked of it.
fourth,it is entirely consistent with a reading of the sia that suncal would have safeguard issue separately denominated l m bonds limited to the work therein described.nissho maintains the sia provision that,a security instrument guaranteeing the payment to contractors,subcontractors,and other persons furnishing labor,materials,equipment labor and materials security instrument with respect to the works of improvement in an amount equal to equal to of the estimated construction cost,required safeguard to issue one l m bond in the amount of percent of all estimated construction costs,from all of which it was entitled to seek remuneration.likewise,nissho argues language in each of the l m bonds reading,for materials furnished or labor thereon of any kind allowed it to disregard the characterization of each bond since it provided work that would fall within the broad definition of any kind.italics added.the clear intent of those provisions was to provide adequate security for the entire project in the sia and the categories of improvements denominated in the separate l m bonds.the fact that suncal had safeguard issue separate bonds securing disparate facets of the project comes well within that intent.lunardi great west life assurance th,d.
whether suncal obtained one security instrument or several,the bonds obtained by suncal from safeguard covered the amounts and work required by the sia,city,and government code sections et.county of kern california of health services th,d.city chose to limit the l m bonds to percent of the estimated costs of the improvements to be performed by the contractors,subcontractors,laborers,materialmen,and suppliers.
the offsite bond in the amount of represented percent of all estimated offsite landscaping and traffic improvements.the amount of the bond was determined primarily from cost estimates provided by nissho itself.moreover,the estimates that provided the base amount for the offsite bond were doubled to provide a cushion in case city had to perform the work.this is,presumably,because once city had to undertake the work,it would become a public works project requiring city to pay prevailing wages.thus,because the offsite bond included amounts for work and doubled the construction estimates for all work performed under its aegis,the bond could not be construed as limiting any subcontractor potential recovery under the bond in the event suncal defaulted,particularly nissho,which participated in the computation of the bond amount.indeed,because nissho offsite landscaping contract with suncal amounted to,nissho was at least on constructive notice that its contract amount twice exceeded the offsite bond and,therefore,it would be unable to recover even half the value of its work from the bond should suncal default.
fifth,nissho presumably had knowledge of both the sia and the bonds before it bid on or accepted award of the offsite landscaping contract with suncal.as noted ante,nissho had provided construction estimates,which served as the basis for the amount of the offsite bond.the incorporated bonds and bond worksheets were attached to the sia,which was recorded in the county recorder office.kato testified nissho began landscaping in.over its ensuing plus year history,nissho expanded to the point where it had four regional offices operating in chula vista,temecula,palm springs,and vista,california.nissho specialized in multiple large projects of up to acres with home sites.
under these circumstances,it is reasonable to conclude nissho knew that under section,subdivision b,city was able to require that suncal provide l m bonds limiting nissho recovery in the event of suncal default to only percent of the work it completed or percent of the total work conducted on the project.thus,nissho was effectively on notice it could not rely on the entirety of all the l m bonds for recovery in the event of suncal default.nissho complains,the net effect of safeguard bond headers,if they are enforceable,is that contractors such as nissho can not be paid the full value of their work and labor.section,subdivision b permits city to limit recovery for subcontractors to percent of the work provided.city elected to require only the minimum amount of coverage required by statute.
sixth,the court judgment did not differentiate between nissho and offsite work.on the contrary,the court judgment aggregated the three separate contracts nissho entered into with suncal and noted nissho had performed worth of work on the aggregated contracts,the exact amount it awarded nissho.thus,the court erroneously permitted nissho to recover against the bonds for its work.although nissho sought recovery against the bonds for both its and offsite work,the undisputed testimony below established that only its offsite work was covered by the offsite bond.thus,only offsite landscaping was bonded and the court award of recovery against the bonds for work performed by nissho was error.
seventh and finally,treatment of all the l m bonds as one singular bond while disregarding each bond limitations with regard to the type of work characterized therein would ignore the intent of the actual parties to the bonds and the legal requirement that bonds be strictly construed to limit the surety obligations to those expressly specified.here,safeguard was presented with bonds by suncal on city forms,in language written by city,based upon language required by statute,in amounts based upon estimates provided by subcontractors,and with characterizations of the work to be performed provided by city and suncal.safeguard issued the bonds as they were presented to it.nissho invokes former civil code section providing,any bond given pursuant to the provisions of this title will be construed most strongly against the surety and in favor of all persons for whose benefit
