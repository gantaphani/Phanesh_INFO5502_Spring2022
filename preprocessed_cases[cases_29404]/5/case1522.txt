background 
in the late,facing the january,expiration of patent covering the antidiarrheal product imodium,mcneil sought patentable improvements that would allow it to extend its position as market leader.id.at.jeffrey garwin,mcneil assistant director of clinical research for gastrointestinal products,proposed at the time to pair loperamide,the active antidiarrheal ingredient in imodium,with the antigas drug simethicone,in order to treat both diarrhea and the flatulence that often accompanies it.id.at.following garwin proposal,mcneil scientists evaluated a combination containing mg loperamide and mg simethicone,and allegedly found that the combination produced a synergistic effect.mcneil was granted two patents relating to that research patent,entitled method for treating gastrointestinal distress,claiming methods of using compositions containing combinations of antidiarrheal compounds and simethicone to treat a human suffering from an intestinal disorder and patent,entitled pharmaceutical compositions for treating gastrointestinal distress,claiming the compositions themselves.collectively,the two patents are referred to as the garwin patents.id.at.
further research with chewable tablets containing a combination of loperamide and simethicone led to the discovery that the simethicone in those tablets apparently surrounded the loperamide over time,decreasing its bioavailability,and thereby reducing the tablets.id.at.mcneil researchers charles stevens,michael hoy,and edward roche then found that the decrease in bioavailability could be avoided by using a polymeric barrier to separate the simethicone from the loperamide.id.at.subsequently,mcneil obtained patents and both entitled simethicone containing pharmaceutical compositions,and collectively referred to as the stevens patents,covering that method and the resulting tablets,respectively.id.at.mcneil has sold combination tablets having the impermeable barrier of the and patents as imodium advanced since,pursuant to an approved new drug application nda.
perrigo filed an abbreviated new drug application anda at the united states food and drug administration fda in under j,seeking approval to market a generic version of imodium advanced.id.at.along with the test data that it was required to include in its anda,perrigo filed a certification under j a vii iv,a paragraph iv certification,declaring that the garwin patents are invalid that the stevens patents are invalid and that perrigo proposed manufacture,use,and sale of its combination product would not infringe the stevens patents.as required under j b,perrigo also gave notice of its anda filing to mcneil as the patent owner and nda holder,providing a detailed statement of the factual and legal bases for perrigo opinion that the garwin and stevens patents are invalid and that the stevens patents would not be infringed if its product were to be approved for marketing.id.
on march,mcneil filed suit against perrigo under e a,alleging that perrigo submission of its anda was an act of infringement of numerous claims of the garwin and stevens patents.id.mcneil later amended its complaint twice,ultimately asserting infringement of only claims and of the patent,claim of the patent,claims and of the patent,and claims of the patent under e a.id.the asserted claims of the patent read as follows 
a method for treating a human suffering from an intestinal disorder characterized by the symptoms of diarrhea and flatulence or gas comprising administering to said human in a combined pharmaceutical composition,an effective amount of an antidiarrheal compound selected from the group consisting of loperamide,bismuth subsalicylate,diphenoxylate,polycarbophil,their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and mixtures thereof and an antiflatulent effective amount of simethicone,wherein the amount of simethicone administered is mg per dosage unit and the amount of loperamide administered is mg per dosage unit 
a method for treating a human suffering from an intestinal disorder characterized by diarrhea and flatulence and or gas comprising administering to said human in a combined pharmaceutical composition,mg of loperamide and an antiflatulent effective amount of simethicone thereafter administering to said human in a combined pharmaceutical composition,mg of loperamide and an antiflatulent effective amount of simethicone until the diarrhea is controlled.
the asserted claim of the patent reads as follows 
a composition for treating a human suffering from an intestinal disorder characterized by the symptoms of diarrhea and flatulence or gas comprising an effective amount of an antidiarrheal compound selected from the group consisting of loperamide,bismuth subsalicylate,diphenoxylate,polycarbophil,their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and mixtures thereof and an antiflatulent effective amount of simethicone,comprising mg of simethicone and mg of loperamide 
the asserted claims of the patent read as follows 
a method of enhancing the dissolution profile of a pharmaceutical from a solid dosage form comprising the pharmaceutical and simethicone,comprising providing the pharmaceutical in a first portion of said dosage form,said pharmaceutical is selected from the group consisting of diphenoxylate,loperamide and,pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof,and combinations thereof providing the simethicone in a second portion of said dosage form and separating said first and second portions with a pharmaceutically acceptable polymeric barrier which is impermeable to simethicone and the pharmaceutical.
the method of claim wherein the pharmaceutical is selected from the group consisting of loperamide,pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and combinations thereof.
the method of claim wherein the pharmaceutical comprises loperamide hcl.
the asserted claims of the patent read as follows 
a solid oral dosage form for the treatment of gastrointestinal distress comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutical for the treatment of gastric disorders selected from the group consisting of diphenoxylate,loperamide,pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof,and combinations thereof and a therapeutically effective amount of simethicone wherein the oral dosage form has a first portion containing the pharmaceutical and a second portion containing simethicone and the first and second portions are separated by a pharmaceutically acceptable polymeric barrier,which is impermeable to simethicone and the pharmaceutical.
the solid oral dosage form of claim wherein the pharmaceutical comprises loperamide hcl.
following a bench trial,the district court concluded that the asserted claims of the garwin patents were obvious over three prior art references an australian pharmaceutical reference publication entitled mims annual,section antidiarrheals,which discloses a product called diareze that combines the antidiarrheal compound attapulgite with simethicone to help relieve the pain and discomfort of gaseous distention french patent application,which discloses the use of simethicone and activated charcoal,also a known antidiarrheal and patent the chavkin patent,which discloses combinations of various substances,including the antidiarrheal polycarbophil and simethicone.id.at.the court found that one of skill in the art at the time of the inventions would have known that flatulence commonly accompanies diarrhea,and concluded that it would have been obvious to replace attapulgite,activated charcoal,or polycarbophil in the prior art references with loperamide,which was,after all,the active ingredient in the antidiarrheal drug,to treat both diarrhea and gas.id.at.the court discounted the value of mcneil objective evidence,including evidence of unexpected results,commercial success,and copying by others,and held the asserted claims invalid.id.at.
the district court then concluded that the product for which perrigo was seeking fda approval would not infringe the stevens patents,because that product directly juxtaposes loperamide and simethicone layers without any impermeable polymeric barrier between them.id.at.the court held that the asserted claims of the stevens patents were,in any event,also invalid for obviousness over the garwin patent applications,which taught making tablets having separate loperamide and simethicone layers,in view of the prior art patent the rider patent,which taught the use of an impermeable polymeric barrier to prevent migration and deactivation of simethicone in antacid tablets.id.at.
finally,the district court awarded attorney fees to perrigo,stating that mcneil conduct during prosecution of the patents in suit was careless,irresponsible,and,at the very least,tantamount to studied and deceptive ignorance.id.at.according to the court,mcneil repeated erroneous representations,failure to disclose relevant prior art,and overall persistence in prosecuting exceedingly obvious inventions make this case exceptional.id.the court accused mcneil of having engaged in a scheme for extending the life of a drug about to go off patent without the slightest regard for the intent and purposes of the patent laws,and found that mcneil sole motive was to compromise those statutes and constitutional protections for the sake of profits.id.
the district court concluded its opinion with a discussion of the constitutional basis for the patent system and what it perceived to be a deviation from the original purposes of that system by decisions.according to the court 
the patent laws promote the progress of science and useful arts by rewarding innovation with a temporary right to exclusivity,art.i,cl.long ago,in hotchkiss greenwood,how,the supreme court established that the sine qua non of patentability is invention,and as stated in a,the legal definition of invention is synonymous with discovery over time,patent law has developed its own,new language,and has even come to require special qualifications for lawyers appearing before the pto.these developments tend to obscure the fundamental notions of invention and discovery.
acting within this often esoteric area of the law,patent lawyers are called upon to play the roles of chemists,engineers,physicians,and,they are also asked to be magicians.that is,patent lawyers are asked to smoke and incantations when decisions having nothing to do with inventing or discovering anything.consistent with schemes to prolong the legally protected period of exclusivity,companies hire highly talented attorneys to perform acts of legal legerdemain in order to make modest developments look and feel like inventions,when in reality the purported discovery is nothing more than a creation of an advertising and marketing department.counsel should be cautioned that complicity in patent prosecution for unsanctioned legal purposes may give rise in the future to review of that behavior by the appropriate attorney disciplinary machinery.advancing a client economic interests is not a license to forget one ethical responsibilities.
it is not lost on this court that by developing not inventing a combination drug,the law automatically permitted mcneil a period of exclusivity however,by concocting multiple patent applications and litigating their validity,this period of exclusivity has been extended by two years and,with an appeal,will extend even further,effectively doubling the initial period of exclusivity.the decision that it is worth the investment to invent an invention will continue unabated unless a vigorous pto or a court sees this transparent attempt to subvert the patent laws for what it is.the patent laws are not the private sandbox of pharmaceutical companies.regrettably,i am constrained by law to award only counsel fees for plaintiff behavior,although i am not unmindful of the fact that while this patent litigation continues,competition in the marketplace is foreclosed and the public is forced to pay higher prices.
mcneil now appeals.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
mcneil appeals the district court holding that the asserted claims of the garwin and stevens patents are invalid for obviousness.mcneil also appeals the court award of attorney fees to perrigo.
obviousness 
obviousness is a legal conclusion based on the factual inquiries set forth in graham john deere,d the scope and content of the prior art the differences between the claims and the prior art the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art and secondary considerations,if any,of nonobviousness.id.at.when reviewing a district court decision,we review a district court underlying findings of fact for clear error,while we rule de novo on the ultimate issue of obviousness.smiths indus.med,vital signs.
on appeal,mcneil argues that the district court erred by holding the asserted claims of the garwin patents invalid for obviousness.in particular,mcneil contends that the prior art failed to provide any disclosure of or motivation to make the claimed combination.according to mcneil,the court committed several legal errors in its obviousness analysis.first,mcneil alleges,the court defined the problem to be solved in terms of its solution.according to mcneil,the problem was not how to make a combination that treats diarrhea and gas,but how to treat diarrhea and gas.second,mcneil argues,the court employed an improper obviousness of substitution approach,and judged the invention on the subjective motives of the inventor and his employer,rather than on its merits.third,with respect to the references cited by the district court,mcneil argues that the mims reference and the french patent were both before the pto during prosecution of the garwin patent application and that the chavkin patent,the only prior art cited by the court that was not before the pto,merely describes liquid carriers for administration of compositions.although the chavkin patent mentions both polycarbophil termed a agent in the reference and simethicone,mcneil contends that it does not suggest using both in a single composition.according to mcneil,the court conclusion that it would have been obvious to combine loperamide with simethicone because diarrhea is often accompanied by flatulence totally disregards evidence that simethicone was not generally believed to be an antiflatulent and flatulence and diarrhea were never separately treated before the invention because loperamide itself relieves flatulence by treating the underlying diarrhea.mcneil argues that the court finding that simethicone was a known antiflatulent is clearly erroneous,because simethicone was known to be an antigas agent only because it stimulates burping and belching,and thereby helps relieve stomach,gastric,gas.however,flatulence is caused by intestinal gas,mcneil contends,and stimulating the passing of that gas would exacerbate flatulence.lastly,mcneil asserts that the court also failed to give proper weight to undisputed objective evidence of nonobviousness,including unexpected results and copying,discounting that evidence without any good reason.
perrigo responds that the district court decision is supported by clear and convincing evidence of obviousness.moreover,according to perrigo,mcneil does not challenge as clearly erroneous any of the court factual findings other than those relating to secondary considerations,but instead attempts to propose on appeal numerous new findings of fact that either are not supported by the record or else are plainly contrary to the court findings.perrigo also points out that stephen collins,the irritable bowel syndrome,can.med.ass,an article referenced in garwin laboratory notebook but not cited to the pto,teaches treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with both loperamide and simethicone.
we agree with perrigo that the district court decision was supported by clear and convincing evidence.the court found,in particular,that the concurrence of diarrhea and flatulence had b
