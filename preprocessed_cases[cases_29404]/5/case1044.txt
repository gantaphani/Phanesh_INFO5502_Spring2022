the filing of a bankruptcy petition immediately gives rise to an automatic stay.the stay applies to block or freeze most judicial actions against a debtor.it also permits a debtor to recoup any actual damages,including attorney fees,that result from a willful stay violation.see.this case presents questions both as to when a willful stay violation occurs and as to what attorney fees may be recovered as actual damages.
we affirm the holding of the district court that appellant melvin sternberg willfully violated the automatic stay that arose once appellee logan johnston filed for bankruptcy.our cases establish that sternberg had an affirmative duty to comply with the stay.this duty included ensuring that his actions did not prolong a violation of the stay that resulted from a state court motion seeking relief against johnston that sternberg filed prior to the bankruptcy.in this case,sternberg willfully violated the automatic stay by defending an overbroad state court order in its entirety.
we also hold,however,that johnston can recover as actual damages only those attorney fees related to enforcing the automatic stay and remedying the stay violation,not the fees incurred in prosecuting the bankruptcy adversary proceeding in which he pursued his claim for those damages.we thus vacate the amount of the award entered by the district court and remand for determination of the appropriate amount.
background 
logan johnston and paula parker were divorced in.as part of the property settlement,johnston was ordered to pay spousal maintenance.
in january,parker,through her attorney,melvin sternberg,asked the state court to hold johnston in contempt for of spousal support.among other things,the request asked the court to award judgment for all sums of spousal maintenance enter an order that johnston be incarcerated that his professional law license be suspended and his drivers license be revoked until he immediately pay s all sums and place a lien upon any vehicle or other property owned.
on may of that year,johnston filed a chapter bankruptcy petition.his bankruptcy counsel did not file notice of this petition in the state court proceeding until may,however.
on that same day,may,the state court conducted what appears to have been a previously scheduled evidentiary hearing on parker contempt request.johnston,who is an attorney,represented himself.approximately minutes into the hearing,he advised the court for the first time of his bankruptcy proceedings,explaining that the proceedings would result in a plan to pay his debts,including the spousal support,and that his bankruptcy counsel had informed him that the filing of the bankruptcy petition stayed anything regarding the property settlement,attorney fees,and sanctions.he apologized for not knowing exactly what going on and said,i guess,i object in the abstract to anything that would contravene the bankruptcy laws,while agreeing that the state court could establish the amount of his arrears.
sternberg,for his part,explained that he did not know if the bankruptcy filing stayed the proceedings but stated that he did not think moving forward on the arrears,attorney fees,and contempt determination would violate the stay.the court decided to proceed on the issue of whether johnston was in contempt.it would take up the issue of sanctions at a later time when counsel ha d researched whether or not the court has jurisdiction to issue sanctions when a bankruptcy proceeding is pending.
on july,the state court filed a minute order holding johnston in violation of the divorce decree.the court found johnston in contempt and granted judgment for parker in the amount of,including interest.in addition,it ordered johnston to pay the judgment by august,or be jailed until the full amount is paid.
the parties were surprised by the order.specifically,the bankruptcy court found that sternberg and parker had expected further proceedings before the judge would order johnston to pay a sum certain or face any consequences.
johnston quickly sought to obtain relief from the order.he filed a motion for stay in the state court,but the hearing date on that motion was set for the day after the august deadline by which he was to pay the arrears or go to jail.additionally,he wrote a letter to sternberg informing him that he was in violation of the automatic stay and asking sternberg to take appropriate remedial measures to cure his violation.sternberg did not take such action.
johnston then filed a petition in the arizona court of appeals,requesting the appellate court to stay and vacate the order.representing parker,sternberg law firm filed a responsive brief,which was signed by another lawyer on sternberg behalf.the brief took the position that the state court had proceeded within two exemptions to the automatic stay.those exemptions allow for the establishment or modification of an order for domestic support obligations and the collection of a domestic support obligation from property that is not property of the estate.b a b.the brief concluded by arguing that the judge properly exercised her broad discretion and legal authority to continue with the evidentiary hearing,to hold petitioner in contempt,and to deny his motion for relief.
in the meantime,johnston also sought relief from the bankruptcy court,where he filed another emergency motion to set aside the minute order,and also an adversary proceeding charging parker and sternberg with willfully violating the automatic stay.on july,the bankruptcy court conducted a hearing on the emergency motion.it concluded that the automatic stay had been violated and vacated the state court minute order.in a later order,the bankruptcy court summarized its decision as follows 
if the state court had qualified its order to reflect only the amount of the arrearages,or if the state court had been advised of what constituted property,so that the minute entry order could be tailored only to the collection of the arrearages from such property,then the state court arguably would have been acting within an exception to the automatic stay.however,the minute entry dictated that the debtor immediately satisfy a large judgment or face incarceration all without the state court focusing on the property or requesting the bankruptcy court prior determination of whether the automatic stay applied

some time later,the adversary proceeding went to trial.after johnston presented his case,parker and sternberg moved for a directed verdict.id.at.the bankruptcy court granted the motion.id.at.while the court reaffirmed its earlier conclusion that the state court order had violated the automatic stay,it wrote that it did not see any separate violation of the stay by defendants parker and sternberg.id.at.furthermore,the court noted that while eskanos adler,leetien,cir,a precedent imposing an affirmative duty on parties to dismiss or stay actions that violate the stay,id.at,could be interpreted as chang ing this result,the court believed that case should be limited to postpetition collection actions commenced or maintained by a creditor or its law firm and not a claim for support arrearages.johnston i,at.
on appeal,the district court reversed,holding eskanos to be controlling.johnston parker in re johnston,johnston ii.more specifically,the court held,under eskanos,that sternberg and parker had an obligation to remedy the violation of the stay created by the state court order and found no grounds by which to distinguish eskanos.id.at.it remanded the case to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings.id.at.
the remanded issues were then tried to the bankruptcy court.before the court issued a ruling,johnston settled with parker,leaving only sternberg as a defendant.
the bankruptcy court filed its decision in march.the court explained that the district court opinion had narrowed the issues because it had concluded that sternberg willfully violated the automatic stay.after hearing johnston testimony and reviewing his monthly interim reports,the court concluded that johnston had been injured in the amount of because the stay violation had hindered his ability to work.the court also found johnston testimony of emotional distress to be credible and awarded further damages in the amount of.lastly,the court conducted a review of johnston attorney fees and costs,and awarded,which included fees for prosecuting the adversary proceeding.the total judgment amounted to plus interest at a rate of per annum.
an appeal followed,and the district court affirmed.sternberg then appealed to our court.
ii.discussion 
this opinion addresses two issues whether sternberg violated the automatic stay and whether the bankruptcy court erred in its calculation of johnston damages each issue is addressed in turn 
a.the automatic stay 
whether the automatic stay has been violated is an issue we review de novo.eskanos,at.whether a party has willfully violated the automatic stay is a question of fact reviewed for clear error.id.
when a debtor files for bankruptcy,he is immediately protected by an automatic stay under a,which provides that a bankruptcy petition,among other things,
operates as a stay,applicable to all entities,of the commencement or continuation of a judicial,administrative,or other action or proceeding against the debtor the enforcement of a judgment any act to obtain possession of property of the estate and any act to create,perfect,or enforce any lien 
it does not,however,prevent the commencement or continuation of a civil action for the establishment or modification of an order for domestic support obligations or the collection of a domestic support obligation from property that is not property of the estate.b a b.nevertheless,t he scope of protections embodied in the automatic stay is quite broad,and serves as one of the most important protections in bankruptcy law.eskanos,at see stringer huet in re stringer,cir congress clearly intended the automatic stay to be quite broad.exemptions to the stay,on the other hand,should be read narrowly.
we have held on several occasions that the automatic stay imposes on parties an affirmative duty of compliance.in state of california employment development department taxel in re del mission,for example,we held that a state knowing retention of disputed taxes violated the automatic stay,cir.we explained that the onus to return estate property is placed upon the possessor it does not fall on the debtor to pursue the possessor.id.at.similarly,in knupfer lindblade in re dyer,we held that the petition recordation of a deed of trust by a creditor was a willful violation of the automatic stay because the creditor had an affirmative duty to remedy his automatic stay violation such as by attempting to undo the recordation process,cir.
the district court in this case found the rationale of our decision in eskanos controlling.in that case,a law firm had been hired by one of a debtor unsecured creditors to pursue a collection action against the debtor.after filing the action,the firm learned of the debtor bankruptcy but waited days to dismiss the action.eskanos.at.the bankruptcy court found that this inaction violated the automatic stay,and the district court agreed.id.at.on appeal,we explained that the plain language of a unambiguously imposed an affirmative duty on the firm to discontinue the action once it gained knowledge of the bankruptcy.id.at.maintenance of an active collection action in state court does nothing if not carry forward or persist against a debtor s tate filings exist as more than risk of default judgment looms over the debtor throughout.id.at.since the law firm allowed the collection action to persist even after learning of the debtor bankruptcy,we affirmed.id.at.
the above authorities establish that sternberg had an affirmative duty to conform his conduct to the automatic stay once johnston filed for bankruptcy.the district court found that sternberg violated this duty because he w as required to take affirmative action to stay or vacate the state court order and failed to do so.johnston ii,at.
we do not fault sternberg for anything he did at the may state court hearing,because the news of johnston bankruptcy filing came as a surprise to him.the state court july order also surprised him,and sternberg can not be held responsible for the order.within a reasonable time after that,however,the law required sternberg to take corrective action.he did not,and he affirmatively opposed johnston effort to obtain relief from the state appellate court.
as described above,shortly after the overbroad state court order was filed,johnston brought a petition for special action requesting the state appellate court to stay and vacate the order.in response,sternberg offered a complete defense of the order.the conclusion of the brief filed by sternberg law firm on behalf of parker illustrates the breadth of this defense.the brief concludes by arguing that the state court judge properly exercised her broad discretion and legal authority to continue with the evidentiary hearing,hold johnston in contempt,and deny his motion for relief.sternberg defense of the order was absolute.he did not try to parse the valid from the invalid,but instead defended the order in its entirety,including the command that johnston pay the arrears or go to jail,and without limiting the source of payment to property.
sternberg argues that he was compelled to do this because the order was not completely invalid and johnston had requested that it be vacated in its entirety.this misses the point.what sternberg was compelled to do was comply with the automatic stay.see,eskanos,at.the state court order was in violation of the stay because,as the courts below concluded,it ordered johnston to pay arrears or go to jail without focusing on johnston property.see johnston ii,at johnston i,at,see also.sternberg recognized this but did not say anything to the appellate court because he did not think it was his duty to practice law on johnston behalf.that did not,however,authorize him to act in violation of the automatic stay.
to comply with his affirmative duty under the automatic stay,sternberg needed to do what he could to relieve the violation.he could not simply rely on the normal adversarial process.see johnston envtl.knight in re goodman,cir holding that parties who attempted to exempt a debtor from their unlawful detainer action with a unilateral stipulation still violated the automatic stay because the stipulation might not have accomplish ed its intended purpose and thus the parties could have,and should have,pursued the orthodox remedy relief from the automatic stay.at a minimum,he had an obligation to alert the state appellate court to the conflicts between the order and the automatic stay.as we have explained before,t he automatic stay is intended to give the debtor a breathing spell from his creditors.goichman bloom in re bloom,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the state court order intruded upon johnston breathing spell.sternberg did not act to try to fix that problem.
sternberg also argues a variety of facts that implicitly challenge the willfulness of his violation.the thrust of his argument is that because johnston never specifically requested that sternberg seek to modify the order,and because sternberg never sought to collect on the order,sternberg did not willfully violate the stay.sternberg also appears to argue that because he believed that he was always proceeding within the domestic support exemptions,he could not have committed a willful violation.
johnston was not required to ask sternberg to modify the order for sternberg violation to be willful.see in re del mission,at concluding that the retention of taxes was a violation of the stay even though the debtor never requested their return.likewise,sternberg needed neither to make some collection effort nor to know that his actions were unlawful for his violation to be willful.see eskanos,at rejecting the law firm assertion that something more than maintaining an active collection action was needed to violate the stay in re goodman,at whether the defendant believes in good faith that it had a right to the property is not relevant to whether the act was willful internal quotation marks omitted.all that is required is that sternberg knew of the automatic stay,and
