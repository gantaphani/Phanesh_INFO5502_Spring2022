factual and procedural background 
wife death and husband claim for benefits under her life insurance policy 
frank and rosamaria rees married in in may they each obtained from farmers new world life insurance company farmers a life insurance policy with benefits of.rosamaria policy insured her life,and frank policy insured his life.they named the other as the sole primary beneficiary and listed no contingent beneficiaries.according to the terms of rosamaria policy,if frank predeceased rosamaria,the benefits were to be paid to rosamaria or to her estate.
on september,rosamaria,on her way to pick up frank from a gamblers anonymous meeting,was shot and killed in the street outside the home she shared with frank.she died intestate,without a will and without having borne any children.she was predeceased by her father but survived by her mother.farmers insurance agent informed the company of rosamaria death on september.a claims officer contacted frank,who indicated that the los angeles police department lapd was investigating rosamaria death as a homicide.farmers sent frank a claim form for the policy benefits.
on october,a special investigation unit manager manager for farmers spoke with an lapd detective regarding rosamaria death.according to the manager notes,the detective reported that no one has been ruled out in this death.he said that frank is a big gambler and has a couple million dollars in life insurance on his wife.about two weeks later,on october,frank submitted a claim to farmers for the in life insurance benefits.farmers responded by letter to frank the next day,during our claims evaluation we have contacted the lapd division and have been informed that their investigation is ongoing and that no one has been ruled out as a suspect in the homicide of our insured rosamaria at this time.therefore,we will await the results of the police investigation before discharging our obligation in this case.about a month later,and then again the following month,farmers sent frank letters repeating essentially the same information.on january,frank called the manager,who informed him that the police were still conducting their investigation and no one had been ruled out as a suspect.the manager said that he would call the detective and contact frank if there were any changes in farmers handling.
the manager spoke with another lapd detective on january.the manager notes stated that the police had not completed their investigation and said do not pay the claim.on january,the manager spoke with the initial detective and noted that the police had not ruled out frank as a suspect and the investigation is ongoing.farmers again sent a letter to frank informing him that the investigation was ongoing and it would await the results before discharging its obligation.on january,the manager left a message for frank,in response to a call from him,indicating that farmers is awaiting the police investigation final report and that no one has been ruled out as a suspect.the manager could not give him a time line.
for the next four months,february,march,april and may,the manager sent letters to frank informing him that,according to the lapd,the investigation of rosamaria death still is ongoing and no one has been ruled out as a suspect in her homicide and that it would await the results of the investigation before discharging its obligation on may,frank called the manager asking for the status of the claim.the manager told frank he would contact lapd.according to the manager notes,the initial detective said that frank is still considered a prime suspect in the death of his wife.on june,farmers sent frank a letter,again informing him that the investigation of rosamaria death still is ongoing,that no one has been ruled out as a suspect in her homicide and that it would await the results of the investigation before discharging its obligation.
frank retained counsel,who sent farmers a letter on july.counsel requested various documents from farmers and asked for confirmation that frank claim was complete and that it had received all the supporting documents needed to process his claim counsel also requested confirmation that the only reason the benefits have not been paid to frank is due to the possibility that he may have been involved in the killing of his wife.we would appreciate knowing whether anyone has accused frank of having been involved in any way in the killing of his wife and,if so,who has made the accusation.we would also appreciate knowing whether anyone other than frank has made a claim to the benefits of rosamaria life insurance policy.finally,we would appreciate knowing whether your company or someone acting on behalf of your company has undertaken its own investigation regarding rosamaria demise or whether it is relying solely on the investigation by the lapd based on the receipt of this letter,and the fact that the manager was informed that frank was still considered a prime suspect in the murder of rosamaria,the manager referred this matter to farmers legal department and,subsequently,a decision was made to interplead the life insurance proceeds.
the interpleader action and award of attorney fees and costs 
on august,farmers filed a complaint in interpleader identifying frank claim for the policy benefits and alleging that,based on lapd investigation of frank as a suspect in the homicide of rosamaria,a s there is no other primary or contingent beneficiary,should frank be convicted of murdering rosamaria,the life insurance benefits would go to her estate.farmers named frank as a defendant and alleged,o n information and belief,that no probate action has been filed,and no administrator named,in connection with the death of rosamaria if an administrator has been named,farmers will amend the complaint to name the administrator of rosamaria s estate as a defendant.if no administrator has been named,farmers will request that the court assign a representative to protect the estate potential claim.
farmers alleged that,b ecause lapd has not ruled out frank as a suspect,farmers has been unable to determine the appropriate payee for the death benefit proceeds.the claim made by frank and the potential claim of ros a maria estate are adverse should frank be accused of ros a maria murder.farmers is unable to safely determine which,if any,of the claims is valid.farmers is indifferent with respect to whether it should pay the death benefits to frank or the estate of ros a maria farmers claims no interest in the proceeds and is a disinterested stakeholder.farmers alleged that it would deposit,the amount of the policy benefit plus interest,with the court and that it had incurred attorney fees and costs as a result of the proceeding.farmers prayed for a judgment ordering frank to interplead and litigate his claim to the death benefits proceeds,appointment of an estate administrator if necessary,a discharge of its liability and an award from the death benefit proceeds deposited with the c ourt its costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred in this action 
on october,frank answered the complaint,asserting no affirmative defenses.he also,on october,filed a first amended,asserting a cause of action for declaratory relief against farmers and rosamaria mother,as the person who would receive the policy benefits through rosamaria estate if he were found to have feloniously and intentionally killed rosamaria.frank asked for a judicial determination that he was entitled to the in benefits on rosamaria policy.frank also asserted causes of action against farmers for breach of contract and bad faith based on its failure to pay him the policy benefits despite his filing a claim for them.
on november,farmers answered the first amended,and then,on january,filed a first amended complaint in interpleader in which it added rosamaria mother as a defendant.according to farmers,because rosamaria died without a will and had no living children,her mother,by virtue of her estate,had a claim to the life insurance proceeds if frank were not entitled to receive them.
rosamaria mother did not answer or otherwise respond to the first amended complaint in interpleader.the clerk entered a default against her on march.in the entry of default farmers represented that it would seek attorney fees and costs from the funds deposited with the court.on september,frank moved for an order releasing the noncontested portion of the interpleaded funds to him,the,plus interest,in policy benefits less the in attorney fees and costs requested by farmers.according to frank,because rosamaria mother had defaulted in the action,he was the only interested stakeholder and,therefore,entitled to the funds.soon after the filing of the motion,on september,the trial court entered a default judgment against rosamaria mother.in that judgment,the court ordered that frank was entitled to the benefits on rosamaria policy.on november,farmers filed an opposition to frank motion for release of the interpleaded funds.farmers maintained that the funds should be held until frank dismissed his first amended for breach of contract and bad faith.the court,on november,granted frank motion and ordered the clerk to pay frank the interpleaded funds,plus any accrued interest,less the requested by farmers in attorney fees and costs.frank received a check from the court payable to him in the amount of.
on december,farmers moved for an order discharging and dismissing it from the interpleaded portion of the action and awarding it costs and attorney fees of.frank opposed the motion,arguing that farmers was not entitled to attorney fees and costs or a discharge of liability because it was never faced with a potential viable claim that could give rise to liability and the equities did not favor such an award.frank submitted the declaration of an insurance industry expert,who opined that farmers did not act reasonably and within the standards of the insurance industry in the handling of frank claim in its investigation and payment of benefits on january,the trial court issued an order discharging farmers from the interpleader action.according to the court,the policy would have been payable to rosamaria mother if frank had been found to have murdered rosamaria,code of civil procedure s ection,subdivision b,only requires a potential for different claims to an insurance policy for the interpleader to be permissible,and farmers had information that frank was the prime suspect in the murder of his wife,the insured.this seems to be a situation that is appropriate for judicial interpleader.the court awarded farmers attorney fees of plus in costs and directed the clerk to pay farmers that amount,which was the balance of the interpleaded funds.
on march,the court entered judgment,discharging farmers liability regarding the death benefits on rosamaria policy and awarding it in attorney fees and costs.frank dismissed his first amended without prejudice and filed a notice of appeal from the judgment.
discussion 
the purpose of interpleader and the statutory allowance for an award of attorney fees and costs to the interpleading party 
any person,firm,corporation,association or other entity against whom double or multiple claims are made,or may be made,by two or more persons which are such that they may give rise to double or multiple liability,may bring an action against the claimants to compel them to interplead and litigate their several claims.code civ,subd.b.the purpose of interpleader is to prevent a multiplicity of suits and double vexation.citation.the right to the remedy by interpleader is founded,however,not on the consideration that a person may be subjected to double liability,but on the fact that he is threatened with double vexation in respect to one liability.citation.citation.shopoff cavallo llp hyon th,d.an interpleader action,however,may not be maintained upon the mere pretext or suspicion of double vexation the plaintiff must allege facts showing a reasonable probability of double vexation citation,or a valid threat of double vexation.citation.westamerica bank city of berkeley th,d.
in an interpleader action,the court initially determines the right of the plaintiff to interplead the funds if that right is sustained,an interlocutory decree is entered which requires the defendants to interplead and litigate their claims to the funds.citation.then,in the second phase of an interpleader proceeding,the trial court also has the power under code of civil procedure section to adjudicate the issues raised by the interpleader action including the alleged existence of conflicting claims regarding the interpleaded funds plaintiffs alleged position as a disinterested mere stakeholder and ultimately the disposition of the interpleaded funds after deducting plaintiffs attorney fees.citation.shopoff cavallo llp hyon,supra,th at,d see also dial fesbinder th,d interpleader proceeding is traditionally viewed as two lawsuits in one.the first dispute is between the stakeholder and the claimants to determine the right to interplead the funds.the second dispute to be resolved is who is to receive the interpleaded funds.
regarding attorney fees and costs,a party to an action who follows the procedure for interpleader set forth in code of civil procedure s ection may insert in his motion,petition,complaint,or cross complaint a request for allowance of his costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred in such action.in ordering the discharge of such party,the court may,in its discretion,award such party his costs and reasonable attorney fees from the amount in dispute which has been deposited with the court.at the time of final judgment in the action the court may make such further provision for assumption of such costs and attorney fees by one or more of the adverse claimants as may appear proper.code civ,subd.a.
the award of attorney fees and costs in this interpleader action was proper 
a.the funds deposited with the court were in dispute 
frank contends that the attorney fees and costs award was improper because the funds farmers deposited with the court were never in dispute as required by statute.see code civ,subd.a court has discretion to award costs and reasonable attorney fees from amount in dispute deposited with the court.according to frank,b ecause no one other than himself,the subject policy named beneficiary,claimed the funds,they were never in dispute as that term is used in code of civil procedure section.we disagree.
the first amended complaint in interpleader defined the dispute over the policy benefits.on the one hand,frank filed a claim to obtain the benefits as the sole beneficiary on the policy.on the other hand,frank was a suspect,at one point a prime suspect in the death of his wife,and lapd had an ongoing investigation into rosamaria death.if frank were found to have feloniously and intentionally killed rosamaria,he would not have been entitled to the policy benefits,and they would have been payable to rosamaria mother through her estate.see probate code,named beneficiary of a bond,life insurance policy,or other contractual arrangement who feloniously and intentionally kills the principal obligee or the person upon whose life the policy is issued is not entitled to any benefit under the bond,policy,or other contractual arrangement,and it becomes payable as though the killer had predeceased the decedent.because of the ongoing investigation,farmers recognized a dispute over how it should handle payment of the policy benefits.it thus initiated the interpleader proceeding that rosamaria mother defaulted in the action,and the trial court determined frank was entitled to the funds,does not mean the funds were not in dispute.indeed,whether frank killed rosamaria could have been litigated in the interpleader proceeding.see shopoff cavallo llp hyon,supra,th at,d court in interpleader proceeding determines alleged existence of conflicting claims regarding the interpleaded funds and ultimately the disposition of the interpleaded funds see also probate code,determination that beneficiary feloniously and intentionally killed insured may be based on final judgment of conviction of felonious and intentional killing or court determination by preponderance of evidence whether the killing was felonious and intentional.the interpleaded funds thus were in dispute for purposes of an attorney fees and costs award under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a.
b.the argument against the attorney fees and costs award based on a theory of immunization from double liability fails 
frank next contends that,based on insurance code section,farmers would have been immunized from double liability if it had paid him the policy benefits while lapd continued to investigate rosamaria death and,as a result,the interpleader action was unnecessary.he essentially maintains that the trial court erred in awarding attorney fees and costs under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,because farmers did not have grounds for an interpleader action under code of civil procedure section,subdivision b.
frank forfeited the right to contest the propriety of the interpleader action by not doing so during the initial phase of the proceeding.a defendant in interpleader has the right to put in issue the question as to whether or not the facts were such as to entitle the plaintiff to compel the defendants to interplead.it has therefore been held in effect that,if the defendants in interpleader have fully litigated their claims without objection,they will be deemed to have consented to the remedy invoked and granted,and will not later be heard to object that the plaintiff complaint did not state a cause of action for interpleader citation.conner bank of bakersfield cal.as a result,when a defendant does not raise the issue of the right of the plaintiff to use the remedy of interpleader while litigating th e matter before the trial court,the question may not be raised on appeal.zimmerman d.
here,frank did not question farmers use of the remedy of interpleader,but rather litigated the matter in the trial court.as noted,the court initially determines the right of the plaintiff to interplead the funds.shopoff cavallo llp hyon,supra,th at,d.frank did not contest farmers decision to interplead the funds.rather,he answered the original complaint,without asserting any affirmative defenses,and stipulated to the filing of the first amended complaint adding rosamaria mother as a defendant.he did not answer or otherwise respond to the first amended complaint,simply requesting that the court release the interpleaded funds to him once rosamaria mother had defaulted in the action.frank,therefore,can not challenge the award of attorney fees and costs on the ground that farmers was not entitled to bring an interpleader action.
frank argues that he did not forfeit an objection to the interpleader action.he cites wells fargo bank,zinnel th,d for support.in that case,the appellate court held that the trial court properly had granted the bank motion to discharge its liability in an interpleader action but reversed an award of attorney fees and costs on the ground that the bank did not satisfy the statutory interpleader requirement in code of civil procedure section to deposit the amount of funds in dispute with the court.id.at,d.the appellate court,however,did not address the question whether the bank had been entitled to maintain an interpleader action the issue that frank forfeited here.see id.at,d declining to address defendant argument that the bank had no right to interplead because she was entitled to the funds.nor does it appear that the bank raised an issue of forfeiture.the question of forfeiture,therefore,was not before the appellate court,which simply decided that the bank did not have a right to attorney fees and costs because it had failed to fulfill one of the statutory requirements for such an award.the case thus does not support frank argument against forfeiture.
in any case,even on its merit,frank argument against interpleader based on a theory of immunization from double liability is not persuasive.frank relies on insurance code section,which provides,notwithstanding s ections and of the family code and s ection of the probate code,when the proceeds of,or payments under,a life insurance policy become payable and the insurer makes payment thereof in accordance with the terms of the policy,or in accordance with the terms of any written assignment thereof if the policy has been assigned,that payment shall fully discharge the insurer from all claims under the policy unless,before that payment is made,the insurer has received,at its home office,written notice by or on behalf of some other person that the other person claims to be entitled to that payment or some interest in the policy.according to frank,this statute means that,if farmers had paid him the policy benefits as the sole beneficiary on rosamaria policy and he subsequently were determined to have feloniously and intentionally killed rosamaria,farmers would have been immune from double liability to rosamaria estate because it had not received written notice of another claimant.we disagree that the statute rendered the interpleader action unnecessary.
insurance code section applies when the proceeds of a life insurance policy become payable and the insurer makes payment thereof in accordance with the terms of the policy.given that,at the time farmers initiated the interpleader action,frank was a suspect in his wife homicide,and thus might not have been entitled to the policy benefits based on probate code section,the proceeds of rosamaria policy had not necessarily,as frank suggests,become payable.the interpleader action was an authorized method to determine to whom the proceeds were payable.moreover,if frank were found to have feloniously and intentionally killed rosamaria,probate code section,combined with the policy language,would have required that farmers pay the benefits to rosamaria estate.the interpleader action enabled farmers to make a payment in accordance with the terms of the policy.ibid.in any case,insurance code section,which refers to family code sections and and probate code section,all addressing interests in and disposition of community property,appears to relate to community property claims on life insurance policy proceeds.leonard occidental life ins.d.insurer immunized from double liability when it paid policy benefits to beneficiary before deceased insured wife made community property claim to proceeds.farmers interpleader action,therefore,was not unnecessary based on a purported immunization from double liability under insurance code section.
the more relevant statute appears to be probate code section,part of the probate code addressing the e ffect of homicide on the l iability of an insurance company.probate code section provides,an insurance company,financial institution,or other obligor making payment according to the terms of its policy or obligation is not liable by reason of this part,unless prior to payment it has received at its home office or principal address written notice of a claim under this part.the language of this statute also did not render the interpleader action unnecessary based on a purported immunization from double liability.probate code section requires the insurer to make payment according to the terms of its policy or obligation.although rosamaria listed frank as t
