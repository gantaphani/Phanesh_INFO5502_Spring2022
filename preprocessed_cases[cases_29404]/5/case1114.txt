vicki welch appeals the district court order awarding her attorney fees under g.she disputes the district court decisions to award fees at an hourly rate of,to apply reductions in the number of hours requested because welch attorneys block billed and billed in increments and to disallow time incurred for discrete tasks such as attorney conferences.we affirm the district court fee award in most respects but reverse in part,holding that the district court erred in setting welch counsel hourly rate at and in imposing a percent reduction for block billing.we remand for a new determination of the court fee award.
factual and procedural background 
welch sued metropolitan life insurance company metlife under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,alleging that metlife improperly denied her benefits under a disability plan.see.six months after welch filed suit,metlife agreed to honor welch claim.thereafter,welch moved for an award of costs and attorney fees pursuant to g,requesting in fees for hours of work at per hour and hours of work at per hour for work after january.
in support of her motion,welch submitted declarations from four experienced erisa attorneys who attested that they charge clients between and per hour.in one declaration,attorney ronald dean said that his hourly rate is not contingent upon the result.in addition,welch submitted four district court orders granting fees to lawyers from kantor kantor law firm representing rates of to per hour.
metlife opposed welch motion for attorney fees,arguing that the requested fees were unreasonable.although asserting that welch requested hourly rates were unreasonable,metlife submitted four complaints that kantor kantor had recently filed in the central district of california in which the firm had requested fees on behalf of its client at the rate of per hour metlife presented no other evidence regarding the prevailing market rate for erisa plaintiffs lawyers.
the district court awarded fees to welch,but reduced the requested hourly rate to.the court also imposed a percent reduction in the number of hours requested because kantor kantor had block billed its time,and a percent reduction because kantor kantor billed in increments finally,the court reduced the hours requested for time spent in meetings between firm lawyers,conducting discovery,preparing a case analysis memo and preparing the motion for attorney fees.in sum,the district court awarded fees for hours of work rather than the hours requested.the court reductions resulted in a final award of in attorney fees to welch.

discussion 
to calculate attorney fees awarded under g,district courts utilize a hybrid approach.first,the court establishes a lodestar by multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation by a reasonable hourly rate.see van gerwen,at.the party seeking fees bears the burden of documenting the hours expended in the litigation and must submit evidence supporting those hours and the rates claimed.see hensley eckerhart,d.in determining the appropriate lodestar amount,the district court may exclude from the fee request any hours that are excessive,redundant,or otherwise unnecessary.id.at.in addition to setting the number of hours,the court must also determine a reasonable hourly rate,considering the experience,skill,and reputation of the attorney requesting fees.chalmers city of los angeles,cir.second,in rare and exceptional cases,the district court may adjust the lodestar upward or downward using a multiplier based on facts not subsumed in the initial lodestar calculation.see van gerwen,at.
recognizing that the district court has the benefit of contact with the litigation and the lawyers involved,we review a district court award of fees deferentially.see hensley,at.according deference to district court in view of the district court superior understanding of the litigation and the desirability of avoiding frequent appellate review of what essentially are factual matters.
reasonable hourly rate 
the district court denied welch fee request for reimbursement at the rates of and per hour,instead finding to be a reasonable rate.this reduced rate was based on the district court finding that t here is no evidence that plaintiff counsel ever collects or per hour from paying clients except as part of an award of attorneys fees issued by a court the court belief that kantor kantor hourly rates have been inflated to include a contingency multiplier and the court consideration of the relevant market rates in the community for this type of matter.we conclude that the district court clearly erred.
first,the district court erred in reducing welch requested rate because kantor kantor does not collect and from its paying clients.we have repeatedly held that the determination of a reasonable hourly rate is not made by reference to the rates actually charged the prevailing party.see,mendenhall transp.safety,cir quoting chalmers,at.rather,billing rates should be established by reference to the fees that private attorneys of an ability and reputation comparable to that of prevailing counsel charge their paying clients for legal work of similar complexity.davis,at see also carson billings police dep t,cir holding that the prevailing market the individual contract between the applicant attorney and the client provides the standard for lodestar calculations.
second,reduction may have been improper because there was insufficient evidence that kantor kantor inflated its hourly rates above the prevailing market rate due to the contingent nature of its practice.in support of its reduction,the district court relied on a fee motion the kantor kantor firm had submitted in an unrelated case,in which the firm justified its hourly rate by stating 
a lthough the market requires defense counsel to offer competitive rates apparently below what he thinks he is truly worth,defense counsel is paid at the time or immediately following,the time his services are rendered.he further gets paid even if he loses the case.this is not so for plaintiff counsel,who,because an erisa claimant can not afford to pay by the hour,is forced to await until completion of a litigation in order to obtain a contingency fee,which may,or may not be the case is lost.
the district court correctly observed that contingency can not be used to justify a fee enhancement,see cann carpenters pension trust fund,cir,or an inflated hourly rate,see davis city and county of san francisco,cir,vacated in part on other grounds.but as we read kantor kantor motion,the firm was at least in part explaining that its hourly rate in the prior case took into account the delay in payment that results from the firm system of of whether the case is won or lost.see missouri jenkins,d although delay and the risk of nonpayment are often mentioned in the same breath,adjusting for the former is a distinct issue.quotation omitted.thus it is unclear to what extent,if any,the requested to rates included a contingency multiplier.
to the extent kantor kantor motion was addressing delay in payment,that is a factor properly considered in arriving at a reasonable hourly rate.district courts have the discretion to compensate plaintiff attorneys for a delay in payment by either applying the attorneys current rates to all hours billed during the course of the litigation or using the attorneys historical rates and adding a prime rate enhancement.see in re.pub.power supply.sec,cir.
third,although the district court appropriately considered relevant market rates,it did not explain how evidence in the record supported the hourly award of.this omission is significa
