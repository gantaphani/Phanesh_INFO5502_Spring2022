facts and proceedings below 
in the underlying action,camacho,a debtor,sued bridgeport financial,bridgeport financial,a debt collector,in a putative class action alleging violations of the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa.camacho alleged that bridgeport financial misrepresented the rights of consumers in its initial collection letter by requiring her to dispute her debt in writing.bridgeport financial filed a motion to dismiss,arguing that section a implicitly requires disputes to be made in writing.the district court denied bridgeport financial motion to dismiss,certified the issue for interlocutory appeal,and we affirmed in a published opinion.see,cir.we held that the district court correctly denied bridgeport financial motion to dismiss because there is no writing requirement implicit in section a,and that bridgeport financial violated that section insofar as it stated that disputes must be made in writing.id.at.
on remand,the litigation focused on class certification,bridgeport financial net worth,and the class remedy.after the district court approved a statewide class,consisting of more than members,the parties settled.pursuant to the parties class action settlement agreement,the court ordered bridgeport financial to pay a cy pres award of to legal services of northern california for use in consumer education or representation,and in actual and statutory damages to camacho.bridgeport financial also agreed to pay reasonable and necessary attorneys fees and costs,to be determined by the court absent an agreement by the parties.the parties did not reach an agreement and camacho filed her motion for an award of costs and attorney fees.
during the course of this litigation,three attorneys represented camacho,irving berg berg,randolph bragg bragg,and richard rubin rubin.berg and bragg represented camacho during proceedings in the district court,and camacho retained rubin to handle the interlocutory appeal.
in her motion,camacho sought to recover fees and costs totaling.this total included hours x in fees and in costs for berg hours x in fees and in costs for bragg hours x in fees for bragg law hour x for the services of bragg paralegal and hours x in fees and in costs for rubin.included in the attorneys requests were hours spent pursuing fees.berg,bragg,and rubin each provided a declaration supporting their respective requests,and camacho also filed declarations from two additional attorneys in support of her motion.bridgeport financial filed an opposition to camacho motion which included numerous exhibits and declarations from two more attorneys.
camacho also explained in her motion that her attorneys would submit a supplemental declaration detailing additional time and costs expended.bragg ultimately did so,filing a supplemental declaration wherein he sought an additional hours x in fees for his services,and hours x in fees for his law services.although bridgeport financial objected to portions of camacho three attorneys declarations,and objected to the two additional attorneys declarations and bragg supplemental declaration in their entirety,the district court never ruled on these objections and bridgeport financial never requested a ruling.
in its second amended order,the district court noted that camacho sought to recover in litigation expenses and in fees.this total reflects the amount requested in camacho initial motion,but does not account for the amount requested in bragg supplemental declaration.the court went on to explain that 
here,the court is satisfied that the number of hours spent upon this case by camacho three attorneys is reasonable.the attorneys spent their time on motions brought by bridgeport financial and defending the case against an appeal brought by bridgeport financial.while the court acknowledges that camacho three attorneys were already exceedingly on the narrow legal question presented in the case,the court nonetheless finds that the hours spent on the matter were reasonable.the court holds,however,that it would be unreasonable on the facts of this case to award the full amount requested by these attorneys.rather than awarding the full hourly rate suggested by camacho,the court finds,in rough accord with numerous other courts that have considered the issue in published and unpublished opinions,that a reasonable rate for fees for an action brought for the violation of a mandatory provision of the fdcpa is per hour.
footnote omitted.therefore,the court awarded berg hours x,bragg hours x,and rubin hours x in fees.the court also awarded berg,bragg,and rubin,their requested costs.the court then held that the fees submitted by bragg on behalf of his law and paralegal were reasonable,but did not account for these amounts in its ultimate award.to this point,the court awarded camacho in costs,and in fees.
finally,the court found that while camacho indicated an intent to seek a supplemental award of costs,expenses,and fees,a substantial award of would be inappropriate in this case.the court explained that 
here,camacho counsel regularly represent litigants in fdcpa cases,and they are therefore experienced with the law governing awards of attorneys fees and the process for recouping them.indeed,as bridgeport financial points out,the materials submitted by camacho attorneys in support of the motion for costs and attorneys fees in this case are virtually identical to the materials that these attorneys have submitted in other cases.
the court concluded that w here the attorneys seeking fees support their motion with materials that are substantially unchanged from those filed by them in numerous other cases it would be inappropriate to award fees on fees on an hourly basis,and instead,the court awarded a flat award of.in the end,the district court awarded camacho a total of in fees and costs in fees,in costs,and a flat award.camacho appealed.
