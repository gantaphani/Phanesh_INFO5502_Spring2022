this is an appeal from a judgment adjudicating a trust to be invalid on the ground of undue influence and fraud and from orders concerning attorney fees.we reverse the portions of the judgment and the orders relating to attorney fees and otherwise affirm.
factual and procedural background 
the litigation arises from a history of disputes between the daughters of zal and jane alter,both now deceased.the petitioner,susan david hereafter susan,is the older daughter the defendant,wendy alter herman hereafter wendy,is the younger.the property at issue consists primarily of the family business,the company,which owns and manages a commercial building at brannan and an apartment building at hayes and divisidero,both in san francisco.in recounting the factual background,we will rely on the trial court lengthy and detailed statement of decision.
on january,zal and jane alter created a revocable living trust,called the alter family trust,as part of an estate plan recommended by their attorney.the complex trust provisions effectively called for equal distribution of the trust assets between their daughters on their death.zal alter was the sole trustee,but he was then experiencing declining health and mental ability.sometime in,susan began to assist zal in writing checks,paying taxes,balancing accounts,and managing the company.later in,she began to sign checks with her father approval and to assume control of the trust estate.on september,zal suffered a fall and became entirely incapacitated.
the year brought changes in the lives of other members of the family.recently divorced,wendy moved from fresno to marin county where she still resides.jane separated from zal after years of marriage and began to live alone in a condominium in san francisco.while undertaking this difficult transition,jane was experiencing declining health and failing eyesight.wendy began to see her mother frequently and assisted her in the tasks of daily living.
in august,the strained relations between the two daughters experienced a serious rift.as advised earlier by his estate planning attorney,zal decided to make a series of gifts to his family in the amount of the gift tax exemption.susan wrote the checks on his behalf.zal gave to each of his daughters and to each of his four grandchildren and,in addition,gave to susan husband.the effect was a imbalance in favor of susan side of the family.wendy complained to jane and contacted her parents attorneys.she scheduled a meeting with the firm on october,a day before susan was scheduled to leave for a vacation in europe.when susan returned from the vacation,she learned from her father business partner that wendy was accusing her of dereliction in the management of the family financial affairs.
on march,jane revoked her interest in the alter family trust.the same day,she executed a will by which she disposed of her separate property and her share of the community property,including all her former trust property,which she held with her husband.she gave half the residue of her estate in equal shares to wendy and the other half to the issue of susan.the will explicitly omitted to provide directly for susan and appointed wendy as executor of her estate.
in april,wendy and jane filed a petition in san francisco superior court for an accounting and for removal of the trustee of the alter family trust and appointment of a successor trustee.the petition alleged that zal suffered from senile dementia and that the trust instrument provided that jane,susan,and wendy would serve as cotrustees in the event of his incapacity.it alleged that susan had unilaterally taken control of trust affairs,made unauthorized gifts of trust assets,improperly paid herself compensation for her duties as trustee,and failed to pay for zal necessary expenses.
concurrently with filing the petition,the parties stipulated to appointment of a trust company as the successor trustee.when the trust company declined the appointment,the parties stipulated to the appointment of an independent fiduciary,debra dolch,as successor trustee by an order filed july.the order provided for the equalization of gifts by an additional gift to wendy.
in further probate proceedings on the same petition,susan filed two accounts and reports covering the period of september,to september.by a stipulation and order filed august,the court approved the accounting as filed and all of her actions in connection with the alter family trust as reported therein,are confirmed and approved.
in an order filed january,the court approved the first account and report as amended of the successor trustee,debra dolch,and directed her to petition for the establishment of a conservatorship for zal and to seek instructions as to the transmutation of zal and jane shares in the alter family trust into their separate property.dolch petitioned for instructions as directed and the matter came up for a hearing on april,in which zal,jane,and the trustee were separately represented by counsel.with the agreement of the attorneys present,the court adopted an order filed june,that went well beyond the objective of the original petition and directed inter alia that zal share of the trust assets would remain in the existing trust and jane equal share would be transferred to a new trust designated the jane alter living trust.
the jane alter living trust,which was executed on june,named wendy as trustee.it provided that if zal predeceased jane,the trust assets would be distributed to wendy and in equal shares to her four grandchildren.the effect was to restrict the distribution to susan children to of the estate.in the event zal was still living on jane death,the trust provided that half of the assets would be held in a terminable interest trust trust for the benefit of zal during his life.
concurrently with creation of the jane alter living trust,jane made a will disposing of all property that might not have been transferred to the trust and seeking to exercise a power of appointment in the alter family trust,conditional upon a determination that the power of appointment was still effective.on november,she executed a first codicil to her will that again sought to exercise the power of appointment in the alter family trust.
zal died on june.since separating from zal,jane had also suffered a progressive decline in her physical and mental condition.she walked with difficulty and was slowly going deaf and blind.the trial court found that she began to suffer from a degree of cognitive impairment that impeded her ability to review records,reason abstractly,or make sound judgments.with her declining physical and mental capacities,jane became increasingly dependent on wendy.the trial court found,for example,that wendy drove jane to attorneys offices,banks and medical appointments,among other things wendy was trustee of the jane alter trust and,as such,had control of all her assets,handled all her financial affairs and,at least at some point between and,started paying all of her bills as well.jane dependence on wendy was accompanied by the growth of an intense and irrational anger toward susan.as the trial court found,s he had it in her mind that susan had stolen money from the alter family trust,and she would not let this notion go.
in early november,wendy took jane to her attorney,sterling ross,to have an amendment prepared for the jane alter living trust.ross referred her to independent counsel,marila marshall,who drafted the document.in the trial court words,she was then blind,hard of hearing,in a wheelchair and had been weakened mentally by a series of strokes.her cognitive abilities were diminished.on november,she executed a second amendment second amendment to the jane alter living trust,which largely excluded susan and her family from receiving trust assets.the amended trust gave each of the four grandchildren the sum of and provided that,if wendy were living at the time of her death,the remaining trust estate would be distributed to her.if wendy were not living,percent of the estate would go to wendy family and percent to susan family.
jane died on october.on december,wendy filed a petition for probate of jane will in san francisco superior court.in response,susan filed a petition for declaratory relief seeking a determination that a contest to the admission of jane will into probate would not constitute a challenge to zal will or the alter family trust and succeeded in obtaining a declaratory judgment to that effect.about two months later,susan filed a contest to probate of jane will.wendy filed an answer to the contest,but the record discloses no further proceedings on the petition for probate or the will contest.
on february,susan filed a petition in the marin county superior court that led to the judgment here on appeal.the petition seeks an order adjudicating the jane alter living trust and the second amendment to the trust to be invalid on the ground of jane incapacity or wendy undue influence over jane.in its statement of decision,the trial court found that,despite jane declining health,the evidence did not show that she lacked competence to execute the jane alter living trust.turning to the issue of undue influence,the court declined to apply a presumption of undue influence on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that wendy procured the documents,but,in a very thorough review of the evidence,the court still found that the allegation of undue influence had been proven.the court proceeded to also find that the dispository provisions were caused by misrepresentations of wendy that were intended to alienate jane from her oldest daughter.the decision declared the jane alter living trust and the second amendment to the trust to be void,and ordered wendy to pay the attorney fees that susan had incurred in the action.the court entered a judgment in the action on december,including attorney fees in an amount to be determined.
susan moved for a determination of attorney fees in accordance with the judgment.on may,the court awarded her attorney fees in the sum of,and on july,the court entered an amended judgment incorporating this award of attorney fees.
susan next took steps to enforce the judgment for attorney fees by recording an abstract of judgment and obtaining an order for a debtor examination.on october,wendy moved for a protective order to expunge the abstract of judgment and vacate the order for a debtor examination.the trial court denied the motion in an order filed november.
wendy has filed notices of appeal from the judgment entered on december,the order filed may,awarding attorney fees the amended judgment filed july,and the order filed november,denying wendy motion for a protective order.
subject matter jurisdiction 
as a first assignment of error,wendy argues that the marin county superior court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over susan petition challenging the jane alter living trust and the second amendment to the trust.susan filed the petition in reliance on probate code section,subdivision a,which authorizes the filing of proceedings affecting a living trust to be filed in the county where the principal place of administration of the trust is located.it is undisputed that wendy lives in marin county and is the trustee of the jane alter living trust.wendy nevertheless contends that the san francisco probate court had previously assumed jurisdiction over jane property subject to her testamentary disposition,either by will or a testamentary trust,the contention requires us to examine closely two previous orders of the san francisco probate court.
as noted above,in an order filed january,approving the first account of the successor trustee of the alter family trust,the san francisco probate court directed the trustee to seek instructions with respect to the transmutation of community property of zal and jane into their separate property.with the stipulation of counsel for zal,jane,and the trustee,the court entered an order on june,that addressed not only this issue but other related issues concerning the division of the spouses property.in response to the original petition,the order directed that the property placed in the alter family trust would remain community property and would not be transmuted into the separate property of zal and jane.in addition,it ordered the establishment of two separate trusts with provisions assuring fair treatment of each spouse by the other.
specifically,the order directed jane to establish a trust for the benefit of zal during his lifetime in the form of an attached trust document designated the jane alter living trust.if jane should fail to establish this trust before her death,the court would have the power to order the representative or trustee of her estate to establish from her assets or the assets of her estate or trust the trust.similarly,if at the time of zal death his existing estate plan did not provide for jane in the form and amounts set forth in the alter family trust,the court would have the power to order the representative or trustee of his estate to establish a trust for the benefit of jane during her remaining life,in an amount equivalent to the amount of the trust which appears in the alter family trust.the court allowed jane revocation of the alter family trust conditional upon her execution of the jane alter living trust and directed that of the trust assets be transferred to zal conservator and to the jane alter living trust.
lastly,the order provided this court shall retain jurisdiction over zal and jane and the assets of the alter family trust to enforce this order.
wendy argues that her petition to probate jane will revested the san francisco probate court with jurisdiction over jane and her assets.the peculiarity of this petition is that it solely concerned the exercise of a power of appointment in the presumably revoked alter family trust wendy petition to probate jane will filed december,stated that the estimated value of property of the estate was zero.attachment to the petition stated all of the decedent assets were held in trust or will be transferred by other means.there will be no assets in the probate estate.the fourth paragraph of the will of jane alter attached to the petition specifically referred to the power of appointment and sought to exercise it in the event the revocation of the alter family trust should be determined to be legally ineffective.the first codicil to the will of jane alter,which was also attached to the petition,sought solely to confirm the exercise in my will of the power of appointment.
susan contested the probate of the will on the grounds of incapacity and undue influence and on the further ground that the alter family trust,which contained the power of appointment,had been revoked both by jane and an order of the court.therefore,at the time of the execution of the purported will of jane alter,the trust was revoked and thus there was no document extant granting her said power.
we see nothing in the order filed june,that would affect the jurisdiction of the marin county court to consider susan petition challenging the jane alter living trust.the san francisco court acted on a petition by debra dolch requesting instructions on the transmutation of community property of zal and jane into separate property,and with the stipulation of the parties,approved a broad settlement regulating the division of property between the spouses following jane revocation of the alter family trust.the court retained jurisdiction for the limited purpose of assuring that the settlement was carried out as directed.this limited reservation of jurisdiction did not conflict in any way with susan petition challenging the validity of the jane alter living trust.
we also see no basis for holding that the petition to probate jane will gave the san francisco probate court prior exclusive jurisdiction over jane trust assets that precluded later filings in another county.such prior exclusive jurisdiction can not be predicated on in rem jurisdiction over jane estate since the petition stated that there were no assets subject to probate.the precedents cited in wendy brief regarding in rem jurisdiction of the probate court over a decedent assets have no application in the absence of a probate estate.estate of wise cal d.similarly,the cited authority regarding the continuing and exclusive jurisdiction of the probate court presupposes an estate subject to administration.dungan superior court cal,marsh edelstein d.estate of white d,estate of evans d.again,the petition has no relevance to the court jurisdiction over the jane alter living trust since it was filed to exercise a power of appointment in a distinct trust,the alter family trust.in the absence of the same subject matter,wendy can not rely on the rule that the tribunal in which jurisdiction first attaches retains it exclusively.slinack superior court cal,jordan clausen d.finally,we see no relevance to wendy discussion of testamentary trusts since the judgment at issue in this appeal concerned the validity of a living trust.estate of cox d,subd.a.
we construe susan petition challenging the dispository provisions of the jane alter living trust as a proceeding to determine the validity of a trust provision that came within the category of proceedings concerning the internal affairs of a trust under probate code section,subdivision b.saks damon raike th,d.under probate code section,the superior court having jurisdiction over the trust had exclusive jurisdiction over the proceedings.the marin county superior court possessed such jurisdiction because the trustee resided in that county.
res judicata 
wendy next maintains that the trial court was barred by the principle of collateral estoppel from finding that the charges against susan in the april petition were unfortunate and irresponsible allegations of wrongdoing that never occurred.the defense of res judicata,however,was not pleaded or otherwise raised in the trial court.res judicata is not a jurisdictional defense,and may be waived by failure to raise it in the trial court.witkin,cal.procedure ed.judgment.moreover,the allegations in the april petition were never adjudicated in the san francisco probate court.instead,the proceeding was terminated by a stipulated order appointing a successor trustee.while a stipulated judgment may have collateral estoppel effect in california california state auto.bureau superior court cal d,probate orders are conclusive only as to matters actually passed upon by the probate court.estate of de laveaga cal d,lazzarone bank of america d.
substantial evidence 
contending that the court misapplied the applicable legal standards to invalidate a testamentary document based on undue influence or fraud,wendy advances two arguments involving issues of law and substantial evidence.with respect to the court finding of undue influence,she argues that the invalidation of a testamentary document on this ground requires evidence of procurement,which is lacking in the present record.in the case of fraud,she argues that a finding of fraud requires evidence of intent to deceive,which can not be found in the present record.
undue influence 
california courts have long held that a testamentary document may be set aside if procured by undue influence.estate of ricks cal.as authoritatively defined in rice clark cal th,d,u ndue influence is pressure brought to bear directly on the testamentary act,sufficient to overcome the testator free will,amounting in effect to coercion destroying the testator free agency.see also estate of shay cal,hagen hickenbottom th,d estate of sarabia d.estate of truckenmiller d.
the proof of undue influence by circumstantial evidence usually requires a showing of a number of factors which,in combination,justify the inference,but which taken individually and alone are not sufficient.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.wills and probate.among the indicia of undue influence is evidence that the chief beneficiaries under the will were active in procuring the instrument to be executed.estate of lingenfelter cal d,estate of franco d.while the person challenging the testamentary instrument ordinarily has the burden of proving undue influence,under certain narrow circumstances,a presumption of undue influence may arise,shifting to the proponent of the disposition the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the donative instrument was not procured by undue influence.conservatorship of davidson th,d.evidence that the beneficiary procured the testamentary instrument is one of three circumstances required to create this presumption.a presumption of undue influence arises upon the challenger showing that the person alleged to have exerted undue influence had a confidential relationship with the testator the person actively participated in procuring the instrument preparation or execution and the person would benefit unduly by the testamentary instrument.rice clark,supra,cal th,d,estate of fritschi cal d.
thus,while evidence of procurement is highly probative of undue influence and figures repeatedly in judicial discussions of the principle,it is essential to proof of undue influence only if the court relies on the presumption of undue influence to shift the burden of proof to the proponent of the testamentary instruction.in the case at bar,the court did not rely on the presumption,but rather applied the general principle of undue influence to a review of all the evidence.appellant can not challenge the court finding of undue influence by showing only the weakness or absence of evidence of procurement other factors in combination can also support this finding.to challenge the finding,she must show that the evidence as a whole does not satisfy the general standard for proof of undue influence.we consider that,as a matter of law,her arguments relying exclusively on the one factor of procurement necessarily fail to show a lack of substantial evidence supporting the finding of undue influence.
our conclusion requires affirmance of the judgment invalidating the dispository provisions of the jane alter living trust and the second amendment to the trust.it is immaterial whether or not the trial court erred in applying the alternative principles of fraud.if the decision of a lower court is correct on any theory of law applicable to the case,the judgment or order will be affirmed regardless of the correctness of the grounds upon which the lower court reached its conclusion.estate of beard th,d.no rule of decision is better or more firmly established by authority,nor one resting upon a sounder basis of reason and propriety,than that a ruling or decision,itself correct in law,will not be disturbed on appeal merely because given for a wrong reason.if right upon any theory of the law applicable to the case,it must be sustained regardless of the considerations which may have moved the trial court to its conclusion.davey southern pacific cal.nevertheless,we will examine briefly the finding of fraud.
the theories of undue influence and fraud commonly rest on a similar factual basis since contestants relying on a theory of undue influence may claim that the beneficiary employed misrepresentations to pressure the testator.they are,however,distinct grounds for contest.in estate of newhall cal,the court held that the issue of fraud should have been submitted to the jury even though the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of undue influence.the court explained,in cases where fraud alone is relied upon as a ground of contest it is the theory of the law that the testator,even though acting,in a manner of speaking,of his own free will,was,nevertheless,deceived by false data into doing that which he would not have done had he not been fraudulently imposed upon f alse representations have been held to constitute fraud if it can be shown that they were designed to and did deceive the testator into making a will different in its terms from that which he would have made had he not been misled.id.at.
the elements of fraud in the procurement of a testamentary instrument are the same as those required to vitiate a contract.one of the necessary elements is an intent to deceive the decedent or an intent to induce decedent to execute his will.estate of newhall,supra,cal.reversing a judgment of fraud,the court in estate of benton cal,found that the element is lacking,to wit that herbert benton made these representations with intent to deceive the decedent,or with intent to induc
