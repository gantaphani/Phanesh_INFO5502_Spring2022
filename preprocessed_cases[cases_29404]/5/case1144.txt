a defendant has thirty days to remove a case on diversity or federal question grounds.we consider whether the clock is reset if the defendant later discovers the case is also removable on federal officer grounds.
plaintiff gerald durham suffers from lung cancer,which he alleges was caused by exposure to asbestos during his service as an electronics technician for the united states air force and air force reserves.durham filed his complaint against lockheed martin and sixty other defendants on august,in california superior court.in his complaint,durham listed the air force facilities where he worked,but did allege which lockheed products exposed him to asbestos.durham complaint incorporated by reference a master complaint filed by his law firm against john doe defendants,which was equally short on detail.
plaintiff served lockheed martin on august.lockheed did attempt to remove the case to federal court on federal enclave grounds because,based on past experience,it believed some of its would be unwilling to consent to removal.ten days later,lockheed received plaintiff answers to interrogatories.these interrogatories for the first time disclosed the specifics of durham he was exposed to asbestos while working on the blackbird and the starlifter aircraft on military bases where lockheed was a contractor.
durham responses disclosed to lockheed a new basis for removing the case lockheed assembled the aircraft while acting as an agent of a federal officer,and was therefore immune to suit as a federal contractor.see a.according to lockheed,the military dictated the precise specifications of the aircraft durham worked on,right down to directing lockheed to install specific navigational components manufactured by other contractors.lockheed also claims that the government directed it to use asbestos in the assembly of these aircraft because it was the only material capable of ensuring the aircraft performed to the military exacting example,that the blackbird be able to fly at mach,and thus withstand temperatures in excess of degrees.
while lockheed was evaluating durham responses to its interrogatories,the removal clock was ticking.when lockheed received the responses,ten days had already passed since it had been served with the complaint.lockheed did file a notice of removal until september than thirty days after it had been served with the complaint,but less than thirty days after it had received durham interrogatory responses.
after lockheed removed,durham moved to remand to state court,claiming that lockheed removal was untimely.see b,c.the remand motion presented two questions first,when did durham put lockheed on notice of the bases for removal and,second,if lockheed discovered federal officer grounds after it discovered federal enclave grounds,was it entitled to a new period to remove the district court found that the complaint disclosed a basis for federal enclave jurisdiction,and sided with durham t here is no special extension of time to remove on the basis of federal officer jurisdiction under where,as here,days has passed from the time which another basis for federal jurisdiction existed under.the district court thus remanded the case to state court and awarded durham in costs and attorney fees because lockheed removal was untimely.see id.c.lockheed appeals the award of costs and fees.
d generally bars review of a district court order remanding a case to state court,and thus,whatever we decide here,we can not recall the case to federal court we consider only whether the district court properly awarded costs and attorney fees to durham.notwithstanding section d,we have jurisdiction to review the award because the district court grant of attorney fees and costs is a final order subject to review under.see moore permanente med.group,cir.the supreme court recently instructed that attorney fees in removal cases are not to be awarded as a matter of course a bsent unusual circumstances,attorney fees should not be awarded when the removing party has an objectively reasonable basis for removal.martin franklin capital,d.we review the award of fees and costs for abuse of discretion,but will overturn it if it is based on an erroneous determination of law.see moore,at.
after a defendant learns that an action is removable,he has thirty days to remove the case to federal court.see b.we held in harris bankers life casualty,cir,that the thirty day time period for removal starts to run from defendant receipt of the initial pleading only when that pleading affirmatively reveals on its face the facts necessary for federal court jurisdiction.id.at quoting chapman powermatic,cir alterations in original.otherwise,the clock does begin ticking until a defendant receives a copy of an amended pleading,motion,order or other paper from which it can determine that the case is removable.b.
lockheed does not contest the district court determination that the complaint revealed one basis for federal jurisdiction.federal courts have federal question jurisdiction over tort claims that arise on federal enclaves.see willis craig,cir per curiam mater holley,cir.the complaint revealed that some of durham claims arose on federal enclaves,so under harris,lockheed had thirty days from when it received the complaint to remove to federal court.but to do so successfully,it had to convince all of its to go small task where,as here,there are defendants.see united computer,v.at t,cir.lockheed believed there was no way to forge consensus among the had learned in prior asbestos litigation with these defendants that some of them preferred a state forum,and thus would not consent to removal.so lockheed never attempted to remove on federal enclave grounds.
it turns out that there was another basis for federal jurisdiction in this case.federal officers,and their agents,may remove cases based on acts performed under color of their federal office if they assert a colorable federal defense 
a civil action or criminal prosecution commenced in a state court against any of the following may be removed by them to the district court of the united states for the district and division embracing the place wherein it is pending 
the united states or any agency thereof or any officer or any person acting under that officer of the united states or of any agency thereof,sued in an official or individual capacity for any act under color of such office 
a mesa california,d.a party seeking removal under section must demonstrate that a it is a person within the meaning of the statute b there is a causal nexus between its actions,taken pursuant to a federal officer directions,and plaintiff claims and c it can assert a colorable federal defense.jefferson county acker,d mesa,at.
to start the clock under harris,durham had to provide lockheed with facts to support each of the three requirements.until durham revealed which aircraft he had worked on during his air force career,lockheed could assert either that its actions were taken pursuant to a federal officer directions,or that it had a colorable federal defense.lockheed,like other federal military contractors,performs some activities on military bases that are protected by federal contractor immunity,and others that are not.see boyle united techs,d.there was enough information in durham complaint for lockheed to discern whether its allegedly wrongful conduct was protected by federal contractor immunity.had it removed upon filing of the complaint,it may well have subjected itself to fees and costs,and potentially rule sanctions,for filing a baseless notice of removal.after harris,we no longer require defendants to take this blind do charge defendants with notice of removability until they received a paper that gives them enough information to remove.
if durham responses to lockheed interrogatories did reset the removal clock,lockheed removal was untimely.if the responses did,the district court erred in remanding the case,and in awarding durham costs and fees.to answer the timeliness question,we begin with the text of the removal statute 
if the case stated by the initial pleading is not removable,a notice of removal may be filed within thirty days after receipt
