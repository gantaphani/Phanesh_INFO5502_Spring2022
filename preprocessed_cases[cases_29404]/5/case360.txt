opinion of the court 
we consider whether,under the first amendment,certain expenses incurred by unions may be charged to and whether a local union must obtain independent auditor verification of its charges and,if so,what kind of verification we require.
the first amendment affords employees the freedom not to associate with a labor organization.see chicago teachers union,local hudson,d quoting abood detroit bd.of,d.there are limits to this constitutional freedom,however,in light of organized labor important role in advancing employment conditions.abood,at.thus,as a means of curing the problem posed by its representation of,a union may charge each employee a,or agency,fee equal to his or her per capita share of the union expenses arising from its duties as a representative.see id.at.but a union may not,consistent with the first amendment,collect dues to support ideological causes or other expenses insufficiently related to collective bargaining.id.
to ensure that are assessed only for fees properly chargeable to them,the supreme court has ruled that unions must adopt procedural safeguards carefully tailored to minimize the first amendment infringement.hudson,at.first,the union must provide a with sufficient information to gauge the propriety of the union fee.id.at.this explanation of the basis for the fee is often referred to as a hudson notice.second,a must have an adequate opportunity to object to the fee allocation.see id.at.the two safeguards are linked without the hudson notice,a would lack a basis for deciding whether to object to a fee calculation.penrod nlrb.
when theory meets practice,questions abound.do the financial information requirements apply to small local unions how much verification of that information must there be when a union represents more than one bargaining unit,can that union include,in the fee assessed to of one bargaining unit,costs associated with another bargaining unit litigation what if those bargaining units are in different industries 
background and procedural history 
shaler area education association saea is the exclusive bargaining representative for education professionals employed by the shaler area school district.saea is the local affiliate of the pennsylvania state education association psea which represents,inter alia,both education and healthcare professionals in the the national education association nea,and collectively with saea and psea,the unions.during the school year,the shaler area school district employed education professionals,of whom were members of the saea and,thereby,the psea and nea.because all three unions provide services to the plaintiffs bargaining unit,the eleven paid fees to the saea,psea,and nea pursuant to.ann.west.
seven education professionals brought this action to challenge the unions fee procedure and assessments after the district court confirmed that the plaintiffs had standing to object to the fees and the sufficiency of the unions hudson notice the parties filed a joint stipulation of facts followed by for summary judgment.the district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs,declaring that the saea must verify its expenditures through an independent audit and that psea could not charge the plaintiffs for expenses incurred in litigation not relating specifically to the plaintiffs own unit.however,it also held that the unions could assess plaintiffs for expenditures related to the unions representation of healthcare professionals.
both parties appealed,and together they present four issues for our review whether,by filing their complaint,plaintiffs objected properly to the unions fees and procedures whether a local union,regardless of size,must obtain an independent auditor verification of the expenditures listed in its calculation notice and,if so,we need to decide at what level of auditor inquiry whether a union may charge for litigation costs incurred on behalf of another bargaining unit pursuant to an arrangement with that other bargaining unit and whether a union may charge for pooled resources available to all local affiliates even though some of the affiliates represent employees in different professions.we rule in favor of plaintiffs as to issues one and two and determine the level of verification required and the unions on issues three and four.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction under and.we exercise appellate jurisdiction pursuant to.
whether plaintiffs properly objected to the unions fee calculation is a question of standing and is subject to de novo review.in re rfe,cir.we also review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.spring dairies.milk mktg,cir.
iii.discussion 
objection requirement 
the unions contend that plaintiffs failed to carry their burden of objecting to the fee calculation by not raising a contemporaneous objection,by not objecting at the time of fee collection.addressing this issue as a question of plaintiffs standing to sue,the district court rejected the unions contention on the ground that plaintiffs complaint satisfied the objection requirement.we agree.
no supreme court case explicitly establishes a requirement.while international association of machinists street,d,held that each must individually object to disputed fees,that requirement merely places the burden on dissenting employees affirmatively to opt out of fees to which they object,rather than allowing them to opt into fees with which they agree.see id.at.holding that because the individual street plaintiffs have in the course of this action made known to their respective unions their objection to the use of their money for the support of political causes,the respective unions were without power to use payments thereafter tendered by them for such political causes.since street,the court has reiterated that may raise their initial objection in a complaint.abood,at.t he requirement in street that dissent be affirmatively indicated was satisfied by the allegations in the complaint that was filed.citation omitted of ry.clerks,freight handlers,exps.station employees allen,d citing street,at.employees in railway labor act case first made known their objection to the unions political expenditures in their complaint filed in this action however,this was early enough.
yet the unions argue that hudson imposed a more onerous notice standard and that cases have implicitly rejected the notion of.even assuming arguendo that the unions are correct,the principle they espouse would nonetheless be inapplicable in this case because,as we explain more fully infra in section,the notice procedures and the fee information given under the plan were inadequate.lowary lexington local bd.of,cir.thus the plaintiffs lacked sufficient information to formulate a contemporaneous objection.
independent auditor verification 
in hudson,the supreme court held that a local union representing employees and collecting over million in annual dues must provide with sufficient information to gauge the propriety of the union fee.at.the court went on to explain that t he union need not provide nonmembers with an exhaustive and detailed list of all its expenditures,but adequate disclosure surely would include the major categories of expenses,as well as verification by an independent auditor.id.at.emphasis added.we applied hudson independent auditor requirement in hohe casey,cir,and held that the first amendment required a exclusive bargaining representative for approximately employees to obtain independent auditor verification.id.at.we noted that the purpose of requiring the verification in the hudson notice is to give the nonmembers some prior assurance that the fee was properly calculated,and w hen nonmembers do not receive that assurance,their constitutional rights are violated under hudson.id.at.
today we decide whether hudson independent auditor requirement applies to saea,a much smaller union than the unions involved in hudson and hohe.plaintiffs argue that it does.the unions contend that hudson independent auditor requirement was merely dictum or applies only to large unions,like those in hudson and hohe,that can afford an independent auditor.they point out that saea would spend more on an audit than it collects through fees.moreover,the unions claim that saea finances are so simplistic that can obtain sufficient information,hudson,at,by examining its documents themselves.
the ninth circuit has addressed this issue.in prescott county of el dorado,cir,vacated on other grounds,d,reinstated in relevant part,the court held that,regardless of its accompanying high cost,a state union must conduct a true audit.id.at.however,the court left unanswered whether the independent auditor requirement applied to a small local union.id.at.we do not decide that each little unit in the state union firmament must necessarily be subjected to a separate verified audit of its expenditures.in a subsequent case very recently decided,harik california teachers association,cir the court provided an answer an independent auditor verification is not necessary.the harik court interpreted hudson to require,in the context of a local union with under in estimated annual revenues,either disclosure of the full financial material necessary to verify a union expenditures,or an independently sanctioned verification of the local union chargeable and expenditures.id.at emphasis added.thus,a small local union need only provide sufficient information so that a nonmember can independently verify that the union spent its money where it claimed that it did.id.in so doing,the ninth circuit shifted the burden of expense verification from the union to the nonmember.it reasoned that f or the smallest affiliates,providing financial reports along with full and fair access to bills,check stubs,canceled checks,account balances,and related materials may be more than an external review.id 
harik acknowledges that union costs for verification do not trump first amendment rights,and thus presumably there is no bye from hudson requirement of independent auditor verification.but for smaller unions we assume the court means those with estimated annual revenues between and,it is confident that they can devise flexible and creative methodolog ies,appropriately tailored to provide their nonmembers with a reasonable opportunity for meaningful verification,without depleting the union coffers.id.and f or the smallest affiliates we assume those unions with estimated annual revenues under,harik as already noted allows the option of providing financial reports unaudited and,it appears,lacking any independent auditor oversight along with full and fair access to the underlying financial information.the district court in that case thus erred in requiring more than adequate accessible information using an auditor verifiable methodology that could verify the local union expenditures.id.in so doing,harik excises independent auditor from hudson verification by an independent auditor,at,at least f or the smallest union affiliates.harik.instead,verification can mean producing adequate accessible information using an auditor verifiable methodology.id.we do not find this an available option unless the supreme court tells us otherwise.
were we writing on a clean slate,we might well require something less rigorous for small local unions than independent auditor verification.but the slate is not clean.we are bound by the supreme court decision in hudson,and its directive of verification by an independent auditor means just that.hudson implied no intent to make the audit requirement depend on the size of the reporting union absent a counter directive by the supreme court,we likewise make no exception.see agostini felton,d stating that i f a precedent of this court has direct application in a case the court of appeals should follow the case which directly controls,leaving to this court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions quoting rodriguez de quijas express,d alteration in original.
but what level of independent auditor verification does hudson require broadly speaking,auditors can provide three different types of accounting services compilations,reviews,and audits.a compilation is the lowest level of assurance regarding an entity financial statements.christian tregillis,overview of services provided by cpas,in basics of accounting finance what every practicing lawyer needs to know pli.law practice course,handbook series no.it expresses neither an opinion nor any level of assurance.id.when performing a compilation,an accountant need not verify or corroborate the financial statement information provided by the client.jane,understanding compilations,reviews,and audits,at.
a review involves an intermediate level of scrutiny in which the auditor provides limited assurance on the entity financial statements.see id.in so doing,the auditor indicates that he is not aware of any material modifications needed to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles,also known as gaap.tregillis,supra,at.in order to provide this limited assurance,the auditor must make some,but not comprehensive,inquiry into client management,accounting practices,internal control structure,and analytical procedures used by the organization.see,supra.the scope of the inquiry and analytical procedures are the major difference between a review and a compilation.larry bailey,gaas guide a comprehensive restatement of generally accepted auditing standards.
in an audit,which provides the highest level of assurance on financial statements,the accountant provides verification of the financial statements claims and assertions and expresses an opinion on the entity financials.tregillis,supra,at emphasis added.among other procedures,the accountant consider s and evaluate s the internal control system of the client and tests the underlying documentation to support account balances,supra bailey,supra,at.annual audits are required for all publicly traded companies.tregillis,supra,at.
as between a review and an audit,a review may bring to the accountant attention significant matters affecting the financial statements,but it does not provide assurance that the accountant will become aware of all significant matters that would be disclosed in an audit.john clay et,guide to compilation and review engagements ed.this is because a review does not contemplate obtaining an understanding of the internal control structure or assessing control risk tests of accounting records and of responses to inquiries by obtaining corroborating evidential matter through inspection,observation or confirmation and certain other procedures ordinarily performed during an audit.id.
we hold that local unions,regardless of their size,are required to obtain audits of their financial statements.compilations and reviews do not provide an adequate basis for a to decide whether to object to a fee.see prescott,at a n audit,as opposed to a review,offers at least some verification of the amounts disclosed in the financial statement we do not see how a mere review of the union records can offer the verification that the supreme court and we have spoken of.indeed,verification the word used by the supreme court in hudson,at,and by at least one accounting authority in describing an audit,see tregillis,supra,at authenticating or confirming the truth or accuracy of a statement.webster third new int l dictionary of the english language unabridged.put another way,an audit make s assurance double sure.william shakespeare,macbeth act,sc,line craig,oxford.a review does not 
we take no position on the precise procedures an accountant must follow when auditing a local union like the second circuit in andrews education association of cheshire,cir,and the sixth circuit in gwirtz ohio education association,cir,we decline to hold either that an accountant audit procedures must constitute the least restrictive process imaginable,andrews,at,or that local unions must obtain the highest possible level of audit service,gwirtz,at.see generally prescott,at noting that audits may vary in procedures and sampling rates.we do note,however,that hudson does not require absolute precision within the audit context.see hudson,at.we continue to recognize that there are practical reasons why a bsolute precision in the calculation of the charge to nonmembers can not be expected or required.quoting allen,at.alteration in original 
we recognize that our decision might place high costs on some local unions.but this is how we read hudson requirement of verification by an independent auditor.id.further,local unions are not without options.for example,unions without the financial wherewithal to afford the audit might choose to enter into combinations with other small unions to achieve necessary economies of scale.in the alternative,state or national unions might choose to subsidize the cost of local unions audits.
litigation expenditures 
plaintiffs fees include charges for litigation conducted by psea or its affiliates but unrelated specifically to the saea unit.such expenses are known as litigation expenses.plaintiffs contend that the litigation expenses at issue are nonchargeable.see ellis of,airline clerks,freight handlers,station employees,d holding certain litigation expenses not incurred on behalf of bargaining unit unchargeable to those.the unions argue that,because the litigation expenses at issue are pooled across psea affiliates,these expenses are chargeable to members.see lehnert ferris faculty ass n,d holding that a union may charge for their pro rata share of certain expenses incurred pursuant to a agreement with affiliate unions.this case requires us to address an issue that lies in the intersection of the ellis and lehnert holdings whether a union may charge for their pro rata share of expenses that relate to litigation and that were incurred on behalf of an affiliate union pursuant to a agreement.
as noted,ellis holds that a union may not charge members for certain litigation expenses ellis,at.while expenses of litigation arising from the bargaining unit are clearly chargeable to that employee,t he expenses of litigation not having such a connection with the bargaining unit are not to be charged to objecting employees but ellis did not involve expenses incurred by an affiliate bargaining unit pursuant to an arrangement with that affiliate.here,psea and its affiliates have agreed to pool their litigation expenses for the unions mutual benefit.this presents a significantly different question than ellis.even if a local union party to such an arrangement does not litigate in any given year,it still derives a tangible benefit from participating in an agreement the availability of resources greater than those it could muster individually.finerty nlrb,it is indisputable that,by pooling its resources on a basis,a union,which is the bargaining representative of all its members,provides some benefit to members of the various local unions.emphasis in original.moreover,it is unclear whether the ellis court would have reached the same result if the litigation at issue were more related to the collective bargaining activities of the ellis plaintiffs bargaining unit.in other words,it is unclear whether the court intended to state a per se rule against the chargeability of litigation expenses.
in lehnert,the supreme court held that a union may charge members for their pro rata share of expenses incurred on behalf of affiliate bargaining units when there is some indication that the payment is for services that may ultimately inure to the benefit of the members of the local union by virtue of their membership in the parent organization.lehnert,at.a majority of the court in lehnert reached this conclusion by applying a test to assess whether a particular union affiliate expense is chargeable to of the union.c hargeable activities must be germane to activity be justified by the government vital policy interest in labor peace and avoiding free riders and not significantly add to the burdening of free speech that is inherent in the allowance of an agency or union shop.id.at.however,when the lehnert court attempted to apply this test to a question similar to the one before expenses for reporting on litigation,where litigation expenses are incurred pursuant to a agreement with an affiliate union,are chargeable to of the local bargaining five justices agreed.
justice blackmun,joined by chief justice rehnquist and justices white and stevens,noted that dissenting employees may not be charged for the costs of union literature reporting on litigation because they can not be charged for such litigation itself under ellis.id.at.he acknowledged that litigation conducted by one bargaining unit could establish precedents useful to another bargaining unit.but he concluded that this potential benefit was too attenuated and that extraunit litigation is more akin to lobbying which is not chargeable in both kind and effect.id were justice blackmun able to garner five justices votes for the proposition that litigation is not chargeable to members,lehnert would control here.however,as we discuss,he wrote only for a plurality of four.
justice scalia,joined by justices and souter,agree d with the court disposition of many of the challenged expenditures,but disagreed with the majority test for evaluating the chargeability of expenditures.lehnert,at.scalia,concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.rather,justice scalia would permit expenses to be charged to when those expenses are incurred as part of the union statutory duties as exclusive bargaining agent.id.however,he did not apply his preferred test to the question whether dissenting employees could be charged for the expenses of union reporting on litigation or for the expenses of litigation itself.
justice kennedy,who endorsed justice scalia rather than justice blackmun chargeability test,wrote separately to argue that litigation expenditures should be allowed if undertaken in the course of the union duties as exclusive bargaining representative.lehnert,at.kennedy,concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.he criticized justice blackmun reliance on ellis to resolve the question whether costs of reporting on litigation are chargeable,pointing out that ellis did not address a arrangement.id.at.
despite the fact that no five justices explicitly agreed on the chargeability of expenses arising from litigation,plaintiffs insist that lehnert controls our disposition of the issue.they contend that because justice scalia was clear when he disagreed with the court rulings on other expenditures,he must have agreed with justice blackmun position that litigation expenditures are not chargeable.we disagree with the plaintiffs interpretation of justice scalia opinion,for his silence is inconclusive we are therefore left without definitive supreme court guidance.see planned parenthood of casey,cir,aff in part and rev in part,d stating that a putative majority standard must necessarily produce results with which a majority of the court from that case would agree.
the sixth circuit,the court of appeals from which lehnert was appealed to the supreme court,addressed the issue before us in reese city of columbus,cir.the court agreed with justice marshall that the lehnert plurality statement on litigation expenses was no more than dicta because at issue was the cost of reporting on litigation.id.at.it then proceeded to find that lehnert not only allowed,but required,it to approve the charges because a majority in lehnert approved of charges for pooled expenses like those in this case.id.at.while reese overstates lehnert holding,as the lehnert majority never held litigation expenses incurred pursuant to a pooling agreement to be chargeable,we nonetheless agree with the sixth circuit conclusion.
moreover,in international association of machinists aerospace workers nlrb,cir,the seventh circuit enforced an nlrb decision in which the nlrb rejected as a matter of law the proposition that litigation expenses should be treated differently from other expenses and instead appl ied the same standard for determining the chargeability of litigation expenses as we are required to apply to all other expenses.cal.saw knife works.the seventh circuit agreed that litigation expenditures are analytically identical to other expenditures related to collective bargaining.international ass of machinists aerospace workers,at.
we too uphold the chargeability of the litigation expenses at issue by applying the lehnert majority chargeability test chargeable activities must be germane to activity be justified by the government vital policy interest in labor peace and avoiding free riders and not significantly add to the burdening of free speech that is inherent in the allowance of an agency or union shop.lehnert,at.first,that the litigation expenses at issue were incurred pursuant to an arrangement makes the pro rata share of those expenses charged to saea members and akin to insurance.see id.at.noting that because t he essence of the affiliation relationship is the notion that the parent will bring to bear its often considerable economic,political,and informational resources when the local is in need of them,the portion of a local fee that contributes to the pool of resources potentially available to the local is assessed for the bargaining unit protection,even if it is not actually expended on that unit in any particular membership year.the premium that saea members and pay,in the form of a pro rata share of litigation expenses,ensures that the local bargaining unit will have sufficient resources at its disposal should it need,in the future,to engage in litigation which would be chargeable to members.because the litigation expenditures at issue ensure the availability of resources for litigation,those expenditures are germane to activity.
applying the second prong of the lehnert test,we note that the concerns applicable to other arrangements apply with equal force to litigation expenditures.
third,litigation expenses present little additional infringement of first amendment rights beyond that already accepted,ellis,at,where,as here,the pooled litigation resources are expended on activities and may ultimately inure to the benefit of the members of the local union,lehnert,at.that,expenses for,inter alia,pooled negotiating advice and informational assistance in lehnert are chargeable to objecting employees informs our conclusion.
unlike the justice blackmun camp in lehnert,we discern no compelling reason to treat litigation expenses incurred pursuant to a pooling agreement differently from other pooled expenses.thus we conclude that they are chargeable to saea.
representation 
in addition to providing services to education professionals,psea affiliated local associations also provide services to healthcare professionals.when psea calculates the expenses chargeable to payers,it does not allocate chargeable costs by profession.rather,it includes as part of fees the expenses incurred on behalf of all represented employees,educators and healthcare professionals.plaintiffs argue that the first amendment bars psea from passing onto them costs incurred on behalf of healthcare professionals because psea has not shown that those costs may ultimately inure to their education unit benefit by virtue of its membership in psea.lehnert,at.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the unions,holding that the plaintiffs failed to allege facts suggesting that any of the three lehnert requirements were not satisfied to repeat,that the expenditures are not germane to activity,not justified by the government vital policy interest in labor peace and avoiding free riders,or that they significantly add to the burdening of free speech that is inherent in the allowance of an agency or union shop.id.at.in so doing,the district court improperly placed the burden of proof on the plaintiffs when it belonged on the unions.as lehnert points out,t he union bore the burden of proving the proportion of chargeable expenses to total expenses.id.
because plaintiffs do not challenge any particular expenditures,we evaluate,as a matter of law,whether psea may pool costs across occupational groups.we answer this question affirmatively.as discussed above,lehnert held that a local bargaining representative may charge objecting employees for their pro rata share of the costs associated with otherwise chargeable activities of its state and national affiliates,even if those activities were not performed for the direct benefit of the objecting employees bargaining unit,so long as there is some indication that the payment is for services that may ultimately inure to the benefit of the members of the local union by virtue of their membership in the parent organization.id.
in our case,the pooling arrangement confers potential benefits on the plaintiffs.first,the arrangement generates economies of scale that redound to their benefit.second,by spreading the costs of expenses over a pool of employees whose levels are not perfectly correlated with their own,healthcare professionals as well as education professionals,education professionals reduce their risk of being assessed unusually high chargeable expenses in any given year.moreover,this pooling arrangement does not necessarily increase the dollar amount of chargeable expenses assessed to plaintiffs for any particular year.just as education professionals are assessed for healthcare professionals chargeable expenses,so too healthcare professionals are assessed for education professionals chargeable expenses.as psea correctly points out,this arrangement may result in lower fees than those assessed in the absence of such an arrangement.
we also note that the lehnert court did not limit its holding only to bargaining units within the same industry,or within related industries.instead,it stated a broad principle that part of a local affiliation fee which contributes to the pool of resources potentially available to the local is assessed for the bargaining unit protection,even if it is not actually expended on that unit in any particular membership year.id.at.though this reasoning was not that employed by the district court,it nonetheless supports its ultimate grant of summary judgment to the unions 
we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on the issue of charging them fees for litigation expenses.in all other respects,we affirm.
