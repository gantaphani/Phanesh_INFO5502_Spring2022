after five years of litigation in the superior court,district court,and ninth circuit court of appeals,a jury awarded appellant robert chavez in a statutory retaliation action brought against his employer and a supervisor.chavez then filed a motion seeking approximately in attorney fees under the fee provisions of the fair employment and housing act feha,government code section,subdivision b.ignoring that statute,and instead exercising its discretion under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a to deny costs because chavez recovery was below its jurisdictional minimum,the trial court denied the motion.chavez appeals from the denial of the motion,contending the court applied the wrong statutory standard and abused its discretion by denying him fees.we agree and reverse the order.
factual and procedural background 
chavez,a los angeles police department officer,sued his employer,the city of los angeles city,and three supervisors for violation of feha.chavez alleged he was subjected to discrimination based on a perceived disability and in retaliation for complaining about harassment and discrimination.chavez sought recovery for five days lost pay and benefits,emotional distress,and punitive damages.before trial,the parties participated in five mediation sessions.according to chavez,the city made no offer to settle except to waive its costs in full satisfaction of chavez claims.neither side made a statutory offer to compromise.
at the conclusion of trial,the jury returned a verdict in favor of chavez on his claim of retaliation.the jury awarded him economic damages of for lost overtime and cash detail,and noneconomic damages of for mental suffering and emotional distress against the city and one individual defendant no punitive damages were awarded.
following trial,chavez moved for in attorney fees as the prevailing plaintiff under feha.the fees consisted of in hourly fees,enhanced with a multiplier of,subd.b.chavez motion was supported by an expert witness declaration attesting to the reasonableness of his fee request.the city opposed the motion.it argued chavez had failed to establish a reasonable hourly rate for sole practitioners with experience comparable to that of his attorney,rochelle evans jackson,submitted inflated bills based on questionable billing practices,unreasonably sought a positive multiplier,and sought recovery of fees for time spent litigating claims on which he had not prevailed.the city urged the trial court to exercise its discretion to deny or at least substantially reduce chavez fee request based on chavez modest recovery,the court exercised its discretion under section,subdivision a to deny fees as costs under section,subdivision a b,and denied the motion.this appeal followed.
discussion 
the issues before us are whether the trial court erred in failing to consider the motion in light of chavez status as the prevailing plaintiff under feha and in applying section to deny him fees.
standard of review.
under feha,a prevailing plaintiff is entitled to recover attorney fees and costs absent circumstances rendering the award unjust,subd.b stephens coldwell banker commercial group,d.stephens,disapproved on other grounds in white ultramar,cal th,fn,d.we review an order denying attorney fees to a prevailing plaintiff under feha for abuse of discretion.steele jensen instrument th,d steele vo las virgenes municipal water dist.th,d.but the determination whether the criteria for a fee award are met is a legal question subject to de novo review on appeal.akins enterprise th,d.while the court is vested with discretion to deny attorney fees to a prevailing plaintiff,its discretion is narrow.stephens,supra,d at.two and attorney fees advancing different public involved feha fee provision,subd.b,and section,subdivision a.in its ruling,the trial court made no reference to feha fee provision.instead,it focused on chavez modest recovery to justify its exercise of discretion under section,subdivision a,to deny attorney fees outright as costs under section,subdivision a.
section,subdivision a.
section,subdivision a is a statute designed to encourage a plaintiff to pursue litigation in the appropriate forum,and to deter the plaintiff from exaggerating the value of a case.witkin,cal.procedure ed.jurisdiction.to encourage the filing of minor grievances as limited civil cases,section vests trial courts with the discretion to deny costs to a plaintiff who files an action as an unlimited action,but recovers a judgment in an amount which could have been rendered in a court of limited jurisdiction steele,supra,th at,d.under section,costs include attorney fees if authorized by a statute,such as feha,subd.a b.
classification of a case as a limited civil case turns largely on whether the amount in controversy exceeds,subd.a.that classification has significant consequences in terms of the quantity of discovery the parties may conduct.in a limited civil action,discovery is typically limited to one deposition and a combined maximum of interrogatories,document requests or requests for admission.but see,subds.a b permitting additional discovery by stipulation or on showing of need.neither statutory nor contractual attorney fees are part of the equation when the trial court determines whether a judgment is one that could have been rendered in a court of limited jurisdiction.dorman dwlc th,d.
attorney fees under feha.
feha authorizes an award of attorney fees to the prevailing party,subd.b.according to that statute,t he court,in its discretion,may award to the prevailing party reasonable attorney fees and costs,except where the action is filed by a public agency ibid.a key objective of feha is to preserve the civil rights of californians to seek and maintain employment without discrimination.notwithstanding feha neutral language,courts award attorney fees to a prevailing plaintiff as a matter of course unless special circumstances render an award unjust but a prevailing defendant recovers fees only if an action is found to be unreasonable,frivolous,meritless or vexatious.cummings benco building services th,d,quoting christiansburg garment eeoc,d jersey john muir medical center th,d.
a plaintiff who brings a discrimination suit acts as a private attorney general,vindicating a vital legislative policy.cummings benco building services,supra,th at,d.the statutory fee provisions are meant to ease the burden on plaintiffs of limited means so they can bring meritorious suits to vindicate key public policies.an award of fees to a prevailing plaintiff under feha provides fair compensation to the attorneys involved in the litigation at hand and encourage s litigation of claims that in the public interest merit litigation.flannery prentice cal th,d,quoting weeks baker mckenzie th,d.
the interplay of the statutes in this action.
the trial court ruling denying chavez motion for attorney fees ignored feha.the court made no express finding of any special circumstance to justify its denial of fees under that statute.instead,it relied on chavez modest recovery and the sparse evidence he presented at trial regarding damages to justify its denial of fees under section.the court noted its decision was guided by the holding in steele,supra,th,d,where the court discretion to deny fees was upheld in a case where the verdict was twice the amount of the instant one.steele is not persuasive.
in steele,the plaintiff sued her employer and two individuals in superior court for pregnancy discrimination under feha.defendants made an offer to compromise under section of,which the plaintiff rejected.plaintiff was awarded just over by a jury.the trial court denied plaintiff request for attorney fees and costs.plaintiff appealed,arguing the court erred in denying her fees under section she was entitled to fees under feha and,under section,when her fees and costs were added to the jury award,the judgment exceeded defendant statutory offer.steele,supra,th at,d.the court of appeal disagreed.it determined that the trial court had discretion to deny fees and costs because nonsuit was granted in favor of the individual defendants,and because the amount of the judgment against the employe
