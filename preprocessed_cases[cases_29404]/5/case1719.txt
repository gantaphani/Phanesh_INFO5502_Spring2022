frances diaz petitions this court for relief from an order of the superior court finding her in contempt for refusing to comply with an order to answer questions at a judgment debtor examination.the underlying judgment awarded attorney fees against both diaz and her sheila moore,jointly and severally,after a special motion to strike moore complaint was granted.we hold that the statute code civ,does not authorize an award of attorney fees against plaintiff counsel because the underlying judgment is therefore void as to diaz,we grant the petition.
background 
this case has a long appellate history.below is a summary of the portions of that history that are relevant to analysis of the present proceeding.
diaz represented sheila moore in a lawsuit filed against barry kaufman in april.moore voluntarily dismissed the suit without prejudice but,one year later,succeeded in vacating the dismissal and having the action reinstated.
kaufman filed a special motion to strike moore complaint pursuant to section and also filed a motion for sanctions.the two motions were calendared to be heard on september.
with respect to the special motion to strike,kaufman notice of motion sought an award of attorney fees against both moore and diaz,and that request was repeated in the conclusion of kaufman memorandum of points and authorities in support of the motion.the request for an award against diaz,however,appeared nowhere else in kaufman motion papers.the body of kaufman memorandum of points and authorities contained no argument or authority in support of an award against diaz.diaz opposition failed to argue against such an award,presumably because kaufman had presented no arguments for diaz to rebut.
kaufman motion for sanctions shed further light on his special motion to strike.kaufman notice of motion under the statute stated that the request for an award of attorney fees against both moore and diaz was based on section and the court inherent discretionary powers.but in his request for sanctions,kaufman expressly conceded that california courts have no inherent power to impose monetary sanctions against parties or their counsel.thus,when read together,the sanctions motion and the special motion to strike amounted to a concession by kaufman that,apart from his request for sanctions which was based on other statutes but not on the statute,kaufman only basis for an award of attorney fees against diaz was the statute.but,again,kaufman memorandum of points and authorities in support of the special motion to strike never argued that the statute authorized such an award.
at the september hearing,the court indicated that it intended to grant the motion and to deny the request for sanctions.having been apprised of the court tentative ruling,kaufman counsel explained that one of the reasons he filed a separate request for sanctions was that there might not be authority for an award of attorney fees against diaz under the statute.the court responded by reiterating its intention to deny the request for sanctions.the court did not state an opinion concerning the propriety of an award against diaz under the statute,but nothing the court said at the hearing gave any indication that the court intended to grant such an award.and given kaufman counsel express acknowledgement that the propriety of such an award was questionable,counsel failure to include any arguments on the issue in his memorandum of points and authorities was tantamount to a waiver of the issue.
although the court never orally indicated any intention to depart from its tentative ruling,the court signed an order prepared by kaufman counsel that said the special motion to strike was granted in its entirely sic,which could be interpreted as granting the request for an award of fees against diaz.the court also signed a judgment prepared by kaufman counsel that awarded attorney fees and costs against moore and diaz jointly and severally,leaving the amounts blank.moore appealed from the judgment,but diaz did not 
on october,kaufman filed a memorandum of costs,which stated that the amount of attorney fees sought was to be determined.on november,kaufman filed a motion for attorney fees.the notice of motion sought an award of attorney fees and costs against moore alone.it did not mention diaz.the notice of motion asserted that the statute empowers the c ourt to assess attorneys fees and costs against moore and explained that t he purpose of this m otion is to fix the amount that moore should pay for attorney fees so that the september,j udgment can be amended accordingly.in seeking an amendment of the judgment to reflect the amount that moore should pay,the motion gave no indication that it sought determination of an amount for which moore and diaz would be jointly and severally liable.on the contrary,to anyone familiar with the terms of the judgment,kaufman motion appeared to seek an amendment of the judgment that would hold moore alone liable for the attorney fees that kaufman sought.
when the motion was heard on november,the court ruled that the motion should be granted but that kaufman could recover only fees incurred in connection with the special motion to strike,not fees for the entire litigation.the court directed kaufman to refile the motion in a manner that properly segregated the fees connected to the special motion to strike.
on december,kaufman refiled the motion as directed.again,his notice of motion sought an award of attorney fees against moore alone.it did not mention diaz.again,the notice of motion stated that the statute empowers the c ourt to assess attorneys fees and costs against moore and explained that t he purpose of this m otion is to fix the amount that moore should pay for such attorney fees and for costs,so that the september,j udgment can be amended accordingly.again,to anyone familiar with the terms of the judgment,the motion seemed to seek an amendment of the judgment to hold moore alone liable for the attorney fees and costs that kaufman sought.
the trial court heard the refiled motion on january.the court granted the motion,awarding in attorney fees and in costs.at the hearing,neither the court nor counsel for any party said anything about an award of fees against diaz.that was understandable,because kaufman motion had sought an award against moore alone.the court minute order,however,did not expressly provide that the award was against moore did not specify whether the award was against moore,diaz,or both.the minute order did,however,command kaufman counsel to prepare a formal order for the court signature.
kaufman counsel never complied with that order.had counsel done so,the signed order might have clarified whether the award was against moore,diaz,or both.in the absence of such a clarification,it is doubtful that diaz could have appealed from the trial court january,minute order.kaufman motion sought only an award against moore.the court minute order granted the motion.nothing in the motion,the transcript of the hearing on the motion,or the minute order granting the motion gives any indication that the award was against diaz.had diaz attempted to appeal from the minute order,her appeal might well have been dismissed for lack of minute order on its face appeared to have nothing to do with her.
correspondence in the superior court file shows that,after the january hearing,diaz promptly asked opposing counsel for a draft of the proposed order so that she could register any objections she might have.no draft was forthcoming.the correspondence also shows that diaz simultaneously sought opposing counsel stipulation to correct a clerical error in the september judgment,so that the judgment would state that the attorney fees award was against moore alone.kaufman counsel refused to stipulate.
at some point after the january hearing,the judgment was amended by interlineation to reflect the amounts of the fees and costs awarded.nothing in the superior court file indicates the date on which any interlineation took place 
in its current form,the judgment reflects that certain amounts were written in but later struck out and replaced by others.the record contains a declaration from diaz to which is attached a copy of the judgment as she found it when she examined the court file in june,six months after kaufman motion for attorney fees was granted.that copy of the judgment reflects an attorney fees award of and a costs award of that was struck out and replaced by a costs award of.at some later time,the judgment was further modified the costs award was struck out and replaced by an award of,which was also struck out and replaced by an award in the identical amount of.the figure of,the sum of the fee award of and the costs award of was further interlineated,followed by the word total.again,nothing in the record indicates the date on which any of these interlineations or occurred or who made them.it appears that no party was given notice when they took place.
on june,the trial court heard diaz ex parte application for an order correcting the clerical error in the judgment nunc pro tunc.the court minute order and the transcript of the hearing reflect that the court denied the application for two reasons the court was concerned that it lacked jurisdiction to modify the judgment because moore appeal from the judgment was still pending,and the court did not wish to address the issue on an ex parte basis.at the hearing,the court expressed no view as to whether diaz was right that the judgment contained a clerical error.in fact,the court stated i have to tell you i do have a whole lot of recollection,adding later that i do know that there is a clerical error here.i truly do,but i am not going to deal with this as an ex parte application.
diaz then filed a noticed motion seeking the same relief.kaufman opposed on the grounds that there was no clerical error,the motion was really a disguised and untimely motion for reconsideration of the september,judgment,and the court lacked jurisdiction to modify the judgment while moore appeal from the judgment was pending.
the trial court heard diaz motion on january,fully one year after it had granted kaufman motion for attorney fees,fifteen months after it had granted kaufman motion and entered judgment,and six months after admitting that the court already did not have a whole lot of recollection of the pertinent facts.the court denied diaz motion on all three grounds urged by kaufman.the record contains no reporter transcript of the hearing,so we have no way of knowing what parts of the record the trial court reviewed,or what information or argument the court relied on in reaching its decision.it is worth noting,however,that in opposition to the motion kaufman provided the court with his notice of motion and motion under the statute and with the conclusion of his memorandum of points and authorities,but he omitted the remainder of his memorandum of points and authorities.kaufman selective presentation of the record thus could well have led the court to believe that kaufman had argued in support of the propriety of an attorney fees award against diaz under the statute,when in fact he had done no such thing.
in april,kaufman filed a motion for an award of attorney fees incurred in his attempts to enforce the judgment,and for accrued interest,against diaz.the trial court granted the motion on june,ordering diaz to pay to kaufman for his attorney fees and costs incurred in his efforts to enforce the original award of just over.
in september,diaz appeared in the trial court for a judgment debtor examination concerning the september,judgment.she stated her name and then declared that the september judgment was void because the trial court never had jurisdiction to enter an award against her.she refused to answer any questions about her private life or pocketbook.the trial court commissioner murray gross heard and rejected diaz arguments and ordered her to answer the questions about her financial affairs.she objected again.the court then found that she knew there was a judgment and that there was no stay,and the court again ordered diaz to answer the questions.diaz refused,and the judgment debtor examination was terminated.
in december,kaufman applied for an order to show cause re contempt based on diaz refusal to answer questions at her judgment debtor examination.on january,diaz filed opposition to kaufman application.
following a hearing held on february,the trial court john shepard wiley,who also presided over all subsequent hearings signed an order to show cause directing diaz to appear on april later continued to may to explain why she should not be adjudged in contempt of court and punished accordingly for willfully disobeying the court september,order to answer questions at her judgment debtor examination.
in march,diaz filed a special motion to strike the order to show cause pursuant to section,contending that it was in substance and effect a against her and that kaufman had filed the application for the order to deter her exercise of her constitutional right to petition the courts for relief.kaufman opposed the motion,arguing that the statute applies to lawsuits and causes of action,not to an application for an order to show cause or to the order itself.
at the beginning of the may,hearing on the order to show cause,the trial court noted the two items then pending,the contempt and diaz special motion to strike,and told the parties they would proceed first with the contempt trial,beginning with the case in chief,after which diaz would have an opportunity to the witnesses and present evidence of her own.only after the trial on the contempt would the court address diaz special motion to strike.in response,diaz explained that she had expected her motion to be heard first and that,in the event of an adverse ruling,she would file an appeal from the order denying her special motion to strike,which would automatically stay the contempt proceedings.
the court did not comment on the special motion to strike but offered diaz a recess so she could call her lawyer.diaz explained that she did not have a lawyer on standby and again insisted that her motion be heard first.following a brief recess during which diaz confirmed that her lawyer was not available that day,diaz informed the court that during the recess she had filed a notice of appeal from the trial court implicit denial of her motion.the not ruled on her motion or even expressed a tentative that diaz was pursuing a tactic of delay,and by her conduct had waived her right to counsel.
the court then conducted the evidentiary phase of the contempt trial and heard argument from the parties.diaz defended on the ground that the underlying judgment against her is void and that a void judgment is subject to collateral attack in a contempt proceeding under people gonzalez cal th hereafter gonzalez.having heard the evidence and argument,the court found that there has been proof beyond a reasonable doubt that diaz knew of the court order and had the physical ability to comply and that she willfully did disobey that court order to disclose her finances i would impose criminal sanctions depending on diaz willingness now to submit to another judgment exam in which she answered these questions.the court granted diaz request to confer with counsel before stating whether she would answer the questions.
next,the court turned to diaz special motion to strike the order to show cause and denied it on the ground that it was not a valid use of the motion the special motion to strike is not designed to shield a party from enforcing a court order.to give diaz an opportunity to seek writ review of the contempt finding,the court then continued the proceedings to june and later to august.the court also certified for interlocutory review diaz argument under gonzalez,supra.see.
following the august hearing,at which diaz informed the court she would not respond to the judgment debtor questions,the trial court signed and entered a formal order finding diaz in contempt of court and sentencing her to jail until she agreed to answer all relevant questions about her financial affairs.she was ordered to surrender on september.on september,diaz asked us for an emergency stay of all proceedings pending the outcome of the appeal she filed during the recess in the may hearing.we issued
