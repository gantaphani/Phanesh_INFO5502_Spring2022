facts and procedural history 
the port of savannah is the container port in the united states and the largest operation in north america.it is a gateway to and from the atlantic ocean and serves as a major distribution hub to and from a of the population.misener was contracted by the georgia ports authority to demolish a dock and build a new dock at the port.as part of this project,misener subcontracted norfolk to dredge parts of the savannah river in the port.norfolk drafted a dredging contract that was subsequently signed by misener.the contract did not contain a provision.and,most importantly,it did not contain a provision providing for attorneys fees.
norfolk started the dredging work on march,and completed it within the time specified by the contract.the area in which norfolk was dredging was close to two temporary mooring dolphins on july,these mooring dolphins pulled partially from the riverbed,causing the vessel the steven n to release from its secured position.misener blamed norfolk dredging for the failure and brought suit in the southern district of georgia for negligence,breach of the dredging contract,and breach of warranty.
misener complaint stated that the lawsuit was filed pursuant to the district court maritime jurisdiction.norfolk answered misener complaint and counterclaimed for payment for the dredging work,interest,and attorneys fees pursuant to the gppa.in pleading its counterclaim norfolk stated that the district court had jurisdiction,but did not explicitly state the basis for jurisdiction 
upon further investigation into the failure of the mooring dolphins,misener determined that norfolk was not responsible.misener filed a voluntary dismissal of its claim against norfolk on october.norfolk moved for summary judgment on its claim for payment,interest,and attorneys fees on november.
on january,the district court entered summary judgment for norfolk,granting norfolk attorneys fees pursuant to the gppa,and reserving ruling on the amount of attorneys fees to be awarded.the summary judgment order held that this court precedent allowed state laws dealing with attorneys fees to supplement maritime law the district court judge ruled that there is not an established federal rule regarding attorneys fees in maritime cases,and attorneys fees is not the type of issue that requires a uniform national rule.thus,the recovery of attorneys fees under the gppa was not inconsistent with maritime law,and the gppa should supplement maritime law.the district court judge passed away prior to issuing a ruling setting the amount of attorneys fees.
a new district court judge was subsequently assigned to the case.in determining the amount of attorneys fees norfolk was entitled to recover,the new judge found that the gppa conflicted with a general principle of maritime law,that each party bears its own attorneys fees.the district court entered an order denying norfolk attorneys fees under the gppa.norfolk appeals this order

we review the district court application of maritime law de novo.all underwriters weisberg,cir citation omitted.
iii.discussion 
norfolk presents several arguments all aimed at recovery of attorneys fees pursuant to the gppa.first,norfolk argues that this case arises under diversity jurisdiction and georgia law,the gppa,should apply.the dredging contract at issue,however,makes this case one of maritime jurisdiction and thus the district court properly applied substantive maritime law.second,norfolk contends that our precedent supports the application of the gppa to dredging cases.this argument is based on a misinterpretation of our precedent and has no merit.third,norfolk argues that the gppa can supplement substantive maritime law because the bar against shifting attorneys fees is not a characteristic feature of maritime law and the gppa will not contravene the uniformity interests of maritime law.we find the rule that each party generally bears its own attorneys fees is a characteristic feature of maritime law.the gppa would directly contravene this established rule of maritime law.further,a clearly established exception exists wherein norfolk was free to contract for the indemnification of attorneys fees.norfolk chose not to include such a provision in the contract and we will not give norfolk a second bite at the apple by way of the gppa.
substantive maritime law controls this case 
the federal courts have primary jurisdiction of maritime issues to determine whether a contract falls within maritime jurisdiction we look to the,the nature and character of the contract the true criterion being the nature of the contract,as to whether it have reference to maritime service or maritime transactions.pac.hall.marine ry.shipbuilding.in hall brothers the supreme court held that an agreement to repair a ship,even though on a dry dock,was a maritime contract.id.at.at.in sum,we look to whether the substance of the contract at issue in the regard to the identity of the reasonably necessary to the conduct of maritime commerce.ambassador factors rhein,maas,und gmbh,cir footnote omitted.
the primary objective of the contract between norfolk and misener was dredging a navigable waterway in a port that services international and national commerce.there is no doubt that the work contracted for and performed by norfolk had a direct effect on maritime services and commerce.further,the supreme court has previously held that dredging is traditionally a maritime activity norfolk dredging contract,and the dispute arising therefrom,falls within the federal courts maritime jurisdiction 
with admiralty jurisdiction comes the application of substantive admiralty law.river transamerica delaval.drawn from state and federal sources,the general maritime law is an amalgam of traditional rules,modifications of those rules,and newly created rules.id.at.at footnote omitted.while congress is empowered to pass laws regarding maritime activities,a large part of the body of substantive maritime law has arisen from common law principles of the supreme court.wilburn boat fireman fund ins.and states can no more override such judicial rules validly fashioned than they can override acts of congress.id.
maritime law generally requires that each party bear its own attorneys fees 
the law in this circuit regarding attorneys fees in maritime disputes is clear the prevailing party in an admiralty case is not entitled to recover its attorneys fees as a matter of course.natco.moran towing of,cir citing noritake,hellenic champion,cir absent some statutory authorization,the prevailing party in an admiralty case is generally not entitled to an award for attorneys fees.see also coastal fuels.express shipping,cir a party is not entitled to attorney fees in an admiralty case unless fees are statutorily or contractually authorized.there are exceptions to the general rule precluding recovery of attorneys fees.see natco,at attorneys fees were properly awarded in a maritime case where a specific contractual provision was interpreted to provide the recovery of attorneys fees.attorneys fees will be awarded to the prevailing party in maritime cases if they are provided by the statute governing the claim,the nonprevailing party acted in bad faith in the course of the litigation,or there is a contract providing for the indemnification of attorneys fees.id.at.absent one of these exceptions,this court will not award the prevailing party attorneys fees 
norfolk asserts that the first exception applies because the gppa,a state statute,is the statute governing the claim.we find no merit to this interpretation.logic and a proper reading of case law demand limiting statutes governing the claim to federal statutes since the gppa is not a federal statute it does not fall within this exception.norfolk has not claimed that they are entitled to attorneys fees as a result of any bad faith on the part of misener,so we will not consider the second exception.
the dredging contract did not contain a provision providing for the indemnification of attorneys fees.norfolk was a sophisticated party who was,or should have been,well aware of the law of our circuit concerning attorneys fees in maritime cases.furthermore,norfolk drafted the contract in conclusion,the general rule that each party bear its own attorneys fees in maritime contract disputes was well established at the time that norfolk entered into the contract.see natco,at.the contract exception was also well established.see id.norfolk was free to contract for the indemnification of attorneys fees,but chose not to.the gppa will not serve as an escape clause for norfolk when the legal framework for the shifting of attorneys fees was clear prior to norfolk drafting of the contract.
c.the gppa can not supplement substantive maritime law 
in the alternative,norfolk asks this court to incorporate the gppa into substantive maritime law.w hen neither statutory nor judicially created maritime principles provide an answer to a specific legal question,courts may apply state law provided that the application of state law does not frustrate national interests in having uniformity in admiralty law.coastal fuels,at.state law may be applied to issues of a maritime nature if there is not an act of congress that speaks to the issue the state law does not contravene a characteristic feature of the general maritime law and the state law does not interfere with the proper harmony and uniformity of maritime law.pac.jensen,superseded by statute,longshoremen and harbor workers compensation act,ch,stat.codified as amended at,et congress has not spoken directly on the subject of whether a prevailing party is or is not entitled to collect attorneys fees in a dredging dispute.that leaves us to determine whether the shifting of attorneys fees is either a characteristic feature of admiralty or a doctrine whose uniform application is necessary to maintain the proper harmony of maritime law.am.dredging miller,citing jensen,at.at.we conclude that the principle that each party bear its own attorneys fees is a characteristic feature of maritime law,and so we do not reach the question of proper harmony and uniformity.
d.the american rule is a characteristic feature of substantive maritime law 
the principle that each party should bear its own attorneys fees,the american rule has become firmly entrenched and consistently adhered to in american federal legal practice norfolk argues,as some courts have ruled,that the rule that each party bear its own attorneys fees is not a characteristic feature of maritime law,but is rather only a general federal procedural rule essentially,norfolk acknowledges that the american rule is the default rule of substantive maritime law,but argues that it does not rise to the level of a characteristic feature of maritime law.thus,according to the analysis in jensen,at.at,and am.dredging,at.at,the default american rule must give way to the gppa provided the gppa does not contravene the uniformity interests of maritime law.
in american dredging the court found that forum non conveniens was not a characteristic feature of maritime law because it neither originated in admiralty nor has exclusive application there.to the contrary,it is and has long been a doctrine of general application.at.at holding that a louisiana forum non conveniens rule could be used in a case that was applying substantive maritime law.similarly,the american rule did not originate in maritime law,it does not have exclusive application in maritime law,and it is a doctrine of general application in federal law.
the gppa is distinguishable from the supreme court holding in american dredging.first,the gppa is a substantive law as opposed to forum non conveniens,which is a procedural rule.second,in american dredging there was not a firmly established principle regarding forum non conveniens in maritime cases.in contrast,it has long been an established rule in maritime law that each party generally bears the costs of its own attorneys fees 
we hold that the consistent and continued application of the american rule to maritime disputes has established the american rule as a characteristic feature of substantive maritime law.although we recognize the position of those who argue that the american rule is not a characteristic feature of maritime law,the long developed precedent of this circuit and others can not be so easily set aside.therefore,the gppa entitlement to attorneys fees is in direct conflict with this principle of substantive maritime law.thus,the gppa can not be incorporated into substantive maritime law.
iv.conclusion 
we find that the dredging contract between norfolk and misener is governed by substantive maritime law.further,the rule that each party bear its own attorneys fees is a characteristic feature of substantive maritime law.norfolk freely drafted the contract but chose not to contract out of this general rule.we will not allow norfolk to alter the terms of its contract through the retroactive injection of a state law that contravenes a principle of substantive maritime law.we affirm the order of the district court denying norfolk request for attorneys fees.
black,circuit judge,specially concurring 
while i concur in the result,i write separately because i would analyze differently the issue of whether the gppa can supplement admiralty law.i would hold application of the gppa would disrupt the proper harmony and uniformity of admiralty law,and thus i would not reach the issue of whether the american rule is a characteristic feature of admiralty law.
in american dredging,the court found a state law rejecting forum non conveniens did not disrupt the uniformity of maritime law because the doctrine is procedural rather than substantive,and it is most unlikely to produce uniform results.at.at.the american dredging court also found forum non conveniens would not disrupt the uniformity of admiralty law because it would have little effect on parties conduct both inside and outside the courtroom.id.at.at 
unlike forum non conveniens,the american rule is a substantive law that yields consistent and predictable results moreover,attorneys fees can be a substantial portion of a party recovery and thus could influence secondary behavior,such as a decision of where to sue.other courts that have considered the application of state statutes providing for attorneys fees in maritime cases have also concluded uniformity is an important interest.see sosebee rath,cir texas a m research found.magna,cir garan,aivik.although i concur the gppa can not supplement admiralty law in this case,i would conclude its application would disrupt the proper harmony and uniformity of admiralty law.
