procedural history 
kirby first amended complaint 
we begin by setting forth the allegations in the operative complaint.in august,kirby filed an amended complaint that alleged six causes of action against immoos,and a seventh that named doe defendants but omitted immoos as a party.
the first cause of action alleged that immoos engaged in enumerated instances of unlawful and unfair business practices in violation of the unfair competition law as set forth in business and professions code section et 
the second cause of action alleged that immoos failed to pay kirby all wages at each pay period and at kirby discharge,as required by labor code sections and 
the third cause of action alleged that immoos failed to pay overtime compensation,as required by sections and industrial wage commission order order 
the fourth cause of action alleged that immoos secretly paid kirby wages less than that required by statute,regulation,and contract,a violation of section 
the fifth cause of action alleged that immoos failed to provide accurate itemized wage statements to kirby,as required by section 
the sixth cause of action alleged that immoos failed to provide kirby with rest periods as required by order 
the seventh cause of action alleged that doe defendants violated section by entering into contracts with immoos while knowing that the contracts did not provide sufficient funds to allow immoos to comply with all applicable labor and wage laws.kirby later amended this cause of action to identify defendants shea homes,hilbert homes,meritage homes of california,and horton.
kirby subsequently settled with shea homes,hilbert homes,meritage homes of california,and horton,in agreements not made part of the court record.
in november,kirby moved for certification of class action.the motion was denied in january.
in february,kirby dismissed with prejudice his complaint as to all causes of action and all parties.
award of attorney fees to immoos 
in april,immoos moved to recover attorney fees from kirby pursuant to section kirby opposed the motion arguing,in part,that the unilateral provision in favor of plaintiffs provided by section barred an award of fees to immoos.
in june,the trial court awarded immoos attorney fees for its defense of the first,sixth and seventh causes of action.in granting attorney fees for a portion of immoos defense against the unfair competition claim,the court explained that the first cause of action also incorporated allegations of failure to provide rest periods sixth cause of action and for the parallel allegations from the seventh cause of action,pursuant to section.
the trial court explained its award of fees to immoos for the sixth cause of action as follows the sixth cause of action is not subject to section,but only to section.no showing has been made that plaintiffs complied with the private attorney general requirements.further,it is apparent from the express language of section,that only section can defeat a prevailing party employer entitlement to attorneys fees under that statute,under the rule of statutory construction,expressio unius est exclusio expression of one thing is the exclusion of another.as only section is named as an exception to,no other labor code sections may be implied to defeat a prevailing party employer entitlement to attorneys fees under that section.
the trial court granted immoos fees for the seventh cause of action,explaining defendant immoos was united in interest with the doe defendant in the seventh cause of action.however,immoos defended that cause of action alone,until the does were added by amendment after the filing of the first amended complaint.further,although kirby asserts they fully recovered damages by way of settlement with the doe defendants,they only settled with four of the defendants,and continued to prosecute the seventh cause of action.thus,immoos is entitled to the attorneys fees spent in defending this cause of action.
in addition to the fees allowed for defense against the complaint,the trial court awarded immoos fees for bringing the motion for attorney fees.altogether,attorney fees were awarded to immoos in the amount of.
kirby filed a notice of appeal on june.a formal order was subsequently entered on july,
issues on appeal 
kirby contends the trial court erred in awarding attorney fees to immoos because section prevents a prevailing defendant from recovering fees in any case involving a claim for unpaid minimum or overtime wages,kirby claim for unpaid wages in the sixth cause of action was subject to section unilateral provision in favor of plaintiffs,immoos can not recover attorney fees for the seventh cause of action,to which it was not a party,a prevailing defendant may not recover attorney fees for defense against alleged violations of the unfair competition law,even if attorney fees are recoverable by a defendant who prevails against allegations of unpaid wages,immoos defense of the sixth cause of action was duplicative of work on other causes of action subject to unilateral provisions.immoos requests that we award it attorney fees on appeal.
we shall conclude that the trial court did not err in awarding fees to immoos for the sixth cause of action.however,the court erred in awarding attorney fees for defense against claimed violations of section as set forth in the first and seventh causes of action.accordingly,we remand the case for determination of reasonable attorney fees for immoos defense against the sixth cause of action.in doing so,we decline to award fees on appeal to immoos.
discussion 
ilabor code sections and 
kirby contends the trial court erred in awarding any attorney fees to immoos because some of the causes of action were subject to the unilateral provision in favor of plaintiffs provided by section kirby points out that section includes an express exception to its bilateral provision,which states this section does not apply to any action for which attorney fees are recoverable under section.italics added arguing that an action refers to an entire case,kirby concludes that the inclusion of causes of action subject to section bars immoos recovery of any attorney fees in this case.we disagree.
we review questions of law without deference to the trial court ruling.burden snowden cal th.the determination of the applicable labor code section governing a claimant rights and obligations regarding an award of attorney fees involves settled principles of statutory construction these are questions of law subject to our independent review.earley superior court th,earley.
resolution of this issue requires us to ascertain the meaning of the second paragraph in section,where it creates an exception to bilateral attorney fee awards for actions governed by section.in approaching questions of statutory interpretation,we follow the california supreme court admonition that t he rules governing statutory construction are well settled.we begin with the fundamental premise that the objective of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.kimmel goland cal d,california teachers san diego community college dist.cal d.in determining intent,we look first to the language of the statute,giving effect to its plain meaning.kimmel,supra,cal d at,citing tiernan trustees of cal.state university colleges cal d,california teachers,supra,cal d at.although we may properly rely on extrinsic aids,we should first turn to the words of the statute to determine the intent of the legislature.california teachers,supra,cal d at.where the words of the statute are clear,we may not add to or alter them to accomplish a purpose that does not appear on the face of the statute or from its legislative history.ibid.burden snowden,supra,cal th at.
when considering the interplay between potentially overlapping statutory provisions,we remain mindful that it is a matter of the proper interpretation of both sections so as to harmonize their provisions.earley,supra,th at.it is a cardinal rule of statutory construction that statutes relating to the same subject matter are to be read together and reconciled whenever possible to avoid nullification of one statute by another.davis ford motor credit th,quoting brown west covina toyota th.thus,we strive for a reasonable statutory construction that avoids creating conflicts among labor code sections.
generally,a party may recover attorney fees only when a statute or agreement of the parties provides for fee shifting.santisas goodin cal th.section provides for fee shifting in favor of the party that prevails on a claim for unpaid wages and specified benefits.as we have already noted,section provides in any action brought for the nonpayment of wages,fringe benefits,or health and welfare or pension fund contributions,the court shall award reasonable attorney fees and costs to the prevailing party if any party to the action requests attorney fees and costs upon the initiation of the action this section does not apply to any action for which attorney fees are recoverable under section.
the second paragraph of section was added by the legislature in to codify the holding of earley,supra,th.as the legislature declared,the amendments to section of the labor code made by section of this act do not constitute a change in,but are declaratory of,the existing law,and these amendments are intended to reflect the holding of the court of appeal in earley superior court th.stats,ch.
earley involved a class action by employees of washington mutual bank to recover unpaid overtime wages from their employer.earley,supra,th at.as part of the class certification process,the trial court required the named plaintiffs to mail to absent class members a notice allowing them to opt out of the class action.ibid.the named plaintiffs sought appellate writ relief,contending that the trial court erred in requiring the notice to advise absent class members that they might be liable for attorney fees if the employer were to prevail.id.at.plaintiffs argued that section bilateral provision did not apply because the class action was governed by section provision for attorney fees to prevailing plaintiffs.earley,supra,at.
the earley court surveyed the legislative history of section in order to conclude that the legislature did not regard the general provisions of section as applicable to overtime claims.if we were to hold otherwise,we would,by such conclusion,create the very type of statutory conflict which we are enjoined to avoid.stop youth addiction,lucky stores,cal th,there is a strong presumption against the implied repeal of one statute by another with apparently conflicting language and the courts are bound,if possible,to maintain the integrity of both statutes if the two may stand together.earley,supra,th at.
the goal of harmonization of the potentially conflicting labor code sections led the earley court to conclude that t he only reasonable interpretation which would avoid nullification of section would be one which bars employers from relying on section to recover fees in any action for minimum wages or overtime compensation.section would still be available for an action brought to recover nonpayment of contractually or wages,fringe benefits,or health and welfare or pension fund contributions.such a harmonization of these two sections is fully justified.an employee right to wages and overtime compensation clearly have different sources.wages above the minimum wage are a matter of private contract between the employer and employee.entitlement to overtime compensation,on the other hand,is mandated by statute and is based on an important public policy.earley,supra,th at,footnote omitted.the earley court granted the writ because section disallows successful defendants from recovering attorney fees from plaintiffs who seek to recover unpaid overtime wages.earley,supra,at.
kirby relies on earley to argue that a claim for unpaid minimum wages invokes the unilateral provision of section in order to defeat a defendant right to recover attorney fees for any other cause of if unrelated and subject to a bilateral statute.in so arguing,kirby points out the ambiguity arising out of the legislature use of the term action in the exception to section provision.see providing exception for any action for which attorney fees are recoverable under section,italics added.
as kirby notes,action can mean a single cause of action,or it can refer to the entirety of a case.see,palmer agee d,noting that an action is sometimes used to denote the suit in which the action is enforced,italics added nassif municipal court d,the courts have generally used the word action to refer to the proceeding or suit and not to the cause of action,italics added.
in support of the argument,kirby relies on two bill analyses prepared while the amendment to section was pending in.both committee reports implicitly equate actions for unpaid minimum and overtime wages with the cases themselves.in relevant part,the report prepared by the assembly committee on labor and employment explained the purpose of the amendment as follows clarifies that section,which provides for an award of attorneys fees for an employee in cases involving failure to pay minimum wage and overtime wages,is separate from,and not controlled by section,which provides for prevailing party attorneys fees in other wage cases.assem.com.on labor employment,on assem.bill reg.sess,italics added.
similarly,the senate judiciary committee report described the aim of the legislation,in relevant part,as clarify that section,which provides for an award of attorney fees for an employee in cases involving failure to pay minimum wage and overtime wages,is separate from,and not controlled by section,which provides for prevailing party attorney fees in other wage cases.judiciary,on assem.bill reg.sess.as amended,italics changed.
although kirby advances a plausible reading of the legislative history,we reject it in favor of construing the section exception as applying only to causes of action for unpaid minimum and overtime wages.accord earley,supra,th at.to adopt kirby statutory construction would allow the exception of section unilateral fee shifting to eviscerate the rule of section.
we harmonize sections and by holding that section applies to causes of action alleging nonpayment of wages,fringe benefits,or contributions to health,welfare and pension funds.if,in the same case,a plaintiff adds a cause of action for nonpayment of minimum wages or overtime,a defendant can not recover attorney fees for work in defending against the minimum wage or overtime claims.nonetheless,the addition of a claim for unpaid minimum wages or overtime does not preclude recovery by a prevailing defendant for a cause of action unrelated to the minimum wage or overtime claim so long as a statute or contract provides for fee shifting in favor of the defendant.
as the legislative counsel digest for assembly bill indicates,the legislature intended section to remain the exception to the bilateral rule set forth in section under existing law,the prevailing party,with certain exceptions,is entitled to an award of attorney fees in an action brought for nonpayment of wages,fringe benefits,or health and welfare or pension fund contributions.this bill would add an express exception for employee actions to recover underpayment of the minimum wage or specified overtime wages,in which a prevailing employee but not the employer is expressly authorized to recover attorney fees.legis.counsel,assem.bill reg.sess.summary,italics added.
kirby approach conflicts with the legislative intent underlying the second paragraph of section in that it would allow plaintiffs to insulate claims against employers from otherwise applicable bilateral provisions by simply adding a cause of action for unpaid minimum or overtime wages.such a statutory construction would be absurd and contrary to the clear intent to create a specific exception to rule.legis.counsel,assem.bill,supra,at.thus,we conclude that the inclusion of a claim subject to section does not preclude attorney fees to be awarded to a prevailing defendant for unrelated claims subject to the bilateral provision of section.
the trial court did not err in ruling that section did not impose a complete bar on immoos recovery of attorney fees in this case.
sixth cause of to provide rest periods 
kirby next contends that the trial court erred in awarding attorney fees for defense against the sixth cause of action,which alleged immoos violated order by failing to provide a second rest period during an workday.characterizing the cause of action as one for unpaid minimum wages,kirby contends the unilateral provision of section bars the award of fees to immoos.we are not persuaded.
kirby sixth cause of action alleged that kirby was owed an additional one hour of wages per day per missed rest period.as a claim seeking additional wages,the sixth cause of action was subject to section provision of attorney fees for any action brought for the nonpayment of wages,fringe benefits,or health and welfare or pension fund contributions italics added.
kirby does not dispute that the sixth cause of action sought payment of wages.instead,kirby asserts that any unpaid wage is necessarily less than statutorily mandated wages and therefore subject to section.not so.
kirby claim was not based on a failure to pay the statutory minimum wage for hours he actually worked.instead,the cause of action was one for failure to provide rest periods.if his claim had succeeded,kirby would have been entitled to an additional wage at the employee rate of compensation.see fn,ante.the employee rate of compensation refers to the contractual rate of compensation,not the legal minimum wage.consequently,the claim is not one premised on failure to pay the minimum wage.
kirby cited case of murphy kenneth cole productions,cal th murphy does not compel a different conclusion.in murphy,the california supreme court considered whether the additional hour of compensation provided by section for a missed rest break constituted a penalty or wage for purposes of determining whether plaintiffs claims were timely filed.id.at.if the remedy were a penalty,a statute of limitations applied and plaintiffs claim would have been untimely.id.at.however,if the additional hour of pay constituted a wage,the plaintiffs could proceed with their action.ibid.
the murphy court concluded that the extra hour of pay provided for a missed rest was more akin to a wage than a penalty.murphy,supra,cal th at.although murphy did not involve the question of entitlement to attorney fees,the decision offers us guidance where it notes that the remedy is one for a wage or premium pay.id.at,italics added.in describing the remedy of the remedial hour of compensation as premium pay,the murphy court indicated that the wage is a sum over and above the regular pay.ibid.as an addition to regular pay,the remedy is not one for failure to pay the minimum wage.accordingly,murphy does not assist kirby attempt to establish that section applies to the sixth cause of action.
the trial court did not err in awarding attorney fees to immoos for its defense against the sixth cause of action.
seventh cause of code section 
kirby argues that the trial court erred in awarding attorney fees to immoos for its defense against the seventh cause of action,which alleged a violation of section for entry into contracts by parties who knew that the contracts failed to provide sufficient funds for payment of all required wages.kirby argues that this cause of action is subject to a unilateral provision in favor of plaintiffs.
the original complaint alleged,as its seventh cause of action,that doe defendants unlawfully entered into contracts with immoos while knowing that the contracts did not provide sufficient funds to allow immoos to comply with all applicable labor and wage laws.kirby first amended complaint realleged the same claim against the doe defendants in its seventh cause of action.kirby subsequently amended the seventh cause of action to identify shea homes,hilbert homes,meritage homes of california,and horton,as defendants.immoos was never named as a defendant in this cause of action.
after kirby dismissed the complaint in its entirety,immoos sought attorney fees including those incurred for defense of the seventh cause of action.kirby countered that immoos was not named as one of the defendants for this cause of action,and that the cause of action was based on a statute with a unilateral provision in favor of plaintiffs.the trial court granted attorney fees to immoos including fees for the seventh cause of action.
we do not have to decide if immoos could recover fees even though it was not named as a party,because section is a unilateral statute that disallows an award of fees to defendants.by providing that a n employee may recover costs and reasonable attorney fees upon prevailing,section does not authorize fee shifting in favor of employers.s tatutes expressly permitting fees for only a particular prevailing party have been interpreted as denying fees for the other party,even if it prevailed.earley,supra,th at,quoting brown west covina toyota,supra,th.section does not authorize immoos to recover fees.
the trial court erred in awarding attorney fees to immoos for its defense against the seventh cause of action.
first cause of practices act bus,et.
kirby asserts that i t is settled law that the unfair practices act does not provide attorney fees for a defendant.thus,kirby contends the trial court erred in awarding attorney fees to immoos for defending against the unfair competition law cause of action.immoos counters that the trial court properly awarded fees for defending against alleged specific instances of unlawful conduct subject to fee shifting in favor of prevailing defendants.immoos further argues that the trial court properly excluded fees for claims subject to in favor of plaintiffs only.
for reasons that follow,we conclude that the trial court erred in awarding fees for the first cause of action.
kirby first cause of action alleged that immoos violated the unfair practices act when it engaged in unlawful and unfair business practices including,but not limited to,violations of sections wages at discharge,payment of wages,overtime pay,secret payment of lower wages,itemization of wage statements,and workday,and failure to maintain accurate records,and tools,safety equipment,and use of employee vehicle,contracting with entity known to have insufficient funds to pay employees,order,and workers compensation rules.
kirby alleged that these enumerated practices serve as unlawful predicate acts result ing in economic harm and injury in fact to kirby for purposes of business and professions code after kirby dismissed the case,the trial court granted fees for part of immoos defense against the unfair competition claim insofar as this cause of action also incorporated allegations of failure to provide rest periods also set forth in the sixth cause of action and for the parallel allegations from the seventh cause of action,pursuant to section.
it is settled that the unfair practices act bus,et does not provide for an award of attorney fees to any party.communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,walker countrywide home loans th.we do not have to decide whether attorney fees can be recovered by dissecting an unfair practices act lawsuit into its constituent statutory violations,because immoos has shown no entitlement to fees on that theory.
as we explained in part iiib,ante,immoos was not entitled to recover for its defense against alleged violations of section which prohibits entry into contracts lacking funds sufficient to comply with all wage and labor laws.even though
