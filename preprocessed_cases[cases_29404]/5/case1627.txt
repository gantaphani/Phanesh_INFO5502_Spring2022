under the american rule,followed in california,each party to a lawsuit ordinarily must pay his or her own attorney fees.citations.musaelian adams cal th.an exception to this rule exists where the parties have agreed to the measure and mode of compensation of attorneys.for example,a contract may contain a provision providing for attorney fees in enforcing the contract.where a contract contains such a provision,the court must fix reasonable attorney fees as an element of the costs of the lawsuit,subd.a,subd.a a.in this instance,the written guarantees signed by the defendants provided for reasonable attorneys fees,including attorneys fees and related costs of enforcement of a judgment.scc acquisitions,central pacific bank,supra.
in chelios kaye d,the plaintiffs appealed an order denying postjudgment costs consisting principally of postjudgment attorney fees.id.at.plaintiffs argued they were entitled to attorney fees as costs in enforcing their judgment because the contract underlying the action contained a unilateral attorney fee provision,and civil code section makes such provisions reciprocal.chelios kaye,supra,d at.the appellate court found civil code section inapplicable,reasoning that attorney fees incurred in enforcing a judgment were not incurred in enforcing the terms of the contract.id.at.the court concluded that w hen,as here,a lawsuit on a contractual claim has been reduced to a final,nonappealable judgment,all of the prior contractual rights are merged into and extinguished by the monetary judgment,and thereafter the prevailing party has only those rights as are set forth in the judgment itself.citations.id.at.
in response to the chelios decision,the legislature amended section of the enforcement of judgments law et in.chinese yellow pages chinese overseas marketing service th,see stats,ch.the amendment did not abrogate chelios holding that contractual rights merge into the judgment.rather,the amendment provided for the inclusion of postjudgment attorney fees as costs when the contract provided for attorney fees and attorney fees were initially included in the judgment.attorney fees incurred in enforcing a judgment are included as costs collectible under the enforcement of judgments law if the underlying judgment includes an award of attorney fees to the judgment creditor pursuant to subparagraph a of paragraph of subdivision a of section.see,subd.a a attorney fees allowable as cost if authorized by contract.because the judgment in this matter originally awarded attorney fees as costs based on the terms of the underlying contract,was entitled to reasonable attorney fees in enforcing its judgment.the attorney fee provisions in the written guaranties do not,however,trump provisions of the enforcement of judgments law et.
there does not appear to be any dispute concerning right to timely seek reasonable attorney fees as costs in efforts to enforce its judgment.that having been said,any motion for such costs must be timely made.to be timely,the motion must be made before the underlying judgment has been fully satisfied and within two years of the fees being incurred,subd.a lucky united properties investment,lee th,carnes zamani cir,subd.b memorandum of costs.t he statutory purpose of requiring that the motion for enforcement costs be brought before the judgment is satisfied in full,subd.a is to avoid a situation where a judgment debtor has paid off the entirety of what he believes to be his obligation in the entire case,only to be confronted later with a motion for yet more fees.citation.lucky united properties investment,lee,supra,th at.that is the present situation.
attorney fees not awarded by the court are not part of the judgment.
before addressing the issue of when a judgment paid with a cashier check is satisfied,we address another of arguments.claims defendants did not fully satisfy the judgment because the amount tendered,almost million,did not include the substantial postjudgment attorney fees incurred in attempting to enforce its judgment by bringing an action to set aside the alleged fraudulent liens on elieff real estate holdings,although such fees were never awarded by a court.those attorney fees,therefore,were not part of the judgment.the amount required to satisfy a money judgment is the total amount of the judgment as entered or renewed with the following additions and subtractions a the addition of costs added to the judgment pursuant to section.b the addition of interest added to the judgment as it accrues pursuant to sections to,inclusive.c the subtraction of the amount of any partial satisfactions of the judgment.d the subtraction of the amount of any portion of the judgment that is no longer enforceable.with exceptions not applicable here,costs including postjudgment attorney fees do not become part of the judgment until such time as the court files an order allowing the costs,subd.a.attorney fees claimed,but not awarded by the court,are not part of section calculation.therefore,contention that defendants payment which in fact exceeded the amount of the judgment plus accrued interest did not fully satisfy the judgment is without merit.
relies on cases for the proposition that payment of an amount excluding attorney fees incurred in enforcing the judgment does not fully satisfy the judgment.the decisions cited by not relevant to our analysis because they do not involve analogous controlling statutes.as stated above,at least two sections of the code of civil procedure expressly require a judgment creditor application for postjudgment attorney fees as costs must be made before the judgment is fully satisfied,subd.b,subd.a.when the enforcement of judgments law refers to a judgment having been fully satisfied,it means an outstanding judgment,not what the judgment would be if postjudgment costs were to be added thereto.no other interpretation is possible.if a judgment were not fully satisfied because of the existence of as yet unawarded attorney fees,the phrase before the judgment is fully satisfied would serve no purpose.in re greg cal th,court must avoid construing statute in such a way that statutory language is rendered surplusage see,subd.a postjudgment costs become part of the judgment when ordered by the court.therefore,the only reasonable interpretation is that statutory references to the judgment having been fully satisfied,action are to the judgment including accrued interest as it existed at the time payment was made.
also relies on heimstadt tapered parts,d,claiming it is directly on point in arguing california public policy requires a judgment debtor to pay the judgment as well as reasonably incurred attorney fees in an effort to collect on the judgment.heimstadt is not directly on point,and in fact,is inapposite.
in heimstadt,the parties entered into a contract that provided should an attorney be employed to procure payment hereof by suit or otherwise,the undersigned,jointly and severally,agree to pay a reasonable sum as attorney fees therefor.heimstadt tapered parts,supra,d at.prior to the plaintiff filing a lawsuit,the defendant offered payment of an amount that did not include the plaintiff claimed was the reasonable amount of attorney fees incurred as a result of defendant breach of the contract.id.at.it was in this context that the court stated,it can not be seriously maintained that an obligation which includes a liability for attorney fees can be satisfied by the payment of the sum exclusive of attorney fees.id.at.the court continued when the obligation to pay such a charge has accrued it becomes a part of the principal obligation.a creditor to whom payment is due has no duty to accept less than the entire debt.ibid.we agree.
heimstadt involved an offer of payment on an unadjudicated debt.in the present case,we are concerned with a judgment.that is a distinction with a difference,for a judgment is satisfied when the total amount of the judgment plus accrued interest has been paid.see,subd.a costs including postjudgment attorney fees do not become part of the judgment until such time as the court files an order allowing the costs.thus,while an unadjudicated debt may not be satisfied by payment of an amount exclusive of agreed to reasonable attorney fees heimstadt tapered part,supra,d at,a judgment debtor who pays the judgment creditor in an amount that includes the full measure of the judgment plus accrued interest,has fully satisfied the judgment.
because the cashier check was sufficient to cover the outstanding judgment and accrued interest,it fully satisfied the judgment.the question is when did it satisfy the judgment contends the judgment is not satisfied until the bank honored the check,which occurred on june,five days after brought its motion for postjudgment attorney fees as costs.defendants argue the judgment was fully satisfied when accepted the cashier check,days before filed its motion.
the motion for postjudgment attorney fees was untimely.
argues the statutory scheme states a judgment paid with a check is not satisfied until the check is cashed.it relies on section.subdivision c of section provides where a money judgment is satisfied by payment to the judgment creditor by check or other form of noncash payment that is to be honored upon presentation by the judgment creditor for payment,the obligation of the judgment creditor to give or file an acknowledgment of satisfaction of judgment arises only when the check or other form of noncash payment has actually been honored upon presentation for payment.this subdivision addresses the timing of a judgment creditor
