plaintiff appeals alleging the district court committed numerous errors.defendants alleging the district court erred in granting summary judgment for plaintiff on the breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claims.the parties agree oklahoma law applies to this diversity case.we have jurisdiction under.although our rationale differs from that of the district court,we affirm.
in april,plaintiff entered an agency agreement agreement with defendants.pursuant to this business arrangement,plaintiff receives a commission for selling policies on behalf of defendants.plaintiff is entitled to a bonus commission each year,calculated by the overall loss ratio on policies he sells.specifically,the agreement bonus provision states plaintiff may earn bonus commission each calendar year he qualif ies.defendants will pay plaintiff a percentage of the total premium defendants receive on plaintiff agent policies and limited by plaintiff loss ratio for a three year period.the agreement further defines loss ratio as the premium defendants earned on plaintiff agent policies divided into the losses charged to plaintiff agent policies.losses charged is defined as the amount defendants have paid on claims and the amount defendants increase or decrease reserves.emphasis added.
in,defendants settled a lawsuit with an insured for.the suit derived from defendants alleged handling of a claim made on an insurance policy plaintiff sold.defendants subsequently included the settlement payment as a portion of the losses charged to plaintiff agent policies.because defendants attributed this payment as a claim paid on one of plaintiff policies,plaintiff did not qualify for a bonus commission in.plaintiff filed suit alleging the settlement payment was not a claim under the agreement and should not have been included in his loss ratio.
prior to trial,plaintiff and defendants filed for summary judgment.in granting plaintiff motion in part and denying defendants motion,the district court held defendants were in breach of contract because the application of the settlement payment to plaintiff loss ratio violated oklahoma law.the district court relied on oklahoma case law precluding insured parties from including agents in suits against insurance companies for handling of policy claims.thus,the district court concluded that attributing such settlement payments to agents through contract violated oklahoma public policy.the district court further charged defendants with constructive knowledge of this oklahoma law and,therefore,ruled defendants violated the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.despite plaintiff request for punitive damages,the district court limited plaintiff recovery on the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim to contract damages.
during trial on plaintiff fraud and breach of fiduciary duty claims,the district court excluded evidence of defendants business practices outside oklahoma.the district court also granted defendants motion to exclude plaintiff expert witness.at the close of each party,defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law.the district court orally granted defendants motion,holding plaintiff did not establish the necessary elements for fraud by clear and convincing evidence,and defendants did not owe plaintiff a fiduciary duty.thus,the district court refused to submit the fraud and breach of fiduciary claims to the jury.
under the breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claims,the district court awarded plaintiff in contract damages.this amount was based upon plaintiff projected bonus commission without the application of defendants settlement payment as a claim paid on one of plaintiff policies.the district court also awarded plaintiff in attorney fees.because attorney fees are not permitted for tort actions under oklahoma law,the district court apportioned plaintiff attorney fees between his tort and contract claims,and limited the award to work performed before the district court granted summary judgment on plaintiff breach of contract claim.both parties appeal.for clarity sake,we first address defendants.
on,defendants argue the district court erred in granting summary judgment for plaintiff on his claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.defendants assert the agreement does not violate oklahoma law and contend the agreement unambiguously includes settlement payments as claims charged to an agent policy.thus,defendants request that we reverse the district court and enter summary judgment for defendants on the claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
relying on timmons royal globe ins,and its progeny,the district court ruled defendants practice of attributing settlement payments to agents loss ratios violated oklahoma law.in timmons,the oklahoma supreme court held that a agent was not a party to the contract between an insured and an insurance company.id.at.as such,the insured could not hold a agent liable for an insurance company breach of its duty of good faith and fair dealing.id.because timmons held this duty owed to the insured was,id.at,the district court reasoned defendants could not achieve a similar delegation of this duty by applying a settlement payment to a agent bonus commission.the district court held defendants interpretation of the agreement was contrary to oklahoma public policy and a breach of contract.our review of the district court determination is de novo.see scrivner sonat exploration,cir.
defendants argue timmons only precluded a cause of action by an insured against a agent for breach of the implied good faith duty owed by the insurance company to the insured under an insurance contract.defendants believe timmons does not speak to how insurance companies and their agents contract amongst themselves.defendants argument relies on general principles of freedom of contract.under oklahoma law,a bsent illegality,the parties are free to bargain as they see fit,and the court may neither make a new contract,or rewrite the existing contract.oxley atlantic.accordingly,courts power to void a contract as being in contravention of public policy is delicate and undefined and may only be exercised in cases free from doubt.in re kaufman,see also shepard farmers ins,courts will exercise their power to nullify contracts made in contravention of public policy only rarely,with great caution and in cases that are free from doubt.
because we hold the agreement unambiguously excludes tort payments from the calculation of plaintiff loss ratio,we need not speculate whether the oklahoma supreme court would find the agreement at issue violative of oklahoma public policy.see medina city and county of denver,cir we are free to affirm a district court decision on any grounds for which there is a record sufficient to permit conclusions of law,even grounds not relied upon by the district court.citation omitted.in addition,because defendants are in breach of contract,we do not decide whether they also breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing owed to plaintiff.
when interpreting a contract,oklahoma law requires courts to consider the entire agreement so as to give effect to every part,if reasonably practicable.scrivner,at quoting.stat.determination of whether a contract is ambiguous and interpretation of an unambiguous contract are questions of law for the court.otis elevator midland red oak realty,cir.an ambiguous contract,however,is a mixed question of law and fact and should be decided by the jury.id.in determining whether a contract is ambiguous,courts must construe the words as they are understood in their ordinary and popular sense,rather than according to their strict legal meaning,unless used by the parties in a technical sense,or unless special meaning is given to them by usage.gamble,simmons kerr mcgee,cir quoting.stat.courts will not create an ambiguity by using a forced or strained construction,by taking a provision out of context,or by narrowly focusing on the provision.corr.union city public schools.the ultimate goal of contract interpretation is to determine and give effect to the intent of the parties.otis elevator,at.
the issue in the instant case is very simple what does the word claim mean the agreement states that losses charged to plaintiff in calculating his bonus are based on the amount defendants have paid on claims.the issue here is whether the word claim includes payments,tort payments,to an insured arising outside of the compensation guaranteed under an insurance policy.the oxford english dictionary defines claim as 
a.a demand for something as due an assertion of a right to something to lay claim to to assert one right to,claim.
spec.in insurance,an application for the compensation guaranteed by an insurance company,esp.for loss of or damage to property,insured.

defendants argue that definition.above is the ordinary and popular meaning of claim and that a tort action against an insurance company is merely based on an insured demand for something as due.thus,the argument goes,the ordinary and popular definition of claim includes settlements,and defendants are not in breach of contract for classifying the settlement payment as a claim.in support of their argument,defendants correctly point out that the agreement involves an agency contract,not an insurance policy.this fact,however,does not require the court to completely ignore the obvious insurance context gathered from a examination of the agreement.pitco prod.chaparral energy.
the agreement is steeped in language pertinent to the insurance industry.for example,the agreement bonus provision,where the disputed term claim is also located,refers to p remium s received on p olicies sold by plaintiff.certainly,premium and policy have different meanings when used outside the insurance context.the contractual intent behind each term is obvious,however,when determined from the entire agreement.corr,at.similarly,a examination of the agreement indicates the parties had the insurance meaning of claim in mind,rather than the broader version espoused by defendants.see dillon family youth,dep t of human,cir under oklahoma law,h owever broad may be the terms of a contract,it extends only to those things concerning which it appears that the parties intended to contract.quoting.stat.we will not permit ambiguities to be created by taking contract provisions out of context.fdic.american casualty,cir.if defendants intended a meaning other than the quite common and unambiguous definition applied in the insurance context,they should have made it clear at the time of contract.a party to a contract can not fail to disclose a meaning he attaches to a term which is not in accordance with the accepted meaning in the industry when he is aware or should be aware that the other party is using the term in its accepted sense.cmi gurries,cir.
having determined the parties intended claim to mean the compensation guaranteed by an insurance company,we hold the agreement is unambiguous and defendants are in breach of contract for treating their settlement payment as a loss on the policy sold by plaintiff.an action alleging lies in tort,not in the compensation guaranteed under contract,and involves the unjustified withholding of payment due under a policy.haberman v.the hartford ins.group,cir citation omitted.thus,the claim relevant to the agreement here was the payment due under the policy sold by plaintiff,not the tort action resulting from defendants unjustified withholding of that payment.id.because the settlement payment was,therefore,unrelated to a claim under the policy,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment on plaintiff action for breach of contract.
we now turn to the five main issues plaintiff has raised on appeal.first,he argues the district court erred by limiting recovery from the breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing to contract damages.plaintiff asserts the issue of punitive damages should have been submitted to the jury.second,plaintiff argues the district court erred in granting judgment as a matter of law for defendants on the fraud claim.plaintiff contends this claim should have been submitted to the jury.third,plaintiff argues the district court erred in granting summary judgment on the breach of fiduciary duty claim.plaintiff asserts that whether a fiduciary duty exists between contracting parties is a jury question.fourth,plaintiff argues the district court should not have apportioned attorney fees between the contract and tort claims because the claims were so interrelated.fifth,plaintiff argues the district court erred in denying injunctive and declaratory relief to preclude defendants from continuing their practice of applying tort payments to agents loss ratios.
we first address whether the district court erred in ruling that oklahoma law precluded plaintiff from recovering punitive damages for defendants breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing we review the district court determination of state law and the propriety of punitive damages de novo.see fdic hamilton,cir.
under oklahoma law,e very contract contains an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.wathor mutual assurance adm rs.in cases involving ordinary commercial contracts,a breach of that duty merely results in damages for breach of contract,not independent tort liability.id.in the proper case,however,punitive damages may be sought.conover aetna health care,cir emphasis added.the proper case requires that a special relationship exist between the parties.see wathor,at.oklahoma courts have found such a special relationship in only very limited circumstances,most notably between an insurer and insured.id.at see also,allison unum life ins,cir there is no dispute that the oklahoma badfaith law is directed toward the insurance industry.the special relationship in insurance contracts stems from the nature of insurance,the unequal bargaining power between the insurer and insured,and the potential for an insurer to unscrupulously exert that power at a time when the insured is particularly vulnerable.wathor,at see also christian american home assurance,noting the special relationship in insurance contracts exists because the insured is not entering the contract to obtain commercial advantage but to protect from risk of accidental losses.
in contrast,the agreement between plaintiff and defendants is a private,commercial agency contract.the agreement lacks the nature and unequal bargaining positions present in insurance contracts.moreover,the agreement is based upon each party attempt to obtain a commercial advantage and is dissimilar to situations where the insured will be disabled and in strait financial circumstances and,therefore,particularly vulnerable to oppressive tactics on the part of an economically powerful entity.id.because no such special relationship exists between plaintiff and defendants,any breach by defendants,merely results in damages for breach of contract,not independent tort liability.wathor,at see also roberts wells fargo ag credit,cir finding no special relationship,and therefore,no tort liability,in commercial lending setting hinson cameron,declining to impose tort liability for termination of employee.accordingly,the district court properly limited recovery on the breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing claim to contract damages.
