defendant and appellant lisa howard appeals following the denial of her motion to vacate entry of default and a default judgment against her on the complaint filed by plaintiffs and respondents barbara hearn and thierry didelot plaintiffs.she contends the trial court abused its discretion by determining that she was properly served by substituted service and declining to find that entry of default was the result of mistake,surprise,inadvertence or excusable neglect.finding no basis to conclude the trial court abused its discretion,we affirm,though we modify the judgment to omit in attorney fees because that amount was not specified in the complaint.
factual and procedural background 
on may,plaintiffs filed a complaint for damages against appellant,sunitha anjilvel and stewart richlin,alleging a claim for legal malpractice arising from their negligent representation of plaintiffs in a prior action which precluded plaintiffs from collecting a judgment and setting aside a fraudulent conveyance.
the following day,may,plaintiffs counsel sent a notice and acknowledgement of receipt to all three defendants which enclosed the summons and complaint and,in order to avoid service of process,requested in a cover letter that each of them sign and return the notice and acknowledgement in a provided envelope.defendants anjilvel and richlin contacted plaintiffs counsel in response to the request plaintiffs ultimately dismissed anjilvel and entered into a nominal settlement with richlin.approximately one month later,appellant sent plaintiffs counsel a letter in which she requested a settlement of the action comprised of plaintiffs dismissal.she indicated that she would revoke the settlement offer if forced to file a responsive pleading.the balance of the letter addressed the merits of the action.plaintiffs counsel immediately responded,refuting appellant assertions and rejecting the proposed settlement.
having received no response from appellant,on july,plaintiffs counsel sent a letter to appellant,which stated in part please let me know if you will voluntarily appear by the filing of whatever pleading you wish or if i should just send out a process server.after appellant neither responded by letter nor filed a responsive pleading,plaintiffs arranged for service of process at lincoln boulevard,suite in santa monica,which was the address on appellant letterhead and the one that appears for her on the california state bar web site.
according to a declaration of due diligence submitted by registered california process server isaac villarreal,he made three attempts to personally serve appellant on july,july and august.during the first attempt,villarreal learned that the address was a post office box rental store.during each attempt,the store clerk declined to confirm that appellant rented a post office box there.during the third attempt,villarreal left the the summons and the store clerk,identified as john doe caucasian male lbs wearing baseball cap.also on august,villarreal mailed copies of the documents to appellant at the same address.according to a proof of service of summons filed on august,villarreal averred that he effected substituted service by these means.
appellant did not file a responsive pleading and,on september,plaintiffs served on her by mail a request for entry of default.the trial court filed the request and entered default on september.in between those dates,on september,appellant wrote a letter to plaintiffs counsel contending that the august,proof of service was false and fraudulent,and denying that she had been served in any authorized fashion.plaintiffs counsel responded via on september,indicating that substituted serviced as authorized by code of civil procedure section was effectuated on august,and service was deemed complete days thereafter.counsel also advised that a request to enter default had been submitted but not yet entered.
appellant did nothing until she appeared in court on november,at the default hearing.after some colloquy between the trial court and appellant,plaintiffs counsel provided appellant with a copy of the complaint.thereafter,plaintiffs filed a second proof of service indicating that appellant had been personally served with the complaint on november.the trial court then reset the default hearing.appellant and plaintiffs counsel engaged in another series of correspondence regarding both service and the merits of the lawsuit.
appellant again appeared in court at the continued default hearing on december.she participated in the hearing for some portion of time,but was ultimately escorted from counsel table to the jury box by one or two bailiffs.the trial court heard testimony from plaintiffs concerning the facts of the underlying litigation and from their new attorney who opined both that appellant failed to comply with the applicable standard of care and that plaintiffs would have prevailed in the underlying action had appellant representation met the standard of care.plaintiffs presented documentary evidence supporting their damages request,comprised of for the original uncollected judgment,in interest and for attorney fees paid to appellant.at the conclusion of the hearing,the trial court entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs and against appellant in the amount of plus costs in the amount of.
on february,appellant moved to vacate the default and the default judgment pursuant to section.appellant asserted that default was improperly entered because she was not properly served until november and that the december default judgment was therefore prematurely and fraudulently entered.concurrently with the motion to vacate,appellant submitted a proposed motion to strike and proposed demurrer.plaintiffs opposed the motion to vacate on the grounds that the motion was untimely the motion did not include the exhibits and declarations referenced therein and there was no surprise,mistake or excusable neglect warranting relief.
following a hearing on april,the trial court denied the motion to vacate.this appeal followed.
discussion 
appellant contends that in denying her motion to set aside the entry of default and the default judgment,the trial court abused its discretion because she adequately demonstrated that substituted service of the summons and complaint did not comply with the statutory requirements.she further contends that she showed the default judgment was the result of mistake,surprise,inadvertence or excusable neglect in that it was entered just days after she was personally served with the complaint in court.finally,she contends the default judgment was improperly entered because no amount of damages was specified in the complaint.we find no merit to any of these contentions.
i.the trial court properly exercised its discretion in denying appellant motion to vacate entry of default and the default judgment pursuant to code of civil procedure section.
appellant sought relief under two separate provisions of section,a statute which provides a procedural basis for obtaining relief from a default judgment according to specified grounds.first,she contended she was improperly served with the summons and complaint.as explained in ellard conway th,d a default judgment entered against a defendant who was not served with a summons in the manner prescribed by statute is void.citation.citation.under section,subdivision d,the court may set aside a default judgment which is valid on its face,but void,as a matter of law,due to improper service.citations.accord,sakaguchi sakaguchi th,d.where the question on appeal is whether the entry of default and the default judgment were void for lack of proper service of process,we review the trial court determination de novo.cruz fagor america,th,d.
alternatively,appellant contended she was entitled to relief pursuant to section,subdivision b,which states that a court may,upon any terms as may be just,relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment,dismissal,order,or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect.appellant correctly observes that a trial court order denying relief under section,subdivision b is scrutinized more carefully than an order permitting trial on the merits.arnaiz,county of san joaquin th,d.because the law favors disposing of cases on their merits,any doubts in applying section must be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief from default citations.rappleyea campbell cal th,d.but that said,a motion to vacate a default and set aside judgment is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court,and in the absence of a clear showing of abuse the exercise of that discretion will not be disturbed on appeal.citations.moreover,all presumptions will be made in favor of the correctness of the order,and the burden of showing abuse is on the appellant.citation.lint chisholm d.accord,in re marriage of king th,d the standard for appellate review of an order denying a motion to set aside under section is quite limited.a ruling on such a motion rests within the sound discretion of the trial court,and will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of a clear showing of abuse of discretion,resulting in injury sufficiently grave as to amount to a manifest miscarriage of justice.
in connection with our review,we note that it is the appellant burden to furnish a record adequate for review.see srithong total investment th,fn,d it was of course the duty of srithong,as the appellant,to furnish an adequate record for review accord,premier medical management systems,california ins.guarantee th,d in re marriage of wilcox th,d.specifically,although the cornerstone of several of appellant arguments involves what occurred at a november,hearing,appellant has not furnished a reporter transcript of those proceedings.we must therefore presume that what occurred at that hearing supports the judgment,denham superior court cal d,a judgment or order of the lower court is presumed correct.all intendments and presumptions are indulged to support it on matters as to which the record is silent,and error must be affirmatively shown estrada ramirez th,d,fn.it is the burden of appellant to provide an accurate record on appeal to demonstrate error.failure to do so precludes an adequate review and results in affirmance of the trial court determination.
substituted service was properly effected.
appellant first contends that the default judgment is void because she was not properly served with the summons and complaint in proceeding with the default,the trial court rejected this argument and relied on the proof of service in the file.according to the proof of service,process server villarreal served appellant by substituted service.section,subdivisions a and b authorize substitute service of process in lieu of personal delivery.statutes governing substitute service shall be liberally construed to effectuate service and uphold jurisdiction if actual notice has been received by the defendant citation.citation.ellard conway,supra,th at,d.
applicable here,section,subdivision b provides if a copy of the summons and complaint can not with reasonable diligence be personally delivered to the person to be served,as specified in section,or,a summons may be served by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint at the person dwelling house,usual place of abode,usual place of business,or usual mailing address other than a united states postal service post office box,in the presence of a competent member of the household or a person apparently in charge of his or her office,place of business,or usual mailing address other than a united states postal service post office box,at least years of age,who shall be informed of the contents thereof,and by thereafter mailing a copy of the summons and of the complaint by mail,postage prepaid to the person to be served at the place where a copy of the summons and complaint were left.service of a summons in this manner is deemed complete on the day after the mailing.
the proof of service here satisfied these requirements.villarreal attempted to personally serve appellant at the business address on her letterhead and reported by the california state bar by appearing at that address on three separate occasions on three different days,espindola nunez d.ordinarily,two or three attempts at personal service at a proper place should fully satisfy the requirement of reasonable diligence and allow substituted service to be made.the business address was not an office,but rather,a private post office box rental store.during the third attempt,villarreal left the documents with the mail store clerk.he thereafter mailed the documents to the same address by first class,postage prepaid mail.these actions mirror those taken in ellard conway,supra,th,d.there,substituted service was held proper where the process server attempted to serve the defendants at their last known residence,discovered they had moved,learned from the united states postal service that their forwarding address was a private post office and ultimately left a copy of the summons and complaint with private post office store manager and mailed the documents to the same place.id.at,d.
importantly,the ellard court rejected the same arguments raised by appellant here appellant contends that the mail store clerk was neither apparently in charge of the post office box store,nor closely connected to her.in concluding that service on the post office store manager was sufficient,the court commented true,section comment states there must be a close connection.citation.however,section,subdivision b judicial council comment states the summons and complaint must be left in the presence of a person apparently in charge of the business.citation.the postal annex manager was such a person.ellard conway,supra,th at,fn,d.our reliance on ellard is not affected by the fact that the mail store clerk served here may not have been a manager and declined to confirm or deny whether appellant rented a post office box at that location.as aptly stated in bein group,th,d,a defendant will not be permitted to defeat service by rendering physical service impossible.citation.the evident purpose of code of civil procedure section is to permit service to be completed upon a good faith attempt at physical service on a responsible person citation.service must be made upon a person whose relationship with the person to be served makes it more likely than not that they will deliver process to the named party.citation.the purpose of section was achieved by service on the clerk at the post office box store where appellant rented a post office box.
the ellard court further rejected the argument that substituted service at a private post office box was improper.relying on a federal case addressing the issue,the court reasoned had the l egislature intended that service be effective only at mailing addresses other than any post office box,it would have omitted the descriptive language united states postal service preceding post office box.citation.we find this reasoning persuasive.the plain language of section,subdivision b authorizes substitute service at a defendant usual mailing address,which includes a post office box.citation.ellard conway,supra,th at,d.the court distinguished bonita packing,which held that substituted service at a private post office box was improper,because it did so on the ground that a better method could have been employed by serving the defendant attorney in accordance with federal law.ellard conway,supra,at,d.here,as in ellard,there was no indication that a better method of service was available to plaintiffs.
ellard did not address appellant final challenge to the method of service.although the proof of service submitted by villarreal properly indicated that it was executed under penalty of perjury under the laws of the state of california,the declaration of due diligence attached to the proof of service provided it was executed under penalty of perjury under the laws of the state of arizona.we agree with appellant that this declaration was not in compliance with the requirements of section which provides,in relevant part whenever,under any law of this state or under any rule,regulation,order or requirement made pursuant to the law of this state,any matter is required or permitted to
