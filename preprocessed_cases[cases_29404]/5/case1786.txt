introduction 
plaintiff randy nein was employed by defendants hostpro,and interland,collectively,defendant as a salesperson between october and december.in december,plaintiff approached at t corporation at t and suggested that defendant provide services to some of at t business customers.such a transaction was still being negotiated when defendant terminated plaintiff in december,and it was consummated the following month.
plaintiff seeks through the present action to recover commissions he claims are due him in connection with the at t transaction.the trial court granted summary judgment for defendant,concluding that the entire action is barred because plaintiff was not a licensed business opportunity broker.additionally,the court found that plaintiff termination cut off his right to any additional commissions under the plain language of plaintiff written employment agreement.
we do not agree with the trial court that plaintiff action is barred by his failure to procure a broker license.in this regard,we reject defendant claim that plaintiff is collaterally estopped by the court of appeal opinion in a related case from raising the broker license issue.salazar interland,th,d salazar.like the trial court,however,we conclude that under the plain language of the written employment agreement,plaintiff was not permitted to recover additional commissions after his termination.accordingly,we affirm the grant of summary judgment.
factual and procedural history 
plaintiff employment and the at t 
defendant hired plaintiff as a sales representative on october.on that date,the parties entered a written employment agreement,which provided among other things that plaintiff was responsible for sales plaintiff starting salary was per year,plus commissions of percent on all direct initial sales defendant will be eligible for commission pay as set forth in this document,so long as plaintiff remains employed with the company as a sales representative and the employment agreement may be amended only by a written agreement executed by each of the parties hereto.
in april,defendant promoted plaintiff to channel manager.the parties entered a new oral agreement that provided among other things that plaintiff salary was increased to per year,and plaintiff would receive commissions of of the up front costs revenues on all accounts brought in by plaintiff or through plaintiff contacts or efforts.
in december,plaintiff introduced himself to vincent salazar,then an agent for at t,at a networking event.subsequent to that introduction,salazar proposed to defendant and at t that defendant acquire all of at t small to clients.plaintiff was not involved in the nuts and bolt negotiations concerning defendant acquisition of at t clients,but he was responsible for procuring and advising hostpro of the potential to consummate a lucrative deal with at further,he did not at anytime solicit at t regarding the deal,but he was responsible for engineering the getting together of at t and hostpro which ultimately led to the acquisition of at t web hosting business by hostpro following months of extended negotiation by higher ups at hostpro.
defendant terminated plaintiff on december.subsequently,on january,defendant and at t executed an asset purchase agreement pursuant to which defendant purchased all of at t contractual rights relating to its small and customer accounts and the equipment used to service those customers.
after defendant and at t executed the asset purchase agreement,plaintiff sought compensation for his role in the transaction.defendant has never paid plaintiff any commission in connection with the at t transaction.
ii.the present action 
plaintiff filed the present action on january.the operative second amended complaint,filed december,asserts four causes of action breach of contract breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing violation of labor code sections and and unfair business practices in violation of business and professions code section.it alleges that plaintiff entered an employment contract with defendant in.the employment contract provided that plaintiff would market defendant services and would be compensated by a salary and commissions of percent.later,plaintiff was promoted to manager and his commissions were increased to percent.in this capacity,plaintiff initiated a deal with at t,valued at more than million,pursuant to which defendant acquired all of at t small to clients.however,approximately days before the at t deal closed,defendant summarily terminated plaintiff and withheld his commissions.
defendant moved for summary judgment.the trial court granted summary judgment on march,finding as follows 
the entire action is barred because plaintiff was not a licensed broker at the time of the at t transaction.under the plain language of business and professions code,section,the at t deal must be considered a business opportunity because it is indisputable that the sale of customers and assets constitutes a sale of at t business.thus,t he analysis is straightforward a license is required to solicit prospective sellers of business opportunities the at t deal was a business opportunity plaintiff solicited the at t deal plaintiff did not have a license.thus,plaintiff entire action for commission is barred under bus.and.the motion for summary judgment is granted on this basis.
there is a triable issue of fact as to whether plaintiff is entitled to a commission under the terms of his employment contract.defendant first argues that plaintiff employment agreement does not provide for plaintiff to receive any commission for the at t transaction.defendant argues that although plaintiff alleges that the employment agreement was modified to provide him with a commission on sales of new business brought in by him,no written agreement,modification,or addendum was ever executed.furthermore,defendant argues that the employment agreement by its terms provides that it may be amended or modified only by a writing signed by both parties.citations.plaintiff presents his declaration,in which he states the initial employment agreement was not amended,but that he entered into a new agreement when he was promoted to channel manager and that this agreement provided for a commission of plaintiff here argues that defendant has redacted information from relevant pay records that would show that he was paid a commission under the later agreement.there appears to be a triable issue of material fact as to whether plaintiff entered into a new oral agreement.however,as stated above,the motion is nevertheless granted because plaintiff did not possess a broker license.
plaintiff was not entitled to any further commissions after his employment was terminated.t he employment agreement clearly states that plaintiff will only be eligible for commission pay while he is employed as a sales representative.plaintiff has not provided any authority showing that where an employment agreement is clear that commission payments cease upon termination,an employee is nevertheless entitled to commissions for transactions that he might have initiated as an employee but which were consummated after his termination.
plaintiff claims are not barred by the statute of limitations.defendants argue that all of plaintiff causes of action accrued on january,the date on which the at t transaction closed plaintiff argues that his cause of action did not accrue until he received a letter from defendant counsel michael french on april,which constituted an anticipatory repudiation.citation.plaintiff argues that prior to that date,defendants had not given him any indication that he would not eventually receive a commission on the at t deal.defendants have not presented any evidence to the contrary.since the action was filed on january,it is timely.
second cause of action breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.defendants arguments as to this cause of action are substantially identical to their arguments as to the first cause of action.essentially,defendants argue that plaintiff did not have a contract entitling him to a commission,and that the cause of action is.the above discussion applies equally to these arguments.
third cause of action violation of the labor code.defendant arguments as to this cause of action are again substantially identical to those discussed above.defendant argues that although commissions are wages under the labor code,contractual terms authorizing the commissions must be established before the wages are due.defendant argues that the express terms of the contract prevent plaintiff from obtaining commissions after he was terminated.as discussed above,the court agrees.
fourth cause of action unfair business practices.where a ucl claim is derivative of another claim that fails as a matter of law,the ucl claim must similarly fail.citation.as discussed above,plaintiff first three causes of action fail as a matter of law.plaintiff also argues that defendants have not raised any credible challenge to plaintiff ucl claim that defendant practice of terminating its employees in order to avoid the payment of earned commission is a fraudulent business practice and thus prohibited by the ucl.citation.the court is unable to find any allegation in the second amended complaint that defendant had a practice of terminating its employees to avoid payment of commission.the pleadings serve as the outer measure of materiality in a summary judgment motion,and the motion may not be granted or denied on issues not raised by the pleadings.citation.
judgment was entered on june,and notice of entry of judgment was served on june.plaintiff timely appealed 
iii.the salazar litigation 
meanwhile,in a separate action,vincent salazar plaintiff contact at at t sued defendant for breach of contract and fraud on march.salazar alleged that he was an agent of at t and was authorized to market internet and services to small and businesses.in,he advised defendant,which also provided services to small and businesses,that at t no longer wished to provide these services.defendant expressed an interest in acquiring at t small and business clients.on february,salazar entered a written contract with defendant to market defendant services to small and business customers and to arrange the acquisition of at t small and business customers.defendant represented to salazar that he would receive a percent commission on all monthly recurring fees received by defendant up to,a percent commission on monthly recurring fees over,and a percent commission payment as a setup fee for each customer acquired due to his efforts.however,defendant subsequently refused to pay salazar the commissions allegedly due him.salazar,supra,th,d.
defendant moved for summary judgment,contending that salazar could not recover the claimed commissions because he did not have a broker license.on december,the trial court granted the motion.
salazar appealed the grant of summary judgment,contending that the trial court erred in finding that the transaction between at t and defendant constituted the purchase and sale of a business opportunity under section,subdivision a.specifically,salazar argued that because only a small portion of at t assets were sold,the sale did not constitute the sale of a business opportunity.salazar,supra,th at,d.on june,division two of this court disagreed and affirmed.it explained that although business opportunity under section includes the sale of an existing business enterprise,there is no requirement that the sale include every business in which a corporation is engaged.moreover,by using the term include the definition is not necessarily limited to the inclusions.people arnold th,d,citing flanagan flanagan cal th,d.the plain language of the statute,therefore,does not support salazar contention that nothing short of the transfer of all the stock or assets of at t,or of one of its subsidiaries or divisions,could constitute the sale of a business opportunity.salazar,at,d.
further,the court said,the transfer of a business opportunity as defined in section includes the transfer of those assets so essential that a business can not continue without them and the transfer of future patronage or customers.it found undisputed proof of those attributes in the transaction between at t and interland.salazar,supra,th at,d.the court concluded given that at t,interland and salazar all characterize the transaction as the transfer of a business and a business opportunity,it is immaterial that the transaction involved less than percent of at t total base of its small business customers,or that at t continued to provide services to large clients,or that at t continued to provide other types of services to the small and medium clients.at t sold and interland purchased the customer contracts,supporting equipment and pledge of nonsolicitation for six months that comprised at t business for small to clients.the undisputed evidence supports the conclusion that the transaction constituted the sale of a business opportunity.id.at,d.
finally,the court rejected salazar contention that he was not seeking a commission for the transaction between interland and at t but rather his share of the monthly fees paid by each customer as he is entitled to under his contract with interland.t he statute prohibits the collection of compensation for acting as an unlicensed business opportunity broker regardless of how that compensation is characterized.see also broker defined as one who for a compensation or in expectation of a compensation,regardless of the form or time of payment.salazar,supra,th at,d.
standard of review 
the standard of review for summary judgment is well established.a defendant may move for summary judgment if it is contended that the action has no merit code civ,subd.a.a defendant has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if that party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action,even if not separately pleaded,can not be established,or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.once the defendant has met that burden,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.code civ,subd.p.the motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.mcgarry sax th,d.
on appeal,we review the trial court decision to grant or deny the summary judgment motion de novo,on the basis of an examination of the evidence before the trial court and our independent determination of its effect as a matter of law.citations.we are not bound by the trial court stated reasons or rationale.instead,we review the summary judgment without deference to the trial court determination of questions of law.sangster paetkau th,d.
discussion 
i.there are triable issues of fact as to whether plaintiff is precluded from recovering a commission because he was not a licensed business opportunity broker 
defendant principal argument in support of summary judgment is that plaintiff is precluded from recovering a commission on the at t transaction because he was not a licensed business opportunity broker as defined by sections and.these sections provide that no person engaged in the business or acting in the capacity of a real estate or business opportunity broker may bring or maintain any action in the courts of this state for the collection of compensation for the performance of any of the acts mentioned in this article without alleging and proving that he or she was a duly licensed real estate or business opportunity broker at the time the alleged cause of action arose because it is undisputed that plaintiff was not a licensed broker at the time he allegedly participated in the at t transaction,defendant contends that he can not recover a commission for that participation.
plaintiff disagrees.he contends that he acted as a finder,not a broker sections and should not apply to employees acting within the scope of their employment the at t transaction was not the sale of a business opportunity within the meaning of the statute and plaintiff did not solicit prospective sellers or purchasers of a business opportunity within the meaning of sections and.
we begin by considering whether plaintiff is collaterally estopped by the court of appeal opinion in salazar from litigating whether the at t transaction constituted the sale of a business opportunity.we then consider on the merits whether sections and bar plaintiff recovery.
plaintiff is not collaterally estopped by the court of appeal opinion in salazar from litigating whether the at t transaction constituted the sale of a business opportunity 
defendant asserts that plaintiff is collaterally estopped by the court of appeal opinion in salazar from litigating whether the at t transaction constituted the sale of a business opportunity within the meaning of section.for the reasons that follow,we disagree.
issue preclusion by collateral estoppel prevents relitigation of issues argued and decided in prior proceedings.citation.castillo city of los angeles th,d see also bob baker enterprises,chrysler th,d.the doctrine rests upon the ground that the party to be affected,or some other with whom he is in privity,has litigated,or had an opportunity to litigate the same matter in a former action in a court of competent jurisdiction,and should not be permitted to litigate it again to the harassment and vexation of his opponent.public policy and the interest of litigants alike require that there be an end to litigation.panos great western packing cal d,see also citizens for open access.tide,seadrift th,d.rodgers sargent controls aerospace th,d rodgers.
traditionally,collateral estoppel has been found to bar relitigation of an issue decided at a previous proceeding if the issue necessarily decided at the previous proceeding is identical to the one which is sought to be relitigated the previous proceeding resulted in a final judgment on the merits and the party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted was a party or in privity with a party at the prior proceeding.citations.people carter cal th,d,see also lyons security pacific nat.bank th,d.in addition to these factors,the courts consider whether the party against whom the earlier decision is asserted had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue.roos red th,d.collateral estoppel will not be applied if injustice would result or if the public interest requires that relitigation not be foreclosed.consumers lobby against monopolies public utilities com.cal d.rodgers,supra,th at,d.
the concept of privity for the purposes of collateral estoppel refers to a mutual or successive relationship to the same rights of property,or to such an identification in interest of one person with another as to represent the same legal rights citations and,more recently,to a relationship between the party to be estopped and the unsuccessful party in the prior litigation which is sufficiently close so as to justify application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel.citations.citations.this requirement of identity of parties or privity is a requirement of due process of law.citation.citations.citizens for open access.tide,seadrift,supra,th,d see also dawson toledano th,d.rodgers,supra,th at,d.
we have no quarrel with the proposition that plaintiff and salazar had a common interest in establishing that the at t transaction was not the sale of a business opportunity.further,that common interest seems to have been represented adequately in the salazar case.however,c ollateral estoppel may be applied only if due process requirements are satisfied.citations.in the context of collateral estoppel,due process requires that the party to be estopped must have had an identity or community of interest with,and adequate representation by,the losing party in the first action as well as that the circumstances must have been such that the party to be estopped should reasonably have expected to be bound by the prior adjudication.sutton golden gate bridge,highway transportation dist.th,d see also george hillenbrand,insurance of north america th,d.the reasonable expectation requirement is satisfied if the party to be estopped had a proprietary interest in and control of the prior action,or if the unsuccessful party in the first action might fairly be treated as acting in a representative capacity for the party to be estopped.citations.furthermore,due process requires that the party to be estopped must have had a fair opportunity to pursue his claim the first time.citation.citation.old republic ins.superior court th,d.in deciding whether to apply collateral estoppel,the court must balance the rights of the party to be estopped against the need to minimize repetitive litigation and prevent inconsistent judgments.children hospital sedgwick th,d see also sutton golden gate bridge,highway transportation,supra,at,d.rodgers,supra,th at,d.
in rodgers,the court of appeal applied these principles to conclude that the plaintiff,who alleged that he had been exposed to asbestos in the course of his employment,was not collaterally estopped from litigating issues decided adversely to other workers in asbestos litigation against the same defendant.specifically,the court found that plaintiff was not bound by findings against workers in prior cases that defendant sargent was not the to other named defendants,even though those workers and the current plaintiff were represented by the same counsel.th at,d.the court explained appellant did not have any proprietary interest in the prior cases.while he had a theoretical interest in the resolution of the successor liability issue in the prior that an outcome favorable to the plaintiffs would have been binding upon had neither incentive to intervene in those actions nor reason to expect he would be bound by decisions in which he did not participate.old republic ins.superior court,supra,th,d lynch glass d.a nonparty should reasonably be expected to be bound if he had in reality contested the prior action even if he did not make a formal appearance,for example,by controlling it.citations.furthermore,privity appertains against one who did not actually appear in the prior action where the unsuccessful party in the first action might fairly be treated as acting in a representative capacity for a nonparty.citation.victa merle norman cosmetics,th,d.the plaintiffs in the prior cases did not act as appellant representatives,and appellant certainly had no control over or even impact upon the litigation that produced the decisions in favor of respondent.old republic ins.superior court,supra,at,d aronow lacroix d.although appellant,at least through his attorney,must have been aware of the prior litigation,he did not stand in a close relationship with the other two plaintiffs,had no control over the proceedings in the other cases,and can not be charged with notice that he avoided the prior proceedings at his peril.lynch glass,supra,at.rodgers,at,d.
we reach the same conclusion here.there is no evidence that plaintiff had a proprietary interest in the salazar litigation.while he may have had a theoretical interest in the resolution of common issues,he did not have an incentive to intervene in that action or a reason to expect that he would be bound by the decision there.there is no evidence that salazar acted as plaintiff representative or that plaintiff had any control over the salazar litigation.accordingly,plaintiff can not be bound by the decision in salazar.
b.there are triable issues regarding whether plaintiff was required to have a broker license to receive commissions 
as we have said,section provides that no person engaged in the business or acting in the capacity of a real estate broker may bring or maintain any action in the courts of this state for the collection of compensation for the performance of any of the acts mentioned in this article without alleging and proving that he or she was a duly licensed real estate broker at the time the alleged cause of action arose.pursuant to section,subdivision a,a real estate broker includes a person who s ells or offers to sell,buys or offers to buy,solicits prospective sellers or purchasers of,solicits or obtains listings of,or negotiates the purchase,sale or exchange of a business opportunity.
the salazar court concluded that salazar could not recover a commission as a matter of law because the at t transaction indisputably was the sale of a business opportunity.in other words,in determining whether sections and barred salazar recovery,the court focused on the nature of the transaction,rather than on salazar role in that transaction,salazar,supra,th at,d the trial court correctly found that the transaction was the sale of a business opportunity and that under business and professions code section,subdivision a,salazar was required to be licensed as a broker in order to recover compensation for arranging the sale or acquisition of this business.the trial court analysis in the present case was similar.according to the court,t he analysis is straightforward a license is required to solicit prospective sellers of business opportunities the at t deal was a business opportunity plaintiff solicited the at t deal plaintiff did not have a license.thus,plaintiff entire action for commission is barred under bus.and.
we read the statute somewhat differently.in our view,the relevant question is not whether the transaction met the statutory definition of a business opportunity,but rather whether plaintiff bought or offer ed to buy,solicit ed prospective sellers of,or negotiate d the purchase of a business opportunity.in other words,the focus of the inquiry should be plaintiff actions in attempting to create a business relationship,not the form that the business relationship ultimately took.under this analysis,plaintiff would come within the statute only if he solicited or negotiated the purchase or sale of a business opportunity.if,on the other hand,he solicited or negotiated a different kind of transaction,he would not come within the if the transaction ultimately was consummated as the purchase or sale of a business opportunity,rather than in the form plaintiff proposed.
in the present case,there was evidence that plaintiff solicited only the sale of defendant services to at t,not the purchase of customer accounts from at plaintiff testified that the initial concept he brought to at t was an outsourcing relationship whereby hostpro would provide web hosting services to at t small and medium business customers.the idea was for hostpro to manage these accounts for at t v ersus them managing it themselves and having all the overhead expenses.plaintiff testified that after he made the initial contact with vince salazar,he was involved in two meetings with at t personnel.during the first meeting,i just remember everyone sitting at our big conference table,and going around the room,introducing ourselves,and talking about hostpro services,and introducing them to the concept of,hey,we would love to be the company that manages and maintains and hosts and provides the service to your customers.o ur purpose was to build the relationship,create the excitement of allowing at t to see the vision of bringing their stuff to us versus them managing all of it themselves.the second meeting was pretty much the same as the first meeting,but they got more serious about talking about the acquisition of their servers over to our servers.and i think it was more of a technical meeting.and it was a meeting that allowed hostpro to understand what at t needs were.and we made it more clear what our goal was and what services and love and support we could offer them in the process.the discussion still was for an outsourcing relationship.
plaintiff also testified that in his dealings with at t,he never heard that at t was interested in selling its small and accounts 
q in the various meetings and teleconferences that you participated in between at t and hostpro,did the parties ever discuss at t putting their customer accounts up for bid 
a no,i what was surprising when i saw the headlines,i never heard that at all.
q did you ever hear that at t was interested in selling all those customer accounts 
a that was a surprise to me,as well.
q so that not something that was discussed in these meetings or conference calls 
a not in the preliminary meetings,no.
q not in any of the meetings,correct 
a not in any of the meetings i was in,no.
q t he concept was for at t to keep their customers and for hostpro 
a yeah,that was the understanding,sure.
plaintiff testimony,although disputed by defendant,is sufficient to create a triable issue as to whether plaintiff offer ed to buy,solicit ed prospective sellers of,or negiotiate d the purchase of a business opportunity within the meaning of section.on the basis of this testimony,a trier of fact reasonably could conclude that although the deal ultimately struck between defendant and at t was the purchase and sale of a business opportunity,that was not the deal plaintiff solicited or negotiated.accordingly,the trial court erred by concluding that plaintiff failure to procure a broker license barred his recovery as a matter of law.
ii.there are no triable issues of fact as to the first cause of action for breach of contract 
the first cause of action asserts breach of the employment agreement.defendant asserts that it is entitled to judgment on this cause of action as a matter of law because the employment agreement provided that plaintiff was entitled to a commission only while he was employed by the company,and it is undisputed that plaintiff employment was terminated before defendant and at t finalized the asset purchase agreement by its plain language,the agreement did not entitle plaintiff to a commission when the company acquired new customers through an asset purchase agreement,rather than through the direct sale of the company services and the breach of contract claim is barred by the statute of limitation.plaintiff disputes defendant interpretation of the employment agreement and asserts that his claim is not.
we begin by considering whether,as a matter of law,plaintiff claims are barred because the at t transaction on which he bases his claim for additional commissions was consummated after plaintiff termination.defendant relies in support of this contention on the language of the parties october,employment agreement.that agreement provided that plaintiff would receive a commission with respect to all direct initial sales for which employee is responsible.it further provided that plaintiff will be eligible for commission pay so long as he remains employed with the company as a sales representative.italics added.
we agree with defendant that,on its face,the italicized language is reasonably susceptible to only one once plaintiff ceased to be employed by defendant,he would no longer be eligible for commission pay.while plaintiff could have relied on extrinsic evidence if there were such evidence to suggest an alternative meaning of this provision,he did not do so.compare wolf superior court th,d t his extrinsic evidence of trade usage exposed a latent ambiguity in the contract language and presented an alter n ative interpretation to which the term gross receipts was reasonably susceptible in the circumstances.accordingly,we conclude as a matter of law that the written employment agreement precludes plaintiff from collecting additional commissions.
we also reject plaintiff contention that summary judgment must be denied because there are triable issues as to the existence of an april oral employment agreement that did not include a termination clause.in support,plaintiff relies on his own declaration,in which he states that s ubsequent to the initial employment agreement that i signed with hostpro,in for a four percent commission,i was promoted to channel manager and given a new agreement for of the up front costs revenues on all accounts brought in by me or through my contacts or efforts.the commission agreement was not amended.during the month of april,a new agreement was entered into when i was promoted to channel manager and i was provided a new commission agreement of,new office,other amenities and new salary of.further,plaintiff says,regarding the employment agreement and during the premier partner program,it was never discussed or detailed by the defendants in any of the meetings or bulletins that an earned commission would not b
