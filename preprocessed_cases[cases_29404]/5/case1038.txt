background 
chp officer larry depee shot and killed john watkins during a struggle on the night of december.watkins was unemployed and had a long history of schizophrenia,accompanied by drug and alcohol abuse.he survived on social security payments and support from his mother.
in its order denying defendants motion for summary judgment on the and wrongful death claims,the district court wrote 
the parties essentially agree that,watkins,a old american yurok indian man,was riding his bicycle down highway southbound in the northbound lane.defendant depee observed 
watkins and saw that he was riding his bicycle without any lights.depee tried to initiate a traffic stop of watkins twice that evening but could not do so because watkins rode away before defendant could position his patrol car for the stop.
later that evening,depee saw watkins a third time,riding southbound on the sidewalk next to the northbound lane of highway.the parties agree that depee parked his patrol car directly in front of watkins.plaintiff claims that watkins collided with the patrol car and fell from his bicycle onto the ground,while defendants maintain that watkins stopped,straddled his bicycle and after depee told watkins he could not ride the wrong way in the roadway without lights,that watkins either shoved or threw the bicycle at depee and started running.the parties agree that at some point after depee stopped watkins,watkins ran away to a wooded area behind a nearby super motel,and depee chased him.according to depee,he and watkins struggled,and at some point during the fight,watkins began yelling that he needed to go home to take his medications,and also told depee he had a gun.also according to depee,watkins wrested depee flashlight away from him and swung at him twice with the flashlight.after the second swing,depee drew his gun and shot watkins several times,killing him.
based upon,inter alia,the declaration of forensic pathologist john cooper,plaintiff maintains that at the time depee shot watkins,watkins was lying on his left side with his right arm raised up in a warding off gesture,and that watkins could not have been swinging the flashlight at the time of his death.plaintiff also emphasizes the fact that a fingerprint analysis of depee flashlight only revealed one of watkins fingerprints on the head area of the flashlight plaintiff asserts that if depee version of events was true,there would be more of watkins fingerprints on the flashlight,and that those fingerprints would be on the shaft of the flashlight.
the evidence at trial was largely consistent with this narrative.depee testified at trial that he fired two shots and that he was probably two or three feet away from watkins when he fired.when asked why he shot watkins,depee replied 
well,in the end i shot him because he was trying to hit me with the flashlight and i definitely felt like he was trying to kill me.he said he had a gun.i do know why else he would tell anybody you have a gun you wanted the kill them or.the whole circumstances fighting,running,assaulting then ultimately the flashlight is when i shot.
q.why did you believe,maybe it obvious,but tell the jury why did you believe he was trying to kill you 
a.that flashlight is no doubt,to me that a deadly weapon when you re swinging that flashlight somebody,to me it painfully obvious he was trying to kill me.
after watkins death,filed suit against depee and several other defendants in state court under and various provisions of california law.defendants removed to federal court.filed an amended complaint in federal court,pleading a number of federal and claims.claims were contained in her sixth cause of action which contained two counts.count included an allegation of excessive force in violation of the fourth amendment,as well as allegations of first,fifth,and fourteenth amendment violations,on behalf of and watkins estate.count was an allegation of a conspiracy to violate watkins constitutional rights.in addition,in her seventh cause of action brought a claim under alleging a failure to prevent civil rights violations and a conspiracy to cover up such violations.claims included wrongful death,assault and battery,intentional infliction of emotional distress,negligence,and negligent hiring,training and retention.
after motions to dismiss,to strike,and for summary judgment,only three claims survived,as to which depee was the sole defendant.the claims were a fourth amendment claim by,a fourth amendment claim by watkins estate,and a wrongful death claim by.the district court held a jury trial,divided into liability and damages phases.at the conclusion of the liability phase,the jury returned a verdict against depee on the estate fourth amendment excessive force claim and wrongful death claim.
in the damages phase,the district court instructed the jury that it could return an award of only one dollar in nominal damages on the claim,irrespective of what the evidence showed.the court instructed the jury that it could return an award on the wrongful death claim in whatever amount the evidence supported.at the conclusion of the damages phase,the jury awarded one dollar in nominal damages on each of the two claims.
moved for a new trial on the issue of damages on the wrongful death claim.the district court denied the motion,explaining that in its view the evidence in support of damages was consistent with the jury verdict.in the court words,the evidence showed a complicated picture of the relationship between watkins and his mother.although testified that she and her son loved each other and had a close relationship,the evidence showed that watkins had threatened his mother on several occasions,that she was afraid of him and periodically requested police assistance with him,that he had difficulty forming any meaningful relationships,and that he had a serious history of psychiatric instability.
moved for attorney fees and costs under based on the jury favorable verdict on the claim.she sought in attorney fees and in costs.the district court tolled the time for taking an appeal in order to consider the motion for fees.the court awarded in attorney fees,reducing the requested amount due to limited success in her suit.the court held that was entitled to recover costs under federal rule of civil procedure,but wrote that it was unable to determine the amount without more information.the court denied the motion for costs and authorized to file a renewed motion after the clerk taxed costs.
depee appealed the award of attorney fees.did not file a timely.
ii.standard of review 
we review an award of attorney fees for abuse of discretion.benton or.student assistance comm n,cir.a district court abuses its discretion if it awards fees based on an erroneous view of the law or a clearly erroneous finding of fact.id.
iii.discussion 
this appeal presents three issues.first,argues that because the district court had not fully resolved her motion for attorney fees and costs when depee filed his notice of appeal,the appeal was premature.second,depee argues that because obtained only one dollar in nominal damages on the claim,she is not entitled to attorney fees under farrar hobby.third,argues that the district court abused its discretion in reducing the amount of attorney fees.
