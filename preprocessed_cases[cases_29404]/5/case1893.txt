background facts 
plaintiff filed her complaint for damages on may.it alleged that during her employment for the city of taft as a police dispatcher,she was subjected to a pattern of continuing sexual harassment that lasted for more than two years.the perpetrator,officer paulson,allegedly engaged in inappropriate and offensive touching of plaintiff on a regular basis,such as unwelcome hugging,kissing,and grabbing of her breasts and buttocks.he also made frequent lewd comments to her.plaintiff repeatedly demanded that paulson stop such conduct,but paulson would not do so.plaintiff reported the sexual harassment to her superiors,but no action was taken to stop paulson actions.the complaint alleges that as a result of the ongoing offensive conduct,plaintiff suffered severe emotional trauma and depression.in addition to various tort causes of action,plaintiff lawsuit alleged sexual harassment,failure to prevent sexual harassment,and retaliation for reporting sexual harassment,in violation of feha.
trial was scheduled to begin on april.after extensive discovery efforts and numerous pretrial motions,the parties reached a settlement on march.the settlement provided that defendant would pay plaintiff the sum of plus reasonable attorney fees and costs in an amount to be determined by the court based upon a motion for attorneys fees and costs to be filed by plaintiff counsel.
plaintiff motion for attorney fees was filed on july.plaintiff was and is represented by morrison foerster,a large law firm with offices in los angeles and in the bay area.the supporting declaration of attorney eric tate summarized the nature of the legal services that were provided to plaintiff in this vigorously litigated case.the declaration also described the extensive experience,expertise and other relevant background information concerning the several attorneys who provided legal services for plaintiff in this case.the hourly rates of the particular morrison foerster attorneys that worked on plaintiff case were listed as follows arturo gonzalez partner per hour eric tate partner per hour samantha goodman associate per hour erika drous associate per hour dara tabesh associate per hour and steven tang associate per hour.attached to the supporting declaration was a copy of time records reflecting the hours worked by attorneys and paralegals at morrison foerster on behalf of plaintiff in connection with this lawsuit.the plaintiff motion sought a total of in fees,which was the total of each attorney or paralegal time spent on the case multiplied by his or her hourly rate.
in opposition to the motion,defendant presented declarations showing that the prevailing hourly rates for comparable attorney services in the local community,kern county,would be at most per hour for partners,and per hour for associates.by plugging in these hourly rates,and making comparable reductions in the rates for paralegal services,the opposition argued that p laintiff request should be reduced to,less any additional subtractions for excessive work performed.moreover,defendant pointed out that plaintiff had failed to establish that local attorneys were unavailable pursuant to horsford,and therefore it would be inappropriate to provide counsel with their customary rates.instead,according to defendant,reasonable rates prevailing in the local community would have to be applied.
plaintiff reply papers argued that it may have been impractical for plaintiff to retain local counsel to handle her case.the reply included a declaration of plaintiff stating that because taft and bakersfield were small towns and law enforcement had close ties with the legal community,she was fearful that she would not get fair and adequate legal representation by attorneys in kern county.
at the hearing of the motion,the trial court announced its tentative ruling to award attorney fees in the sum of and then proceeded to explain how it arrived at that amount.preliminarily,the court stated that plaintiff had failed to demonstrate,pursuant to horsford,the impracticability of retaining local counsel to handle her case therefore,the court did not directly apply the rates from the higher fee market,but used the local rate of per hour.however,based on its reading of the remainder of the horsford case addressing multiplier s,the trial court decided it was necessary to enhance the local rates by applying a multiplier of percent.defense counsel objected that plaintiff had never requested a multiplier.in explaining its decision,the trial court specifically stated i still obligated,as i read the law,i would have to apply some kind of multiplier to the lawyer that in a higher fee market.oral argument concluded on this issue with the judge stating he was still of the opinion he was going to adopt the tentative.
the court written order granting the motion was consistent with its oral ruling and pronouncements at the hearing.on the issue of need for counsel,the written order hypothesized that this is a case that a kern county plaintiff attorney may not have been willing or able to undertake given the commitment of resources required and risks involved.however,the court found it unnecessary for purposes of the fee motion to resolve the question of whether a sufficient showing of need for counsel was made,because a n award of the fees requested either at the higher fee market rates or at the local hourly rates proffered by taft,per hour,with a multiplier,would provide essentially the same result and best effectuate the purposes of feha in this matter.the court applied the local rate plus the multiplier,which resulted in a total of.the court then deducted for time entries,for a total fee award of.
defendant notice of appeal timely followed.
