hylton opposed the motion,arguing his claim against rogozienski did not arise from protected petitioning activity by rogozienski,but was instead based on his alleged ethical violations and breaches of fiduciary obligations.hylton cited and relied on numerous holding a client claim against his former attorney for misfeasance during the course of representation does not arise from protected activity within the ambit of the statute merely because the alleged misfeasance by the attorney occurred in the context of litigation.hylton asserted those cases were controlling and precluded rogozienski from demonstrating his threshold burden of showing the statute was applicable to the present action.
the trial court agreed hylton complaint did not arise from protected activity,and denied the motion.rogozienski appealed the order
