the international longshoremen association challenges the district court order denying its motion for relief from judgment under.b.the union argues that the court mistakenly classified eddie knight as a prevailing party and wrongly awarded him attorney fees in the amount of,including costs and fees.the union also questions whether the district court even had jurisdiction to make the award,claiming it did more than our mandate authorized it to do in the union prior appeal.we will affirm.
this case has been around since and this is the third appeal we have heard from these parties knight is a member of the international longshoremen association,local,and was financial secretary for the local.in,he distributed a flier that said the local was hosting a group known as the worker coalition.adam mcbride,executive director of the diamond state port corporation created by the state of delaware to operate the port of wilmington where members of local work saw the flier knight distributed and offered to be a speaker.mcbride also contributed paying it directly to the hotel where the meeting was happening.
shortly after mcbride did these things,the union national vice president,james paylor,called mcbride and told him that the worker coalition was not affiliated with the union.mcbride withdrew his offer to be a speaker,but he did not ask for the to be returned.
knight filed union charges against paylor for interfering with the local.paylor knight.he accused him of making frivolous claims that were detrimental to the union.he also said that knight used the union name without permission,violating article xxvii of the union constitution.the union put together a board to hear the charges.the hearing board cleared paylor,but decided that knight committed three violations he misled the executive director of the corporation to believe that the union endorsed the worker coalition he violated section of the labor management relations act b by accepting a gift from an employer and,he used the union and local name,without permission,to solicit funds from an employer.it recommended that the union executive council suspend knight and order him,personally,to repay the given by diamond state port corporation.the executive council adopted the recommendations.
knight filed suit,claiming that article xxvii of the union constitution prohibiting use of its name violated his free speech rights.he also asserted against the union three claims under the labor management reporting and disclosure act.specifically,he alleged that the union refused to allow him to record his disciplinary hearing selected a biased union member to serve on the board and failed to give union members proper notice about the act,violating section.the district court abstained on the free speech issue and ruled against knight on the due process claims.
we reversed the district court order in and remanded the case.we ruled that the district court should not have abstained,and decided that article xxvii was too broad,chilling the free speech rights of union members under the labor management relations act.the remand instructed the district court to consider changing article xxvii of the union constitution to apply more narrowly to the misuse of the union name.we also reversed the district court order on all of knight other claims,ruling that the union violated due process under the labor management reporting and disclosure act by refusing his request to record the hearing by failing to give him an impartial disciplinary hearing committee and,by failing to properly inform its members about the act.our remand instructed the district court to determine the appropriate remedy for knight.later,in a separate order,we awarded attorney fees to knight in the amount of.
following our remand,the district court ordered the union to revise article xxvii and to create a new policy for distributing copies of summaries of the labor management reporting and disclosure act.the district court also ordered the union to give knight a new hearing with an impartial tribunal,and to allow knight to record the hearing.the union complied with the order on the due process issues regarding bias and a record,and with improving its efforts to distribute information about the act.it did not,however,immediately fulfill the requirements of the order to change its constitution.
before the union ethics officer who was accepted by both parties as unbiased the union asked for a ruling that knight should be disciplined under article xviii of the union constitution for conduct detrimental to the welfare of the union by violating section a of the labor management relations act.the hearing was recorded,and the ethics officer of the union presided.the officer decided that knight did not technically violate section a because the corporation who gave the did not fit the definition of an employer under that section.but,the officer went on to conclude that,at the time of the first hearing,it was reasonable for the union to decide that knight violated the spirit and intent of b and to direct the return of the money.
knight and the union then filed summary judgment motions with the district court.the district court denied most of the parties claims,but it did order a hearing on knight assertion that the union never charged him with violating the spirit of section b,infringing his due process right under section a of the act.it also instructed the parties to present evidence regarding knight request for compensatory and punitive damages the district court decided that the union violated knight due process rights because it did not give him adequate notice of the misconduct for which he was found guilty.it also ruled that knight was entitled to be reimbursed for the fine that he paid to the union and interest on that amount.however,it concluded that he did not present enough evidence to justify either compensatory damages for lost income or punitive damages 
shortly after the district court entered this order,knight filed motions to set aside the judgment,to alter the judgment for prejudgment interest,and to recover attorney fees and costs.knight then appealed the order on the issue of damages.the union the district court order,arguing that it did not violate knight due process rights.we stayed the appeal and while the district court decided the motions.
the district court eventually granted knight motion for attorney fees and costs,awarding him in fees and costs.citing to ruocchio united transp.union,cir,it concluded that knight was a prevailing party who conferred a common benefit to all union members because of his successful free speech and due process challenges.the union conceded that knight successful free speech and section claims conferred a common benefit.the district court concluded that the required changes to the disciplinary hearing also conferred a common benefit because they would encourage the union to pay more attention to procedural fairness in hearings that would follow,and make members aware of their due process rights.it denied the rest of knight motions.
the union amended its appeal in light of the attorney fees and costs awards,preserving this issue,but neither party briefed it and we did not address it.in our decision,we agreed with the union that knight due process rights under section a of the act were not violated in the second hearing,and we disagreed with knight that damages should be awarded.before we issued our mandate,knight filed a motion with the district court to require the surety to pay attorney fees.in the alternative,knight wanted the district court to order the union to continue the supersedeas bond they posted,or to put up a substitute bond in an amount to cover knight attorney fees award.the union filed for relief from judgment under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,arguing that knight no longer was a prevailing party and could not claim attorney fees.the district court denied the union motion for relief and ultimately awarded knight attorney fees,costs,and interest.it based the award on its conclusion that,because of knight suit,knight and other union members can no longer be disciplined for making harmless references to the union name or logo are more aware of certain due process rights at disciplinary hearings and,are properly informed about the act.it adjusted the amount of the judgment downward to,in part to account for our reversal on knight due process claim in the second round.the union now appeals the denial of their motion for relief.
the union first says that our order in remanded the case to the district court to do only one thing vacate the award of damages they maintain that the district court did not have authority to do anything else.this is incorrect 
there is no question that the district court was required to follow our mandate bankers trust bethlehem steel,cir but,there is no basis here for the union to say that the district court acted improperly.on remand,a trial court is free to make any order or direction in further progress of the case,not inconsistent with the decision of the appellate court,as to any question not settled by the decision.casey planned parenthood of southeastern pennsylvania,cir quoting bankers trust,at.knight appeal focused on the district court damages ruling.the union cross appeal challenged the district court ruling that the second disciplinary hearing violated due process under section a of the act.these are the issues we decided.it is true that the union amended their cross appeal to add the district court later award of attorney fees however,as we said,no one briefed the issue and we did not rule on it.therefore,our mandate did not prevent the district court from deciding knight motions on the supersedeas bond and attorney fees,and the union motion for relief.the district court had jurisdiction to decide these motions.
the union second claim is that the district court wrongly denied its rule b motion for relief from judgment.the rule says the following 
on motion and just terms,the court may relieve a party or its legal representative from a final judgment,order,or proceeding for the following reasons the judgment has been satisfied,released or discharged it is based on an earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated or applying it prospectively is no longer equitable 
b.we have plenary review over the district court interpretation and application of legal rules and doctrines.le university of pennsylvania,cir.every other aspect of the district court decision to deny the motion is examined for an abuse of discretion.wilson fenton,cir.our scope of review is narrow we do not examine the underlying judgment.id.
the union has the burden of convincing us that the district court misinterpreted the legal definition of prevailing party here and that,because of this misunderstanding,it relied on the wrong facts to decide its motion.their argument,essentially,is that the district court should have focused on the relief that we gave the union in and should have minimized or ignored the judgment in knight favor that we filed in.
the union says that,without a final judgment in his favor,knight is no longer a prevailing party.concentrating on his underlying motive for the lawsuit reversing the union discipline against him as the centerpiece of any determination on his success in this lawsuit,they say knight lost the battle his suspension was not revoked and his fine was not reduced.mirroring language in supreme court precedent on attorney fees,they contend that the court has not issued an enforceable judgment against defendant ila on plaintiff knight labor management reporting and disclosure act claim.the legal relationship between knight and the union was not altered.see buckhannon bd.care home west virginia of health and human.
there is truth in what the union is saying.our ruling on knight second appeal ended his due process challenge.this wiped out his entitlement to any damages,and it eliminated anyone credible belief that flaws in the union disciplinary process were affecting the outcome of the hearing.however,the union is convinced that the district court lost sight of all of this and analyzed the prevailing party issue in a way that contradicts buckhannon ruling.it went astray,they claim,by relying on the order we issued in granting knight relief on his due process and free speech claims rather than focusing exclusively on the final judgment in its favor.we disagree.the union approaches this argument from different perspectives,and we will examine each.
the union underscores the fact that knight did not receive any damages in this case.citing to rhodes stewart,it insists that a party who is not awarded damages can not prevail.rhodes does not really say this but,be that as it may,the union position does not account for the effect that the common benefit doctrine has here.although title i of the labor management reporting and disclosure act does not provide an award of attorney fees,it is settled law that union members who successfully vindicate rights under title i of the act can seek reimbursement under the common benefit doctrine.pawlak greenawalt,cir citing hall cole.the doctrine applies when the plaintiff successful litigation confers a substantial benefit on the members of an ascertainable class.id.quoting hall,at.
before hall,the supreme court had already brushed aside concerns about damage awards when it considered the issue of attorney fees under the common benefit doctrine.mills electric auto lite.the fact that this suit has not yet produced,and may never produce,a monetary recovery from which the fees could be paid does not preclude an award id.at.the court concentrated on the stare decisis effect of the case upon future suits that could arise from the newly created precedent.id.at.it also credited the judgment resulting from the suit as vindicating the statutory policy by contributing to a fair and informed voting process for the shareholders.id.at.notwithstanding all of this,the supreme court set a substantial threshold for judging a party as successful under this doctrine.quoting the minnesota supreme court,it cautioned that the common benefit must be something more than technical in its consequence and be one that accomplishes a result that corrects or prevents an abuse which would be prejudicial to the rights and interests of the beneficiaries or affect the enjoyment or protection of an essential right of the beneficiaries.id.quoting bosch meeker cooperative light power.
success in lawsuits is a slippery concept that can shift between the parties as different phases of the case unfold.courts always must be cautious to avoid authorizing attorney fees where a party has won a battle but lost the war.national amusements,borough of palmyra,cir internal brackets omitted.that concern is at the heart of our review here.we understand the fact that knight launched this lawsuit because he wanted to reverse the union decision to fine and suspend him and that,ultimately,this did not happen.but,his complaint,which provides a fair basis for figuring out what the legal war was about,pointed to problems that could not be fixed with money damages.it is important to us that,citing to the act,the focus of knight lawsuit was on challenging the validity of the process used to discipline him.it is also matters that his suit claimed problems that were not merely technical or incidental mistakes in the process as it applied to him.by claiming that the union constitution infringed his free speech rights,and that basic elements of the union disciplinary process violated his due process rights,he raised larger issues about structural elements of his disciplinary process.all of this gave the district court good reason consistent with mills and pawlak to look beyond the absence of monetary damages in the final judgment to figure out if knight lawsuit was successful.
the union goes further,though,arguing that the district court opinion mistakenly relied on our judgment in and ignored or contradicted the final judgment in this case.they make three related arguments to support this idea the order granting relief was an interim order the relief that knight got in was only a remand for a new hearing and our order in reversed all prior orders that supported any claim that knight prevailed.
