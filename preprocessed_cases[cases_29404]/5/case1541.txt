walter hudson appellant seeks review of the final decision of the united states court of appeals for veterans claims dismissing his application for an award of attorneys fees and expenses pursuant to the equal access to justice act eaja.we hold that the court of appeals for veterans claims erred in dismissing his eaja claim,vacate the decision of the court of appeals for veterans claims in hudson west,and remand to the court for consideration of hudson eaja application.
background 
hudson served on active duty in the united states air force from january to july.he suffered from a variety of medical conditions,including a duodenal ulcer,while in the service.in july he received a certificate of disability for discharge due to his ulcer.he later was diagnosed by the department of veterans affairs as having both ulcers and a mental disorder.in october hudson filed a claim with the department of veterans affairs for service connection for paranoid schizophrenia.
the regional office of the department of veterans affairs informed hudson by letter dated march,that his claim for service connection was denied.in a letter dated march,hudson submitted a notice of disagreement nod with this decision.in november the regional office determined that hudson had submitted new and material evidence to reopen his claim but denied service connection for paranoid schizophrenia,on both a direct basis and as secondary to the ulcer.the regional office stated since this action has reopened the claim,no further action is taken on the notice of disagreement filed because it is considered favorably resolved.the regional office,however,failed to prepare or issue a statement of the case soc to hudson as required by d.
in december hudson filed a notice of disagreement seeking to appeal the decision of the department of veterans affairs to take no further action on the march notice of disagreement.after several rejections and another notice of disagreement,hudson appealed to the board of veterans appeals board.
on may,the board determined that the november department of veterans affairs decision had been final,and that hudson had failed to file a timely appeal from that decision.the board therefore considered whether hudson had submitted new and material evidence after november sufficient to reopen his claim.see if new and material evidence is presented or secured with respect to a claim which has been disallowed,the secretary of veterans affairs shall reopen the claim and review the former disposition of the claim.the board found the evidence to be cumulative and not material,and therefore denied hudson application to reopen his claim for service connection for paranoid schizophrenia.
hudson appealed to the court of appeals for veterans claims,raising for the first time the issue as to whether the department of veterans affairs failure to prepare a statement of the case rendered the decision.after the board decision but before the court of appeals for veterans claims opinion in this case,this court held in hodge west,that the definition of new and material evidence set forth in a must be applied in determining whether a veteran has submitted new and material evidence,thereby expressly overruling colvin derwinski.the effect of hodge west is that it is no longer necessary for a veteran to prove that there is a reasonable possibility that the new evidence would change the outcome.at.instead,after hodge west,a veteran need only present evidence which by itself or in connection with evidence previously assembled is so significant that it must be considered in order to fairly decide the merits of the claim,consistent with a.id.at.
in a july,opinion,the court of appeals for veterans claims noted that t he secretary concedes in his brief that the board decision must be vacated and the matter remanded to the board to determine whether or not the evidence submitted by the appellant was new and material under the definition promulgated by the federal circuit in hodge west.hudson west,wl,at.july,unpublished disposition.the court further stated that the secretary concedes that the board committed an additional error by failing to ensure that the regional office issue a soc after the november regional office decision.id.the court therefore concluded that the november decision did not become final,stating 
the board erred by failing to adjudicate appellant appeal.this error was material because the board only considered the evidence submitted since the november decision.
in summary,because the regional office failed to issue a soc following the november regional office decision,this decision did not become final.the appellant time to file a nod was tolled by the failure of the regional office to issue an soc.the appellant december nod was timely filed.this appeal is currently in appellate status before the board.although the court will dismiss his appeal for lack of jurisdiction,the board is required by statute to adjudicate the merits of the appellant claim,considering all of the evidence submitted since the december regional office decision to determine if the appellant has furnished new and material evidence to reopen his claim.if the board decides that the appellant has submitted new and material evidence to reopen his claim,the board will then proceed to adjudicate his claim on the merits by first determining whether the appellant has submitted a claim.
id.internal citations omitted.the court thus instructed the board to adjudicate the merits of hudson claim,considering all of the evidence submitted since december to determine if hudson has furnished new and material evidence under the correct standard.the court nonetheless dismissed the appeal,finding that i n tablazon brown,the court of appeals for veterans claims held that when the va has failed to procedurally comply with statutorily mandated requirements,a claim does not become final for purposes of appeal to the court of appeals for veterans claims.id.
on october,hudson filed an eaja application at the court of appeals for veterans claims for an award of attorneys fees and expenses.hudson asserted that he was the prevailing party within the meaning of d because the july,decision,although dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction,remanded to the board with instructions to adjudicate the merits of hudson claim the secretary of veterans affairs asserted that in order for the court of appeals for veterans claims to award eaja fees,the court of appeals for veterans claims must have had jurisdiction over the underlying action.the secretary urged that because the court of appeals for veterans claims found that it did not have jurisdiction over the may board decision and dismissed the appeal,the court was also required to dismiss hudson eaja application for lack of jurisdiction.
in the decision now on appeal,the court of appeals for veterans claims held that it could not award eaja fees unless it had jurisdiction to award the relief requested during the merits litigation,citing heath west.hudson west.at.the court concluded that since it did not have actual jurisdiction over the appeal of the may board decision,the underlying action in this eaja application,the court does not have jurisdiction to consider the eaja application itself.id.at.the court accordingly dismissed hudson application for attorneys fees and expenses under eaja.judge steinberg filed a concurring opinion stating that the court july opinion was incorrect in relying on tablazon brown,where the court had dismissed a claim for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of disagreement was filed before november,the effective date of the veterans judicial review act.id.at.judge steinberg noted that hudson case should have instead been based on cases dealing with,notices of disagreement that consistently remanded if a soc had not yet been issued.id.at.judge steinberg agreed however that the court was constrained to refuse to reconsider the jurisdictional issue and to dismiss the eaja application based on the binding precedent of heath west cited in the majority opinion.id.at.this timely appeal followed.
