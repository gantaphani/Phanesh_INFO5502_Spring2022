this case raises the question of how and where a conflict between a creditor claiming a judgment lien under code of civil procedure section et sometimes the judgment lien statutes and an attorney claiming a contractual lien on the proceeds of the same judgment is to be resolved.specifically,can an attorney lien claimant,over the objection of the judgment creditor,appear in the client underlying action for the limited purpose of asserting his or her contractual lien and contesting the creditor judgment lien we conclude the answer to that question is no,even if there is no dispute between the attorney and the client as to the validity or amount of the attorney lien.in the face of an objection by any a judgment creditor in a judgment lien enforcement proceeding under section validity and amount of the attorney contractual lien can be established only in a separate action.
this does not mean,however,that a creditor with a judgment lien can defeat the potentially senior contractual lien of an attorney simply by filing an application for satisfaction of his or her judgment lien under section before the attorney has litigated the validity and amount of his or her lien in another action.because the trial court has discretion to grant an application under section,it may be an abuse of discretion for the court to do so before the attorney lien claim has been adjudicated.
in this mandamus case,the respondent trial court granted the application of a judgment creditor under section to satisfy its lien from the judgment proceeds,despite opposition from a competing attorney lien claimant,because the court concluded the attorney was not a party to the client action and had no right to intervene.while the respondent court was correct regarding the attorney status in the client action,it does not follow that the judgment creditor was necessarily entitled to the judgment proceeds before the attorney.although the validity and amount of the attorney lien must be adjudicated in a separate action,the potential existence of a senior contractual lien on the judgment may well warrant denying the judgment creditor application under section at this juncture.however,that is a matter for the trial court to decide in the first instance in the exercise of its discretion under section,taking all applicable facts and circumstances into account.because we can not be assured the respondent court in this case actually exercised its discretion in that manner,we will issue a peremptory writ of mandate directing the court to vacate its order granting the judgment creditor application under section and to reconsider that application in the light of this opinion.
factual and procedural background 
in,vortran corporation vortran brought an action against real party in interest vortran medical technology,vmt on claims arising out of a licensing agreement between the parties.we will refer to this as the vmt action.while that action was pending,real party in interest cyclon corporation cyclon prevailed in an arbitration against vortran in another matter.as a result of that arbitration,on april,a judgment was entered against vortran and in favor of cyclon for sometimes the vortran judgment.six days later,in the vmt action,a judgment was entered against vmt and in favor of vortran for sometimes the vmt judgment.on april,cyclon filed a notice of lien in the vmt action based on the vortran judgment.
both vortran and vmt appealed the vmt judgment.while that appeal was pending,vmt filed for bankruptcy.in january,the bankruptcy court confirmed vmt plan of reorganization,which provided that vmt would have years to pay the vmt judgment to vortran and that vmt was to deposit monthly payments into a blocked account for that purpose.distribution to vortran from the account was to occur when and if vmt lost its against vortran.
in july,this court affirmed the vmt judgment.after vortran petition for review was denied,the remittitur issued in october.
in early,petitioner michael brown filed a motion in the vmt action seeking to establish priority among lien claimants.apparently,he claimed a contractual lien on the proceeds of the vmt judgment as vortran attorney and sought an order establishing that his lien was senior to cyclon judgment lien,which was created with the filing of cyclon notice of lien in april.the court denied brown motion without prejudice.
what happened during the next five years is a mystery on the record before us.in june,however,cyclon filed an application in the vmt action pursuant to section for an order that vortran right to money under the vmt judgment be applied to satisfy cyclon judgment lien.
brown,nominally acting in his capacity as attorney for vortran,filed an opposition to cyclon application.in vortran opposition,brown asserted he had an attorney contractual lien on the proceeds of the vmt judgment that was senior to cyclon judgment lien.brown also asserted that because there was no dispute concerning any of the fees or costs he claimed,there is no necessity to bring an independent action to determine the amount of the fees and costs owed or whether brown has an attorney lien on the proceeds of the judgment herein.
in reply,cyclon contended the court should strike vortran opposition because vortran corporate powers had been suspended under corporations code section for failing to file an annual statement of information required by corporations code section.cyclon also contended the court did not have jurisdiction over brown lien claim because the validity of brown lien had to be determined in a separate,independent action.
brown responded by filing an application to correct the previously filed opposition,claiming he did not intend to appear for vortran and instead always intended to appear on his own behalf to assert his lien claim against the proceeds of the vmt judgment.brown also filed,as an attorney lien claimant appearing pro se,a motion for an order determining the amount and priority of his lien and directing vmt to pay all sums held in the blocked account to him until his lien was satisfied.
the trial court tentatively denied cyclon application for satisfaction of its judgment lien and granted brown motions to correct his opposition to cyclon motion and to determine lien priority in his favor.after argument,however,the trial court changed its mind.based on its rereading of two cases,cetenko united california bank cal d,and carroll interstate brands th,d discussed below,the court concluded brown was not a party to the underlying action and has no right to intervene.he must bring a separate independent action against vortran to enforce his lien.accordingly,the court denied brown motion to determine lien priority,struck what it now deemed was vortran opposition to cyclon application under section,and granted cyclon application,ordering that vmt apply all monies it owed to vortran under the judgment to satisfy cyclon judgment lien.
on brown petition,we issued an alternative writ of mandate and stayed the trial court orders.
discussion 
ijudgment liens under section et.
under the judgment lien statutes,a judgment creditor who has a money judgment against a judgment debtor who is a party to a pending action or special proceeding may obtain a lien on the rights of the judgment debtor to money or property under any judgment subsequently procured in the action or proceeding to the extent required to satisfy the judgment creditor money judgment,subd.a.to obtain a judgment lien under these statutes,the judgment creditor shall file a notice of lien and an abstract or certified copy of the judgment creditor money judgment in the pending action or special proceeding,subd.b.
although a judgment creditor with a judgment lien may seek to intervene in the action,subd.a,intervention is not necessary to enforce the lien.for example,under section,any party to the action can apply for an order that the judgment debtor rights to money or property under the judgment be applied to the satisfaction of the judgment lien as ordered by the court,subd.a.for purposes of an application under section,a judgment creditor is deemed to be a party to the action or special proceeding even without intervening,subd.b.
here,cyclon was a judgment creditor of vortran by virtue of its april,judgment against vortran.based on that judgment,cyclon obtained a lien on vortran right to money under the vmt judgment when it filed its notice of lien under the judgment lien statutes in the vmt action on april.
attorney contractual liens 
a lien in favor of an attorney upon the proceeds of a prospective judgment in favor of his client for legal services rendered may be created either by express contract or it may be implied if the retainer agreement between the lawyer and client indicates that the former is to look to the judgment for payment of his fee citations.cetenko united california bank,supra,cal d at.an attorney lien is created and takes effect at the time the fee agreement is executed.carroll interstate brands,supra,th at,d.unlike a judgment creditor lien,which is created when the notice of lien is filed citation,an attorney lien is a secret lien it is created and the attorney security interest is protected even without a notice of lien.citations.an attorney may,however,choose to file a notice of lien in the underlying action,and the common practice of doing so has been held permissible and even advisable.id.at,d.
here,we do not decide whether brown has a valid contractual lien on the proceeds of the vmt judgment.we note,however,that brown claims such a lien based on written fee agreements he allegedly entered into with vortran in june and july two years before cyclon obtained its judgment lien on vortran right to money under vmt judgment.
priority of liens 
in cetenko,our supreme court rejected the argument that a judgment lien acquired pursuant to a statute has priority over a contractual lien.cetenko united california bank,supra,cal d at.instead,the court held that the rule of priority set forth in civil code section applies.cetenko,at,fn.that statute provides that,o ther things being equal,different liens upon the same property have priority according to the time of their creation.thus,an attorney contractual lien arising out of a contract entered into before the filing of a notice of lien under the judgment lien statutes has priority over the judgment lien created by that filing.as the supreme court explained in cetenko,p ublic policy favors th is conclusion if an attorney claim for a lien on the judgment based on a contract for fees earned prior to and in the action can not prevail over the lien of a subsequent judgment creditor,persons with meritorious claims might well be deprived of legal representation because of their inability to pay legal fees or to assure that such fees will be paid out of the sum recovered in the latest lawsuit.such a result would be detrimental not only to prospective litigants,but to their creditors as well.cetenko,at.
here,if brown claim of a lien on the proceeds of the vmt judgment is valid,his lien has priority over cyclon lien.the question,however,is whether the trial court in the vmt action has the power to determine the validity of brown lien.we turn our attention to that question.
enforcing attorney lien claims by separate action 
appellate courts have consistently held that the trial court in the underlying action has no jurisdiction to determine the existence or validity of an attorney lien on the judgment.citations.the trial court does have fundamental jurisdiction over the subject matter and over the parties.nevertheless,because the attorney is not a party to the underlying action and has no right to intervene,the trial court acts in excess of its jurisdiction when it purports to determine whether the attorney is entitled to foreclose a lien on the judgment.citations.nor can the court entertain a motion to terminate the lien.citation.after the client obtains a judgment,the attorney must bring a separate,independent action against the client to establish the existence of the lien,to determine the amount of the lien,and to enforce it.citations.an order within the underlying action purporting to affect an attorney lien is void.carroll interstate brands,supra,th at,d.
under carroll and the numerous cases cited in carroll,the trial court in the vmt action had no authority to determine the existence or validity of brown claimed lien on the proceeds of the vmt judgment.this means that while brown was entitled to assert his lien claim against the proceeds of the vmt judgment by filing a notice of lien in the vmt action,the trial court had no power to determine in that action whether brown lien claim was valid or invalid.thus,the trial court correctly denied brown motion for an order determining the amount and priority of his lien and directing vmt to pay all sums held in the blocked account to him until his lien was satisfied.any order or judgment granting the attorney fees made in the main action is in excess of the court jurisdiction and is void.bandy diablo unified sch.dist.d.
brown attempts to avoid the effect of carroll and its predecessors by arguing that each of those cases concerned either a dispute between a discharged attorney and the client regarding attorney fees,or a dispute between the client and current counsel and discharged counsel regarding attorney fees.brown suggests that while the trial court does not have either subject matter or personal jurisdiction over the contract dispute between the party and his attorney or former attorney,the court does have jurisdiction over an attorney lien claim when there is no dispute between the attorney and the client,but only between the attorney and another creditor of the client.according to brown,because vortran does not dispute his lien claim,he is entitled to appear as a party in postjudgment proceedings in the vmt action both for the purpose of challenging cyclon motion to enforce its lien under section and for the purpose of filing an independent motion to determine lien priority.
brown is mistaken.while it may be true that carroll and its predecessors involved disputes,the rationale of those cases is not limited to such disputes.the rule that the trial court in the underlying action lacks jurisdiction to affect an attorney lien is founded on the fundamental principle that one who is not a party to a proceeding may not make a motion therein.marshank superior court d.it is a recognized rule of legal procedure that no one not a party to the action,without any disclosed interest in the result thereof,can be permitted to thrust himself into the controversy by filing any character of pleading therein.indeed,it would seem to confound the reason of the law,in a mere action at law,requiring pleadings to make up issues to be tried between the parties named in the action,that one not interpleaded as a party,neither for nor against whom the court could render any relief or judgment,could,sua sponte,come into the litigation for any purpose,quoting difani riverside county oil cal.
in very limited circumstances,an attorney may be entitled to intervene as a party in the client action under section the right of an attorney to intervene for the purpose of settling a dispute between him and his client as to attorney fees for services rendered in the same action is limited to those actions wherein,by virtue of the contract of employment between the attorney and client,the former is given a specific present interest in the subject matter of the action,which interest might be jeopardized by the client discharge of his original attorney and the employment of another to prosecute the action.marshank superior court,supra,d at.absent proper intervention,however,the fundamental rule is that the attorney is not a party to the client action and can not appear on his or her own behalf to seek any relief in that action,including enforcement of a contractual lien against the proceeds of the judgment.see hansen jacobsen d.because the discharged attorney is not a party to the pending action and may not intervene,the trial court has no jurisdiction to award fees to that attorney.
that there is no dispute between the attorney and the client regarding the attorney lien claim does not confer party status or the right to intervene as a party on the attorney.nor is an attorney claiming a contractual lien a party to a judgment lien enforcement proceeding under section,as brown contends.a judgment creditor claiming a judgment lien under section et is deemed a party to the underlying action for purposes of an application under section by virtue of subdivision b of section there is no similar statute,however,that conveys party status on an attorney claiming a contractual lien against the proceeds of the judgment.moreover,as brown himself admits,the judgment lien statutes relate only to liens of judgment creditors,and do not apply to contractually created attorneys fees liens.pangborn plumbing carruthers skiffington th,d.
without an applicable statute on which to rely,brown cites several cases to support his argument that a person claiming a contractual lien against the proceeds of a judgment is a party to a judgment lien enforcement proceeding under section.brown reliance on those cases is misplaced.
the first case on which brown relies is cetenko united california bank,supra.in cetenko,an attorney schwartz entered into a fee agreement with a client cetenko in november regarding an action to establish ownership of a parcel of real property.cal d at.the agreement provided that most of the fee would be deferred and that fees owed by cetenko would become a lien upon any recovery in the action.ibid.
in july,a judgment creditor of cetenko schaefer was granted a judgment lien by the trial court pursuant to the predecessor of section et,on the proceeds of any judgment which cetenko would recover in the action filed by schwartz on his behalf.cetenko united california bank,supra,cal d at.
after cetenko recovered a money judgment in the action,and the defendant deposited the sum of the judgment in court,schwartz filed a motion seeking release of the entire proceeds to him as payment for services rendered the trial court granted schwartz motion,but ordered that he deposit the amount cetenko owed to schaefer in a bank account,from which withdrawals could only be made with the joint consent of schwartz and schaefer attorney.cetenko united california bank,supra,cal d at.
on schaefer appeal,our supreme court concluded that schwartz contractual lien was valid and was entitled to priority over schaefer judgment lien,and therefore the supreme court affirmed the trial court order.cetenko united california bank,supra,cal d at.
the facts of cetenko appear to call into question the rule from carroll and its predecessors that because the attorney is not a party to the underlying action,the trial court lacks jurisdiction to enforce the attorney contractual lien in the underlying action.it is critical to note,however,that the jurisdictional issue was never raised in cetenko.that is,so far as can be determined from the supreme court opinion,no party ever objected to schwartz filing of a motion in the underlying action to enforce his lien.thus,when the cetenko court affirmed the trial court order enforcing schwartz lien,it did so without analysis of the jurisdiction issue.carroll interstate brands,supra,th at,d making the same point regarding an appellate decision that endorsed the remedy of granting a motion to expunge an attorney lien in the underlying action.because a case is not authority for a proposition not considered ibid,cetenko does not support brown argument that an attorney lien claimant is entitled to file a motion in his or her client action to enforce his or her lien on the client judgment.
all four of the other cases on which brown lizzoli d,cappa f k rock sand,d,bluxome street associates fireman fund ins.d,and pangborn plumbing carruthers skiffington,supra,th at page,d likewise of no assistance to brown because in none of those cases did any party object to the trial court adjudicating the contractual lien in the underlying matter.
as the court explained with reference to consensual medical liens in lovett carrasco th,d,a trial court does not lack fundamental jurisdiction to adjudicate contractual liens in the underlying action because adjudication of contractual lien claims is clearly within the general subject matter jurisdiction of the superior court.id.at,d.the jurisdictional issue is whether the court in the underlying action act s in excess of its jurisdiction by adjudicating contractual liens,italics added.unlike some other jurisdictional defects,a party may,by its conduct,be estopped from contesting an action in excess of jurisdiction,quoting law offices of stanley bell shine,browne diamond th,d.thus,when the parties to an action allow the trial court to adjudicate a contractual lien in the underlying case without objection,that in excess of the court nonetheless valid.see lovett carrasco,supra,th at,d law offices of stanley bell shine,browne diamond,supra,th at,d.
it does not follow,however,that an attorney lien claimant is entitled to adjudication of his or her lien in the underlying action over the objection of a party to the action.indeed,brown does not cite a single case in which such an adjudication was upheld over objection.when a it the plaintiff client or a judgment creditor deemed a party for purposes of an application under the judgment lien to the adjudication of the attorney lien claim in the underlying action,the fundamental rule set forth in carroll and its predecessors applies any order within the underlying action purporting to affect the attorney lien,whether positively or negatively,is void.
because the trial court in the vmt action did not have the power to adjudicate brown lien claim over cyclon objection,the trial court correctly denied brown motion for an order determining the amount and priority of his lien and directing vmt to pay all sums held in the blocked account to him until his lien was satisfied.the trial court has no power to determine whether brown has a valid lien,let alone the amount or priority of that lien.if brown wants to establish and enforce his lien on the proceeds of the vmt judgment,he must bring a separate action to do so.
brown suggests that requiring him to bring a separate action against vortran to enforce his lien,when there is no conflict or dispute between him and vortran concerning the amount of the fees and costs or the fact that he was granted a lien on the judgment,would require him to violate the rules of professional conduct and the business and professions code and commit a tort because such an action would be without just cause.not so.by requiring brown to bring a separate action to enforce his lien,we do not mean to suggest that he must sue vortran for breach of contract.given the apparent lack of any controversy between brown and vortran,but the clear existence of an actual controversy between brown and cyclon over whose lien on the proceeds of the vmt judgment is entitled to first priority,a declaratory relief action under section seeking a declaration of brown rights with respect to cyclon,or in respect to the proceeds of the vmt judgment would be appropriate.even if brown were to name vortran as a defendant in such a declaratory relief action,vortran would not have to appear in the action if it did not claim any remaining interest in the judgment 
by requiring brown to bring a separate action to establish and enforce his lien,we also do not mean to suggest that brown must obtain a money judgment against vortran,then obtain a judgment lien under section et before he can enforce his lien against the proceeds of the vmt judgment.if brown files a declaratory relief action naming cyclon as a defendant,brown and cyclon can litigate the validity,amount,and priority of brown lien in that action.if brown lien claim,based on the fee agreements he allegedly entered into with vortran in,is valid,then under cetenko his lien will have priority over the judgment lien cyclon obtained in,and brown can enforce that lien in the declaratory relief action without having to obtain a judgment lien under section et in the vmt action.
adjudicating competing lien claims 
having concluded the trial court properly denied brown motion to enforce his contractual lien in the vmt action,the questions that remain are whether the court acted properly in denying brown application t
