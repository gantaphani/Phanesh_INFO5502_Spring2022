this case requires us to determine whether an unrecorded bill of sale purporting to convey a federally documented yacht,the cent anni,is valid as against a judgment creditor and to review an award of in punitive damages and an assessment of in attorneys fees.we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
on november,john walsh,and beatrice walsh conveyed the vessel,the lady,to david and angela murphy,who,on december,documented the conveyance with the department of transportation dot pursuant to the united states vessel documentation system,and,and changed the vessel name to lady b gone.on july,david mullane,purchased the vessel from the murphys but failed to record the bill of sale or conveyance with the dot until september.
in the meantime,adele chambers and jean farese,sought to levy on the vessel to satisfy two massachusetts state court writs of execution they held against the murphys,whom they believed to still own the vessel on august,the essex county sheriff department sheriff department,with the two executions in hand,seized the vessel,which at this point had the name cent anni painted on it,at the seaport marina in lynn,massachusetts.the murphys were on the vessel at the time of the seizure.when asked by the sheriff department whether they owned the vessel,the murphys responded that they had conveyed the vessel back to the previous owners,the walshes.the mullanes were never mentioned.
the sheriff department was accompanied by a member of the united states coast guard,who verified that the dot records showed that angela and david murphy were the registered owners.as we noted,the july conveyance to the mullanes and the change in the vessel name from lady gone to cent anni was not recorded with the dot until september,days after the seizure.
on september,the mullanes filed an amended complaint in admiralty against chambers,farese,sheriff frank cousins,the sheriff department,and the cent anni seeking repossession of the vessel and compensatory damages for harm to the vessel allegedly sustained as a result of the seizure.pursuant to rules d and e,the mullanes also filed an emergency motion for immediate arrest of the vessel and a motion to appoint substitute custodian,which the court allowed.the united states marshals service arrested the vessel,and after the mullanes posted security in the amount of,the vessel was released to them.chambers and farese filed an answer and counterclaim on october.in their counterclaim,chambers and farese sought to have the transfer to the mullanes set aside as a fraudulent transfer to defraud creditors under the uniform fraudulent transfer act.laws ch.
on february,cousins and the sheriff department filed a motion for summary judgment,contending that they had exercised due diligence in determining the record owner of the vessel by relying upon the dot records and by confirming ownership through the coast guard.the mullanes opposed the motion on the grounds that the arrest was improper under state law and that the sheriff department was liable for the claimed damages to the vessel under a bailment theory.while the motion was under advisement,on march,the sheriff department filed a motion to enter and inspect the vessel,which the court allowed.claiming that the mullanes had engaged in bad faith conduct by failing to launch the vessel or provide adequate electrical supply as required by the march order,on june,the department filed a motion to bar the mullanes claims regarding claimed damages to the mechanical,electrical,and plumbing systems of the vessel.on june,the court allowed the motion for summary judgment and the motion to bar such claims.the sheriff department also filed a motion for attorneys fees,seeking,an amount equal to the all of the department litigation expenses accrued up to that point in the case.the court allowed the fee motion on march.
in december,the court conducted a bench trial,and on june,issued an opinion and order and entered final judgment.it determined that the mullanes were bona fide purchasers of the vessel as of july,and thus took the vessel free of any interests held by chambers and farese.the court also found that the vessel was damaged while in the sheriff department care,but that the mullanes had failed to prove the amount of damages,and that,in any event,the sheriff department was immune from damages.finally,the court imposed in punitive damages against chambers and farese,finding that they had intentionally disregarded the mullanes rights to the vessel by continuing to assert a claim to the vessel after learning of the mullanes unrecorded bill of sale.
chambers and farese appeal from the district court judgment and award of punitive damages,and the mullanes from the district court order of attorneys fees and costs 
as an initial matter,chambers and farese challenge the district court jurisdiction,which we review de novo.see bull hn info,hutson,cir.the amended complaint invoked the district court admiralty jurisdiction pursuant to.subsection,grants to federal district courts original jurisdiction,exclusive of the courts of the states,of any civil case of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction,saving to suitors in all cases all other remedies to which they are otherwise entitled.it is beyond dispute that admiralty jurisdiction extends to possessory and petitory actions.ward peck,how.in this country the ancient jurisdiction over petitory suits or causes of property has been retained by courts of admiralty.matsuda wada,d,collecting cases see also friedell,benedict on admiralty,at ed.a possessory action is one in which a party seeks to recover possession of a vessel of which she has been wrongfully deprived.gallagher unenrolled river queen,cir friedell,supra,at.a petitory suit,on the other hand,is one to assert legal title to a vessel.jones v.one fifty foot gulfstar motor sailing yacht,cir matsuda,d at friedell,supra,at.the procedure to be followed in such cases is set out in rule d of the supplemental rules of the federal rules of civil procedure,which provides,in relevant part,in all actions for possession,partition,and to try title with respect to a vessel,the process shall be by a warrant of arrest of the vessel.
here,the mullanes asserted legal title and sought immediate repossession of their vessel,which allegedly had been wrongfully taken by chambers,farese,and cousins.and pursuant to rule d,they successfully moved the district court to arrest the vessel.the district court,therefore,had original subject matter jurisdiction under.
chambers and farese rely upon a line of cases holding that actions seeking original possession of the vessel premised upon breach of a purchase agreement for the sale of a vessel fall outside admiralty jurisdiction.see,richard bertram v.the yacht,wanda,cir.chamber and farese reliance on those cases is misplaced.those cases stand for the well established general rule that admiralty will not entertain suits where the substantive rights of the parties flow from a contract to sell or construct a vessel.jones,at.by contradistinction,the mullanes had no contractual relationship with chambers and farese and alleged that they held legal title to the vessel and sought immediate repossession of and damages for harm caused to their vessel.id.
chambers and farese also contend that the court lacked admiralty jurisdiction because the vessel no longer had status as a vessel,as it was out of service at the windward yacht yard in newburyport,massachusetts,and thus not operating commercially or otherwise on a maritime venture or purpose.chambers and farese appear to be invoking the dead ship doctrine,under which a ship loses its status as a vessel when its function is so changed that it has no further navigation function.goodman foot trojan vessel.registration no,cir see also dluhos floating and abandoned vessel,known as new york,cir.simply taking a vessel temporarily out of service,however,does not render it a dead ship as the supreme court has instructed,it is generally accepted that a vessel does not cease to be a vessel when she is not voyaging,but is at anchor,berthed,or at dockside.chandris,latsis,d internal quotation marks omitted.chambers and farese offer no authority for the proposition that the duration and location of the cent anni storage takes it out of admiralty jurisdiction.in any event,the sheriff department seized the vessel at the seaport marina in lynn,massachusetts only later was the vessel moved to newburyport,where it was temporarily taken out of navigation for security purposes.
we now turn to the merits.first,we address chambers and farese appeal of the district court ruling that the mullanes unrecorded bill of sale was valid against them.we then turn to their challenge to the award of in punitive damages.finally,we address the mullanes appeal of the district court award of in attorneys fees.
chambers and farese appeal on the theory that the unrecorded conveyance is invalid as against them under the plain language of a before determining this issue,however,we first address the mullanes claim that the levy was not properly issued under state law.
after finding that the sheriff department was required to comply with.laws ch,before seizing the vessel,the district court held that the seizure was contrary to state law because n o order or affidavit was attached to the execution,nor was any writ of attachment filed with th e district court.we disagree.section simply does not apply to levies of execution section applies only to prejudgment attachments.a prejudgment attachment is a process issued by the court before judgment has been rendered,authorizing the seizure of the real and personal property of the defendant to be held as security for any judgment the plaintiff may recover in the action.such attachments are governed by.laws ch,and.civ.
in contrast,a writ of execution is the process by which the judgment creditor satisfies a money judgment against the judgment debtor.civ.miller london.it constitutes a court order to a sheriff or other authorized officer to seize and sell the property,real or personal,of the debtor,and in some cases in default of property to take the body of the debtor and commit him to jail.miller,at.executions,in general,are governed by.laws ch,and.civ,and levies of executions on personal property are governed by.laws.ch.other than pointing to the requirements of.laws.ch,the mullanes rely on no other statute or case law,and we found none,that requires the sheriff department to do more than what they did in this case.in short the levy of the vessel was proper,and thus chambers and farese perfected their interest in the vessel by taking possession of it before the mullanes had recorded their prior purchase agreement.
this brings us to the central issue of the case whether the recording statute relating to federally documented vessels,renders an unrecorded bill of sale or conveyance invalid as against a seller judgment creditors who levy the vessel without notice.subsection a,a,states 
a bill of sale,conveyance,mortgage,assignment,or related instrument,whenever made,that includes any part of a documented vessel or a vessel for which an application for documentation is filed,must be filed with the secretary of transportation to be valid,to the extent the vessel is involved,against any person except 
a the grantor,mortgagor,or assignor 
b the heir or devisee of the grantor,mortgagor,or assignor and 
c a person having actual notice of the sale,conveyance,mortgage,assignment,or related instrument.
emphasis added.despite the unambiguous language of the statute,the mullanes essentially ask that we rewrite it to read,against any person excluding judgment creditors.certainly an argument can be made that the drafters intended to protect only subsequent purchasers,mortgagees,and possibly creditors who had something in the nature of a specific lien on the vessel and to exclude other general creditors of the vendor,like chambers and farese.nonetheless,strictly as a matter of policy,congress could have decided also to protect general creditors.see,graeber hickel inv,discussing policy reasons for protecting creditors who rely on title records before levying.in fact,as we demonstrate below,congress has excluded judgment creditors from the protections of other recording statutes.here,we are faced with plain and unambiguous language that extends the protections of the recording statute to any person,and like other courts that have considered the issue,we find no extraordinary circumstances sufficient to require us to look beyond its plain meaning.the parties in this controversy failed to brief the issue in any helpful manner neither brief provides developed argumentation or cites to any case law supporting the respective positions,even though such case law is available and listed in the annotations to the statute.and the subsection is never mentioned in the district court opinion.in sum,given the plain and unambiguous language of the statute,we hold that the mullanes unrecorded bill of sale is invalid against chambers and farese unless they had actual notice.
in construing the terms of a statute,we start with the statutory text,according it its ordinary meaning by reference to the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.robinson shell oil,d see also in re bajgar,cir.when the statutory language is plain and unambiguous,judicial inquiry is complete,except in rare and exceptional circumstances.rubin united states,d internal quotations and citations omitted see also barnhart sigmon coal,d pritzker yari,cir we will not depart from,or otherwise embellish,the language of a statute absent either undeniable textual ambiguity or some other extraordinary consideration,such as the prospect of yielding a patently absurd result.this is not one of those cases.
there is nothing ambiguous about the term any person.congress chose the broadest possible term to describe the third parties it intended to protect,and did not qualify the term in any way.the statute as written thus extends protection to any creditors,including judgment creditors like chambers and farese,who rely upon the record title of the vessel.several state supreme courts have applied the statute accordingly.graeber hickel inv,alaska benner scandinavian am.bank,secrist german ins,ohio potter irish,see also ellis rickett,citing parker mills jacot.lewistown propane ford,construing similar provision of federal aviation act as protecting judgment creditors bank of honolulu davids,same marsden flight,same.these courts reasoned that congress intended to protect any third party,including attachment or judgment creditors,who relies upon the title records and found no evidence that congress intended to exclude any class of persons from the term any person.neither have we.
this reading of the subsection is reinforced when considering its remarkable breadth when compared with the language congress has used in other recording statutes.see,d c onveyance shall be void as against any subsequent purchaser or mortgagee for a valuable consideration,without notice,unless it is filed for recording in the plant variety protection office emphasis added d c onveyance shall be void as against any subsequent purchaser or mortgagee for a valuable consideration,unless it is recorded in the office of the administrator emphasis added c onveyance shall be void as against any subsequent purchaser or mortgagee for a valuable consideration,without notice,unless it is recorded in the patent and trademark office.if congress meant to exclude a particular class of persons from the protection of a,it certainly knew how and could have done so clearly and explicitly.
our acceptance of the term any person at face value is further buttressed by the overall purpose of the subsection.the language of subsection a,like that of other recording statutes,reveals a legislative intent to protect third parties who rely upon the title records of the vessel.like other creditors,judgment creditors rely upon these documents at expense and risk.if a wrongful levy is made on a vessel,which is then sold at a sheriff sale,they could be held liable for trespass,conversion,and damages,and would be responsible for their own legal fees in defending the levy against unrecorded interests.this case presents an apt illustration.in addition to being responsible for their own legal fees in defending the levy,chambers and farese were held responsible for in punitive damages for pressing their claim to the vessel.furthermore,as a unanimous alaska supreme court reasoned,an attaching or judgment creditor could be injured by their reliance on the erroneous title record the creditor might be liable to the holder of the unrecorded bill of sale for damages resulting from the sinking of the vessel or for its lost use even though the creditor seized the vessel in reliance on the record of ownership exactly as it should have.graeber,at.
it is also worth noting that,despite the case law extending protection to attachment and judgment creditors and the use of more specific terms in other recording statutes,see,c onveyance shall be void as against any subsequent purchaser or mortgagee for a valuable consideration,without notice,unless it is recorded,congress has twice reenacted the recording statute and retained the term any person to describe the third parties it intended to protect 
we recognize that two state courts have reached a different conclusion,holding that the statute was intended to protect only subsequent purchasers and mortgagees.these courts relied on the general common law rule that the rights of an attaching or judgment creditor are no greater than those held by the debtor in other words,the creditor rights are limited to the debtor actual title in the property.fort pitt bank williams,so,richardson montgomery.the williams court further reasoned that the vessel recording statute was passed simply to protect persons who have dealt on the faith of the recorded title,and as to whom it would be fraud to give effect to unrecorded titles to their detriment,a group which would not include judgment creditors.so.at.
simply relying upon the common law principle of first in time,first in right is unpersuasive.at common law,without the benefit of recording statutes,this same principle applied to subsequent purchasers and mortgagees.tiffany jones,tiffany real prop.ch.if a conveyed property to b and then made an identical conveyance to c,b prevailed over c on the theory that a no longer had any interest to convey.taking the argument to its logical terminus then would lead to the unpalatable result that subsequent purchasers would not be protected by the vessel statute on the ground that when they purchased the vessel,the vendor no longer had an interest to sell.but the recording act changed this result.moreover,while it is ordinarily true that the rights of an attaching or judgment creditor do not have priority over a prior unrecorded conveyance,many states have abrogated this principle by protecting creditor rights through a recording statute.see,in re muller,construing ann.as protecting judgment creditors whitaker hill,holding that former version of.property code ann.changed the common law rule by protecting execution creditors see also sky harbor,jenner,hillside.bank cavanaugh,blum schwartz,hitz metro.bank.and to say that judgment creditors who rely on the faith of the recorded title when levying their execution do not do so to their detriment is baseless.as we said,judgment creditors may rely upon title records at the risk of being held liable for trespass,conversion,and any damage sustained to the vessel during a wrongful levy.
most important,these courts point to no textual basis for saying that subsection a applies to purchasers and mortgagees alone.certainly congress is not required to list every person it had in mind when it says that it is protecting any person.in short,without some indication from congress that it intended to exclude judgment creditors,we will not engraft such a policy limitation on the statute.as instructed by the supreme court,courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.when the words of a statute are unambiguous,then,this first canon is also the last judicial inquiry is complete.bank germain,d quoting rubin,at.because subsection a is explicit as to whom it protects,our inquiry is at an end 
chambers and farese are not yet out of the deep,however.the recording statute protects only those persons having no actual notice of the unrecorded conveyance at the time their interests attached.a c.the district court found that chambers and farese had notice of the unrecorded conveyance either at the time of the seizure or soon thereafter.the crucial question,however,is whether they had actual notice either before or at the time of the levy.it is not sufficient that they learned of the unrecorded conveyance after they levied upon the vessel.because the district court did not apply subsection a and did not make a factual finding as to whether chambers and farese had actual notice at the time of the levy,we remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.if chambers and farese did not have actual notice,then the mullanes complaint against them should be dismissed,and their seizure of the vessel was valid to enforce a judgment debt against the murphys.because the vessel has now been released under what would in those circumstances be an erroneous order,we leave it to the district court on remand to sort through the remaining issues.
we make one final note.if the district court finds that chambers and farese had actual notice of the transfer,there remains the issue of whether the transfer was fraudulent as defined by section of the uniform fraudulent transfer act.laws.ch,which would allow chambers and farese to avoid it under.laws.ch.despite being raised in chambers and farese counterclaim,the district court never cited to or analyzed chapter,presumably because of its holding that the validity of the transfer was governed by federal law,not state law.see mullane,d at.however,we agree with chambers and farese that state law governs the validity of the transfer and that the district court should have considered whether the transfer was avoidable under.laws.ch,whether the mullanes had any defenses under.laws.ch.see chase manhattan fin.servs.mcmillian,cir holding that state law,not admiralty,governs the validity of transfers of title paul fire marine ins.vest transp,cir jones,at applying florida law to determine title loveland,east west towing,cir gilmore black,supra,at noting that contracts for the sale of a vessel are stewart rivara.
we recognize that.laws ch,provides several defenses to a person who took in,which vary depending on whether the person had paid reasonably equivalent value for the property,and that the district court found that mullane was a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of any adverse claims to the vessel and thus concluded that whether the underlying transaction was fraudulent was immaterial.in making this ruling,however,the court failed to consider the specific sections of or the case law interpreting chapter and instead patched together definitions and elements from the massachusetts uniform commercial code in determining whether a defense to a fraudulent transfer existed.it also made its ruling without ever determining whether the underlying transfer to mullane was fraudulent under.laws.ch.we can not say from the district court opinion whether its use of a hodgepodge of definitions and standards and its failure to make an initial determination of whether the transfer was,in fact,fraudulent made any difference in this case.we believe that it is in the interests of all concerned to have the entire fraudulent transfer claim decided by the district court in the first instance.we therefore vacate the district court ruling on this issue and remand the case to the district court so that it may ascertain whether the sale was a fraudulent transfer.
chambers and farese also appeal the district court award of in punitive damages.even though the plaintiffs did not seek punitive damages,the court sua sponte awarded them,reasoning that 
defendants conduct in this case constituted an intentional and conscious disregard for the rights of plaintiffs.when the defendants had the vessel seized they were either aware,or soon became aware,that murphy had sold his ownership interest in the vessel to mullane.they nevertheless continued to assert a right to the vessel in satisfaction of david murphy debt,and by that course of action deprived mullane of his rights with respect to possession and use of the vessel.
mullane chambers,d.essentially,the court awarded punitive damages merely because chambers and farese continued to assert their legal claims to the vessel after the mullanes finally presented their bill of sale.given our holding above,there is no longer a basis for the award.but it is important to note that we would have reversed even if we had found in favor of the mullanes.it is true that punitive damages are available in admiralty where defendant intentional or wanton and reckless conduct amounted to a conscious disregard of the rights of others.ceh,seafarer,cir collecting cases.however,it is equally true that punitive damages are rarely imposed.id.it should go without saying that simply presenting a defense in a lawsuit is not the type of conduct that warrants punitive damages.this was not a case by the mullanes of abuse of process or malicious prosecution,nor was there any finding of a violation of rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.tellingly,at oral argument the mullanes agreed that there was nothing in the record to support punitive damages and that they could not defend such an award.thus,we reverse the award of in punitive damages.
finally,we turn to the mullanes appeal of the district court award of attorneys fees to the sheriff department there is a nagging issue of jurisdiction since the mullanes filed their notice of appeal more than thirty days after the june final judgment was entered.fed.a providing that notice of appeal must be filed within days after the judgment or order has been entered id.a a judgment or order is entered for purposes of this rule a when it is entered in compliance with rules and a of the federal rules of civil procedure.
we think it helpful to sketch the procedural background.after the district court granted the sheriff department motion to bar claims concerning damages to the mechanical,electrical,and plumbing systems on the ground that the mullanes had engaged in bad faith conduct to prevent the sheriff department from mounting a defense,the department filed a motion for attorneys fees under rule d of the federal rules of civil procedure,invoking the court inherent powers to sanction the mullanes.on march,the court issued an opinion and order,in which it awarded attorneys fees,made a presumptive finding that a reasonable fee award was the amount of the entire litigation up to that point,and allowed each party five weeks to file a motion for a modification.the order also provided that if no party filed such a motion,the clerk was authorized to make an order awarding attorneys fees in the amount of the court presumptive finding,together with taxable costs.the court opinion and order were entered on the docket on march.on april,the mullanes filed a motion to modify,which the court denied at a case management conference on july.although the clerk made a notation of the court denial on the docket,it did not issue a separate order or judgment.
on the first day of trial,on december,the sheriff department filed a motion for final judgment as to less than all parties under.b on the order granting its motions for summary judgment,to bar claims,and for attorneys fees.the mullanes filed an opposition.finally,on june,the court issued an opinion and order,in which it,among other things,ordered the sheriff department rule b motion to be dismissed as moot and ordered the clerk to enter a final judgment on a separate document as follows for the reasons explained in the opinion and order of june,it is ordered,plaintiffs are hereby declared and adjudged to be the true owners of the motorized yacht cent anni.judgment for the plaintiffs in the amount of,plus costs.the clerk entered the final judgment accordingly on june.
on july,after the time for filing a notice of appeal had expired,the mullanes filed a motion requesting a separate entry of judgment on the orders granting the sheriff department motions for summary judgment and for attorneys fees,or,in the alternative,for leave to file a notice of appeal late.in a memorandum and order issued on august,the court denied the motion.according to the court,taking together the orders of june,allowing in part motion for summary judgment,march,allowing motion for attorneys fees,and june ruling in favor of the sheriff department on immunity grounds,established that the mullanes won nothing against the sheriff department and that the sheriff department won attorneys fees of.the court concluded that w hen the final judgment of june,closed the case,the previous interlocutory orders in favor of the sheriff in some respects and against him in other became final because the case was declared closed by a final judgment.we disagree.
our starting point is rule d.rule d a provides,in part,that upon granting a motion for attorneys fees,t he court shall find the facts and state its conclusions of law as provided in rule a,and a judgment shall be set forth in a separate document as provided in rule.d c emphasis added.former rule required that e very judgment be set forth on a separate document and provided that a judgment is effective only when so set forth and when entered as provided in rule a.the time then for filing a notice of appeal on the order awarding attorneys fees did not start to run unless and until a separate judgment was entered.see,green nevers,cir.
although rule does not require that a separate judgment use any particular words or form of words,nonetheless,we interpret rule fairly strictly as the supreme court has instructed,rule must be mechanically applied to avoid new uncertainties as to the date on which a judgment is entered.united states indrelunas,d.in general,the judgment should be,complete,and describe the parties and the relief to which the party is entitled.willhauck halpin,cir reytblatt denton,cir collecting cases claybrook drilling divanco,cir wright,miller,cooper,federal practice and procedure,at ed.t he separate judgment should be and should not merely incorporate other documents by reference.
in its order denying the mullanes motion for entry of judgment on a separate document,the district court seemed to say that the june final judgment was such a document.we agree that it is the only relevant document,as the court march,conditional order allowing fees and the clerk notation regarding the court denial of the motion to modify clearly do not suffice for rule purposes.see domegan ponte,cir noting that separate judgment must be separate and distinct from any opinion or memorandum accord green,at same and noting that a docket entry is not sufficient.we hold that the june final judgment was insufficient to serve as a separate judgment on the award of attorneys fees the final judgment simply failed to make any mention of the award.we recognize that courts have been willing to accept judgments as sufficient for rule purposes where they incorporate by reference the underlying opinion or order.wright,miller cooper,supra,collecting cases but observing that this is inconsistent with the supreme court pronouncement that the separate document requirement of rule is to be mechanically applied.however,this does not change the result in this case.in the june opinion and order,after acknowledging that it had issued interlocutory orders allowing in part the sheriff department motion for summary judgment and the motion to bar claims,the court stated that those rulings did not dispose of all claims against the department,and went on to hold that the department seizure of the vessel violated state law but that it was immune from damages.in no place in the opinion did the court discuss the award of attorneys fees or intimate that such fees had ever been awarded.it was simply silent on the issue.
because no separate judgment has been entered under rule,the time for filing a notice of appeal has not yet begun to run.see fed.a providing that a judgment or order is entered when it is entered in compliance
