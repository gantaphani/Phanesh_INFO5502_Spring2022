the clean air act authorizes an award of attorney fees whenever the court determines that such award is appropriate.in this case,organizations that settled their clean air act suit against the environmental protection agency prior to adjudication on the merits move for an award of fees.the epa opposes the motion,arguing that only parties who obtain relief may recover fees.applying relevant supreme court precedent,we hold that the clean air act,unlike statutes that authorize fee awards only to prevailing part ies,permits awards to who obtain,through settlement or otherwise,substantial relief prior to adjudication on the merits.because we find an award of fees appropriate under the circumstances of this case,we grant the motion.
title v of the amendments to the clean air act,establishes procedures through which the environmental protection agency may authorize states and localities to issue stationary air pollution source operating permits.see generally appalachian power epa.governors must submit proposals for state or locally administered permit programs n ot later than years after november,and the epa must approve or disapprove the proposed programs within one year of receipt.d see also specifying that state means any permitting authority,including any local agency.if a program substantially meets the requirements for approval,but is not fully approvable,the epa may grant the program interim approval,which shall expire not later than years after such approval,and may not be renewed.g.if a state fails to meet title v deadlines for obtaining program approval,however,the epa must itself promulgate,administer,and enforce a program for that state.id.d,g,i.
in,the epa promulgated d,which language virtually identical to title v that i nterim approval shall expire on a date set by the administrator but not later than years after such approval,and may not be renewed.four years later,in,the epa issued a rule that appended a second sentence to d providing that n otwithstanding the previous sentence,the administrator may,through rulemaking,provide for a longer period of time on an individual basis,but only once per state and extended most existing interim approvals by ten months.operating permits program interim approval extensions.twice again,in and,the epa extended existing interim approvals.extension of operating permits program interim approvals,extension of operating permits program interim approval expiration dates.july.neither rule,however,cited any statutory or regulatory authority for the blanket extension.in fact,both rules expressly stated that the epa was not acting pursuant to d,though the rules reserved the agency purported authority to do so in the future.roughly a week before the blanket interim approval would have expired,the epa issued yet another rule,this time extending existing interim approvals for more than thirty states until december.extension of operating permits program,interim approval expiration dates.may.like the previous extension rules,this rule cited neither statutory nor regulatory authority for the blanket extension.unlike the previous rules,however,it not only failed to expressly reserve the epa authority to offer additional extensions under d,but also gave notice that no additional extensions of interim approval deadlines will be granted.id.at.
sierra club and new york public interest research group filed a petition in this court challenging the epa may,rule as contrary to title v.after petitioners had filed their opening brief and six days before the epa brief was due,the parties reached a settlement and filed a joint motion requesting a stay of proceedings.under the settlement,the epa agreed to grant no further interim approval extensions remove the language from d purportedly authorizing the epa to extend interim approvals beyond two years on a basis initiate a formal process for interested parties to identify deficiencies in both fully approved and interim programs and provide responses to all comments received through the process.the settlement agreement provided that if the epa breached any of its promises,petitioners could ask the court to lift the stay and set a new briefing schedule.the settlement agreement also obligated the parties to seek joint dismissal if,by december,the epa had fulfilled its promises.dismissal,the agreement stated,would provide an opportunity for sierra club to petition this court for attorneys fees within a reasonable period of time,which petition epa may oppose.
in january,after the epa fulfilled its obligations under the settlement agreement,this court,at the parties request,dismissed the case.acting pursuant to the settlement agreement and citing caa section f,f,petitioners then filed a motion requesting attorney fees.section f provides in any judicial proceeding under this section,the court may award costs of litigation including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees whenever it determines that such award is appropriate.id.
because the parties have agreed on the amount that the epa will pay if this court rules for petitioners,the only question before us is whether a fee award is appropriate in the first place.the epa argues that section f whenever appropriate standard does not authorize fee awards to parties,such as petitioners,whose litigation produces no relief.according to petitioners,their role as a catalyst in halting the epa practice of serially extending interim approvals makes a fee award appropriate.
whether petitioners role as a catalyst permits fee awards under section f turns on the meaning of two supreme court decisions.in ruckelshaus sierra club,d,the supreme court held that section f whenever appropriate standard prohibits awards to parties who lose on the merits.in buckhannon board care home,west virginia department of health human resources,d,the court held that a different statutory standard,one that authorizes fee awards to prevailing part ies,prohibits awards to catalyst parties,defined as those who achieve the desired result s because the lawsuit s brought about voluntary change s in the defendant s conduct.id.at.at.because ruckelshaus did not involve a catalyst party,and because buckhannon,which did,concerned a different statute,neither case addresses the precise issue we face here.even so,the parties,though they read ruckelshaus and buckhannon quite differently,agree that the two cases are dispositive,as do we.
ruckelshaus began when this court found a fee award to be appropriate because the parties requesting fees,though having lost on the merits,had served as expert and articulate spokesmen for environmental interests without whom the process of judicial review might have been fatally skewed.sierra club gorsuch.the supreme court reversed,explaining that i t is difficult to draw any meaningful guidance from f use of the word appropriate,which means only specially suitable fit,proper.ruckelshaus,at.at citation omitted.our basic point of reference,the court said,is the american rule,under which parties bear their own attorney fees.id.at.the court explained that although congress has often departed from the american rule by shifting fees from the prevailing,substantially prevailing,or successful party to the losing party,the additional departure of shifting fees from the losing party to the winning party would require a clear showing that this result was intended.id.at.at.moreover,the court explained,because section f affects fee awards against the united states,as well as against private individuals,it triggers the interpretive canon that w aivers of immunity must be construed strictly in favor of the sovereign and not enlarged beyond what the language requires.id.at.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.applying these two interpretive presumptions,the court concluded that the term appropriate modifies but does not completely reject the traditional rule that a fee claimant must prevail before it may recover attorney fees.id.at.at.
the court found support for this conclusion in its analysis of the statute legislative history.the court began by quoting from a house report stating that,i n the case of the section judicial review litigation,the purposes of the authority to award fees are not only to discourage frivolous litigation,but also to encourage litigation which will assure proper implementation and administration of the act or otherwise serve the public interest.id.at.quoting,at.the report goes on to explain,in language italicized by the court,that t he committee did not intend that the court discretion to award fees under this provision should be restricted to cases in which the party seeking fees was the prevailing party.id.seeking to determin e the meaning of congress rejection of the prevailing party standard,the court then surveyed lower court decisions that had applied the prevailing party standard in a variety of rather narrow ways,concluding that s ection f was meant to expand the class of parties eligible for fee awards from prevailing parties to partially prevailing achieving some success,even if not major success.id.at.emphases in original.
the court also quoted from the senate report on caa section d,upon which section f was modeled,noting that b ecause d and f have similar meanings,the history of is relevant to a construction of f.id.at.at.the quoted senate report explains that t he courts should recognize that in bringing legitimate actions under this section citizens would be performing a public service and in such instances the courts should award costs of litigation to such party.id.at.at quoting,at emphasis in original.the report then explains that fee awards should extend to plaintiffs in actions which result in successful abatement but do not reach a verdict.for instance,if as a result of a citizen proceeding and before a verdict is issued,a defendant abated a violation,the court may award litigation expenses borne by the plaintiffs in prosecuting such actions.id.analyzing the senate report,the court concluded in footnote passage central to our view of the instant 
congress found it necessary to explicitly state that the term appropriate extended to suits that forced defendants to abandon illegal conduct,although without a formal court order this was no doubt viewed as a somewhat expansive innovation,since,under law,some courts awarded fees only to parties formally prevailing in court.we are unpersuaded by the argument that this same congress was so sure that appropriate also would extend to the far more novel,costly,and intuitively unsatisfying result of awarding fees to unsuccessful parties that it did not bother to mention the fact.if congress had intended the result urged by respondents,it plainly would have said so,as is demonstrated by congress careful statement that a less sweeping innovation was adopted.
id.internal citation omitted emphases in original.
buckhannon involved a motion for fees under the fair housing amendments act and the americans with disabilities act,both of which authorize courts to grant the prevailing party a reasonable attorney fee.c.the plaintiff brought a preemption challenge to a state law,but the action became moot after the state legislature repealed the allegedly preempted law.even though the court never ruled on the merits,the plaintiff sought an award of attorney fees,arguing that its suit was the catalyst for the repeal.
the supreme court began its analysis by observing that the term prevailing party is a legal term of art.buckhannon,at.at.quoting from black law dictionary,the court explained that prevailing party means a party in whose favor a judgment is rendered.id.surveying its own precedents involving prevailing party statutes,the court observed that it had never approved an award of attorney fees without some degree of formal success,concluding 
a defendant voluntary change in conduct,although perhaps accomplishing what the plaintiff sought to achieve by the lawsuit,lacks the necessary judicial imprimatur on the change.our precedents thus counsel against holding that the term prevailing party authorizes an award of attorney fees without a corresponding alteration in the legal relationship of the parties.
id.at.at emphasis in original.turning to legislative history,the court found it at best ambiguous as to the availability of the catalyst theory for awarding attorney fees.id.at.at.although the court also briefly discussed the parties various policy arguments,it concluded that,g iven the clear meaning of prevailing party in the feeshifting statutes,we need not determine which way these various policy arguments cut.id.at.at.at no point in the opinion did the court discuss ruckelshaus,much less cite it.
it is on the field of ruckelshaus and buckhannon that the parties in this case do battle.according to the epa,section f plain language and legislative history,interpreted in light of the canons of construction employed in ruckelshaus,require that,to be eligible for a fee award,a party must have received some form of relief.ruckelshaus footnote eight discussion of the catalyst theory,the epa insists,is dictum.the epa also contends that because ruckelshaus says that section f applies only to fully and partially prevailing parties,at.at,buckhannon rejection of the catalyst theory for prevailing party statutes applies to section f as well.petitioners have a very different view of these two cases.they argue that ruckelshaus s footnote eight interpretation of section f controls.buckhannon,they insist,applies only to prevailing party provisions.
were we operating on a clean slate concerning section f meaning,we would accept the epa invitation to apply standard tools of statutory construction,including ruckelshaus presumptions against inferring departures from the american rule and waivers of sovereign immunity.our slate,however,is far from clean,for in resolving the issue before it in ruckelshaus,the supreme court engaged in an analysis of section f and its legislative history that determines the outcome of the catalyst issue we face here.specifically,ruckelshaus interprets the senate report as demonstrating that congress did in fact authorize fee awards under section f for suits that forced defendants to abandon illegal conduct,although without a formal court order.at.at.the court explained that the less sweeping innovation recovery without formal court order was adopted,while the more result recovery by parties losing on the merits was not.id.emphases in original.the epa resists this interpretation,but neither in its brief nor at oral we spent considerable time on the it able to offer any interpretation of the less sweeping innovation that congress adopted other than the catalyst theory.id.
at bottom,the epa only real argument against treating footnote eight as controlling authority is to dismiss it as dictum.for this inferior court,const.art.iii,cl,however,that argument carries no weight since carefully considered language of the supreme court,even if technically dictum,generally must be treated as authoritative.united states oakar,internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also bangor.ferc,it may be dicta,but supreme court dicta tends to have somewhat greater when expressed so unequivocally.
moreover,we are not at all certain that footnote eight is dictum.the footnote logic is this we know congress authorized catalyst fee recoveries because it said so therefore we assume congress rejected losing party recoveries because it remained silent on the issue.to reject the validity of the first the epa pull the rug from under footnote eight.to be sure,footnote eight is only one among several justifications that ruckelshaus gives for its ultimate holding,but we can not ignore the unmistakable import of a supreme court decision analysis.oakar,at.
our understanding of ruckelshaus also comports with the supreme court conclusion,this time in true dictum,that whenever appropriate language in the clean water act authorizes fee awards in cases where the plaintiff obtains no relief.in gwaltney of smithfield,chesapeake bay foundation,d,the court held that citizens may sue under the clean water act only for present,not past,statutory violations.discussing the possibility that statutory violators could strategically moot enforcement actions by complying with the statute after the actions had been filed,the court observe
