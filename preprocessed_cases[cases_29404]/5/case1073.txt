in this opinion,we address whether the supreme court decision in quality king distributors,research international,d,requires us to overrule our precedents that allow a defendant in a copyright infringement action to claim the first sale doctrine of a as a defense only where the disputed copies of a copyrighted work were either made or previously sold in the united states with the authority of the copyright owner.omega omega filed claims for infringing distribution and importation under and a in response to costco wholesale corporation costco unauthorized sale of authentic,imported omega watches bearing a design registered at the copyright office.the district court granted summary judgment to costco on the basis of the first sale doctrine,and awarded attorney fees.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we reverse.
this circuit has construed a to provide no defense to an infringement action under and a that involves,nonpiratical copies of a work,unless those same copies have already been sold in the united states with the copyright owner authority.we hold that the first portion of this construction is not clearly irreconcilable with quality king,and that it remains the law of this circuit.see miller gammie,cir en banc.because there is no genuine dispute that omega made the copies of the disputed design in switzerland,and that costco sold them in the united states without omega authority,the first sale doctrine is unavailable as a defense to omega claims.
factual and procedural background 
the facts are not disputed.omega manufactures watches in switzerland and sells them globally through a network of authorized distributors and retailers.engraved on the underside of the watches is a omega globe design.
costco obtained watches bearing the copyrighted design from the gray market in the following manner omega first sold the watches to authorized distributors overseas.unidentified third parties eventually purchased the watches and sold them to ene limited,a new york company,which in turn sold them to costco.costco then sold the watches to consumers in california.although omega authorized the initial foreign sale of the watches,it did not authorize their importation into the united states or the sales made by costco.
omega filed a lawsuit alleging that costco acquisition and sale of the watches constitute copyright infringement under and a,and subsequently moved for summary judgment.costco filed a on the basis of a,arguing that,under the first sale doctrine,omega initial foreign sale of the watches precludes claims of infringing distribution and importation in connection with the subsequent,unauthorized sales.the district court ruled without explanation in favor of costco on both motions.the court also awarded in attorney fees to costco under.this appeal followed.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment under federal rule of civil procedure.buono,cir.rule c provides that summary judgment is warranted when the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.we review a district court award of attorney fees under for an abuse of discretion.columbia pictures television,krypton broad.of birmingham,cir.
iii.discussion 
the viability of omega infringement claims hinges on the relationship among three sections of the copyright act of,a,and a.in relevant part,a reads 
importation into the united states,without the authority of the owner of copyright under this title,of copies of a work that have been acquired outside the united states is an infringement of the exclusive right to distribute copies under section,actionable under section.
section states 
subject to sections through,the owner of copyright under this title has the exclusive rights to distribute copies of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership,or by rental,lease,or lending.
finally,a provides 
notwithstanding the provisions of section,the owner of a particular copy lawfully made under this title,or any person authorized by such owner,is entitled,without the authority of the copyright owner,to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of that copy 
this last section codifies the first sale doctrine,which holds that o nce a copyright owner consents to the sale of particular copies of his work,he may not thereafter exercise the distribution right with respect to those copies.melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright b,at ed.
the text of the copyright act establishes by syllogism that the first sale doctrine of a limits a first,given that is subject to sections through and falls within the designated portion of the code,a limits the exclusive distribution right in.second,infringing importation under a is merely a subcategory of infringement of the exclusive right to distribute copies under section,so conduct that does not violate can not constitute infringement under a.finally,because conduct covered by a does not violate,and because absent a violation of there can not be infringement under a,conduct covered by a does not violate a.in short,infringement does not occur under or a where the owner of a particular copy lawfully made under this title imports and sells that copy without the authority of the copyright owner.a see quality king,res.int l,d adopting this interpretation.
omega concedes that a generally limits and a,but contends that a does not apply in this case.specifically,omega argues that a provides no defense to the infringement claims because,although the omega globe design was copyrighted in the united states,the watches bearing the design were manufactured and first sold overseas.omega claims that the copies of the design were not lawfully made under title in these circumstances.a.costco responds that although omega position is correct under bmg music perez,cir,parfums givenchy,drug emporium,cir,and denbicare toys r us,cir,the supreme court effectively overruled those cases in quality king.for the reasons set forth below,we hold that quality king did not invalidate our general rule that a can provide a defense against and a claims only insofar as the claims involve domestically made copies of works.because we also conclude that the exception to that rule does not apply,a provides no defense in this case.
current rule in the circuit 
omega position was clearly correct under king ninth circuit precedent.this court has twice held on indistinguishable facts that a provides no defense against a claim under a.in bmg music,the defendant purchased copies of the plaintiffs,sound recordings,imported them into the united states without the plaintiffs authorization,and then sold them to the public.at.following cbs scorpio music distributors,aff without opinion,cir,we held that a provided no defense against a claim under a in the circumstances because the phrase lawfully made under this title in a grants first sale protection only to copies legally made and sold in the united states,and the copies at issue were made and first sold abroad.at.the rationale for this interpretation was twofold first,a contrary interpretation would impermissibly extend the copyright act extraterritorially.id.citing scorpio.at.second,the application of a after foreign sales would render virtually meaningless as a tool against the unauthorized importation of nonpiratical copies because importation is almost always preceded by at least one lawful foreign sale that will have exhausted the distribution right on which a is premised.id.at quoting scorpio.at.
drug emporium,followed bmg music by holding on similar material facts that a provided no defense.however,we criticized the prior interpretation of a key phrase lawfully made under this title.by permitting the first sale defense only against claims involving copies that are legally made and sold in the united states,bmg music appeared to give greater copyright protection to copies than to their domestically made counterparts.see at.we found that such a result would be untenable,and that nothing in the legislative history or text of supp
