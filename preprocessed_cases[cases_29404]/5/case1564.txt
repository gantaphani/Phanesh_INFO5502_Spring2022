fletcher prepared and filed a complaint for conversion against gilbert and gernsbacher.prior to filing the complaint,fletcher sent master washer a memorandum setting forth his understanding of the terms of their oral retainer agreement.master washer president,william scallon,represented to fletcher that he would sign a written retainer agreement,but never did so.the suits between gilbert and master washer were consolidated.
while the washer litigation was pending,fletcher agreed to do additional,personal legal work on behalf of scallon and scallon mother.in each matter,scallon,on behalf of master washer,orally granted fletcher a lien on master washer prospective recovery against gilbert in the conversion action.
