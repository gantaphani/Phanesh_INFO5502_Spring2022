plaintiffs paula lauren gibson and annette work for the office of the attorney general of the state of california oag as a lawyer and a paralegal,respectively.in violation of an internal policy of the oag,gibson represented in a private legal malpractice case without first having obtained permission from the oag.the oag informed gibson that she would be fired if she continued the private representation.plaintiffs then filed this action against the oag and individual,alleging a violation of their first amendment rights and a breach of contract.we hold that the district court properly dismissed the action under federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim,but erred in awarding attorney fees to defendants.
factual background 
first amendment claim 
gibson works as a deputy attorney general in the antitrust law section of the oag.is employed as a senior legal analyst in the same section.on june,gibson filed a private legal malpractice action on behalf of against a california divorce lawyer in the los angeles superior court.the malpractice claim related to the divorce lawyer representation of in a divorce proceeding.although the oag requires its lawyers to obtain permission in advance to engage in the private practice of law,gibson did not seek permission to represent until nearly a year after filing the malpractice case.defendant kathleen foote,senior assistant attorney general for the antitrust law section,ultimately denied gibson request on the ground that the existence of a separate,pending claim by the divorce lawyer against gibson with the state board of control created a conflict of interest.
gibson filed a grievance concerning the denial of her request to represent.gibson argued that the oag policy of requiring advance permission for engaging in the private practice of law violates the first amendment.four months later,without any formal action in response to gibson grievance,gibson was informed that she would be terminated from her employment with the oag if she did not withdraw from representing in the malpractice action.
immediately thereafter,defendant james thomas greene,the chief assistant attorney general for the public rights division,reviewed and denied gibson grievance.he noted in his denial that it is difficult for a deputy attorney general to engage in the private practice of law and not come into conflict with the oag interests or those of a client.he also noted that the process is necessary to prevent conflicts between a public employee official duties and his or her outside activities,and he opined that the process is not an unconstitutional prior restraint.
gibson appealed the denial of her grievance,and defendant richard frank,chief deputy attorney general,upheld the denial.he agreed with greene conclusions that the oag requirement is not an unconstitutional prior restraint and that gibson involvement in the malpractice action created a conflict of interest.gibson appealed frank decision to the department of personnel administration.her appeal was denied.
around the same time that gibson submitted her grievance and appeals,she requested and received permission to represent herself in connection with two additional legal matters related to the underlying malpractice case involving the divorce lawyer.first,she received permission to appeal a sanctions order that had been issued against her in that action,subject to certain limitations,including that the representation be confined to specific issues,oag resources not be used and gibson affiliation with the oag not be invoked,and any criticisms of gibson performance by the appellate court made in the course of the appeal be reported promptly to the oag.
gibson also was given permission to file a malicious prosecution action against the divorce lawyer.the conditions placed on gibson by the oag were that she would not disparage the oag or its policies she would not use office time,materials,staff,or equipment she would not invoke the oag or her title in her representation,and she would report to greene any criticisms or concerns expressed by the court during the case.
contract claim 
in july,gibson entered into a written agreement with the oag,which provided that gibson would transfer to the antitrust law section from the health,education,and welfare section.the agreement was a response to gibson complaints of disability discrimination and denial of reasonable accommodations,which she had made to the state personnel board and department of fair employment and housing.provided many of the reasonable accommodation services required by gibson.alleges that she had an oral agreement with oag that mirrored gibson written agreement.
plaintiffs assert that their respective agreements provided that transfer to the antitrust law section would take place in order for plaintiffs to make a fresh start,the reasonable accommodations previously provided would continue,all other conditions of employment would remain the same,and attorney fees for enforcement of the agreements would be available.plaintiffs allege that these agreements were breached by the oag denying gibson certain overtime assistance,not making reasonable accommodation assistance a priority over her other work,and denying plaintiffs flexible work hours.
procedural background 
plaintiffs filed suit against the oag and a number of employees within the oag.plaintiffs claimed a breach of contract by defendants and,under,a violation of plaintiffs first amendment rights.defendants filed a motion to dismiss,arguing that they were entitled to qualified immunity because plaintiffs failed to allege that they had engaged in any protected first amendment activity.the district court agreed with defendants,but gave plaintiffs an opportunity to file an amended complaint to address the protected activity at issue and the adverse employment actions taken.with regard to the contract claim,the district court held that plaintiffs failed to allege conduct that was inconsistent with the terms of the transfer agreement.the district court also held that,even if plaintiffs had alleged breach of a particular contractual term,they failed to allege any foreseeable contract damages.as a result,the district court dismissed plaintiffs contract claim with prejudice but allowed plaintiffs to file an amended complaint with regard to their claims.
plaintiffs did not file an amended pleading.accordingly,defendants asked the district court to dismiss the entire action,and the district court did so.plaintiffs timely appealed.when the district court issued its order granting attorney fees of to defendants,plaintiffs timely appealed that decision as well.we consolidated the appeals.

discussion 
neither private malpractice action nor gibson representation of her was constitutionally protected speech.
in evaluating a first amendment retaliation claim,this court uses a sequential series of questions.eng cooley,cir.those questions are as follows whether the plaintiff spoke on a matter of public concern whether the plaintiff spoke as a private citizen or public employee whether the plaintiff protected speech was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment action whether the state had an adequate justification for treating the employee differently from other members of the general public and whether the state would have taken the adverse employment action even absent the protected speech.id.the pivotal element in this case is the first one whether plaintiffs spoke on a matter of public concern.
unlike the determination regarding whether the plaintiff spoke as a private citizen or as a public employee,which presents a mixed question of fact and law,posey lake pend oreille sch.dist,cir,the public concern inquiry is purely a question of law,which we review de novo.eng,at.moreover,the facts regarding the public concern inquiry are undisputed here.see jeffers gomez,cir per curiam holding that,in the absence of disputed facts,qualified immunity is a question of law.the question presented here is,therefore,a legal one whether plaintiffs private malpractice suit is an issue of public concern.
the supreme court has held that speech involves a matter of public concern when it fairly can be said to relate to any matter of political,social,or other concern to the community.connick myers,d.we have explained further that s peech by public employees may be characterized as not of public concern when it is clear that such speech deals with individual personnel disputes and grievances and that the information would be of no relevance to the public evaluation of the performance of governmental agencies.mckinley city of eloy,cir.in previous cases,we have held that issues of public concern include,for example,speech about police officers wages and relationships with city officials,safety and emergency policies at a public school district,posey,at,sexual abuse of public employees while on the job,freitag ayers,cir,discharges of raw sewage into the environment and exposure of public employees to dangerous contaminants,coszalter city of salem,cir,mismanagement and corruption in county government,johnson multnomah county,cir,leaks to the irs about school property purchase arrangements leading to additional,more expensive public school financing,eng,at,and retaliatory prosecution of a government employee,id.at.
filing a legal malpractice claim against a private lawyer in connection with a private divorce matter is not an issue of public concern.the malpractice action did not involve any suggestion of government malfeasance nor did it purport to inform the public about the operation of government nor was it relevant to the public evaluation of a governmental agency performance nor did it challenge the conduct of any government official or agency,but only that of former divorce lawyer.in short,the malpractice action itself,along with gibson involvement in it,was a private matter between and her former divorce lawyer.the mere fact that the action potentially could have affected the divorce lawyer bar disciplinary record does not transform the litigation into a matter of political,social,or other concern to the public at large.the action remained an individual grievance that did not bear on the public evaluation of the performance of a public agency 
because plaintiffs speech here,filing a private malpractice action,does not qualify as an issue of public concern,it is not constitutionally protected speech in the context of public employment.in the absence of a violation of their constitutional rights,plaintiffs claim against defendants on first amendment grounds must fail.therefore,we hold that defendants did not violate plaintiffs constitutional rights when they denied gibson permission to represent in her private malpractice action.
b.the oag policy regarding outside litigation by its employees does not constitute an improper prior restraint.
plaintiffs also argue more generally that the oag policy regarding outside litigation by its public lawyers who wish to represent themselves or others in private litigation,which defendants applied to gibson here,constitutes an improper prior restraint on their speech by chilling the speech of others who are not before the court.we are not persuaded.
t he state has interests as an employer in regulating the speech of its employees that differ significantly from those it possesses in connection with regulation of the speech of the citizenry in general.pickering bd.of,d.when employee expression can not be fairly considered as relating to any matter of political,social,or other concern to the community,government officials should enjoy wide latitude in managing their offices,without intrusive oversight by the judiciary in the name of the first amendment.connick,at.
we have not addressed precisely whether a public employer policy regulating its employees outside employment activities is a prior restraint on the employees speech,but our decision in hudson craven,cir,provides some guidance to us.in that case,the plaintiff served as an instructor at a community college.id.at.she organized an unofficial field trip for her students to attend a protest against the world trade organization despite being warned not to do so by college officials.id.at.she then sued various college administrators when her employment contract was not renewed after the protest.id.at.we held that the plaintiff rights to free speech and association were at issue.id.at.using the balancing test established in pickering,at,we held further that the professor protest activities were a matter of public concern but that the legitimate administrative interests of the college strongly outweighed the plaintiff first amendment freedoms.hudson,at.
similarly,plaintiffs argument that the oag policy is an unconstitutional prior restraint on their speech must fail.the first pickering inquiry explores whether the speech that led to the adverse employment action relates to a matter of public concern,and the second inquiry questions whether,using a balancing test,the public employer can demonstrate that its legitimate interests outweigh the employee first amendment rights.hudson,at.as we have discussed already,private malpractice action is not a matter of public concern and,therefore,is not entitled to free speech protections.but even if we were to credit plaintiffs assertion that they spoke on an issue of public concern,thereby meeting the threshold for protected speech,the oag policy is constitutionally sound under the second pickering prong.
the court of appeals for the district of columbia is the only federal circuit court that has faced this precise issue previously.in williams irs,per curiam,the court upheld a policy that prohibited an internal revenue service irs lawyer from engaging in the outside practice of law.in that case,the plaintiff was a senior tax lawyer employed by the irs.id.at.he filed a class action lawsuit against a church board of directors for an accounting of trust funds.id.the irs maintained a policy requiring its employees to obtain written permission from the agency before engaging in any outside employment or business activities.id.because the plaintiff had failed to seek such permission,the agency suspended him for five days.id.at.noting that the government may limit the exercise of a citizen first amendment rights where government regulations are aimed to address legitimate concerns,the court upheld the agency policy and the sanctions imposed on the plaintiff.id.the court held that the policy of requiring prior written permission was proper because it was tailored to the government interests in operating efficiently and in avoiding the appearance of impropriety.id.at.the policy did not prohibit all outside activities.rather,it allowed the agency to determine whether there is an apparent conflict of interest,tax issues are involved,official information would be used improperly,or the expenditure of time would adversely affect the employee performance of his or her official duties.id.
the policy at issue here is very similar to the one examined in williams.the oag policy reads in pertinent part 
no lawyer employed by the department of justice shall engage in the private practice of the law,provided,however,that he may handle personal and family legal matters in which there is no conflict with his dut
