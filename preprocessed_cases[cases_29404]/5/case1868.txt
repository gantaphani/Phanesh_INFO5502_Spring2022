a lawsuit brought by an attorney alleging that another attorney improperly solicited his client was subject to the strategic lawsuit against public participation statute,as it arose out of the second attorney communications concerning pending litigation,and was not barred by the commercial speech exception to the statute.the plaintiff attorney failed to establish a probability of prevailing on his claim,and accordingly the trial court correctly granted the defendant attorney special motion to strike the complaint.however,because the defendant attorney represented himself,the trial court erred in awarding him attorney fees under the statute.
factual and procedural background 
taheri law group,apc sued attorney neil evans,asserting causes of action for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and intentional interference with business relations.taheri alleged that it successfully represented alexander sorokurs and his medical corporation sorokurs in several litigation matters for some months,when sorokurs without warning and for cause unknown discharged taheri while still owing taheri more than in fees.on the same day,taheri received a letter from evans,notifying taheri that he was sorokurs new counsel in connection with the matters in which taheri had been representing sorokurs.
in its lawsuit,taheri alleged evans knew of the economic relationship between taheri and sorokurs,and induced sorokurs to terminate his relationship with taheri,promising unobtainable and ethically improper litigation objectives evans promise was that he evans would be able to enforce a settlement agreement to which sorokurs was a party evans without a care moved to enforce the settlement agreement,leaving the plaintiffs adverse parties in the settled actions exposed to further malicious prosecution action.evans allegedly procured the disruption of taheri relationship with sorokurs 
by advising sorokurs to discharge taheri from his duties and refusing to pay for the legal services already rendered by taheri,by reporting as being fraudulent the credit card payments made against sorokurs credit card to pay for the costs of sorokurs matters,by procuring sorokurs insolvency,and by waiving all attorney fees earned by taheri through out the course of eighteen months of litigation of sorokurs matters.
evans brought a special motion to strike the complaint under code of civil procedure section,the statute evans asserted his actions were protected by the statute,as those actions all took place in connection with pending litigation in which taheri interests were allegedly interfered with by evans by evans filings,letters,and other communicative actions in pending litigation.taheri could not establish a probability of prevailing on its claims,evans argued,because evans actions were protected by the litigation privilege civil code section,subdivision b.evans submitted a declaration from sorokurs,which stated that 
in may,a global settlement was reached in the three matters in which taheri was representing him.
in july,he was told by taheri that plaintiffs in the settled litigation were repudiating the settlement agreement.sorokurs asked taheri for written proof of the repudiation,but was never provided with proof,and was told that the litigation would have to continue.
because his goal was to end the litigation through the settlement agreement,sorokurs decided to replace taheri with new legal counsel.
he was referred to evans by a patient,frank keebler,and contacted evans directly.evans did not solicit me,i pursued evans.after meeting with evans on or about november,at my insistence,i decided to hire evans in order to enforce the settlement agreement and to otherwise protect my legal interests 
evans also submitted his own declaration,stating that he was contacted by sorokurs.evans declaration also stated that he read the sorokurs settlement agreement on november,it appeared on its face to be a fully enforceable agreement resolving sorokurs involvement in the three lawsuits,and provided for binding mediation or arbitration of any dispute taheri did not seek to enforce the settlement,instead pursuing motions for attorney fees and costs which were not in sorokurs best interests and he advised taheri and the parties to the settlement agreement that he was seeking to enforce it,which would have the effect of nullifying attorney fee awards and cost awards to sorokurs which had been obtained by taheri after the settlement agreement had been reached.
on may,taheri filed an ex parte application to shorten time to bring motions to compel further responses to discovery,and to continue the hearing date on the motion.the next day,taheri filed its opposition to evans special motion to strike.taheri argued that the statute was not implicated because the gravamen of the action is client stealing,and the action had nothing to do with evans first amendment rights taheri also argued that even if the statute were applicable,the commercial speech exemption in section would bar its application to this case.taheri asserted it would prevail in the case,and in support of its opposition submitted a declaration from payman taheri.taheri described his representation of sorokurs,the tentative settlement,and the july repudiation of the settlement.he stated he could not enforce the settlement because there were no essential terms,and he explained all of this to my client sorokurs and he understood what was going on.taheri stated that evans knew of my relationship with sorokurs,knew what a great client sorokurs would be,took advantage,cornered sorokurs and took that client away from me evans has personally admitted the same to me.taheri also submitted a declaration from its attorney,consisting principally of assertions that evans stole taheri client and that evans and sorokurs were liars.
the trial court granted evans motion,finding evans had demonstrated his conduct was within the terms of the statute,that is,privileged communications and communications in the exercise of rights of litigation in a judicial proceeding,and taheri did not introduce any evidence to establish a prima facie case for its claims.the court also awarded attorney fees of to evans under section,subdivision c.
judgment was entered on july,and this appeal followed 
discussion 
taheri argues its complaint was not subject to the statute,and even if it were,the suit was barred by the commercial speech exception to the statute.in addition,taheri contends the trial court erred in not continuing the hearing on the motion to permit further discovery,in overruling taheri evidentiary objections to the declarations of sorokurs and evans,and in awarding attorney fees to a pro per defendant.we conclude the trial court order granting evans special motion to strike was proper,but that the court erred in awarding attorney fees to evans.
we briefly review the legal principles applicable to motions,and then address each of taheri contentions.
the statute is a procedural remedy to dispose of lawsuits that are brought to chill the valid exercise of first amendment rights of petition and free speech.rusheen cohen cal th,d,rusheen.in evaluating an motion,the trial court first decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action arises from protected activity.id.at,d.a cause of action arising from defendant litigation activity may appropriately be the subject of a section motion to strike.citation,subd.e acts in furtherance of free speech or petition rights include any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a judicial body.acts in furtherance of free speech or petition rights include communicative conduct such as the filing,funding,and prosecution of a civil action.rusheen,supra,cal th at,d.
if the trial court finds the defendant has made a threshold showing that a cause of action arises from protected activity,it must then decide whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.to do so,plaintiff must show the complaint is legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.citation.rusheen,supra,cal th at,d.
taheri causes of action arose from protected activity.
taheri contends its lawsuit did not arise from protected activity.according to taheri,its lawsuit arose from evans conduct soliciting a client,not what evans did when he got into the case.taheri analysis is erroneous.its complaint plainly shows it arose from evans communications with sorokurs about pending litigation,and from evans conduct in enforcing the settlement agreement on sorokurs behalf.the fact that some of evans communications took place while taheri was sorokurs which sorokurs says he irrelevant to the question whether the lawsuit arises from communications made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a judicial body,subd.e.taheri insists that improper solicitation of another attorney client is not subject to the protections of either the statute or the litigation privilege.but the only authority cited for this proposition is jespersen th,d jespersen,in which the court held that a cause of action for legal malpractice was not subject to an motion.jespersen does not assist taheri.in jespersen,the malpractice alleged consisted of the lawyers failure to serve timely discovery responses and to comply with court orders to do so,and did not consist of any act in furtherance of anyone right of petition or free speech,but the lawyers negligent failure to do so on behalf of their clients.jespersen,supra,th at,d.
here,unlike the malpractice cause of action in jespersen,taheri causes of action arise directly from communications between sorokurs and evans about the pending lawsuits against sorokurs.and,as for the litigation privilege,numerous cases have applied it to prelitigation communications rubin green cal th,d,citing cases,and the litigation privilege clearly informs interpretation of the arising from prong of the statute navellier sletten th,d ruiz harbor view community th,d clauses of the statute defining protected activity to include statements made before or in connection with an issue under review by a judicial body are parallel to and coextensive with the definition of privileged communications under civil code section,subdivision b.in short,it is difficult to conjure a clearer scenario than the case before us of a lawsuit arising from protected activity.
taheri causes of action are not excepted from the statute under section.
taheri asserts his causes of action are not subject to the statute because the conduct on which they are based falls within the commercial speech exemption to the statute,as defined in section,subdivision c.again,we disagree.
the statute does not apply to causes of action arising from specified claims against business entities involving commercial speech or conduct,subd.c.the exemption covers any cause of action brought against a person primarily engaged in the business of selling or leasing goods or services,including,but not limited to,insurance,securities,or financial instruments,arising from any statement or conduct by that person,if two conditions exist the statement or conduct consists of representations of fact about the business operations,goods or services of the person or a business competitor,and is made for the purpose of obtaining approval for,promoting,or securing sales or leases of,or commercial transactions in,the person goods or services,or in the course of delivering the goods or services,and t he intended audience is an actual or potential buyer or customer,subds.c c.
if we read the statutory exemption literally,the conduct taheri alleges could arguably be viewed as falling within its scope.thus,a lawyer may be said to be primarily engaged in the business of selling or leasing goods or services,subd.c,because providing legal advice and representation is a service.taheri causes of action arise from a statement or conduct by evans evans is alleged to have advised sorokurs to discharge taheri and to refuse to pay for his services reported as fraudulent payments made with sorokurs credit card for the costs of sorokurs matters and waived attorney fees earned by taheri in litigating sorokurs matters.the two statutory conditions for application of the exemption also appear to be met.evans alleged conduct consists of representations of fact about a business competitor taheri services,made for the purpose of obtaining sales of evans services or,alternatively,the statement or conduct was made in the course of delivering evans services,subd.c.and,evans intended audience was sorokurs,an actual or potential buyer or customer,subd.c.nonetheless,we conclude that a cause of action arising from a lawyer conduct,when the conduct includes advice to a prospective client on pending litigation,does not fall within the statutory exemption to the statute.any other conclusion would be inconsistent with the intent of the legislature when it passed section,and would conflict with the client fundamental right of access to the courts,which necessarily includes the right to be represented by the attorney of his or her choice.
first,the legislative history of the commercial speech exemption to the statute confirms the legislature intent to except from coverage disputes that are purely commercial.see brill media,llc tcw group,th,d section was intended to apply to commercial disputes such as the one before us id.at,d,dissenting opinion t he purpose of the statute appears to have been to immunize comparative advertising by retailers from the special motion to strike statute com.on,on bill reg.sess.as amended may,bill would make slapp motion s inapplicable to cases against a business where the cause of action arises from the business commercial speech or activity see id.at t he consumer attorneys of california,sponsors of sb,assert that sb is needed to stop corporate abuse of the statute.a dispute involving a lawyer advice to a prospective client on pending litigation,however,while it may include an element of commerce or commercial speech,is fundamentally different from the commercial disputes the legislature intended to exempt from the statute.the substance of the statement or conduct from which taheri causes of action arise constituted much more than commercial speech the conduct was in essence advice by a lawyer on a pending legal matter.because that is so,the alleged conduct clearly does not fall within the intendment of the statutory exemption.indeed,the activity alleged is the very sort of activity the statute is designed to cover.
second,construing the commercial speech exemption to encompass a cause of action arising from advice given by a lawyer on a pending legal matter would serve to thwart the client fundamental right of access to the courts,and specifically to the lawyer of his choice.a litigant right to the utmost freedom of access to the courts is too to require discussion action apartment,city of santa monica cal th,d,and the important right to counsel of one choice is likewise.see people ex rel.of corporations speedee oil change systems,cal th,d,collins state of california th,d.the client right to receive legal advice relating to his representation,and to change lawyers if he chooses,would be thwarted if we were to construe the commercial speech exemption to apply to lawyers providing legal advice,even if that advice includes an element of commercial speech.
to be clear,we are not holding that lawyers are categorically excluded from the commercial speech exemption to the statute.like proprietors of other commercial enterprises,the lawyer sells his services to prospective buyer s or customer s.it is also clear that lawyers engage in commercial speech when they advertise their services.leoni state bar cal d,analyzing as commercial speech an attorney massive advertising campaign in the form of personalized mailings to individuals named as defendants in pending lawsuits.consequently,we can envisage as a massive advertising campaign divorced from individualized legal which the commercial speech exemption to the statute conceivably might apply to a lawyer conduct.however,this is not such a case.as the trial cour
