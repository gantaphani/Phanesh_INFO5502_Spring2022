background 
the patent is entitled portable vehicle adhesive remover for removing pinstripes,decals,side moldings and other adhered items from a vehicle and was issued to irving fisher as inventor and to fisher tool company as assignee.the invention relates to a combination of a pneumatic driver with an eraser wheel to remove decals from a motor vehicle.the invention includes a motor unit assembled in a housing,a shank extending from the motor unit,and an eraser wheel attached to the shank.the device operates by using compressed air to rotate the eraser wheel.the rotating eraser wheel engages with an adhered decal on a vehicle causing friction and generating heat,which in turn warms the adhesive and causes the decal to lose its adhesion.
irving fisher,astro founder and former president,filed the patent application with a declaration stating that at the time of the filing,he was not aware of any relevant prior art,and did not perform a novelty search for the purpose of discovering any such prior art.six months after filing the patent application,irving fisher died,and his son,stephen fisher,took over as astro president and directed the prosecution of the patent.the examiner thereafter issued an office action,rejecting claims not relevant to this appeal and allowing present claims the examiner expressly noted that present claims were allowable because none of the art of record shows all of the detailed internal workings of the instant claims including the wave washer,the valve screw and o rings,the valve stem and spring,the exhaust sleeve and o ring,and the roll pins.
after obtaining the patent,astro marketed and sold its patented device both in a combination,as a pneumatic driver with an eraser wheel,and as separate components.when the eraser wheel was sold individually,it was marked with a patent pending label and also with the patent number.in,astro accused s g of infringement of the patent.astro stated in its infringement letter that it believed that s g sales of rubber eraser pads in the united states are contributing to or inducing others to infringe the patent,in violation of b and c.astro concluded its letter by stating that if s g continued to sell its products,astro would not hesitate to initiate litigation to enforce its rights and recover all applicable damages and costs.s g responded by denying any infringement,alleging that its eraser wheel could be used with any pneumatic driver,not solely with astro,and hence was capable of a noninfringing use.various letters were thereafter exchanged between astro and s g with no resolution of the dispute.
astro then sent infringement letters to a number of distributors and suppliers,many of which sold s g eraser wheels.those letters stated that customers who use s g wheels in a tool that is not made by astro pneumatic tool infringe the patent.the letters gave s g customers three options cease all sales of s g wheels,screen all the customers and refuse to sell s g wheels to any who would use them with a tool not made by astro,or continue to sell s g wheels without screening all the customers.if the last option were chosen,the letter stated that the customer could be subject to a lawsuit.after receiving the letters,all the companies that previously sold s g wheels stopped their sales of the eraser wheels.
s g commenced this lawsuit against astro on march,in the united states district court for the district of new jersey,claiming that astro engaged in unfair competition,tortious interference with contractual relations and with prospective economic advantage,false marking,and violations of the lanham act and the new jersey fair trade act.s g sought a judgment that it did not infringe the patent and an injunction ordering astro to cease its threatening communications with s g customers.s g also sought damages for astro alleged tortious acts.astro counterclaimed that s g contributorily infringed and induced infringement of the patent.astro sought an injunction preventing s g from further infringement of the patent and also sought damages.
on november,s g filed a motion for summary judgment of invalidity and unenforceability of the patent,and,in the alternative,noninfringement.in eagles i,the district court denied s g motion for summary judgment of invalidity because s g had not satisfied its burden of establishing obviousness or lack of proper inventorship by clear and convincing evidence.however,the district court granted s g summary judgment motion on inequitable conduct,determining that there was clear and convincing evidence of materiality and intent to deceive the united states patent and trademark office pto.as to materiality,the court found that a model die grinder that astro had been selling for twenty years,the model,was material prior art that had not been submitted to the pto.according to the court,the model contained many of the same components that were present in the pneumatic driver of the patent.the court observed that the examiner allowed present claims of the patent expressly because he could not find prior art that disclosed all of the limitations of the claims.because the model contained some of those elements,the court found it clear that the model would have been material to the examiner analysis.the court also noted that the model was not cumulative of other prior art before the examiner because it had elements that were not found in other prior art references.
the district court inferred that astro intended to deceive the pto solely from its nondisclosure of the model.the court observed that it is undisputed that irving fisher and stephen fisher were familiar with the critical features of both the driver in the patent and the model driver.according to the court,because the examiner notified astro that he could not find many of the limitations of the claims in the prior art,and the model possessed some of them,astro must have known of the model relevance.moreover,because astro did not disclose to the pto the model even after receiving the examiner statement and did not offer a good faith explanation for its omission,the district court found that astro intended to deceive the examiner.after stating that it weighed the materiality of the omission and astro intent,the court concluded that the patent should be held to be unenforceable.
after determining there was inequitable conduct,the district court declined to address the patent misuse and infringement arguments and dismissed all the motions relating to infringement as moot.the court also denied s g motion for summary judgment regarding violation of the false marking statute,because s g did not show that astro marked its eraser wheels with the patent number with the intent to deceive the public.
the district court next found that astro violated the lanham act.the court concluded that astro made false representations concerning its eraser wheels by marking them with the patent number and with the label patent pending,when the wheel itself was not protected by a patent.according to the court,those misrepresentations,coupled with astro letters to s g customers,deceived customers and diverted sales from s g to astro.the court finally found that the case was not exceptional and denied an award of attorney fees under because s g did not present clear and convincing evidence constituting exceptional circumstances.
on march,astro filed a new motion for summary judgment on the unfair competition and tortious interference claims in light of the recent holding in zenith electronics exzec.s g filed a requesting that the court grant summary judgment in its favor as to its lanham act,state unfair competition,and tortious interference claims,and award attorney fees pursuant to.in,in eagles tool ii,the district court reevaluated its lanham act holding because zenith electronics required a showing of bad faith for a lanham act violation.the court cited its previous determination of inequitable conduct as evidence of bad faith in astro subsequent contacts with s g and its customers.the court therefore found clear and convincing evidence that astro actions were made in bad faith and granted s g motion for summary judgment as to its lanham act claim.the court granted summary judgment as to the state law unfair competition claims for the same reason.
the district court relied on its inequitable conduct determination in order to hold for s g on its tortious interference with prospective economic advantage claim.the court noted that such a claim requires malice,and held that there was malice in astro patent having been procured inequitably.the court determined that astro actions fell outside of the generally accepted standards of common morality and therefore constituted tortious interference with prospective economic advantage when astro sent letters to s g customers and suppliers instead of commencing a lawsuit,and because those letters were sent in relation to an unenforceable patent.
although the district court had previously denied s g motion for summary judgment as to its attorney fees claim,the court revisited that holding and awarded attorney fees because it considered that brasseler,i,stryker sales,suggested that a case may be found to be exceptional based upon a showing of inequitable conduct.the court held that its finding of astro inequitable conduct before the pto was proof of exceptional circumstances and allowed the award of attorney fees.
after having found lanham act,state law unfair competition,and tortious interference violations,the court held a hearing in to determine the damages,which it then awarded to s eagles iii,civil action.
astro timely appealed,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.

inequitable conduct 
patent applicants and those substantively involved in the preparation or prosecution of a patent application owe a duty of candor and good faith to the pto.a see also molins plc textron.a breach of this duty may constitute inequitable conduct,which can arise from a failure to disclose information material to patentability,coupled with an intent to deceive the pto.molins,at.both of these elements,intent and materiality,must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.stevens,lex tex.m ateriality does not presume intent,which is a separate and essential component of inequitable conduct.manville sales paramount.intent to deceive can not be inferred solely from the fact that information was not disclosed there must be a factual basis for a finding of deceptive intent.hebert lisle.although it is not impermissible to grant summary judgment of inequitable conduct,this court urges caution in making an inequitable conduct determination at the summary judgment stage.paragon podiatry lab.klm.
on appeal,astro asserts that the district court erred in finding the patent to be unenforceable for inequitable conduct because there was no evidence of intent to deceive the pto astro argues that the court improperly found intent to deceive solely from the fact that astro failed to disclose the model to the pto,without relying on any evidence,direct or circumstantial,that the applicant or attorney deliberately withheld information concerning the model.astro also contends that it did not know of the alleged relevance of the model and,without knowing of its importance,it could not have purposefully omitted the disclosure.although the district court found that astro must have known of the model importance from the examiner statement,astro asserts that there are differences between the claims and the model that prohibit such an assumption.moreover,astro asserts that even if the failure to disclose the model constituted gross negligence,that can not be the sole basis for finding an intent to deceive.without any evidence of intent to deceive,astro contends that the court improperly used a theory of strict liability to find that the failure to disclose the model constituted inequitable conduct.
s g responds that the district court did not clearly err in inferring intent because the sequence of facts demonstrates that astro acted with a culpable mind to deceive the pto.s g asserts that the examiner expressly stated that he was allowing the claims because he could not find certain limitations of the claims in the prior art.the model contained those limitations,according to s g,and irving fisher and stephen fisher,as successive presidents of astro,were familiar with the model,which had been in existence for years.after receiving the examiner statement,s g asserts that astro must have known that the model was material because of the similarities between the claims and the model,and should have disclosed it to the examiner.by not disclosing the model to the pto after astro was aware of its materiality,s g contends that the district court did not err in inferring an intent to deceive the pto.finally,s g focuses on the fact that astro never presented any evidence that the failure to disclose was inadvertent,and asserts that the failure to provide any good faith explanation for that failure is evidence of intent.
the issue central to the disposition of this case is whether a lack of a good faith explanation for a nondisclosure of prior art,when nondisclosure is the only evidence of intent,is sufficient to constitute clear and convincing evidence to support an inference of intent.we agree with astro and conclude that a failure to disclose a prior art device to the pto,where the only evidence of intent is a lack of a good faith explanation for the nondisclosure,can not constitute clear and convincing evidence sufficient to support a determination of culpable intent.
to satisfy the requirement of the intent to deceive element of inequitable conduct,the involved conduct,viewed in light of all the evidence,including evidence of good faith,must indicate sufficient culpability to require a finding of intent to deceive.see paragon podiatry lab.klm,quoting kingsdown med.consultants hollister.intent need not be proven by direct evidence.see merck,danbury pharm.intent is generally inferred from the facts and circumstances surrounding the appli
