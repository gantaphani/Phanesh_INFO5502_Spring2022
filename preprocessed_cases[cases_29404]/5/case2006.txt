factual background 
is a clothes designer and manufacturer based in sonoma county,california.after early successes as an artist,she began producing monoprints that she sold to local customers at prices appropriate for original works of art.in,she leased a space of square feet in the lakeville building in petaluma,california,which was owned and managed by the lourdeauxs.the initial lease was for a term and called for a monthly rental of the next year the rental rose to.in succeeding years,began to achieve a toehold in national markets and developed a line of products for a national market.in,she participated in her first new york fashion show and hired three employees,including an office manager,anne sachs.
the business continued to expand rapidly,with sales doubling for several consecutive years.in,achieved gross sales of over million,incorporated her business as lili butler studio,and leased a showroom for the dallas market.she added a new line of clothes called tiger lili and began plans for other lines,called day lili and water lili,which were targeted at different price ranges and clientele.her staff continued to increase,reaching a high of employees at one point in the.
in leased adjacent warehouse space in the lakeville building,designated suite,which she converted into a showroom and office.her rent then rose to.she testified that she agreed to lease suite after receiving the assurance of wallace lourdeaux that he would upgrade the heating system.lourdeaux later provided two vents to the room,but complained that the heating system still did work adequately.
the following year,explored the option of moving to another location since she calculated that she needed square feet of production space to accommodate future business.in an effort to keep her as a tenant,wallace lourdeaux offered to convert a small area into a kitchen and to expand the leased area to include a bare,warehouse space known as suite g.according to,her main concern was the adequacy of the heating system both in suite and in the new suite g,which was then unheated.as an inducement to stay in the building,lourdeaux represented that he would repair the heating system in suite and would install a complete heating unit at his own expense in suite agreed to enter into the lease on these terms.wallace lourdeaux then brought a lease dated march,bearing his signature to her office.the lease was for a term and provided for the lease of two additional areas,suite g and the kitchen,for a total rental payment of a month.testified that she made clear that she would not enter into the lease unless the deficient heating of suite was taken care of.in late august,she returned a signed copy of the lease to the lourdeauxs after being assured that the heating system for suite was completely renovated.
about the time entered the new lease,roseanna lourdeaux assumed active management of the building.the next year she hired a tenant,phelan,to serve as manager.according to,her problems with the building and its management,especially with regard to heating,took a turn for the worse in the new lease term,stalling the expansion of her business and leading to the present litigation.
phelan soon came into conflict with by engaging in the practice of walking uninvited into production areas and talking to employees.when tried to limit phelan contact with employees,phelan adopted a contentious attitude toward the business,which was expressed in certain statements that will be examined later in the portion of this opinion dealing with the slander verdict.
invested in improvements to both suite and suite g with the expectation that they could be converted into working spaces,but the heating problems allowed only very limited use of suite.in response to her complaints,roseanna lourdeaux repeatedly assured her that they were working on the problem and dispatched a series of workmen to make service calls.in december,had an opportunity to talk to a heating system technician who had examined the system.he told her that he had some bad news.the system was undersized to heat suite and would never provide adequate heat.in his words,it was a stage set.
being unable to place production employees in unheated space,could use only a fraction of the leased space to meet the orders generated by rapidly expanding sales.compounding these difficulties,the first six months of were marked by a series of conflicts and disputes with the lourdeauxs and phelan that signaled a breakdown in cooperation and communication between the parties.in january,the lourdeauxs issued a notice of rent increase that treated the unheated suite as office space and inflated the calculation of the rent obligation by employing a disputed calculation of the square footage of the leased area.when raised objections,she was told that the increase was nonnegotiable.she paid the increase under protest after retaining a lawyer.the building manager,phelan,scheduled electrical maintenance that would have deprived business of power shortly before her critical spring shipment date and continued to demand greater access to the premises.resisting these demands,insisted on notice for access into her premises.
shortly after complaining to the lourdeauxs about phelan management,was served with a notice of termination of her lease.she successfully opposed the notice of termination by relying on the term of the lease,which was not subject to such termination,but the lourdeauxs pursued other demands they billed her for common area maintenance charges,though the lease did not provide for them demanded that she pay monthly parking charges claimed that she had fallen
