the youthful offender parole board yopb appeals the judgment finding it liable under the fair employment and housing act feha,et for retaliation against lisa steele plaintiff or lisa and awarding her in past economic damages.the yopb also appeals the trial court postjudgment order granting plaintiff in attorney fees as the prevailing party in her feha action.
the yopb contends the feha judgment must be reversed because there is insufficient evidence plaintiff suffered a constructive discharge from her employment with the yopb and,thus,she suffered no adverse employment action as required for her feha retaliation claim,and there is insufficient evidence of a causal link between plaintiff protected activity and the alleged adverse employment action.the yopb contends the order granting attorney fees must be reversed once the underlying judgment is reversed.we conclude substantial evidence supports the judgment and therefore,affirm both the judgment and the order awarding fees.
factual background 
anthony peacock was a california state employee.in may he left his permanent position at the office of the secretary of state,after being there for years,in order to take a limited term position at the yopb that offered a slight pay increase and more interesting work as peacock wanted to make his position at the yopb a permanent position,he hired his friend robert steele,whom he had known through their mutual state employment since,as a retired annuitant to complete the necessary paperwork.the personnel proposal completed by steele successfully persuaded the department of personnel administration to make peacock position permanent.
peacock then mentioned to steele a clerical vacancy at the yopb that might be a good opportunity for steele daughter lisa.lisa had an interest in criminal justice,wanted a career with the state,and at that point had been working for approximately two months at the department of justice.
lisa started working for the yopb as an office in january.she completed her probationary period without any problems and never received any criticisms of her job performance.lisa did her job,was intelligent,capable of complex tasks,and asked others if she could help them with their tasks when she ran out of work 
in october,lisa competed in three bikini contests held by a local radio station.on the day of the last contest,raul galindo,chairman of the yopb board,came up to lisa at work and said he had heard she was doing bikini contests.he asked if she was going to do another one and lisa told him there was one scheduled for that night.at his request,lisa provided galindo directions to the contest.galindo showed up at the contest before it began.after the contest,lisa went over to galindo to thank him for coming.as she was saying goodbye,galindo leaned in to kiss her on the mouth.lisa turned her head so that she received the kiss on her cheek.lisa was taken aback,but not offended.
lisa and her boyfriend got into a physical altercation later that night and lisa was injured.she called into work the next day and spoke to a coworker,jeannie cerrito.lisa told cerrito she was not coming in and why.lisa mentioned the kiss incident to cerrito.lisa also talked to her then supervisor shelley jones and told her about the fight with her boyfriend.
cerrito told another coworker,kym kaslar,about the bikini contest,the fight between lisa and her boyfriend,and the incident where galindo grabbed lisa and kissed her.
peacock heard about the kissing incident from cerrito and on october,interviewed kaslar regarding her knowledge of what had happened at the bikini contest.kaslar told him about the altercation between lisa and her boyfriend and said she also knew about galindo being at the contest and kissing lisa.peacock shut down very quickly and told kaslar to go back into the office and keep her mouth shut.peacock told kaslar that what she knew could get galindo fired,as well as get her into trouble.it could cost her job.
as soon as susan wallace,the executive officer of the yopb,came into the office that morning,peacock told her about his conversation with kaslar.wallace told peacock to talk to lisa to find out what happened wallace and peacock were both concerned galindo actions had the appearance of impropriety.galindo was a political appointee whose term was set to expire in seven months,may,at which time he was subject to reappointment by the governor office and confirmation by the state senate.galindo had been elevated from board member to chairman of the yopb by robert presley at the suggestion of wallace.wallace reported the incident to presley,the secretary of yaca,and discussed it with beutler,the under secretary of yaca,because it was politically sensitive.wallace also had a pending application to be appointed as a judge by the governor.peacock had aspirations for promotion at the yopb 
peacock drafted a letter to galindo for presley signature at the suggestion of wallace and as approved by beutler.on october,the letter signed by presley was sent to galindo.the letter stated in pertinent part it has come to my attention that it has been alleged that you were involved in a social situation of questionable taste with a member of the yopb staff.i want to make it perfectly clear that under no circumstances is fraternizing with staff considered acceptable behavior in this administration.in order to be crystal clear about the expectations of this administration regarding appropriate contacts with staff,i have directed the yopb executive officer to enroll you in a course on sexual harassment it is my sincere hope that no incidents of this nature come to my attention ever again.
on october,peacock called kaslar into his office again.peacock told kaslar she was no longer to have any contact with any of the board members or the chairman galindo.peacock threatened kaslar with adverse action if she said anything.
on october,kaslar filed a complaint with the state personnel board in which she claimed,in part,unlawful retaliation by peacock based on her disclosure of the kissing incident between galindo and lisa.she said peacock told her it could cost galindo and her their jobs 
on november,lisa met with her current supervisor jones.jones criticized lisa work performance in the areas of her work schedule,her maintenance and organization of travel and attendance records,her need to notify jones if she needed additional work,her conduct of personal business at her desk,and her installation of america online aol on her workstation computer in violation of state policy.these criticisms were memorialized in a memorandum to lisa dated november.lisa was very upset by the memo.she believed it was inaccurate and contained numerous false accusations.at the suggestion of her father,lisa prepared a written response addressing each area of criticism.on november,jones sent another memo to lisa criticizing both lisa and her november response to jones first memo.
lisa brought both of jones memos to the attention of peacock,telling him they contained false accusations.lisa father also talked to peacock about jones memos to lisa.peacock agreed the memos were unfair,excessive and inappropriate.peacock told steele that as a new supervisor,jones was a little,but the memos did not constitute a performance issue or grounds for discipline.jones was basically trying to establish her authority as supervisor.peacock told lisa he would speak to jones about the matter and told steele he would get lisa and jones together to resolve their personality conflict.he did neither.
in early november,peacock told lisa and kaslar that there might be budget cuts in the future,and that it might be in their best interests to look for another job.peacock did not warn any other yopb employees to look for another job.he claimed he met with only lisa and kaslar because they were the least senior in the office.
on november,jones gave lisa a letter of instruction for aol on her computer a letter of instruction is the first step in progressive discipline under state civil service.the letter of instruction was not placed in lisa personnel file,but kept by peacock in his supervisor file for future reference.according to peacock,the steps for progressive discipline went from a letter of instruction to a formal letter of reprimand to suspension,short then long,to finally,termination.at each step of the process,the employee has a right to a hearing before an independent officer to review the discipline.lisa did not request a hearing with respect to the letter of instruction.
in december,wallace made comments to kaslar,similar to those of peacock,warning her to not say anything about the kissing incident.wallace told kaslar she would be in this situation if you just kept your mouth shut and stayed out of office politics and left the clerical people alone.at that time,lisa was the only clerical person at the office.
in,the yopb transferred kaslar to the department of corrections.although peacock disclaimed at trial any knowledge in january of kaslar state personnel board complaint,lisa testified peacock told her the department had decided to transfer kaslar due to a sexual harassment suit she had pending at the time.
in late january and early february,marilyn wolk,executive secretary to wallace,reported to peacock that lisa was throwing some items of yopb mail into the trash.wolk admitted she did not actually see lisa throw away any mail she only found the mail in the trash can.she admitted a student assistant also handled the mail at the yopb.peacock counseled lisa on january and february to let her know that continued trashing of the mail could lead to adverse action against her.
on february,the yopb received a complaint that kaslar had filed with the department of fair employment and housing dfeh again claiming,in part,retaliation based on her report of the kissing incident.
on february,peacock claimed to have been notified by wolk that lisa had once again aol on her computer.according to lisa,this accusation was false.she never the aol program after receiving the letter of instruction.jones,who had given lisa the letter of instruction regarding her previous installation of aol,would have been the person to contact to determine if lisa had aol on her computer.jones testified she did not recall anyone suggesting lisa was accessing aol in february and no one asked her to check the computer access records at that time to verify if lisa had done so.
on february,peacock told lisa he would be suspending her in days based on the mail trashing lisa asked if she could take a leave of absence instead because she did not want a suspension on her record.peacock told her she needed to seek employment elsewhere.he said,it would be in my best interest to seek employment elsewhere,because i would make the office look bad if the investigators for kaslar complaint are there investigating and i was still there.peacock warned lisa that a suspension would be a huge black mark,making it harder to transfer to another state job.peacock offered to give lisa assistance in transferring to another state job.peacock subsequently put four state job announcements on her chair.
lisa father talked to peacock in early february.according to steele,peacock agreed at that point wolk accusations regarding the mail did not make sense and he did not think they were valid or legitimate.however,in a second meeting,peacock launched into a discussion regarding the mail issue and told steele they were going to give lisa a specified number of days to find a new job before penalties were imposed as peacock had previously treated the issue as nominal and incredible,steele suggested there was something hidden peacock was not discussing.peacock denied there was anything else.he said lisa had to leave.
on february,jones sent lisa an complaining that lisa had left for the day before taking down the video conference equipment at the conclusion of the board hearings.jones criticized lisa for not being available to handle her duties with respect to the hearings.two days later,on february,jones sent another to lisa complaining lisa had again left the office without ensuring someone was available to take down the conference equipment.the also criticized lisa handling of document disposal,forwarding of phone calls,reading of related materials at her desk and time spent tending to personal telephone calls.the was sarcastic and demeaned lisa actions as unprofessional and tacky.
wallace received a copy of jones february to lisa.she peacock with directions to w rite her lisa up about this and other things that happen so we are in place we are sic with kym kaslar,verbally dealing with it and no paper back up.document it all.wallace instructed peacock to change lisa work hours.she told peacock to change lisa hours to an to schedule to make lisa job less desirable.peacock responded to wallace by that he had changed her work hours with day notice per her contract to be.peacock also stated in his that i t is only weeks i gave her days to find another job until i drop the suspension on her for the mail in the trash that wolk discovered,and i again reiterated to her that it would be in her best interest to be gone prior to that happening.lisa wrote a memo on february to peacock responding to each of jones complaints in her february.according to peacock,lisa memo was and made some very cogent points.when lisa spoke to him about jones criticisms,peacock told lisa he would speak to jones.peacock did not do so.
according to her father,lisa came home during this time dismayed and despondent.she cried and was upset.steele met with peacock again.peacock agreed with steele that jones february was unfair and not appropriate.but when steele asked about giving lisa a leave of absence,peacock said it not possible without elaborating.
lisa took several days of sick leave in february because she could not handle the stress of the work atmosphere.she asked peacock whether she would have to retest to obtain another state job if she resigned.peacock confirmed she would not have to retest since she had passed probation.
on february,lisa told peacock she wanted to resign from her position at the yopb.peacock told her to put it into writing,which lisa did.peacock then asked lisa to draft another document describing the events of the bikini contest.peacock edited the draft lisa provided,adding his own comments and telling her to omit any mention of the kiss.peacock also specifically directed lisa to include a statement that kaslar had made comments about lisa body,but that lisa was not offended.with respect to galindo,the memo stated,in part,that kaslar and galindo appeared to be on a friendly basis.lisa did notice galindo being more friendly to kaslar over anyone else.both seemed like they had a professional relationship,nothing out of the ordinary or anything i would perceive as sexual harassment.lisa stated her relationship with galindo was strictly on a friendly basis.he would acknowledge me in the office and that was the extent of it.kym kaslar was just an acquaintance at work.i never observed galindo being inappropriate either inside or outside of the office to anyone.
peacock then presented lisa with an additional note handwritten by peacock in his own words,which he asked lisa to type up and sign as if she had written it out.the note stated memo to file.regarding the unfortunate bikini contest at mcgee,i need to clear up some misconceptions.first,raul galindo did not kiss me.kym told tony peacock that raul galindo tried to kiss me,which she just made up.lisa typed the note up and signed it,although the statement was false.she did so because she was upset by the heavy pressure during these weeks and she was under the impression peacock was going to assist her in transferring.she still wanted to retain a state job.she thought if she resigned,peacock would give her a reference and help her.peacock had been consistently friendly and lisa did not feel he criticized her.
after she resigned,lisa contacted personnel with the yopb and the yaca and tried to find another state job.while she waited to get another job with the state,she lived on money she inherited after her grandmother died.she denied she felt she did not need to work because of her inheritance.lisa remained unemployed until january when she obtained a clerical job in the private sector.
peacock provided lisa current contact information to the dfeh after lisa left the yopb employment as part of the dfeh investigation into kaslar claims.lisa told the dfeh that she had never seen anything indicating galindo had sexually harassed kaslar.lisa did,however,tell the dfeh about galindo kissing her.
discussion 
the jury in this case answered six questions on a special verdict form.as relevant to this appeal,the jury expressly found the yopb authorized the creation of working conditions for lisa that were so intolerable that a reasonable person in her position would have had no reasonable alternative except to resign and that lisa resigned because of those intolerable conditions.the yopb challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support these findings.
our review is governed by principles.as with any civil appeal,we must presume the judgment is correct,indulge every intendment and presumption in favor of its correctness,and start with the presumption that the record contains evidence sufficient to support the judgment.in re marriage of arceneaux cal d,foreman clark fallon cal d.an appellant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence must set forth all the relevant evidence,not just the evidence favorable to the appellant,and show how the evidence does not support the judgment otherwise,the contention is forfeited.foreman clark fallon,supra,at,brockey moore th,d western aggregates,county of yuba th,d.
to the extent the issue is not forfeited,we are bound by the elementary,but often overlooked principle of law,that when a verdict is attacked as being unsupported,the power of the appellate court begins and ends with a determination as to whether there is any substantial evidence,contradicted or uncontradicted,which will support the conclusion reached by the jury.crawford southern pacific cal d,accord western states petroleum superior court cal th,d,taylor roseville toyota,th,d.we can not reweigh the evidence,but must resolve all conflicts in favor of the prevailing party.scott pacific gas cal th,d.when two or more inferences can be reasonably deduced from the facts,the reviewing court is without power to substitute its deductions for those of the trial court.crawford southern pacific,supra,at.we defer to the trier of fact on issues of credibility.lenk,th,d.
substantial evidence supports the judgment 
feha makes it unlawful f or any employer or person to discharge,expel,or otherwise discriminate against any person because the person has opposed any practices forbidden under feha or because the person has filed a complaint,testified,or assisted in any proceeding under feha,subd.h.in order to establish a prima facie claim of retaliation under this section,plaintiff must show she engaged in a protected activity,she was subjected to an adverse employment action,and there is a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.yanowitz usa,cal th,d,yanowitz.
substantial evidence supports the finding lisa was engaged in a protected activity 
with respect to the first element of a retaliation claim,section of title of the california code of regulations expressly defines assisted in any proceeding under feha as used in section,subdivision h,to include i nvolvement as a potential witness which an employer perceives as participation in an activity of the dfeh or fair employment and housing commission,tit,subd.a b,italics added.kaslar filed a complaint with the dfeh based,in part,on the yopb retaliating against her for her report of the kissing incident involving galindo and lisa.lisa was a potential witness in such proceeding.thus,lisa was engaged in a protected activity so as to meet the first requirement for a claim of retaliation.the yopb does not argue otherwise 
substantial evidence supports the finding of an adverse employment action 
the yopb,however,claims substantial evidence does not support the second element for a retaliation claim.specifically,the yopb contends there is insufficient evidence plaintiff suffered a constructive discharge from her employment with the yopb and,thus,she suffered no adverse employment action.according to the yopb,the evidence established lisa voluntarily resigned based on conditions that a reasonable employee would not have found intolerable or aggravated so as to amount to a constructive discharge.we disagree.
constructive discharge,like actual discharge,is a materially adverse employment action.eeoc of chicago hospitals cir.constructive discharge occurs when the employer conduct effectively forces an employee to resign.although the employee may say i quit,the employment relationship is actually severed involuntarily by the employer acts,against the employee will.as a result,a constructive discharge is legally regarded as a firing rather than a resignation.citation.turner cal th,d,turner.
in order to establish a constructive discharge,an employee must plead and prove,by the usual preponderance of the evidence standard,that the employer either intentionally created or knowingly permitted working conditions that were so intolerable or aggravated at the time of the employee resignation that a reasonable employer would realize that a reasonable person in the employee position would be compelled to resign.turner,supra,cal th at,d.to be intolerable or aggravated,the employee working conditions must be sufficiently extraordinary and egregious to overcome the normal motivation of a competent,diligent,and reasonable employee to remain on the job to earn a livelihood and to serve his or her employer.the proper focus is on whether the resignation was coerced,not whether it was simply one rational option for the employee.id.at,d.the essence of the test is whether,under all the circumstances,the working conditions are so unusually adverse that a reasonable employee in plaintiff position would have felt compelled to resign.citations.id.at,d.
the yopb contends the sum evidence of intolerable working conditions presented by lisa at trial consists of the following jones sent two to lisa peacock in one meeting told lisa that it would be in my best interest to seek employment elsewhere,because i would make the office look bad if the investigators are there investigating and i was still there and offered assistance in transferring to another state agency peacock left four job announcements on lisa chair wolk was allowed to go through her trash and otherwise harass her about throwing away yopb mail peacock told her he would give her days to start doing her job properly or he would consider giving her a two to three day suspension for trashing the mail and lisa hours were going to be changed to to 
in presenting this argument focusing on just the actions occurring during february after the yopb formal receipt of service of kaslar dfeh complaint and in presenting such limited facts solely in the light most favorable to the yopb position,the yopb comes perilously close to forfeiting its substantial evidence claims on appeal.foreman clark fallon,supra,cal d at,brockey moore,supra,th,d western aggregates,county of yuba,supra,th,d.
the yopb disagrees,contending its actions only after late january were relevant and needed to be summarized on appeal because lisa was not engaged in a protected activity for purposes of feha until she was actually listed as a potential witness in kaslar complaints to the state personnel board and the dfeh,which the yopb claims it became aware of only in late january and early february.not so.
in lujan minagar th,d lujan,a case involving retaliation under california occupational safety and health act,the court held labor code section applies to employers who retaliate against employees whom they believe intend to file workplace safety complaints.lujan,supra,at,d.the court reasoned that firing workers who are suspected of planning to file workplace safety complaints could effectively discourage the filing of those complaints and allowing such preemptive retaliation would be at odds with section apparent encourage such complaints and to punish employers who retaliate against employees as a result.sauers salt lake county cir,action taken against an individual in anticipation of that person engaging in protected opposition to discrimination is no less retaliatory than action taken after the fact.id.at,d.according to lujan,t o hold otherwise would create a perverse incentive for employers to retaliate against employees who they fear are about to file workplace safety complaints before the employees can do so,therefore avoiding liability under section.we do not believe the legislature could have possibly intended such an absurd result,which could be depicted by an image of an employer following an employee and firing him or her just before the employee reached the filing window,complaint in hand.citation.lujan,supra,at,d.
although lujan involved interpretation of labor code section,we are persuaded the same analysis is applicable to feha.the legislative purpose underlying feha prohibition against retaliation is to prevent employers from deterring employees from asserting good faith discrimination complaints.akers county of san diego,supra,th at,d.employer retaliation against employees who are believed to be prospective complainants or witnesses for complainants undermines this legislative purpose just as effectively as retaliation after the filing of a complaint.to limit feha in such a way would be to condone an absurd result lujan,supra,th at,d that is contrary to legislative intent.see also,tit,subd a b feha protects i nvolvement as a potential witness which an employer perceives as participation in an activity of the dfeh or fair employment and housing commission.we agree with the trial court that feha protects employees against preemptive retaliation by the employer.we will consider the evidence of the yopb actions from late october onward.
such evidence and the rational inferences from the evidence strongly suggest that from the moment yopb learned about the kissing incident in october,it feared that lisa was a potential witness if not a potential claimant in a sexual harassment claim against the yopb.that is,even though lisa told peacock she was not offended by galindo behavior,and even though it seemed unlikely lisa herself would bring a sexual harassment claim based on the kiss,the evidence reflects the yopb immediately perceived the kissing incident to be significant and that lisa would be a material,corroborating witness in any sexual harassment claim involving galindo.the evidence further suggests that peacock and wallace engaged in what they considered to be damage control of this important incident.
when peacock was told by kaslar of the kissing incident,he immediately shut down and told kaslar to go back into the office and keep her mouth shut because what she knew could get galindo fired.peacock told wallace about his conversation with kaslar as soon as wallace came into the office.both peacock and wallace were concerned by an appearance of impropriety in galindo kiss of lisa.they promptly alerted the highest officials in the yopb and yaca because of the issue political sensitivity.galindo,peacock,wallace,beutler,and presley were all connected in some way to each other by former employment,employment recommendations or appointments.it is a reasonable inference they were all concerned that they and the yopb could be embarrassed and adversely affected by the fallout from galindo actions.
with the approval of beutler,peacock and wallace drafted a strongly written letter to galindo,for signature by presley,warning galindo about his actions with lisa and sending him to sexual harassment prevention training.both peacock and wallace threatened kaslar with adverse action if she said anything about the incident.
in early november,lisa received the first memo from her then supervisor,jones,criticizing lisa work performance.lisa believed it to be inaccurate and unduly harsh.she responded to it in writing and received a disparaging reply from jones.both lisa and her father spoke to peacock about jones memos.peacock agreed the memos were unfair,excessive and inappropriate.peacock assured lisa and steele the memos did not constitute a performance issue or grounds for discipline,but were simply a result of jones trying to establish her authority as a supervisor.peacock said he would speak to jones about the matter and get lisa and jones together to resolve their personality conflict.he did neither.
several reasonable inferences arise from this evidence.first that peacock,aware of the discord between lisa and her supervisor,permitted it to fester in order to encourage lisa resignation.secondly that peacock was content to leave in place unverified and possibly inaccurate criticisms of lisa work performance to put pressure on lisa.and lastly,the retention of these unconfirmed criticisms would lay the groundwork for questioning her credibility in any future investigation of galindo.
during this same time frame,peacock warned only lisa and kaslar about possible future budget cuts and told them it might be in their best interests to look for another job.although peacock claimed he met with only lisa and kaslar because they had the least seniority at the yopb,an alternative inference was that peacock wanted lisa and kaslar to leave the yopb before any complaint was made about galindo any investigation of galindo began.
in,the yopb transferred kaslar to the department of corrections.although peacock disclaimed at trial any knowledge at this time of kaslar state personnel board complaint,lisa testified peacock told her the department had decided to transfer kaslar due to her pending sexual harassment claim.obviously the yopb had to have known about the complaint in january if it transferred kaslar because of it.peacock comment to lisa clearly sent the message that the yopb would take action against employees alleging such claims.
on february,the yopb received service of kaslar dfeh complaint again claiming,in part,retaliation based on her report of the kissing incident between galindo and lisa.
just three days later peacock informed lisa he would be suspending her in days based on her trashing of yopb mail peacock said this despite his admissions to lisa father that such allegations did not make sense and he did not think they were valid or legitimate and even though the disciplinary steps preceding a suspension based on the trashing of mail a letter of instruction followed by a letter of reprimand had not been taken.when lisa asked if she could take a leave of absence instead because she did not want a suspension on her record,peacock told her,without any apparent qualification,she needed to seek employment elsewhere.he told her it would be in my best interest to seek employment elsewhere,because i would make the office look bad if the investigators are there investigating and i was still there.peacock warned lisa that a suspension would be a huge black mark on her state employment record,making it harder to transfer to another state job.peacock told lisa father that lisa has to leave.
a reasonable understanding of these events is that peacock,in his capacity as her supervisor,intimidated and threatened lisa,a young employee new to state service,with a baseless and inappropriate level of disciplinary action that would detrimentally effect her future employment in state service because he wanted her out of the way of dfeh investigators.he concealed his retaliatory motive behind a friendly offer to assist her in transferring.
on february and,jones sent to lisa further criticizing her work performance.lisa responded with a memo that peacock felt made some very cogent points,but peacock did not speak to jones despite his assurances to lisa that he would.instead,peacock changed lisa hours,at the direction of wallace,to make lisa job less desirable.peacock again reiterated to lisa that it would be in her best interest to be gone before the suspension became effective,essentially reminding her that the clock was ticking and it would soon be very difficult for her to continue pursuing her state service career.
lisa took sick leave because of the stress and then,when she returned,she told peacock she wanted to resign.peacock told her to put it into writing,which lisa did.
peacock then did two further machi
