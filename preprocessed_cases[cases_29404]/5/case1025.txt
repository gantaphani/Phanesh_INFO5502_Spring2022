background 
thirteen entities filed involuntary bankruptcy petitions against ibt international,ibt and southern california sunbelt developers,scsd under chapter of the bankruptcy code.the petitioning creditors are banyon limited partnership,birch international limited partnership,van dan limited partnership,ctm limited partnership,dtg limited partnership,gallery i,hampton limited partnership,key enterprises,orange blossom limited partnership,pear tree limited partnership,slevin limited partnership,showthunder,and trails end limited partnership.they are controlled by two individuals,donald grammer and david tedder.
the bankruptcy court dismissed the involuntary petition against scsd after finding that petitioners claims were the subject of a bona fide dispute.see b.the court subsequently dismissed the involuntary petition against ibt on a motion by petitioning creditors.in its response to that motion,ibt reserved its right to recover costs,attorney fees and damages under i in the event the motion was granted.
scsd and ibt thereafter filed motions for costs,attorney fees and punitive damages against petitioning creditors under i.they also sought sanctions against grammer and tedder under bankruptcy rule and the court inherent power.section i states 
if the court dismisses a petition under this section other than on consent of all petitioners and the debtor,and if the debtor does not waive the right to judgment under this subsection,the court may grant judgment 
against the petitioners and in favor of the debtor for 
a costs or 
b a reasonable attorney fee or 
against any petitioner that filed the petition in bad faith,for 
a any damages proximately caused by such filing or 
b punitive damages.
i.scsd and ibt did not seek damages under i a.
after a evidentiary hearing on the motions,the bankruptcy court entered judgment against grammer,tedder and the petitioning creditors and in favor of scsd and ibt as follows 
under i,the court held the petitioning creditors jointly and severally liable for in costs and attorney fees incurred by scsd and ibt,including costs and fees they incurred during the proceedings on the i motions themselves.
under i b,the court found that the petitioning creditors filed the involuntary petitions in bad faith and held them jointly and severally liable for in punitive damages per creditor per petition.
finally,under its inherent power to impose sanctions,the court held grammer and tedder jointly and severally liable for the costs and attorney fees awarded against the petitioning creditors.
grammer,tedder and the petitioning creditors appealed to the district court,which affirmed the bankruptcy court judgments.we have jurisdiction under d.we affirm in part and reverse in part.
ii.standard of review 
we review decisions of the bankruptcy court independently without deference to the district court determinations.higgins vortex fishing,cir.the bankruptcy court conclusions of law,including its interpretation of the bankruptcy code,are reviewed de novo.see in re salazar,cir higgins,at.we will not disturb a bankruptcy court award of attorney fees unless the court abused its discretion or erroneously applied the law.higgins,at.
iii.discussion 
appellants raise three issues whether the bankruptcy court erred by awarding attorney fees incurred by scsd and ibt to litigate the i motions whether the bankruptcy court erred by awarding punitive damages under i b in the absence of an award of actual damages under i a and whether the bankruptcy court erroneously held grammer and tedder liable for the attorney fees incurred by scsd and ibt to litigate the motions for sanctions imposed under the court inherent power.we affirm with respect to the first and second issues.on the third issue,we agree with appellants.
recovery of attorney fees incurred litigating the i motions 
the first issue is whether i authorizes a recovery of attorney fees incurred litigating a i motion.we hold that it does.we begin by examining whether i is a provision or a sanctions statute.then,having determined that it is a provision,we explain that i authorizes an award of attorney fees incurred litigating claims for attorney fees and damages under i and.
section i is a provision 
the supreme court drew a distinction between provisions and sanctions statutes in business guides,chromatic communications enterprises.in determining that federal rule of civil procedure was a sanctions statute,the court emphasized two considerations.first,rule sanctions were not tied to the outcome of the litigation.id.instead,the availability of sanctions turned on whether a specific filing was well founded.id.second,rule sanctions shifted the costs of only a discrete portion of the litigation,rather than the cost of the litigation as a whole.id.the court also distinguished rule from statutes in cooter gell hartmarx.
applying these and other relevant considerations here,we hold that i is a provision rather than a sanctions statute.like other provisions and in contrast to rule,eligibility for fees turns on the merits of the litigation as a whole,rather than on whether a specific filing is well founded.in deciding whether to award fees,a court considers the totality of the circumstances,including the merits of the involuntary petition,the role of any improper conduct on the part of the alleged debtor,the reasonableness of the actions taken by the petitioning creditors,and the motivation and objectives behind filing the petition.higgins,at quoting in re scrap metal buyers of tampa.fees may not be awarded unless the court dismisses a petition.i.that is,only a debtor who has prevailed on the central issue in the proceedings is eligible for an award of fees.fee eligibility is therefore inextricably linked to the proceedings dispositive adjudication.also,unlike rule,i shifts costs for the litigation as a whole rather than a discrete portion.when a petition is dismissed,a court may grant a debtor a reasonable attorney fee a single fee award presumably covering the entire action.id.
two other considerations support treating i as a provision.first,i creates a presumption in favor of an award of attorney fees.when an involuntary bankruptcy petition is dismissed,the debtor is presumed to be entitled to reasonable fees and costs.in re,cir see higgins,at explaining that any petitioning creditor in an involuntary case should expect to pay the debtor attorney fees an
