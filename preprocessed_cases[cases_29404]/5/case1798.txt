factual and procedural background 
in,bam,franke and george benjamin were each creditors of and marlene wilburn the wilburns.the wilburns expected distribution on claims they were pursuing against a bankruptcy debtor,noci oro corporation the wilburn distribution the competing claims of these creditors against the wilburn distribution led to the current litigation.
bam had a unsatisfied judgment against the wilburns.benjamin had a unsatisfied judgment against the wilburns.in,the wilburns granted franke,their bankruptcy attorney,a first priority lien against the wilburn distribution to secure his fees.
in february,the bankruptcy court approved a compromise allowing the wilburns unsecured claim against noci oro.bam received notice of the wilburn compromise but did not object to it or appear at the approval hearing.the notice did not disclose franke lien.bam chose not to oppose the compromise and to utilize instead its state court judgments to levy upon the wilburns.
in order to levy on the wilburn distribution,bam obtained a writ of execution against the wilburns for in the municipal court action on february,bam levied on the wilburn bankruptcy distribution by causing the sheriff to serve the writ of execution and a notice of levy on the bankruptcy trustee.franke responded by filing a third party claim asserting that he had a priority lien against the wilburn distribution for in fees currently owed him by the wilburns plus future fees and interest.in order to prevent release of the funds pursuant to franke claim,bam tendered an undertaking in the amount of to indemnify franke against losses he might incur by reason of the enforcement proceedings against the wilburns.at the time,that statute required an undertaking of two thousand five hundred dollars,or twice the amount of the execution lien whichever is the lesser amount.franke also tendered a statutory undertaking to indemnify bam.
meanwhile,in the noci oro bankruptcy,the trustee acknowledged service of bam writ of execution.he also acknowledged notice of franke lien and notice of benjamin assignment of claim.the trustee did not immediately release any funds to the wilburns.he requested letter briefs on the relative priorities of the three claims against the wilburn distribution.the parties exchanged correspondence,and in august of,the trustee gave notice of his intent to distribute the wilburn distribution in the following priority first to benjamin,second to bam and third to franke.
in october,in the municipal court,bam writ was returned unsatisfied.in april,franke moved the municipal court for an order recognizing the superiority of his claim and requiring bam to indemnify franke for losses incurred as a result of bam enforcement proceedings,subd.c.the municipal court denied the motion,finding that it had no jurisdiction to determine the issue of the priority of franke claim of lien,that issue already having been determined in the bankruptcy court.franke motion is denied.
the united states trustee office approved the trustee proposed distribution and filed a final report on may,requesting bankruptcy court approval.in august of,the bankruptcy court entered a formal order instructing the trustee to distribute first to benjamin the full amount necessary to satisfy his claim,and to distribute the remainder between franke percent and bam percent.in june,the trustee distributed funds to bam,before the court had issued its formal order.
franke successfully appealed the order of the bankruptcy court to the bankruptcy appellate panel of the ninth circuit court of appeal.in july,the panel remanded the matter to the bankruptcy court with directions to award franke the full wilburn distribution,and to distribute nothing to bam or benjamin.
franke again moved the municipal court for an order determining that his lien was senior to bam and requiring bam to pay franke losses incurred as a result of the enforcement proceedings.the court denied the motion without prejudice pending a priority decision by the bankruptcy court on remand.
on remand,the bankruptcy court ordered bam to disgorge the prior distribution,which it did,and the court ordered the trustee to pay the full wilburn distribution to franke.franke received that distribution in the amount of on november.benjamin and bam received nothing.franke had incurred in fees and costs in the municipal court enforcement proceedings,and he incurred in attorney fees and costs in the bankruptcy priority litigation from the date of bam levy on the wilburn distribution.
in,franke filed this action for liability on the undertaking against bam to collect his losses incurred as a result of bam enforcement actions,pursuant to section,subdivision a.the parties waived jury.they stipulated to many facts concerning the procedural history in the municipal court and bankruptcy court actions.other facts remained in dispute,including the nature and extent of franke losses resulting from bam enforcement action.franke sought recovery of all his expenses for litigating his priority claims in both municipal court and bankruptcy court,and sought compensation for the delay in distribution and the reduction in distribution that resulted from the bankruptcy trustee hiring additional counsel to handle bam lien claim.bam argued that its lien was invalid or released,and that because there was no wrongful attachment,franke had incurred no recoverable losses.alternatively bam argued that franke losses should be limited to the amount incurred in the municipal court enforcement proceeding itself and that his other claimed losses were not supported by the evidence.
at trial,franke testified on his own behalf.without objection from bam,the court approved franke as an expert witness in both bankruptcy and finance,based on his education and experience as an attorney with a certified specialty in bankruptcy and an mba in corporate financial management franke also presented the adverse testimony of bam principal,michael novick,and the testimony of bam bankruptcy priority attorney,thomas hinshaw.bam called one witness counsel for the bankruptcy trustee,william winfield.bam did not present any expert testimony.
at the close of evidence,the trial court determined that bam was liable on its undertaking to franke for all losses incurred as a result of bam enforcement proceedings pursuant to section,subdivision c resulting losses,and that the amount of franke resulting losses was,including his expenses incurred in the bankruptcy priority litigation.the court set forth its factual findings in a written statement of decision prepared by franke and objected to by bam.the court subsequently awarded franke in fees and in costs as the prevailing party in the action on the undertaking.
discussion 
when a creditor gives an undertaking to proceed with an enforcement action,the creditor indemnifies the secured party against any losses incurred by reason of the enforcement proceedings,subd.c.the secured party may recover its resulting losses summarily in the enforcement proceeding,subd.a or in a later civil action for liability on the undertaking,subd.a as franke did here.we affirm the resulting losses determination because we find substantial evidence in the record to support the trial court factual determination as to each item of resulting loss.we vacate the award of attorney fees because it was not authorized by law.
standard of review 
we determine whether the trial court factual findings were supported by substantial evidence and independently review its legal determinations.lake reed cal th,d.thus,we independently review the trial court legal determinations that the amount of the undertaking did not cap franke recoverable losses,the validity of bam lien was not necessary to franke recovery,and the fees and costs incurred in municipal court were not the only recoverable losses and failure to obtain summary relief there did not preclude franke recovery in this action.we review for substantial evidence the trial court factual determination that franke resulting losses were plus prejudgment interest.finally,we independently review the legal question whether an award of attorney fees to the prevailing party in this action on the undertaking was authorized by contract,statute or other law.
no cap on resulting losses 
we reject bam argument that the amount of the judgment should not have exceeded the amount of the undertaking.we also reject bam argument that it limited its liability with language in its letter transmitting the undertaking to the sheriff.
the scope of bam liability on the undertaking is established by section,subdivision c.it includes any losses incurred by reason of the enforcement proceedings.the liability of a principal based on statute is not limited to the amount of the bond,except as otherwise provided by statute,subd.a,harris northwestern nat.ins.th,d.no statute limits the liability of the principal to the amount of an undertaking posted pursuant to section.bam transmittal letter incorporated obsolete language of a predecessor statute,section.section limited liability on an undertaking to losses incurred by reason of the officer seizing,taking,withholding or sale of the levied property.use of this outdated language did not absolve bam of its liability under the current statute,section.
validity of lien 
bam argues that franke did not incur any losses as a result of bam efforts to enforce the lien because the lien was invalid or expired or because bam did not receive any money directly from the sheriff.we disagree.
the test for recovery under section is not whether the creditor lien was valid,but whether the secured party incurred losses as a result of the enforcement action.whether or not the levy was actually valid,or created a valid lien,the only claim or interest bam had against the bankruptcy distribution was by virtue of its claim that its levy resulted in a valid lien.bam consistently took the position in the bankruptcy proceedings that its lien was valid and that enforcement entitled it to priority distribution.at trial,bam principal acknowledged bankruptcy court filings in which bam asserted that its claim against the wilburn distribution arose solely from the writ of execution and that its resulting lien against the distribution was valid.bam bankruptcy attorney advised the bankruptcy trustee that bam knew it had a means of collecting from the wilburns by the writ served on the trustee,and warned the trustee that distribution to franke would reflect cavalier disregard for the writ procedure and would be at the trustee peril.bam asserted in that bam does not contend that its judgment lien or the priority thereof arise in or under the bankruptcy code,and that o nly after it appeared that the court would allow the wilburn claim did it make legal or economic sense to attach it.substantial evidence supported the trial court determination that these enforcement efforts caused franke to incur the awarded losses.
municipal court enforcement proceedings 
bam argues that franke resulting losses should be limited to the fees and costs he incurred litigating in municipal court.bam argues that franke fees and costs incurred in the bankruptcy priority litigation are not recoverable as a matter of law because bankruptcy litigation does not constitute the enforcement proceeding within the meaning of section,subdivision c.the arguments overlook the plain language of the section,subdivision c,which authorizes recovery of any losses incurred by reason of the enforcement proceedings.although predecessor statutes used more limiting language neither the current statute nor case authority limits losses to those incurred in the enforcement proceedings.franke losses were not limited to his fees and costs incurred in municipal court.
bam also contends that franke should not be entitled to any damages because he did not prevail in the municipal court enforcement proceeding.we disagree.franke interest as a lienholder was not effected by his inability to obtain summary relief on the undertaking from the municipal court.the municipal court twice declined to consider franke request for resulting losses on the merits,pending resolution of the bankruptcy priority litigation.however,failure to obtain a determination of liability on the undertaking in a summary enforcement proceeding does not discharge the surety and the secured party may subsequently file a civil action on the undertaking,subd.b commercial credit plan,gomez,d supp.in commercial credit plan,the secured party was entitled to bring an independent civil action for liability on the undertaking,notwithstanding the fact that he previously filed a third party claim in the related municipal court enforcement proceeding,where he failed to request a hearing or obtain any relief.in the absence of any determination on the merits in the municipal court,franke was free to pursue damages in this independent action on the undertaking.
particular items of resulting loss 
the trial court made factual determinations that franke losses incurred as a result of the enforcement proceedings consisted of i in attorney fees incurred in the bankruptcy priority litigation ii in costs iii reduction in distribution iv value of delay in distribution and v prejudgment interest as of april.at trial,these losses were supported by substantial evidence consisting of stipulated facts,trial testimony and documentary evidence.
although we independently review the application of a statute to undisputed facts harustak wilkins th,d,here the parties disputed the amount of franke resulting losses.the parties stipulated to certain facts,including the amount franke claimed he incurred in municipal court,but whether his other losses were incurred as a result of the enforcement proceedings was contested.most of the evidence at trial was directed to this question.the trial court resolution of the question was a factual determination.therefore,we examine each item of loss in turn resolving all conflicts in the evidence and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the trial court decision.we defer to the trial court unless the evidence is insufficient as a matter of law to sustain these factual findings.ibid.
a in attorney fees and costs in the bankruptcy priority litigation 
the trial court found that franke paid an attorney,simon dunstan,in fees and costs to litigate the priority of his lien claim and bam levy and execution lien in the bankruptcy court.the finding was supported by franke testimony and records of payment to dunstan.substantial evidence supports the trial court finding that dunstan fees were incurred by reason of the enforcement proceedings.franke testified that before bam initiated its municipal court enforcement proceedings,it had asserted no claim in bankruptcy court against the wilburn distribution.correspondence and pleadings from the bankruptcy priority litigation corroborated this testimony.franke testified that after bam attempted to levy on the wilburn distribution,franke retained dunstan to handle the resulting priority litigation.correspondence from the bankruptcy trustee demonstrated that the priority controversy arose upon the trustee receipt of bam writ of execution.the trial court took judicial notice of documents that bam submitted to the bankruptcy court and the bankr
