this appeal requires us to address a question of first impression in this circuit under what circumstances,if any,can anticipated attorneys fees properly be included within an appellate cost bond issued by a district court pursuant to either fed.rule or the court inherent power to manage its affairs 
the district court concluded that both rule and its inherent power are legitimate sources of authority for including attorneys fees within an appellate cost bond,and further,that it was appropriate to rely on both of these bases in holding appellant jointly and severally liable for posting a bond,the overwhelming majority of which corresponded to the estimated appellate attorneys fees.after careful review of the parties briefs and the body of law that bears on these issues,we conclude that although the district court correctly determined that there are cases in which anticipated attorneys fees may be included in an appellate cost bond,it erred in holding that this is such a case.accordingly,we vacate the district court bond order and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the factual and procedural history of this large class action is straightforward but complex.plaintiff marie pedraza is the representative of a class of borrowers who obtained mortgage insurance from defendants united guaranty corporation and united guaranty residential insurance company collectively ug the class claimed that in ug began systematically paying kickbacks to lenders,which in exchange agreed to steer borrowers to ug for their mortgage insurance needs,and that ug thereby violated the provision contained in the real estate settlement procedures act of respa,a 
the class filed its complaint on december,and ug promptly responded to these allegations by raising several defenses,including that respa did not apply to mortgage insurance that the doctrine precluded any recovery that the act barred the application of respa and that claims brought by borrowers who had closed their loans more than one year prior to the filing of the action were barred under respa statute of limitations.ug subsequently moved to dismiss on statute of limitations grounds the claims of all borrowers who had closed their loans prior to december.the district court denied the motion,holding that respa limitations period was subject to equitable tolling for up to three years,provided that the class member pled with particularity that ug had fraudulently concealed its activities,thereby precluding the timely assertion of a claim under.see pedraza united guaranty,d.accordingly,the class amended its complaint to include allegations that would give rise to equitable tolling for members whose loans had closed between december,and december.
discovery ensued,and on may,the class moved for certification.before the court could rule on the motion,however,ug moved for summary judgment based in significant part on the first three defenses listed above.on august,the district court granted summary judgment to ug on the ground that the act,b invalidated the class respa claims.the class responded by moving for reconsideration under.e,and subsequently by filing a notice of appeal.during the pendency of this motion,settlement negotiations began between ug and the plaintiffs.these discussions ultimately proved fruitful,and on december,the parties filed with the court a proposed settlement the settlement agreement required ug to pay an amount exceeding million to the class members.any class member whose claim had accrued between december,and december,was required to submit a form indicating that he or she was unaware of ug practices prior to the latter date.although the class agreed to relinquish any future claims against ug,its members retained the right to cancel their mortgage insurance policies.moreover,ug agreed to permanently cease and desist from two of the alleged kickback practices.on december,the court conditionally certified the class,ordered that the class members be notified,and scheduled a fairness hearing for june.
on february,a notice of pendency of class proposed settlement was filed,and then on march,notice of this settlement was published in nationally circulating newspapers.these notices delineated not only the terms of the settlement,but also the lengthy procedural history of the case and the right of class members to opt out.they also announced an april,deadline for the submission of objections to the settlement.ultimately,out of class members,three filed timely objections and opted out of the class.more than members whose claims were potentially subject to equitable tolling submitted claim forms to receive their payments.
on may,olorunnisomo filed an untimely objection to the settlement,a motion for leave to file a late objection,and a motion for leave to intervene.on june,the district court held a hearing on appellant motions,and denied on timeliness grounds his requests to intervene and to file an objection.roughly a week later,the court held its fairness hearing,at which olorunnisomo was permitted to argue that a texas subclass,a subclass comprised of texas residents,should be created.specifically,appellant contended that given the facts at bar.a provided class members with an automatic right of recovery and ug defense was not recognized in texas.accordingly,he argued that it was unfair to require that the claims of class members residing in texas be governed by the less advantageous provisions of georgia law.the district court considered and rejected these contentions,and approved the settlement with only one minor change,that of the attorneys fees were to be withheld pending distribution of the settlement proceeds to the class.as a corollary of its approval of the settlement,the court vacated its previous summary judgment order.
on july,olorunnisomo filed both a rule motion for reconsideration and a notice of appeal from the orders approving the settlement and denying his request to intervene.he asserted that our then recent holding in wooden bd.of regents,cir,established that the district court certification of the class constituted error.however,on september,the district court denied his rule motion for lack of standing,and appellant amended his notice of appeal to encompass the september,order as well.
while olorunnisomo motion for reconsideration was pending,the class moved to require all objectors and intervenors who had filed notices of appeal to post bonds for attorneys fees,damages,costs and interest that would be lost on appeal.although appellant opposed the inclusion of anticipated attorneys fees in the requested bond,he did not contest the amount of the bond sought by the class.the district court determined that attorneys fees were properly bondable under fed,and in support of this conclusion it cited the holding of the united states court of appeals for the second circuit in adsani miller,cir,cert.denied,d.see baynham pmi mortgage ins,slip op.at,reasoning that adsani approach to rule best comports with the american rule that absent exceptional circumstances each litigant bears responsibility for its own attorneys fees.the district court also indicated that it could include attorneys fees in an appellate cost bond pursuant to its inherent power to manage its affairs.see id.at 
however,the district court recognized the existence of constraints on its authority to require the posting of such a bond.in particular,it determined that the standard that governs the propriety of including attorneys fees in an appellate cost bond is set forth in independent fed of flight attendants zipes,where the supreme court held that attorneys fees could not be assessed against losing title vii unless their claims were frivolous,unreasonable or without foundation,d.the district court concluded that the zipes standard was satisfied in this case,stating having asserted no new reason supporting their contention that the denial of intervention was an abuse of the court discretion,the court finds that the appeal of the denial of intervention is without foundation.baynham,slip op.at emphasis added.
ultimately,the district courtgranted the class bond motion in partand denied it in part and held sixobjectors who had manifested an intent to appeal,jointly and severally responsible for posting a bond.this bond encompassed both filing and copying costs,but more significantly from the perspective of this per appellant in anticipated attorneys fees.see id.at.
on october,olorunnisomo filed a notice of appeal from the district court bond order,and it is this appeal that presently is before us.appellant challenges the order on the grounds that the term costs,as used in fed,does not encompass estimated attorneys fees on appeal even if rule permitted the inclusion of anticipated appellate attorneys fees in some contexts,respa is not such a context,as attorneys fees are explicitly distinguished from costs in d the district court lacked the inherent power to set an appellate cost bond to cover items not encompassed under fed.district courts are not permitted to impose a bond to cover anticipated sanctions on appeal,to cover attorneys fees that,it anticipates,will be shifted as a punitive or deterrent measure the court erred in determining that olorunnisomo appeal of the court denial of his motion for leave to intervene was without foundation the court decision to hold olorunnisomo jointly and severally liable for the class anticipated costs and attorneys fees constituted an abuse of discretion and setting the bond for substantially more than what olorunnisomo can be required to pay contravened the fifth amendment due process clause.
typically,a district court decision to impose a cost bond pursuant to fed.is reviewed for abuse of discretion.see adsani,at.however,a trial court legal determination as to the proper interpretation of rule,whether the term costs should be read to encompass attorneys reviewed de novo.see id.citation omitted.the exercise of the court inherent powers is reviewed for abuse of discretion.see chambers nasco,d.however,a determination as to the scope of those powers is a legal conclusion,and as such is reviewed de novo.see generally christo padgett,cir.
federal rule of appellate procedure provides in pertinent part 
in a civil case,the district court may require an appellant to file a bond or provide other security in any form and amount necessary to ensure payment of costs on appeal.
fed.emphasis added.this case requires us to determine whether the term costs,as used in this rule,includes anticipated appellate attorneys fees.although we never have addressed the issue before,this precise question was analyzed in by the second circuit.see adsani,at.given the paucity of caselaw on this the and third circuits have joined the second circuit in addressing it coupled with the persuasiveness of the adsani court discussion and fact that the arguments of the instant litigants track those advanced before the second circuit,we examine the adsani decision in some detail.
adsani was a copyright infringement case in which summary judgment was granted by the district court in favor of the defendants adsani filed a timely notice of appeal,and the district court required her,pursuant to fed,to post a bond in the amount of,a figure which included estimated appellate attorneys fees.the district court cited in support of its decision the facts that the plaintiff had no assets in the united states and posted no supersedeas bond pursuant to fed.adsani appealed this bond order,and as olorunnisomo does in this the definition of the term costs in rule is supplied by fed,which plainly excludes from its scope attorneys fees the defendants countered by the class presently the list of costs contained in rule is irrelevant,and that instead the propriety of including attorneys fees in a rule bond should be evaluated by referring to the definition of costs contained in the statutory fee shifting provision that attends the plaintiff underlying cause of action.in other words,they posited that if the fee shifting provision that applies to the underlying cause of action includes attorneys fees within awardable costs,then rule costs may likewise be said to encompass attorneys fees.thus,the adsani defendants asserted that in copyright cases,which implicate,see supra note,rule bonds may properly include attorneys fees.here,the class similarly attempts to support its position by pointing to respa fee shifting provision,which provides that the court may award to the prevailing party the court costs of the action together with reasonable attorneys fees.d.
in adsani,the second circuit ultimately sided with the defendants,and in so doing squarely rejected adsani argument that rule supplies the definition of costs,as that term is used in rule.it did so because rule contains no definition of costs at all,and instead clarifies the circumstances when costs should or may be awarded,see fed.a b,requires the courts of appeals to establish rules pertaining to the taxation of copying costs,see fed.c,sets forth procedural requirements for the obtainment of costs,see fed.d,and finally lists some costs that are taxable in the district court.see fed.e.notably,the rule never sets forth an exhaustive list or a general definition of costs.this analysis is plainly correct.under no fair reading of the simple,unambiguous language of rule can an exportable definition of costs be perceived in the language of that provision.
this is so,we believe,despite the contrary conclusions of several treatises and the two circuit level decisions other than adsani to address this issue.see hirschensohn lawyers title ins,june,in re am.president lines,james moore et,moore federal practice moore,at ed.attorney fees are not considered to be costs under appellate rule.wright,miller cooper,federal practice procedure wright,miller cooper,at ed.the costs secured by a rule bond are limited to costs taxable under appellate rule.they do not include attorney fees that may be assessed on appeal.
indeed,as the adsani court noted,neither in re am.president lines nor hirschensohn arose in the context of an underlying statute that provides for the shifting of attorneys fees.see at.accordingly,the second circuit,we think correctly,found both of these precedents to be distinguishable and neither to be compelling given the precise contours of the dispute then at bar.instead,the court took rule at face value while that rule certainly limits the universe of costs on appeal that are taxable in the district court,it does not attempt less can it be read forth an omnibus,generalizable definition of costs that governs the construction of fed.as the adsani court said we find that adsani argument that rule definition of costs should be imported into rule is unavailing because rule has no definition of the term costs but rather defines the circumstances under which costs should be awarded.at.
instead of gleaning the meaning of rule costs from rule,the adsani court determined that the definition of that term as it is used in rule should be derived from the statutory fee shifting provision that attends the plaintiff underlying cause of action.in support of this conclusion,the second circuit relied heavily on the supreme court decision in marek chesny,d.marek was a action brought jointly by the father and estate of a police shooting victim.prior to the rendering of the jury verdict,the defendants tendered a settlement offer of.see id.at.at.this was rejected by the plaintiffs,who ultimately were awarded,and subsequently sought attorneys fees pursuant to.see id.at.at.although these fees totaled,all but of this sum had been incurred after the defendants had made their settlement offer.see id.the defendants argued that costs,as used in.included attorneys fees,and that as such they were not liable for any of the fees incurred by the plaintiffs after the rejection of the settlement offer.see id.accordingly,the question confronting the supreme court in marek was whether attorneys fees are included within the definition of costs under.
in holding in the affirmative,the court first acknowledged the general applicability of the american rule regarding fee shifting,that each party bears its own attorneys fees.see marek,at.at alyeska pipeline serv.wilderness soc y,d discussing the general rule that,absent statute or enforceable contract,litigants pay their own attorneys fees citations omitted.however,the court proceeded to note that congress indisputably possesses the authority to abrogate the rule in any given circumstance.see marek,at.at alyeska pipeline,at.at w hile fully recognizing and accepting the general rule congress has made specific and explicit provisions for the allowance of attorneys fees under selected statutes granting or protecting various federal rights.
the supreme court then set forth a list of statutes that permit attorneys fees to be awarded as costs and observed 
the authors of federal rule of civil procedure were fully aware of these exceptions to the american rule.the advisory committee note to rule d contains an extensive list of the federal statutes which allowed for costs in particular cases of the statutes as to costs set forth in the final paragraph of the note,no fewer than allowed for attorney fees as part of costs.against this background of varying definitions of costs,the drafters of rule did not define the term nor is there any explanation whatever as to its intended meaning in the history of the rule.in this setting,given the importance of costs to the rule,it is very unlikely that this omission was mere oversight on the contrary,the most reasonable inference is that the term costs in rule was intended to refer to all costs properly awardable under the relevant substantive statute or other authority.in other words,all costs properly awardable in an action are to be considered within the scope of rule costs.thus,absent congressional expressions to the contrary,where the underlying statute defines costs to include attorney fees,we are satisfied such fees are to be included as costs for purposes of rule.
marek,at.at.
federal rule of appellate procedure does not differ from federal rule of civil procedure in any way that would lead us to adopt a different interpretive approach in this case than was embraced by the supreme court in marek.quite the contrary,close scrutiny reveals that there are several substantive and linguistic parallels between rule and rule.both concern the payment by a party of its opponent costs,yet neither provision defines the term costs.see adsani,at rule does not have a definition of costs any more than.had its own definition.moreover,just as the drafters of rule were aware in of the varying definitions of costs that were contained in various federal statutes,the same certainly can be said for the authors of rule,which bears an effective date of july.as such,the reasoning that guided the marek court determination that rule costs are to be defined with reference to the underlying cause of action is equally applicable in the context of rule.
as is specifically relevant in this case,section of respa,was enacted in.see culpepper inland mortgage,cir.congress amended this section effective january,to provide that the court may award to the prevailing party the court costs of the action together with reasonable attorneys fees.d.following this change,rule was itself stylistically amended on december.accordingly,the drafters of the present incarnation of rule must not only have been aware in general terms that numerous federal statutes encompass attorneys fees within the definition of costs,see marek,at.at,but also of the fact and nature of respa fee shifting regime.this timetable also weighs in favor of defining rule costs in the context of a respa action by referring to the definition of that term contained in d.
also counseling in favor of the adoption of the marek approach in the context of rule is the fact that this interpretive method is consonant with the purposes underlying that rule,as well as the primary rationales underlying fee shifting statutes generally and d in particular.the purpose of rule itself appears to have been correctly ascertained by the adsani court,which held that 
the court has made a determination that this particular appellant poses a payment risk because she has no assets in the united states and has failed to post a supersedeas bond.the purpose of rule appears to be to protect the rights of appellees brought into appeals courts by such appellants 
by contrast,the fee shifting provisions in various federal statutes serve two purposes.the first is to ensur e the effective prosecution of meritorious claims.kay ehrler,d.second,fee shifting provisions help to protect defendants from burdensome litigation having no legal or factual basis.christiansburg garment eeoc,d.courts have ascribed the former purpose to d.see glover standard fed.bank,cir congress has guaranteed legal representation under respa by permitting attorneys fees and costs as part of each allowable recovery.this permits and encourages individual consumers to raise valid respa claims.internal citations omitted mullinax radian,d,stating that the fee shifting provision ensures that the respa substantive facets will be enforced.
if fed.is read to include attorneys fees within the definition of costs whenever congress has so defined the term in the statutory fee shifting provision that attends the plaintiff underlying cause of action,then in appropriate qualifying,where there is a significant risk of insolvency on the appellant courts can require that the fees that ultimately would be shiftable be made available ab initio.it seems clear to us that the guaranteed availability of appellate attorneys fees prior to the taking of an appeal will further the goal of providing incentives to attorneys to file or defend against such appeals.notably,this reasoning coincides with the aim of rule,namely,to protect the rights of appellees brought into appeals courts by appellants who have no assets in the united states and have failed to post a supersedeas bond.adsani,at.this reading of rule also furthers the second purpose underlying fee shifting statutes,to protect defendants from the burdens that stem from being forced to defend frivolous lawsuits and to deter plaintiffs from bringing such suits.simply stated,an appellant is less likely to bring a frivolous appeal if he is required to post a sizable bond for anticipated attorneys fees prior to filing the appeal 
for the foregoing reasons,both marek and adsani persuasive application of that decision lead us to conclude that the meaning of costs,as used in rule,should be derived from the definition of costs contained in the statutory fee shifting provision that attends the plaintiff underlying cause of action.
although we believe that pursuant to rule attorneys fees may be included in an appellate cost bond,this does not answer the ultimate question whether the district court properly included attorneys fees within the bond in this case.the precise question at issue before the second before the supreme court in distinguishable from the one presented here,because there is a powerful linguistic distinction between the fee shifting provisions codified at and on the one hand,and respa fee shifting provision,d,on the other.specifically,provides that the court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party,other than the united states,a reasonable attorney fee as part of the costs.b emphasis added.features identical language.see t he court may award a reasonable attorney fee to the prevailing party as part of the costs.emphasis added.by contrast,under respa the court may award to the prevailing party the court costs of the action together with reasonable attorneys fees.d emphasis added.seizing on this linguistic distinction,olorunnisomo contends that the reasoning of the second circuit does not compel the same conclusion in this case as was reached in adsani.we agree.
each and every statute cited in marek as including attorneys fees within the definition of allowable costs features either the words as part of the costs or similar indicia that attorneys fees are encompassed within costs.see marek,at.at.for example,e of the securities act of describes the costs of suit,including reasonable attorney fees.e see also e same.indeed,in setting forth the governing legal principle in that case,the supreme court observed where the underlying statute defines costs to include attorney fees,we are satisfied
