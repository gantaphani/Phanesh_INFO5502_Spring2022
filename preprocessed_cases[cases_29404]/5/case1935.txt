plaintiff john luckett appeals from the order awarding attorney fees of to defendants john peter lee,john peter lee,and trevor hatfield after luckett complaint was dismissed for failure to post a vexatious litigant bond.code civ.because attorney fees are not recoverable under that statute when a complaint is dismissed solely for the failure to post the required bond,we hold that the trial court erred by awarding fees on that basis.the order is therefore reversed to the extent it awarded defendants their attorney fees,but is affirmed as to the award of costs.
facts and procedural history 
in,john luckett was declared a vexatious litigant pursuant to code of civil procedure section in re luckett d.luckett.as required by subdivision a of that section,luckett,acting in pro,sought leave of court in march to file an action against john peter lee,john peter lee,and trevor hatfield respondents the proposed complaint alleged that respondents,who are nevada lawyers,improperly sought to enforce a nevada state court judgment against luckett.because the trial court believed that documents attached as exhibits to luckett complaint did not show that luckett was in fact affected by the nevada judgment and enforcement proceedings,the trial court concluded luckett action lacked merit,and ordered luckett to post a bond,as authorized by the vexatious litigant statutes 
after the court denied luckett motion for reconsideration,he petitioned this court for a writ of mandate,contending there were documents showing he had been targeted by the nevada judgment enforcement proceedings.based on documents supporting that contention,we ruled that the trial court erred by denying the motion for reconsideration and issued a notice that we would issue a peremptory writ unless the trial court granted luckett motion for reconsideration.because our ruling was based solely on the trial court mistaken factual assumption,we made clear that when reconsidering the motion,the trial court was free to determine for itself whether luckett proposed complaint lacked merit and was filed for purposes of harassment or delay.if the trial court proceeded as suggested within days,we would not issue a peremptory writ,and a stay of any bond order would be lifted at that time.
in response to our palma notice,the trial court reconsidered whether luckett should post a vexatious litigant bond.the court concluded there might be merit to some but not all of luckett claims.it also noted that the luckett decision,which determined that luckett was a vexatious litigant,was based in part on his plethora of frivolous motions.the trial court in this action said luckett was repeating that conduct in the instant case,in a matter of three weeks,plaintiff has again shown indicators of precisely this same conduct.indeed,this court and specially appearing defendants have received repetitive and duplicate filings and motions on almost a daily basis.more than one of these purported motions are of questionable validity,running the gamut from a lack of standing attacking the timing of defendants payment of filing fees for their special appearance,seeking sanctions in sums totaling for the stress allegedly inflicted upon him by defendants special appearance,and because a second pending case filed by plaintiff has,apparently,now been dismissed by a nevada court.as a result,defendants were required to respond to these motions,justifying an order to post security.taking luckett claimed indigency into account,the court ordered him to post security of.
luckett never posted the bond.instead,he filed and served his complaint and entered respondents defaults.respondents moved to vacate the defaults because the bond had never been posted,and the complaint should therefore never have been filed.the trial court agreed,vacated the defaults,and dismissed luckett complaint based on his failure to post the required bond.respondents later sought to recover their costs and attorney fees based on the dismissal of luckett complaint,pursuant to section.even though respondents sought attorney fees of nearly,the court limited respondents fee recovery to the amount of the bond that luckett failed to post.the court also awarded respondents more than in costs.luckett appealed,contending the trial court erred by ordering him to pay attorney fees in the amount of the bond he should have posted.
discussion 
the vexatious litigant statutes were enacted in to restrain misuse of the legal system by parties who continually relitigate the same issues.singh lipworth th,d singh.a vexatious litigant is someone who,while representing himself,either brought and lost at least five actions in the preceding seven years,attempted to relitigate an action he had lost,repeatedly filed meritless motions,pleadings,or papers,or had previously been declared a vexatious litigant by another court,subds.b.upon motion by a defendant in a pending action,and a showing that there is no reasonable probability a vexatious litigant will prevail in an action,the court may order the plaintiff to post security to cover the defendant costs and attorney fees.if the security is not posted,the action will be dismissed.singh,supra,at,d.
section permits a court,acting on its own motion or that of a party,to enter a prefiling order which prohibits a vexatious litigant from filing a new action without first obtaining leave of court,subd.a.the new action may be filed only if it appears to have merit and was not brought for the purposes of harassment or delay.such an action may still be subject to an order to post security pursuant to section,subd.b.when such a prefiling order has been issued,the clerk may not file the action without an order from the court allowing the plaintiff to file his complaint.if the clerk mistakenly permits the filing of an action without such an order,upon filing of a proper notice by any party,the action may be stayed for days until permission to file is granted.if the plaintiff does not then obtain the order,the action will be dismissed,subd.c.a vexatious litigant who disobeys a prefiling order may be punished for contempt of court,subd.a.
the singh court considered an appeal from a vexatious litigant whose action had been dismissed because he failed to post the required security under section.the plaintiff argued that he could not be required to post security for the defendant attorney fees unless some independent statutory or contractual basis for awarding such fees existed.the singh court disagreed,interpreting the vexatious litigant statutes as an independent and basis for awarding fees from previously posted security whenever a vexatious litigant pursued and lost an action that had been found to lack merit under sections through.singh,supra,th at,d.according to the singh court,the liability and the remedy were created by the vexatious litigant statutes,which authorized an attorney fees award in favor of a successful defendant from the security posted by a vexatious litigant.id.at,d.
after finding that some portions of luckett complaint had merit,the trial court ordered luckett to post security of pursuant to section.when it dismissed luckett complaint for failing to do so,the court ordered him to pay respondents attorney fees in the amount of the unposted bond.because singh interpreted the vexatious litigant statutes to authorize an attorney fees award from the plaintiff security,the trial court reasoned that luckett should be liable for respondents fees in the amount of the bond he failed to post.luckett contends the statute does not authorize an award of attorney fees where an action is dismissed for the failure to post security for such fees in the first instance.he is correct.
because we are interpreting a statute,the rules of statutory construction apply.the fundamental rule of statutory construction is to ascertain the intent of the legislature in order to effectuate the purpose of the law in doing so,we first look to the words of the statute and try to give effect to the usual,ordinary import of the language,at the same time not rendering any language mere surplusage.the words must be construed in context and in light of the nature and obvious
