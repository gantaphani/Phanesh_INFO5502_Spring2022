the prison litigation reform act plra,d,caps awards of attorneys fees in prisoner civil rights actions that result in a monetary judgment.in this appeal,we are asked to decide whether this statutory cap on attorneys fees applies to a stipulation entered in the united states district court for the northern district of new york mordue,dismissing a prisoner action against two new york state corrections officers.the stipulation was entered pursuant to.a and memorialized a private settlement agreement between the parties providing for,among other things,dismissal of the action with prejudice,payment of to ramon torres,and the payment of torres reasonable attorneys fees.the district court held that the plra fee cap was applicable to such a stipulation of dismissal and,accordingly,the court declined to award attorneys fees in excess of the statutory cap.the district court also upheld the constitutionality of the plra fee cap after concluding that the cap was rationally related to legitimate governmental interests.
for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that the plra fee cap does not apply to the stipulation of dismissal entered in this case and,consequently,we need not reach the issue of whether the plra fee caps are constitutional.accordingly,we vacate the order of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
in october,after exhausting his administrative remedies,torres filed a pro se complaint in the district court against various new york state corrections officers and officials,alleging that the corrections officers at the auburn correctional facility where he was incarcerated violated his federal constitutional rights by using excessive force against him.after filing his pro se complaint,torres initially retained pro bono counsel from prisoners legal services of new york,which filed a second amended complaint in january.in his second amended complaint,torres alleged that,while being interrogated about a fire that was set at the prison,he was verbally threatened with racial epithets,punched in the face,choked,severely beaten until he lapsed into unconsciousness,and then dragged back to his cell torres further alleged that he was subsequently treated at the prison hospital for a broken nose,two black eyes,and multiple contusions and lacerations.torres sought in compensatory damages and in punitive damages,as well as attorneys fees and costs.
in january,the public interest law firm of syracuse university law school was substituted as counsel.the parties thereafter engaged in significant discovery.at a january pretrial settlement conference,torres submitted a settlement demand,to which defendants never responded.a trial was initially scheduled to begin on december,but was postponed to february,at defendants request.
on january,two weeks before trial was scheduled to commence,defendants served torres with an offer of judgment,pursuant to,to settle the case for plus costs and reasonable attorneys fees accrued to date.the cover letter accompanying defendants rule offer stated that i fees were a separate consideration from damages ii defendants were willing to compensate torres for the reasonable costs and attorneys fees expended to date and iii fees were not to be calculated as a percentage of the total amount of the settlement offer.two days later,torres accepted the settlement offer in a notice that provided,in relevant part,that he accept ed defendant s offer and ask ed that the clerk enter judgment in accordance with the offer.in february,the parties entered into a stipulation for an extension of time,in relation to a motion for fees and costs.that stipulation provided as follows in order to give the parties an opportunity to resolve and determine reasonable attorney fees and costs without further expenditure of judicial resources,it is hereby stipulated by and between the parties that the deadline for filing plaintiff motion for attorney fees and costs be extended to days after entry of judgment.
the parties were unsuccessful in their subsequent attempts to agree on reasonable attorneys fees.consequently,in march,torres moved for an award of attorneys fees pursuant to the settlement and judgment entered on january,and.in his motion,torres sought in attorneys fees.defendants opposed torres fee request,arguing that the fee award was subject to the limitation in the plra,which capped the award of fees in prisoners civil rights litigation at of the money judgment entered in a plaintiff favor.defendants also argued that the amounts claimed by torres were not reasonable.in reply,torres argued that the accepted offer of judgment was governed by contract law principles and that,based on both the language of the settlement agreement and the conduct of the parties,the parties had not intended that the plra caps would apply.torres argued in the alternative that,if the plra did apply,the statute was unconstitutional.specifically,torres claimed that the plra violated the equal protection clause because the act treated prisoner and nonprisoner civil rights plaintiffs differently without a rational basis for doing so.
as noted above,notwithstanding the references to a judgment in the parties filings and correspondence,a separate judgment was never entered with respect to the parties settlement.instead,on may,while the attorneys fee dispute was sub judice the parties settlement agreement was memorialized,at defendants request,in a stipulation of settlement and order of dismissal signed and entered by the district court pursuant to.a.the stipulation provided,among other things,that i torres complaint would be dismissed with prejudice ii defendants would pay torres in full satisfaction of all claims for damages iii defendants would pay torres counsel reasonable attorney fees and costs to be determined by the district court upon submission of the parties and iv defendants would make no admission of any wrongdoing.
in a,unpublished memorandum decision and order dated february,the district court awarded torres in attorneys fees after determining that the cap on fees set forth in the plra applied to a stipulation of dismissal.in addition,the district court,applying rational basis review,rejected torres argument that the plra cap was unconstitutional.this final order was entered on february,and this timely appeal followed 
after this appeal was docketed,the clerk of the court,acting pursuant to a,filed a certification with the attorney general of the united states indicating that the constitutionality of the plra was being challenged,and inviting the united states to intervene to defend the constitutionality of the statute.by motion dated september,the united states sought leave to intervene to defend the constitutionality of the plra in an order dated september,we granted the motion to intervene.
