plaintiff terry ann swanson appeals from a judgment entered after the trial court had granted a motion for summary judgment in favor of defendant state farm general insurance company state farm.the trial court determined that state farm did not breach its insurance contract with swanson by refusing to pay any attorneys fees incurred by her cumis counsel after state farm withdrew its reservation of rights.we affirm.
factual background 
state farm issued swanson homeowners insurance policy the policy that provided personal and general liability coverage for her real property in la crescenta,for the period of may,to may.the policy provided that if a third party brought a suit against an insured for damages for covered bodily injury or property damage caused by an occurrence,state farm would provide a defense at our expense by counsel of our choice.bold omitted.
on october,swanson personal attorney,richard blasco,requested that state farm defend and indemnify swanson in an action on a by her neighbors,mark and patricia bitetti the bitetti action,which alleged claims for premises liability and negligence in connection with an incident that occurred on january.blasco was already representing swanson in the underlying lawsuit on her claims against the bitettis for damage to her property and for personal injury caused by failure of the bitettis retaining wall after the la crescenta area experienced substantial rainfall in december.
on november,state farm wrote to swanson and stated that it was accepting the defense of the lawsuit subject to our reservation of rights.state farm tentatively accepted swanson choice of blasco as her cumis counsel,subject to his compliance with the requirements of civil code section state farm asserted that there was a question whether we have a duty,under the terms of the policy,to defend or indemnify swanson for the loss alleged in the bitetti action.the rights reserved by state farm involved questions regarding whether some of the claimed damages would qualify as bodily injury or property damage as defined by the policy,whether they arose out of an occurrence as defined by the policy,and whether they were excluded from coverage by policy provisions excluding certain bodily injury or property damage.bold omitted.state farm also advised swanson that it was reserving the right to supplement or amend this reservation of rights to add or remove any policy defenses,as well as the right to withdraw this defense if we determine there is no duty to defend or indemnify you.state farm also reserved the right to submit any disagreement over defense attorney fees to arbitration as outlined in c ivil c ode section.
on december,blasco responded that the terms of state farm november,letter were generally acceptable,except for state farm proposed hourly rate of.blasco requested an hourly rate of,the same rate swanson had been paying him.blasco also provided information about himself and his firm to demonstrate his qualifications to serve as defense counsel under civil code section.
on december,state farm notified blasco that he had met the requisite statutory qualifications for cumis counsel but advised him that the compensated hourly rate would remain.the parties resolved the issue by blasco agreeing to accept payment from state farm at the hourly rate of and swanson agreeing to pay blasco the hourly rate difference.
on april,state farm amended its original reservation of rights and withdrew certain policy defenses it had previously asserted in its reservation of rights.it is undisputed that state farm withdrawal of these reservations eliminated the conflict between the insurer and its insured state farm informed swanson that it had chosen and retained an attorney from the firm of procter,mccarthy and slaughter procter to take over the defense of the bitetti action.state farm also advised swanson that elimination of the conflict relieved it of its obligation to pay for independent counsel.state farm explained that in the absence of any obligation to provide independent counsel of the insured choosing,state farm had the right to provide a defense at our expense by counsel of our choice.
prior to the april,letter,state farm had not asked for swanson consent to turn control of the bitetti action over to proctor or to have proctor serve as defense cocounsel with blasco.swanson subsequently agreed to add proctor as cocounsel without removing blasco as her defense counsel.proctor and blasco then worked together as cocounsel in the defense of the bitetti action.blasco continued billing state farm and swanson as he had been doing before state farm withdrew the reservations of rights that had triggered swanson right to cumis counsel.state farm,however,did not make any further payments to blasco 
the bitetti action went to trial in november.both blasco and proctor defended swanson.the jury found in favor of swanson and did not award the bitettis any monetary damages the trial court in the bitetti action entered judgment on january.
procedural background 
swanson filed this action in april her first cause of action asked the court to submit the dispute over blasco fees to arbitration pursuant to the terms of the policy and civil code section.her second cause of action for breach of insurance contract sought damages in the amount of for,attorneys fees billed by blasco for the defense of the bitetti action.her third cause of action for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing sought damages for mental suffering and emotional distress,as well as punitive damages.
in july swanson filed a motion to compel arbitration of the blasco fee dispute on august,the trial court denied the motion.
in october swanson filed a motion for summary adjudication on all three causes of action.in january the trial court denied the motion,noting that the court had previously decided the arbitration issue in august.
in september state farm filed a motion for summary judgment or in the alternative for summary adjudication.state farm argued that when it withdrew all reservations of rights regarding swanson defense on april,swanson was no longer entitled to independent cumis counsel paid by state farm.state farm argued that at that point it was entitled to appoint counsel of its choosing and had no further obligation to pay for swanson personal attorney.swanson filed an opposition to state farm motion for summary judgment and a for summary adjudication on the issues in swanson motion for summary adjudication.state farm argued on reply that the court could not consider swanson because she had filed it on only days notice in violation of code of civil procedure section.
on january,the trial court granted state farm motion for summary judgment and denied swanson.the trial court stated the parties agree that there is no disputed issue of material fact and that this motion presents purely an issue of law of first impression.that issue is whether,after reservations are withdrawn by an insurer,an insurer remains obligated to pay the insured personal counsel if the insured does not wish to be represented by panel counsel on a basis.the trial court concluded that when state farm ultimately withdrew its reservations,plaintiff insured was no longer entitled to independent cumis counsel.under the terms of the policy,where there was no,state farm had the right to provide a defense at our expense by counsel of our choice.the court rejected swanson claim that state farm,swanson,and blasco had created a modified insurance agreement when state farm and blasco agreed in to a rate of reimbursement for his fees.the trial court stated agreeing on the hourly rate was the satisfaction of an obligation imposed by statute.civil code section does not expand or broaden an insurer duty to defend.on february,the trial court entered judgment in favor of state farm.swanson filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
the primary issue on appeal is whether state farm had the right to take control of the litigation with an attorney of its choosing and to cease paying blasco,cumis counsel chosen by swanson,after state farm withdrew its reservation of rights.we agree with the trial court that state farm had such a right.as we explain below,an insurer has a duty to provide cumis counsel to its insured only while the insurer maintains a reservation of rights.thus,when state farm withdrew its reservation of rights,it no longer had an obligation to allow swanson to control the litigation or an obligation to pay the attorneys fees of swanson cumis counsel.

state farm duty to defend and to provide cumis counsel 
the provisions of the standard general liability insurance policy impose on the insurer a duty to indemnify the insured,generally stating that the insurer will pay all sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages for harm proved within coverage.a secondary provision of the standard policy imposes on the insurer a duty to defend the insured,generally stating that the insurer has a duty to defend the insured in any suit seeking damages for harm alleged within coverage.certain underwriters at lloyd of london superior court cal th.an insurer duty to defend is broader than its duty to indemnify.buss superior court cal th.the insurer duty to indemnify runs to claims that are actually covered,in light of the facts proved by contrast,the insurer duty to defend runs to claims that are merely potentially covered,in light of facts alleged or otherwise disclosed.ibid.
at the time an insurer accepts an insured tender of defense,the insurer has an incentive to reserve a broad spectrum of coverage defenses in order to preserve its right to limit its obligation to indemnify to covered claims.blue ridge ins.jacobsen cal th.by giving notice to its insured,a n insurer may agree to defend a suit subject to a reservation of rights.citation.in this manner,an insurer meets its obligation to furnish a defense without waiving its right to assert coverage defenses against the insured at a later time.citation.id.at.i f the insurer adequately reserves its right to assert the noncoverage defense later,it will not be bound by any judgment against its insured.if the injured party prevails,that party or the insured will assert his claim against the insurer at this time the insurer can raise the noncoverage defense previously reserved.penney casualty ins.cal d,fn.omitted,quoting gray zurich insurance cal d,see state farm general ins.mintarsih th,an insurer may provide the required defense under a reservation of its rights to later assert its objections to coverage as to one or more of the claims alleged against its insured.
when an insurer undertakes defense of its insured,an attorney selected by the insurer provides dual representation to the insured and the insurer.an insurer that owes a duty to defend an insured,arising because there exists a potential for liability under the policy,has the right to control defense and settlement of the third party action against its insured,and is a direct participant in the litigation.citations.the insurer typically hires defense counsel who represents the interests of both the insurer and the insured.citations.in this usual tripartite relationship existing between insurer,insured and counsel,there is a single,common interest shared among them.dual representation by counsel is beneficial since the shared goal of minimizing or eliminating liability to a third party is the same.citation.long century indemnity th.
the benefits of dual representation give way to the need for independent cumis counsel for the insured,however,if an insurer reserves its rights to deny indemnification on specific coverage issues,and the reservation creates a conflict of interest between the insurer and its insured that precludes dual representation because of the attorney ethical obligations to refrain from representing conflicting interests,subd.b long century indemnity,supra,th at.as the court explained in cumis,the canons of ethics impose upon lawyers hired by the insurer an obligation to explain to the insured and the insurer the full implications of joint representation in situations where the insurer has reserved its rights to deny coverage.if the insured does not give an informed consent to continued representation,counsel must cease to represent both.moreover,in the absence of such consent,where there are divergent interests of the insured and the insurer brought about by the insurer reservation of rights based on possible noncoverage under the insurance policy,the insurer must pay the reasonable cost for hiring independent counsel by the insured.the insurer may not compel the insured to surrender control of the litigation citations.disregarding the common interests of both insured and insurer in finding total nonliability in the third party action,the remaining interests of the two diverge to such an extent as to create an actual,ethical conflict of interest warranting payment for the insured independent counsel.cumis,supra,d at accord,james truck ins.exchange th,fn.
