aspex eyewear and contour optik,together aspex appeal the summary judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york,ruling that aspex is equitably estopped from pursuing this infringement claim against clariti eyewear,on,clariti challenges the district court denial of attorney fees under.
background 
aspex filed suit against clariti in march,alleging that clariti sales of its airmag brand eyeglass frames constitute willful infringement of patent the patent and no.the patent.the patents relate to eyeglass frames with magnetically attachable auxiliary lenses such as sunshades.after summary judgment briefing was completed,the infringement claim for the patent was dismissed by stipulation.as for the patent,the dismissal on the ground of equitable estoppel was based on the three years of silence after aspex contacts with clariti in concerning infringement by the airmag products.
this is not the first litigation between these parties.in,aspex sued clariti for infringement of patent,the patent that was reissued as the patent.later that year,clariti and aspex entered into a consent judgment wherein clariti acknowledged infringement of the patent by its magnetic eyewear designs,and agreed to a permanent injunction barring sales of those designs and any other magnetic eyewear that would infringe the patent.clariti did not again market a magnetic eyewear product until early,when clariti launched what it described as a new line of airmag eyeglass frames with magnetically attachable auxiliary lenses.on march,counsel for aspex sent clariti a letter identifying four aspex patents,patent and the patent,and stating 
it is our understanding that some of the products sold by you may be covered by the claims of the above mentioned patents.in order to minimize further damage,we ask you to immediately confirm for us that you have stopped selling any frames,frame attachments or parts in violation of our rights under the patent s.we also ask you to supply us with the identity of the source of these goods and information concerning the number of pieces sold to date.we will then be in a position to reach a prompt and reasonable resolution of this situation.
it has been our policy and continues to be our strong intention to fully and vigorously enforce our rights under the exclusive license to these magnetic frame attachments.
we look forward to your immediate reply to this very urgent and serious matter.
three days later,on march,aspex sent an almost identical letter as to the patent.on march,clariti responded,stating that its policy is not to infringe any valid,enforceable patent,and requesting certain information to assist it in analyzing the aspex patents,including file histories,assignment documents,and other documents likely to be readily available to aspex.clariti observed that the patents have a large number of claims and asked aspex to specify which claims you believe may cover clariti products by model number.aspex responded on may,as follows 
we are in receipt of your letter dated march.
for your review,enclosed please find courtesy copies of the file histories for patent and.
also,in response to numbered paragraph of your letter,we have provided you with the following list of claims we believe cover the frames sold by your client 
patent claim and 
patent claims.
we have included more than enough information for your analysis of your client infringement of patent and.
we repeat,in order to minimize further damage,we ask you to immediately confirm for us that your client has stopped selling any frames,frame attachments or parts in violation of our client rights under these patents.we also ask you to supply us with the identity of the source of these goods and information concerning the number of pieces sold to date.we will then be in a position to reach a prompt and reasonable resolution of this situation.
we look forward to hearing from you.
neither the nor the patent was mentioned in this letter,and no claim of either patent was identified by aspex as covering any clariti product.
on june,clariti responded,stating after reviewing the allegations raised in your letter,we believe that the products of clariti eyewear do not infringe any valid claims of the or patents.
the record reports no further contact from aspex until august,when aspex wrote to clariti as follows 
it has come to our attention that your company is manufacturing a product called airmag.this product utilizes magnetic attraction on the two side extensions for attachment of the auxiliary frames to the primary frames.as such,it directly infringes our clients patent rights with regard to the patent.specifically,your products are covered by claims of these patents,including but not limited to claims and.a copy of the patent is enclosed for your reference.
the parties exchanged additional letters concerning the patent,clariti refused to cease sales of the airmag products,and aspex filed this suit on march.
clariti then moved to dismiss aspex infringement claims on the ground of equitable estoppel based on the three years of silence.clariti also moved for summary judgment of invalidity,and of unenforceability due to inequitable conduct during patent prosecution.based on the asserted equitable estoppel inequitable conduct,clariti moved to have the case declared exceptional and attorney fees awarded under.the district court granted clariti motion for dismissal on the ground of equitable estoppel,but ruled that the case was not exceptional.aspex and clariti appeal the judgments adverse to each.we affirm the district court rulings.
discussion 
a summary judgment of equitable estoppel is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.see aukerman chaides constr,en banc.however,when there are disputed underlying factual elements,summary judgment is inappropriate unless the movant would prevail even on the view of the facts.see anderson liberty lobby.
the district court held that aspex conduct was misleading,in that aspex in threatened an infringement suit under several patents,clariti responded that its products did not infringe the claims of the and patents on which aspex focused,and this response was followed by silence for three years as to the patents now in suit,while clariti continued to market the accused products without objection.in the context of patent infringement,the three elements of equitable estoppel that must be established are the patentee,through misleading conduct,led the alleged infringer to reasonably believe that the patentee did not intend to enforce its patent against the infringer the alleged infringer relied on that conduct and due to its reliance,the alleged infringer would be materially prejudiced if the patentee were permitted to proceed with its charge of infringement.aukerman,at.misleading conduct may include specific statements,action,inaction,or silence when there was an obligation to speak.id.in deciding whether to bar the suit on estoppel grounds,the court must consider all evidence relevant to the equities.id.at.
aspex argues that misleading silence can not be found unless an express charge of infringement was levied against a particular product.aspex states that no particular product was identified by either aspex or clariti during the correspondence and that aspex did not threaten an immediate suit for infringement,whereby its failure to sue could not produce an estoppel.in support aspex cites meyers asics.however,this case does not support the position taken by aspex.in meyers the court explained that intentionally misleading silence arises when a patentee threatened immediate or vigorous enforcement of its patent rights but then did nothing for an unreasonably long time.id.quoting meyers brooks shoe.meyers did not hold that failure to identify specific products is a critical condition,when the accused infringer is sufficiently apprised of the products of the patentee concern.
aspex also seeks to distinguish scholle blackhawk molding,and wafer shave,gillette,aff,table.the district court cited scholle and wafer shave for the proposition that a patentee silence and inaction can be misleading in the context of the specific interaction between the parties.in scholle the patentee had notified blackhawk that one of blackhawk valved bottle caps infringed a scholle patent.blackhawk asked which claims were allegedly infringed,but received no response.later blackhawk provided scholle with samples of a new cap design,and stated that it would consider the new product unless scholle advised otherwise.scholle made no response,but three years later sued for infringement.dismissal on grounds of equitable estoppel was sustained.aspex argues that clariti did not advise aspex that it considered airmag a alternative to the patent,and thus that scholle is inapplicable.
wafer shave involved a charge of infringement as to a particular gillette product,with a cease and desist deadline included in the letter from wafer shave.gillette refused to cease and desist,wafer shave did not explain why it considered the patent to be infringed,and wafer shave did not reassert infringement in later correspondence with gillette.wafer shave filed suit three years and five months after its last charge of infringement and two years and nine months after the last communication with gillette.the district court found equitable estoppel,and this court affirmed,wafer shave,gillette,table.aspex states that it presented no deadline in its letters.
although aspex notes factual differences among wafer shave,scholle,and the instant case,equitable relief is not a matter of precise formula.aspex letters to clariti of march and,can fairly be understood as threats of suit for infringement,for aspex stated its understanding that some of the products sold by you may be covered by the claims of the above mentioned patents,and aspex strong intention to fully and vigorously enforce our rights in this very urgent and serious matter.the ensuing silence is analogous to the silence in scholle and in wafer shave.
aspex argues that its letters did not threaten suit,and highlights the equivocal nature of the statements that its patents may cover some of clariti products.aspex points to the letters request that clariti divulge sales information and the source of the accused goods,arguing that this shows that aspex would not file suit until it received such information.the district court viewed the correspondence as a whole,and concluded that it was reasonably viewed by clariti as a threat of an infringement suit,and not mitigated by the words may and some.
with respect to the patent,the aspex letter of march,was specific to this patent,but in response to clariti request for the claims thought to be infringed,aspex on may,identified only claims of the and patents.whether this sequence is fairly viewed as a tacit withdrawal of the patent,or as misleading silence with respect to the patent,the result is the same,for it was reasonable for clariti to infer that aspex was not continuing the accusation of infringement as to the patent.
aspex points out that silence alone does not generate an estoppel,and that clariti must show that,in fact,it substantially relied on the misleading conduct of the patentee in connection with taking some action.aukerman,at.it is correct that estoppel requires reliance.clariti position is that it expanded its airmag products in the belief that the patent would not be enforced.clariti president,dominique yonemoto,declared that following aspex may correspondence,she understood that aspex was no longer accusing clariti of infringing any claims of the patent.aspex,wl,at.yonemoto stated that had aspex filed a patent infringement suit against the airmag products in march,given the newness of the products and clariti lack of investment in them,clariti would very likely have simply decided to stop selling the airmag products and pursued other business opportunities.clariti principal br.quoting declaration.clariti points to the may,letter from aspex,which listed only claims of the and patents,and did not mention the patent,which is the only patent here in suit.clariti stresses that aspex did not respond to clariti letter asserting,and that clariti thereafter expanded its business involving the airmag products its airmag sales totaled less than sales were over and in and clariti sold about in airmag products.clariti promoted the products at the international vision expo and enlarged its sales force during this period.
aspex argues that clariti testimony was speculative and conclusory,and does not suffice to support summary judgment of estoppel.however,to show reliance on aspex silence and inaction,clariti need not prove precisely what alternative paths it would have taken,or that every marketing decision was based on reliance on aspex silence.it was undisputed that clariti took into account aspex failure to pursue the patent while the parties discussed the and patents.clariti president referred to the prior patent dispute between the parties,where aspex did file an infringement suit.in that suit clariti agreed to an injunction,and withdrew the accused products.clariti president stated that clariti would likely have done the same with the airmag products if aspex had filed suit in rather than withdraw into silence.we agree with the district court that reliance on aspex silence was shown.
aspex argues that clariti was not reasonable in relying on aspex silence to believe that the and other patents would not be enforced and thus to continue to enlarge the airmag business.according to aspex,clariti should have known that aspex might be delaying an infringement suit because suit was not economically worthwhile in,at the low volume of airmag sales.aspex takes this argument from aukerman,where the accused infringer chaides told the patentee aukerman that the infringement claim was worth at most to a year.this court ruled that this could lead one in chaides position to infer that aukerman did not sue because the amount in issue was de minimis,not that aukerman was abandoning its claim against chaides for all time regardless of quantum.aukerman,at.the court held that aukerman was not necessarily estopped from bringing suit more than eight years later,when the infringer business had grown.the court explained that summary judgment of estoppel was not available,for the infringer might not reasonably be credited with believing that enlarged infringement could not be remedied.in the case at bar,neither party argued that the low volume of clariti initial sales was a factor in leading aspex to drop the patent from its correspondence in,while the may,letter listed claims from the and patents.clariti could reasonably have relied on this action in enlarging its business within the possible reach of the patent,and in continuing to do so in the succeeding years of silence.
we also agree with the district court that clariti development of its airmag business,in reliance on aspex silence after its aggressive letters,represents a significant change in economic position and constitutes material prejudice sufficient to support equitable estoppel.clariti need not show a total loss of value in order to show material prejudice.prejudice may be shown by a change of economic position flowing from actions taken or not taken by the patentee.see abb robotics,gmfanuc robotics,c ases in which economic prejudice has been found lacking did not so hold because of a lack of capital investments,but,rather,because the alleged infringer failed to prove that their increased expenditures,on marketing and development,were in any way related to actions taken by the patentee.although aspex argues that clariti continued to expand this business after aspex filed suit in for infringement of the patent,and thus that material prejudice should not be attributed to aspex period of silence,the district court did not err in determining prejudice based on clariti commercial activities undertaken and expanded during the period of silence.
in aukerman the court explained that the trial court must,even where the three elements of equitable estoppel are established,take into consideration any other evidence and facts respecting the equities of the parties in exercising its discretion and deciding whether to allow the defense of equitable estoppel to bar the suit.at.aspex argues that the trial court did not properly consider clariti own egregious conduct,for clariti continued its sales of the airmag products after receipt of aspex letters in,and without obtaining advice of counsel as to the patent.aspex states that this shows willful infringement of the patent,for only the passage of time gave weight to aspex silence.
the district court stated that this court ruling in in re seagate technolgy,llc,made clear that there is no automatic obligation to obtain or present an exculpatory opinion of counsel in order to avoid willful infringement.although this ruling is not controlling as to estoppel,for this equitable question the court could have given weight to its conclusion that the record contained no evidence of egregious copying or willful infringement.the district court further reasoned that in light of aspex may,letter,which did not mention the patent and identified no claims as infringed,clariti had no reason to think that aspex still believed it infringed the patent,and was under no duty to cease its activities based solely on the initial letter from aspex and the abandoned charge of infringement as to the patent.
after aspex reopened discussion in,clariti received from the manufacturer of the airmag products an opinion of counsel on the validity of the patent.aspex points out that clariti relied on this opinion in the district court,and argues that clariti failure to obtain an opinion earlier constitutes evidence of clariti willful infringement.aspex argues that where a defendant chooses to rely on an opinion of counsel to negate a charge of willful infringement,the timing of the opinion can be considered in the totality of circumstances.aspex argues that in view of the letters and clariti knowledge of aspex enforcement of its patents in the litigation between them,clariti should have stopped selling the airmag products or obtained an opinion of counsel in.
we agree that the timing as well as the content of an opinion of counsel may be relevant to the issue of willful infringement,for timely consultation with counsel may be evidence that an infringer did not engage in objectively reckless behavior.see finisar directv group,thus a competent opinion of counsel concluding either that directv did not infringe the patent or that it was invalid would provide a sufficient basis for directv to proceed without engaging in objectively reckless behavior with respect to the patent.however,as the district court explained,the may,letter from aspex no longer referred to the patent as potentially infringed,and clariti could reasonably have concluded that aspex would not sue on the patent.thus clariti can not have been objectively reckless in not obtaining an opinion of counsel as to the patent.
the elements of equitable estoppel were established without material factual dispute,and the district court did not abuse its discretion in weighing the equities.we affirm the district court ruling that aspex is equitably estopped from suing clariti for infringement of the patent.
on,clariti argues that this case should be declared exceptional under,for the purpose of awarding attorney fees.the district court denied the request.
a case may be found exceptional in terms of when there has been some material inappropriate conduct related to the matter in litigation,such as willful infringement,fraud or inequitable conduct in procuring the patent,misconduct during litigation,vexatious or unjustified litigation,conduct that violates,or other major impropriety.see standard oil am.cyanamid,collecting cases beckman instruments,lkb produkter ab,affirming exceptional case determination based on a strategy of vexatious litigation activity.even in the absence of misconduct in the litigation or in securing the patent,attorney fees may be assessed when the litigation was objectively baseless and was brought in subjective bad faith.brooks furniture,dutailer int l,reversing exceptional case finding based on lack of subjective bad faith,citing professional real estate investors,columbia pictures industries,holding that litigation can not be deprived of immunity under the doctrine as a sham unless the litigation is objectively baseless and brought in subjective bad faith see also icu medical,alaris medical,affirming attorney fee award on the basis of litigation misconduct and objectively baseless litigation brought in bad faith.the party seeking attorney fees under must establish,by clear and convincing evidence,that the case is exceptional.forest,abbott.this court reviews the factual determination of whether a case is exceptional for clear error.id.at.when a case is found to be exceptional,the award of attorney fees is within the discretion of the district court,and is reviewed accordingly.see serious indus.plastic recovery techs,abuse of discretion standard.
section is an exception to the american rule concerning attorney fees,and is limited to circumstances in which the award of fees is necessary to prevent a gross injustice.forest,at.in forest labs.the accused infringer argued that the patentee misleading conduct leading to a successful charge of equitable estoppel was in bad faith,and that this made the case exceptional this court held that does not reach a patentee or misleading business conduct toward an accused infringer before litigation.id.clariti argues that this case is different because clariti specifically warned aspex in,after aspex broke its silence,that an attempt at litigation would be equitably estopped,yet aspex filed suit anyway.
while we have affirmed the district court ruling of equitable estoppel,the warning by clariti that it would raise this defense does not convert aspex action into one of bad faith.defeat of a litigation position,even on summary judgment,does not warrant an automatic finding that the suit was objectively baseless all of the circumstances must be considered.the district court did not clearly err in ruling that the act of bringing this suit,under the circumstances that existed,did not produce an exceptional case in terms of,and does not warrant the award of attorney fees.
clariti also argues that the case is exceptional based on inequitable conduct by aspex in procuring the patent.inequitable conduct in obtaining a patent may,depending on the circumstances,support the award of attorney fees.see,brasseler,i,stryker sales,affirming finding of exceptional case based on inequitable conduct gardco,herst lighting,i t has not been held that every case of proven inequitable conduct must result in an automatic attorney fee award.clariti argues that the inventor of the patent,david chao,and his assignee,contour optik,knew of a material reference and intentionally withheld it from the patent and trademark office.the reference is a patent application filed by julie madison of manhattan design studio.the madison application was filed on april,ten days before chao filed the application,and it issued as patent the patent shortly after the patent issued.chao testified that he became aware of the madison application while it was pending,in late or early,and was very upset because he had given some technical drawings to madison and he believed that she had used these drawings in her patent application.neither chao nor his assignee contour optik brought the madison application to the attention of the pto during prosecution of the application.clariti later requested reexamination of the issued patent on the basis of madison issued patent,and the claims were confirmed after chao swore behind the madison application.
clariti argument for inequitable conduct is that the madison application was material because the pto granted reexamination of the patent,and that chao should have described the madison application to the examiner during pendency of the application.clariti argues that aspex,the patent exclusive licensee,committed inequitable conduct independent of this lapse by the inventor and the assignee of the patent,because aspex had purchased the assets of manhattan design studio,including the madison application,before issuance of the patent.clariti states that aspex should have required disclosure of the madison application to the
