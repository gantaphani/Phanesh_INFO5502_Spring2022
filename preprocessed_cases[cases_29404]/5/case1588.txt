attorney joseph baxter and his former clients,michael and lorie bock,participated in an arbitration under the mandatory fee arbitration act bus,et mfaa,after stipulating to be bound by the result.in his decision,the arbitrator concluded the legal services provided by baxter should be valued at the amount already paid by the bocks and awarded baxter nothing.as all parties acknowledge,however,the arbitrator erred in stating the amount of fees paid by the bocks.when the error was brought to his attention,the arbitrator declined to correct his award.in addition,considerably after the arbitration was concluded,baxter discovered the arbitrator was in the business of auditing attorney bills and had written extensively about attorney overbilling.
in the trial court,baxter argued unsuccessfully that the arbitration award should be vacated,among other reasons,because the arbitrator erred in stating the amount paid by the bocks and failed to disclose matters relating to bias.he repeats those arguments on appeal.in turn,the bocks contend the trial court failed to award them sufficient legal fees in connection with the confirmation proceeding.
we reject baxter arguments and affirm the trial court confirmation of the arbitration award.with respect to the attorney fees award,we find no error in the amount of compensable time approved by the trial court,but we can find no reasonable basis in the record for the court assignment of different hourly rates to the bocks two attorneys.we therefore vacate this aspect of the court decision and remand for its reconsideration.
background 
baxter,an attorney,provided legal services for the bocks.in august,following a dispute over the value of baxter services,the bocks filed a request for arbitration with respect to his fees under the mfaa.the state bar of california appointed attorney james schratz to arbitrate the dispute.
when the parties first appeared for arbitration,baxter claimed he needed more time to prepare a response to the arguments raised by the bocks in their arbitration brief,and a continuance was granted.the arbitration ultimately occurred in august.at that time,the parties stipulated the arbitrator award would be binding.bus,subd.a parties to an mfaa arbitration can agree in writing to be bound by the award.
prior to the commencement of the hearing,schratz informed the parties the arbitration hearing would last only four hours the bocks presented their case through minutes of direct testimony by the bocks and a third witness.baxter of the bocks witnesses consumed much of the remaining four hours.following this testimony,the arbitrator accepted the bocks arbitration brief and its exhibits as testimonial evidence.when baxter moved to have his arbitration brief and exhibits admitted into evidence,the arbitrator did not rule on the request.
after baxter had testified for minutes,schratz told him to conclude his testimony promptly.when baxter asked for more time,the arbitrator agreed to receive additional evidence from baxter in the form of a declaration and supplemental briefing,and he provided baxter an additional minutes of live testimony.
several months after the conclusion of the arbitration,in december,schratz entered an award stating he had reviewed all of the documents and considered all of the testimony presented at the hearing and was ruling in favor of the clients michael and lorie bock.specifically,schratz found baxter had billed the bocks the services rendered were worth only and the bocks had paid baxter.accordingly,other than requiring baxter to reimburse the bocks of the arbitration filing fee,schratz rendered an award of.in the text of the decision,schratz criticized baxter in several respects,finding he engaged in a substantial amount of block billing,which is the practice of reporting more than one task in a single time entry violated state bar rules of professional conduct,rule f when he requested and accepted payment of fees billed to the bocks from a third party without obtaining the bocks written consent to the practice or making appropriate conflict of interest disclosures failed to keep the bocks informed of the status of their appeal failed to retender the defense of their action to the insurance company following an appeal and spent unreasonable amounts of time on certain specified tasks.
the figure quoted by schratz for the fees paid by the bocks was,as the award stated,drawn from a letter sent by baxter to the bocks counsel prior to the commencement of the arbitration,a copy of which had been forwarded by baxter to the arbitrator.as all parties acknowledge,baxter misstated the amount of money paid by the bocks in this letter in fact,they had paid him only,less than half of the amount stated in the award.the arbitrator apparently had not been informed of the error in the letter.
baxter sent a letter to schratz,acknowledging his error in the letter,contending the letter was not part of the evidence at the arbitration hearing,and asking for the award to be corrected to reflect the actual payments.unlike baxter,who merely sent a letter to schratz,the bocks filed a formal request for correction with the state bar,acknowledging their actual payments of and seeking correction to confirm baxter services were worth that amount.through the state bar,schratz denied the bocks request,finding the claimed error in the award did not qualify as a basis for correction of an arbitration award under the relevant state bar arbitration rule.although the response did not directly acknowledge baxter letter requesting correction,it noted the arbitrator had reviewed baxter replies to the bocks request for correction,which made clear baxter position regarding the error.
baxter filed a petition to correct or vacate the arbitration award in the trial court,and the bocks filed a petition to confirm it.in the course of the extended trial court proceedings,baxter raised several issues in addition to the undisputed error on the face of the arbitration award.
the trial court denied the petition to correct or vacate and granted the petition to confirm.in a lengthy and detailed written decision,the court found the arbitrator error in relying on baxter letter did not provide grounds for correcting or vacating the award schratz was not subject to disqualification for bias and was not required to disclose aspects of his professional background that,baxter contended,would have provided grounds for his disqualification and the arbitrator purported evidentiary errors did not provide grounds for vacating the award.the court subsequently entered a judgment confirming the award.
following entry of the judgment,the bocks filed a motion seeking reimbursement of their attorney fees incurred in connection with the superior court proceedings to confirm the award.the request was premised on their fee agreement with baxter,which permitted the prevailing party in an action to enforce the agreement to recover reasonable attorney fees and costs.the motion detailed baxter extensive motion practice in the trial court,arguing it was largely unnecessary and ineffective the motion was accompanied by a declaration from the bocks attorney,who detailed baxter allegedly abusive conduct and attached the legal bills incurred by the bocks in connection with the trial court proceedings.although the bocks attorneys had billed their clients at a rate of per hour,they sought compensation at a rate of per hour,for a total of.baxter opposed the motion,disputing the characterization of his conduct and arguing the fee request was outrageously inflated,due in part to the activities of the bocks attorneys.baxter also pointed out the bocks had already received the benefit of the error in schratz arbitration award.
the trial court granted the bocks motion to the extent of ordering baxter to pay in attorney fees.the court found the bocks attorneys regular hourly charges not reflective of market conditions in sonoma county and reduced them accordingly.in doing so,it assigned a lodestar figure for the two attorneys involved in the litigation,kathryn curry and kenneth van vleck,of and per hour,respectively.although the court disagreed with baxter that the confirmation proceeding was a simple motion,it authorized compensation for a total of attorney hours,less than half of the time actually billed by curry and van vleck.in explanation,the court noted the billings themselves provide some justification for a fee award.there is little additional evidence presented.considering the matters contained in the court file,and the court experience with this matter,the court determines as follows both parties have appealed from the court attorney fee award 
ii.discussion 
on appeal,baxter contends the judgment confirming the arbitration award should be reversed and the award vacated because the arbitrator relied on erroneous information in baxter letter,the arbitrator should have disqualified himself for bias,and the arbitrator made erroneous evidentiary rulings.
a.the arbitrator error 
b.the arbitrator disclosures 
baxter claims the award should be vacated because the arbitrator failed to make required disclosures about his background or,alternately,should have disqualified himself for bias.
factual background 
both parties received disclosing schratz address and law firm affiliation,jim schratz associates.beyond that,the extent of the arbitrator disclosure of his background was in dispute.baxter asserted in a declaration that schratz told the parties only that he had worked for an insurance company in the past and had previously served as an arbitrator.the bocks attorney declared schratz described the nature of his law practice and his experience as a legal fee auditor and expert,including the nature of his legal practice included reviewing and auditing legal bills,acting as a retained expert,and acting as a fee arbitrator,as well as prior work at fireman fund insurance company fireman fund.schratz submitted a declaration stating he told the parties on more than one occasion of his experience as a legal fee bill auditor and disclosed his web site,which contains information about his work 
following his receipt of the arbitration award,baxter learned information causing him to conclude schratz was biased against attorneys.among the information submitted to the trial court in connection with baxter claim that the arbitration award should be vacated either on grounds of a failure to disclose or outright bias was the following 
a july article from the wall street journal profiling schratz,then a of fireman fund,in which his job was described as finding attorneys who,he believes,do unnecessary work,inflate bills or even fake accidents.the article described a variety of excessive and fraudulent billing practices uncovered by schratz in his work for fireman fund and described him as more than willing to believe the worst about lawyers,based on his experience 
a promotional flyer assembled by schratz that recounts the results of billing audits performed by his law firm that resulted in judicial awards of legal fees substantially lower than those requested by the attorneys 
a law review article written by schratz subtitled,a psychological and sociological analysis of why attorneys overbill,as well as other articles written by schratz discussing proper billing practices 
a article by schratz in a state bar publication discussing best practices by outside counsel,in the course of which he stated fireman fund will not tolerate abusive billing and criticizes block billing as a fraudulent practice and 
a declaration by an attorney,john,who has been acquainted with schratz since,and had filed suit against schratz for defamation.stated he had spoken with numerous attorneys who had disputes with schratz over fees and recounted various claims made to him of improper conduct or unfairness by schratz in his work as a fee auditor.based on his own experience,which included deposing schratz and persons who worked with him at fireman fund,claimed schratz was biased against attorneys and their bills and took shortcuts in evaluating legal bills.declaration contains five pages of criticism of schratz audit methods.
schratz submitted a second declaration stating he was not biased,had no prior relationship with any of the parties or their attorneys,had never been predisposed to rule in any particular manner in the fee arbitration proceeding,and knew of no facts that would require his disqualification or recusal.in that declaration,schratz described the nature of his career and law practice,stating he had first worked for fireman fund for years,adjusting complex high profile insurance claims.in,he left to form his own consulting and expert witness firm specializ ing in providing testimony on insurance industry practices such as claims handling or investigating insurance fraud.a relatively small amount of his practice involves auditing legal bills.as to that part of his business,schratz explained,most of it is done by his associates.eighty percent of their work involves reviewing fee applications that have been submitted by counsel for prevailing parties in a lawsuit.the remaining percent of the audits performed by schratz firm are done in support of attorneys,either in connection with attorney fee requests or fee disputes.the declaration lists some law firms,most large and well known,that have retained schratz firm in support of their fee requests.
governing law 
section,subdivision a permits a court to vacate an arbitration award if the arbitrator either a failed to disclose within the time required for disclosure a ground for disqualification of which the arbitrator was then aware or b was subject to disqualification but failed upon receipt of timely demand to disqualify himself or herself as required by that provision.although the mfaa does not specify the grounds for vacating an award rendered under its provisions,it does authorize the filing of a petition to confirm,correct,or vacate an award in the same manner as provided in the caa.bus,subd.b.we therefore assume that section applies to judicial challenges to an award under the mfaa,as has at least one other court.see,glaser,weil,fink,jacobs shapiro,llp goff th.

disclosure requirements under the mfaa 
the case law governing disclosure by an arbitrator has arisen under the caa,which requires an arbitrator to disclose all matters that could cause a person aware of the facts to reasonably entertain a doubt that the proposed neutral arbitrator would be able to be impartial,including a specific list of matters pertaining largely to the arbitrator past relations,if any,to the parties and their counsel,subd.a.section,however,does not apply to arbitrations under the mfaa.see,kors,supra,th,fn.caa disclosure rules do not apply to arbitrations under the mfaa.we must therefore determine disclosure obligations under the mfaa independently.
the statutes and state rules governing mfaa arbitrations contain no similar disclosure requirement.rule of the state bar fee arbitration rules,promulgated under the authority of business and professions code section,subdivision a,states an arbitrator who believes he or she can not render a fair and impartial decision or who believes there is an appearance that he or she can not render a fair and impartial decision must disqualify himself or herself or accede to a party challenge for cause.rules of state bar,tit,div,ch,rule b.rule does not,however,require any particular disclosure by an arbitrator.
the state bar fee arbitration handbook,published in april,does address the issue.section v,governing the assignment and disqualification of arbitrators,states if an arbitrator,for any reason,may not be impartial,that arbitrator shall disqualify himself or herself from any further consideration of the proceedings.state bar,com.on mandatory fee arbitration,fee arbitration handbook v.implementing this requirement,section v requires arbitrators to disclose any prior or present relationship to any party or participant in the proceeding and any other fact that may bear upon his or her disqualification as an arbitrator.ibid.because an arbitrator disqualification under the mfaa turns on his or her ability to be impartial,the handbook requirement of disclosure of matters bearing on the arbitrator disqualification essentially requires disclosure of matters relating to impartiality or the appearance of impartiality,the same standard for disclosure imposed by the general disclosure requirement of section,subdivision a.as a result,the general disclosure requirements of the mfaa and caa are,for practical purposes,the same,and decisions under the impartiality disclosure requirements of the caa may be applied in evaluating arbitrator disclosure obligations under the mfaa.
disclosure generally 
the leading case on caa disclosure is haworth superior court cal th haworth,in which the female plaintiff in a medical malpractice arbitration contended the award should be vacated because the arbitrator,a retired judge,failed to disclose that he had been censured years earlier for conduct offensive to female court staff.id.at.discussing the general requirement that the arbitrator disclose any matter that reasonably could create the appearance of partiality,the court noted impartiality entails the absence of bias or prejudice in favor of,or against,particular parties or classes of parties,as well as maintenance of an open mind.citation.in the context of judicial recusal,p otential bias and prejudice must clearly be established by an objective standard.citations.judges,like all human beings,have widely varying experiences and backgrounds.except perhaps in extreme circumstances,those not directly related to the case or the parties do not disqualify them.citation.an impression of possible bias in the arbitration context means that one could reasonably form a belief that an arbitrator was biased for or against a party for a particular reason.id.at,italics added by haworth.
the court rejected out of hand the plaintiff contention that the arbitrator public censure would cause a person to reasonably conclude that this arbitrator might be biased against a female plaintiff in a medical malpractice case involving cosmetic surgery.haworth,supra,cal th at.while recognizing the arbitrator offensive conduct,all directed specifically at women,is clearly inappropriate it is disrespectful toward staff members and tends to create an offensive work environment,the court concluded nothing in the public censure would suggest to a reasonable person that the arbitrator could not be fair to female litigants,either generally or in the context of an action such as the one now before us.id.at.
after further discussion,the court explained there are many reasons why a party might,reasonably or unreasonably,prefer not to have a particular arbitrator hear his or her case including the arbitrator prior experience,competence,and attitudes and viewpoints on a variety of matters.the disclosure requirements,however,are intended only to ensure the impartiality of the neutral arbitrator.citation.they are not intended to mandate disclosure of all matters that a party might wish to consider in deciding whether to oppose or accept the selection of an arbitrator.citation.when,as here,an arbitration agreement provides the parties or the parties representatives the authority to jointly select a neutral arbitrator,they have the opportunity to take reasonable steps to satisfy themselves that the arbitrator they agree upon is acceptable.the type of information here at issue a decision publicly censuring a judge,which has been published in the official reports of this court is readily discoverable.haworth,supra,cal th at,fn.omitted.in further explaining its conclusion that disclosure of this type of matter was not required,the court stated the arbitrator can not reasonably be expected to identify and disclose all events in the arbitrator past,including those not connected to the parties,the facts,or the issues in controversy,that conceivably might cause a party to prefer another arbitrator.such a broad interpretation of the rule could subject arbitration awards to attacks by losing parties searching for potential disqualifying information only after an adverse decision has been made.citation.such a result would undermine the finality of arbitrations without contributing to the fairness of arbitration proceedings.id.at.
disclosure of business activities 
with respect to the nature of the business of an arbitrator,courts have recognized that b ecause arbitrators are selected for their familiarity with the type of business dispute involved,they are not expected to be entirely without business contacts in the particular field,but they should disclose any repeated or significant contacts which they may have with a party to the dispute,his attorney or his chosen arbitrator.casden park la brea retail llc ross dress for less,th.
despite this general rule,the court in kors,supra,th,imposed an additional disclosure requirement for attorney arbitrators whose practice is focused in a particular area related to the subject matter of the litigation.kors featured,like this case,a fee dispute between a law firm and its client.id.at.a panel of three arbitrators was appointed.id.at.following issuance of the award,the client learned that,at the time of the arbitration,the chief arbitrator was representing a prominent law firm in a client fee dispute before the california supreme court.in addition,his law firm web site stated his practice was focused on claims against lawyers and touted his representation of some of the nation largest law firms.id.at.on appeal,the client argued the chief arbitrator had an obligation to disclose the nature of his law practice.in considering the claim,the court noted that,in enacting the disclosure requirements of the caa,o ne of the ethical problems the legislature was specifically concerned about was the danger that,like the referees in proceedings authorized by section and,arbitrators impartiality might be undermined by their economic.kors,at,fn.omitted.in particular,the legislature was concerned that persons who frequently served as neutrals in a particular industry might tend to favor steady customers,parties in the industry who commonly appear before them.ibid.by analogy,the kors court concluded the chief arbitrator legal practice could cause a reasonable person to doubt whether his or her dependence on business from lawyers and law firms sued by former clients would prevent him from taking the side of a client in a fee dispute with a former law firm,because doing so might put at risk his ability to secure business from the lawyers and law firms whose business he solicits.id.at.for that reason,the court concluded,the chief arbitrator was required to timely disclose to the parties the nature of his legal practice,including the fact that he was then representing a law firm engaged in a fee dispute with a former client.id.at.
discussion 
disclosure under kors 
we find no obligation under kors for schratz to have disclosed the nature of his consulting practice.unlike the arbitrator in kors,schratz practice was not devoted exclusively to one side of fee disputes.as schratz stated in his second declaration,the bulk of the fee audit work of his firm was not performed on behalf of clients in legal fee disputes but for the losing parties in litigation who were faced with claims for prevailing party attorney fees.further,a significant percentage of his clients were attorneys looking for expert support for their bills,either against their former clients or in support of their fee applications.the expertise of his firm was therefore in reviewing attorney bills,rather than in representing one side or the other in fee disputes.because schratz did not depend exclusively on business from
