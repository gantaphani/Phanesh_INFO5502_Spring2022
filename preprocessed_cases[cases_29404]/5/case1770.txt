appellant owes her a considerable sum in unpaid child support,for which appellant obtained a judgment against him in.since then,appellant has brought several actions against her and his two siblings to attempt to collect on the judgment.in the present case,appellant sued not only her and his siblings,but also several attorneys who represented the,his siblings,their mother.one of the attorneys revised the mother estate plan in a manner that appeared to disinherit appellant.the others participated in probate court proceedings to effectuate the mother revised estate plan after her death,defended appellant and his siblings in other judicial proceedings through which appellant sought to collect her child support judgment.appellant contends that in performing these acts,the attorneys violated a statute enacted in that authorizes treble damage awards against those who help a child support obligor avoid paying child support by assisting in the obligor transfer or concealment of assets.
the trial court granted the attorneys special motion to strike under the statute,and awarded them attorney fees.we affirm,holding that plaintiff cause of action is predicated on protected activity under the statute,and that plaintiff has not shown a probability of success on the merits.we also conclude that plaintiff has not demonstrated any abuse of the trial court discretion in determining the appropriate amount of attorney fees to award.
facts and procedural background 
appellant tammy cabral is the former wife of respondent james cabral it is undisputed that james owes tammy a considerable sum in unpaid child support,which tammy has reduced to a judgment but has not yet collected.james,together with his brother,respondent joseph cabral,and his sister,respondent mary soares collectively the cabral family respondents,are the children of the late edwina cabral.in the spring of,shortly before her death on june of that year,edwina hired respondent edward martins,an attorney,to assist her in modifying her estate plan from one that divided her estate equally among her three children to one that essentially disinherited james and left of the estate to mary and to joseph.after edwina death,martins lodged her revised will with the probate court,and initiated proceedings to probate the will and to administer a related trust.
on december,about six months after edwina death,tammy sued the cabral family respondents,alleging various causes of action against them,including fraudulent transfer of james share of edwina estate to mary.we will refer to this proceeding as the fraudulent transfer action.in defending the fraudulent transfer action,james was represented by respondent david biasotti,and mary and joseph were represented by martins and respondent valarie follett.on may,mary and joseph demurrer to tammy complaint was sustained in its entirety,without leave to amend.tammy appealed from that decision,and on december,division three of this court reversed in part,holding that the trial court should have permitted tammy to amend her complaint to plead a cause of action against mary for constructive trust.cabral soares th,d.
while tammy appeal in the fraudulent transfer action was still pending,she filed a will contest and a creditor claim in the probate proceedings relating to edwina estate.on january,tammy also filed another,separate fraudulent transfer action against the cabral family respondents,alleging essentially the same facts involved in the fraudulent transfer action.we will refer to this proceeding as the fraudulent transfer action.mary and joseph,represented as before by martins and follet,demurred to the fraudulent transfer action.on may,their demurrer was sustained,and the action was stayed pending resolution of the fraudulent transfer action and the will contest in the probate proceedings.about two months later,in july,respondent michael dougherty replaced martins as counsel for mary and joseph in the probate proceedings.
the complaint in the action underlying this appeal was filed on october.in it,tammy relies on essentially the same facts about james unpaid child support and the revision of edwina estate plan.however,in this case tammy has sued not only the cabral family respondents,but also the attorneys who represented them in the other proceedings,martins,follett,biasotti,and dougherty collectively the attorney respondents.as the basis for her cause of action against all of the respondents,tammy relies on the provisions of two statutes,civil code sections and the child support evasion statutes,which were enacted in,and became effective on january.the child support evasion statutes are not expressly cited in the complaint,but tammy has never denied that her cause of action is entirely based on them.
in response to the complaint,each of the respondents except james filed a special motion to strike under code of civil procedure section section,which is commonly referred to as the strategic lawsuit against public participation statute on january,the trial court entered an order granting all of the motions.tammy filed a timely appeal.
respondents then filed motions for attorney fees under section,subdivision c.again,the trial court granted the motions,and tammy timely appealed.we consolidated the two appeals.
while the present appeals were pending,tammy entered into a settlement,as between herself and mary and joseph only,of all of the proceedings described in this opinion.in accordance with the settlement,these appeals were dismissed as to mary and joseph.accordingly,our opinion addresses the issues on appeal only insofar as they concern the attorney respondents.
discussion 
standard of review of order granting special motion to strike 
as our colleagues in division two explained in herrera th,d under the statute,the court makes a determination first,the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity,subd.b.a defendant meets this burden by demonstrating that the act underlying the plaintiff cause fits one of the categories spelled out in section,subdivision e citation.if the court finds that such a showing has been made,it must then determine whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim,subd.b citations.only a cause of action that satisfies both prongs of the,that arises from protected speech or petitioning and lacks even minimal a slapp,subject to being stricken under the statute.citation.
a ruling on a special motion to strike under section is reviewed de novo.citation.this includes whether the statute applies to the challenged claim.citation.furthermore,we apply our independent judgment to determine whether plaintiff causes of action arose from acts by defendant in furtherance of defendant right of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue.citation.assuming these two conditions are satisfied,we must then independently determine,from our review of the record as a whole,whether plaintiff has established a reasonable probability that s he would prevail on her claims.citation.citation,supra,th at,d,quoting thomas quintero th,d,italics omitted.
whether cause of action arises from assertedly protected activity 
following the analysis described in,supra,th at pages,d,and thomas quintero,supra,th at page,d,we must first review de novo the question whether the statute applies to the challenged claim.answering this question involves a analysis.first we must determine whether the plaintiff cause of action actually arose from the assertedly protected activity,and if so,then we must answer the distinct inquiry whether the activity was in fact protected.this is made clear by the court reliance on kajima engineering construction,city of los angeles th,d,which held that a city for unfair business practices in a contractor suit for breach of contract was not subject to a special motion to strike under the law,because the did not arise from the contractor petitioning activity in suing the city,but rather from the contractor acts during the procurement and execution of the contract at issue.
in the present case,it is evident on the face of the complaint that the attorney respondents have correctly characterized tammy cause of action against them as arising from their actions in revising edwina estate plan,attempting to implement the revised plan through probate proceedings,and defending the cabral family respondents in litigation initiated by tammy.tammy does not argue that any other activities underlie her cause of action against the attorney respondents.accordingly,we proceed to the next step of the analysis,which is to determine whether those activities are protected under the statute.
whether activity from which cause of action arises is protected 
the activities by the attorney respondents from which tammy cause of action in this case arises can be divided into three categories martins revision of edwina estate planning documents the will revision martins lodging of edwina will with the probate court and his initiation of proceedings to probate her estate and administer her trust the probate proceedings and the actions of all of the attorney respondents in defending the cabral family respondents in the various judicial proceedings initiated against them by tammy the litigation defense.
it is clear that the second and third probate proceedings and the litigation protected petitioning activity for purposes of the statute.under the plain language of section,subdivisions e and e,as well as the case law interpreting those provisions,all communicative acts performed by attorneys as part of their representation of a client in a judicial proceeding or other petitioning context are per se protected as petitioning activity by the statute.see,rusheen cohen cal th,d,statute protects communicative conduct such as the filing,funding,and prosecution of a civil action,including such acts when committed by attorneys in representing clients in litigation briggs eden council for hope opportunity cal th,d,filing a lawsuit is an exercise of one constitutional right of petition peregrine funding,sheppard mullin richter hampton llp th,d attorneys opposition to administrative agency efforts to appoint receiver for client was protected by statute chavez mendoza th,d statute protected attorneys from malicious prosecution action against them by parties whom they had sued on behalf of a client miller filter th,d technical defect in attorneys authority as deputies of county district attorney did not obviate their protection under the statute for their actions in connection with their criminal prosecution of plaintiffs.
tammy only argument to the contrary is that the litigation defense activity of the attorney respondents can not be protected activity because it violated the child support evasion statutes.even if we assume for the sake of argument that the premise of tammy reasoning is correct her conclusion is not supported by the case law on which she relies.
in one of these cases,flatley mauro cal th,d,the california supreme court held that a defendant whose assertedly protected speech or petitioning activity was illegal as a matter of law,and therefore unprotected by constitutional guarantees of free speech and petition,can not use the statute to strike the plaintiff complaint.the court therefore concluded that communications which constituted criminal extortion as a matter of law and,as such,were unprotected by constitutional guarantees of free speech or petition,were not protected by the statute.id.at,d.the court made clear,however,that its holding was limited to the specific and extreme circumstances of this case,in which the assertedly protected communications,as a matter of law,fell outside the ambit of protected speech.id.at,fn,d.
the other case on which tammy relies is paul for council hanyecz th,d,disapproved on other grounds in equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,d.in that case,the plaintiff was a city council member seeking reelection.following his defeat,he filed an action against several individuals,alleging that they interfered with plaintiff candidacy by influencing the election with illegal campaign contributions for one of his opponents.plaintiff alleged that defendants acts violated the political reform act of.citation.citations.the defendants moved to strike the complaint as a slapp but t heir moving papers show ed that they in fact did violate the political reform act when they laundered campaign contributions to persons running for local or state offices.citation.nonetheless,the defendants argued that their money laundering was in furtherance of their constitutional rights of free speech and arose out of acts in furtherance of their constitutionally protected conduct.citation.the plaintiff argued in his opposition that section did not apply in this case because defendants actions in laundering campaign money do not constitute constitutionally protected activity.citation.flatley mauro,supra,cal th at,d,describing and quoting paul for council hanyecz,supra,th at,d.thus,the allegedly protected actions of the defendants in paul for council hanyecz were admittedly illegal,under the provisions of a statutory scheme specifically aimed at confining otherwise protected political activity within constitutionally valid bounds.see flatley mauro,supra,cal th at,d.
in the present case,however,the attorney respondents actions in the course of the probate proceedings and the litigation defense were neither inherently criminal nor otherwise outside the scope of normal,routine legal services.even if the attorney respondents actions had the effect of defeating or forestalling tammy ability to execute her judgment for child support,thereby according to tammy violating the child support evasion statutes,this is not the kind of illegality involved in flatley mauro,supra,cal th,d,and paul for council hanyecz,supra,th,d 
as our colleagues in division three stated in birkner lam th,d,c onduct that would otherwise come within the scope of the statute does not lose its coverage simply because it is alleged to have been unlawful or unethical.citations.an exception to the use of section applies only if a defendant concedes,or the evidence conclusively establishes,that the assertedly protected speech or petition activity was illegal as a matter of law.citation.the exception does not apply here.id.at,d,italics omitted see also soukup law offices of herbert hafif cal th,d,if a defendant assertedly protected constitutional activity is alleged to have been illegal and,therefore,outside the ambit of the statute,the illegality must be established as a matter of law either through the defendant concession or because the illegality is conclusively established by the evidence presented in connection with the motion to strike.the exception noted by the birkner court does not apply here.
if we were to hold otherwise,it would mean that actions by attorneys in defending their clients against disputed claims for child support that later proved to be valid would never be protected under the law.accordingly,we are not persuaded by tammy argument for excluding the probate proceedings and the litigation defense from the ambit of protected petitioning activities.
that brings us the third category of activities by the attorney respondents,the will revision,which actually involved only martins.case law establishes that communications that are intimately intertwined with,and preparatory to,the filing of judicial proceedings qualify as petitioning activity for the purpose of the statute.see briggs eden council for hope opportunity,supra,cal th at,d,statements made in connection with or in preparation for litigation are protected activity within the meaning of salma capon th,d notice of rescission of contract given as prerequisite to litigation was protected communication under birkner lam,supra,th at,d notice terminating tenancy is protected under because it is prerequisite to unlawful detainer action dove audio,rosenfeld,meyer susman th,d communications preparatory to or in anticipation of bringing action or other official proceeding are protected by statute.
in the present case,the will revision was of no effect in and of itself,but only insofar as it was later implemented through the probate proceedings.accordingly,the will revision was also protected activity under the statute.even if not,it was only incidental to the subsequent protected activity,thus rendering tammy entire cause of action subject to a special motion to strike.see,peregrine funding,sheppard mullin richter hampton llp,supra,th at,d.
whether probability of prevailing on merits has been established 
because,as we have concluded,the acts of the respondent attorneys were protected activities within the contemplation of the law,tammy bears the burden of establishing a probability that she will prevail on her cause of action against them.soukup law offices of herbert hafif,supra,cal th at,d,zamos stroud cal th,d.whether or not she has succeeded in doing so is a question of law which we examine de novo.ibid.
the attorney respondents assert several grounds for arguing that,as a matter of law,tammy can not succeed on her cause of action against them.the first is that the attorneys actions in revising,effectuating,and defending edwina estate plan did not violate the child support evasion statutes.these statutes apply against anyone who knowingly assist s a child support obligor by helping to hide or transfer assets of the child support obligor,subd.b,italics added.the attorney respondents contend that the statutes were inapplicable,because james expectation that he would inherit of edwina estate upon her death did not constitute a property right,or asset,that belonged to james.
this argument finds some support in cabral soares,supra,th at page,d,in which our colleagues in division three noted that even assuming the truth of tammy allegation that edwina and mary agreed to transfer james share of edwina estate to mary in order to avoid the payment of child support,there was no fraudulent conveyance as alleged in tammy cause of action for fraudulent conveyance.while his mother still lived,james had no right to any of her property.his mother was under no obligation to leave any of it to him,and she was under no obligation to plaintiff.thus,the home and other property that edwina owned while she was living was not the property of a debtor within the meaning of civil code section,subdivision a,and edwina decision to leave none of it to james was not a fraudulent transfer within the meaning of civil code section.edwina was entitled to remove james as a devisee under her will if she did not wish to leave him property that plaintiff would be able to recover.she also had the right to increase her bequest to mary.citation.fn.omitted.
in short,cabral soares,supra,th,d,implies and we agree that james expectancy as a probable heir of edwina estate was not an asset belonging to james.therefore,if tammy complaint alleged only that the attorney respondents revised edwina estate plan in order to carry out edwina wish to disinherit james,and then took action to effectuate and defend that plan,we would find no reasonable possibility of success as to tammy cause of action under the child support evasion statutes.but,as the court anticipated in cabral soares,supra,th at pages,d,tammy also alleges that edwina did not actually wish to disinherit james,but agreed with mary that she would revise her estate plan so as to appear to give james share of the estate to mary,on condition that mary would,in turn,turn that money over to james in some fashion designed to prevent tammy from enforcing the child support judgment against james inheritance.
thus,cabral soares held that james expectation of an inheritance from edwina was not in and of itself a property right,but it also held that if tammy could establish the existence of the alleged agreement between mary and edwina that mary would hold part of the estate bequeathed to her in constructive trust for james,then tammy,as james creditor,would be entitled to enforce the constructive trust against mary.th at,d.for the same reason,it is at least arguable that in the present case,tammy could state a claim against the attorney respondents under the child support evasion statutes on the theory that in defending mary against tammy claims,they assisted mary and james in hiding or transferring an asset of james,to wit,the money from edwina estate that mary agreed to hold in constructive trust for james.
such a claim would be subject to two dispositive defenses,however.see peregrine funding,sheppard mullin richter hampton llp,supra,th at,d if defendant establishes that plaintiff causes of action are subject to valid defenses,plaintiff does not establish probability of success on merits required to defeat special motion to strike under statute.first,as to martins actions in revising edwina estate plan,these all occurred prior to edwina death in.the child support evasion statutes were not enacted until over a year later,and did not become effective until january.under california law,statutes do not apply retroactively unless a clear intent to make them retroactive clearly appears either on the face of the enactment or from its legislative history or the circumstances of its enactment,strauss horton cal th,d,myers philip morris companies,cal th,d.tammy has not pointed to any such clear statement of intent in the language or legislative history of the child support evasion statutes,and our own research has found none.accordingly,even if tammy allegations as to martins state of knowledge and intent could be proven an issue we need not and do not decide,she still could not prevail on a claim against martins under the child support evasion statutes based on his involvement in the will revision.
second,as to the attorney respondents subsequent actions in the probate proceedings and the litigation defense,these are all absolutely protected by the litigation privilege under civil code section,subdivision b the section b privilege.the section b privilege precludes civil liability,except for malicious prosecution,for any communication made in judicial or proceedings by litigants or other participants authorized by law to achieve the objects of the litigation and that have some connection or logical relation to the action.citations.silberg anderson cal d.this privilege is absolute in nature,applying to all publications,irrespective of their maliciousness.citation.the privilege is not limited to statements made during a trial or other proceedings,but may extend to steps taken prior thereto,or afterwards.citation.action apartment,city of santa monica cal th,d,see also wise thrifty payless,th,d because litigation privilege is absolute,it applies regardless of existence of malice or intent to harm.the privilege applies to communications relative to the defense of an action as well as those relative to its filing and prosecution.california physicians service superior court th,d defensive pleading,including the assertion of affirmative defenses,is communication protected by the absolute litigation privilege.such pleading,even though allegedly false,interposed in bad faith,or even asserted for inappropriate purposes,can not be used as the basis for allegations of ongoing bad faith.no complaint can be grounded upon such pleading.it applies even if the communication involved forgery or falsification of documents,such as the presentation for probate of a forged will.steiner eikerling d.
in her reply brief,in opposition to these principles,tammy discusses two unpublished federal district court opinions,decided after the completion of her opening brief sial unifund ccr partners,cab,wl,dist.lexis sial,and cassady union adjustment,no,wl,dist.lexis cassady.at oral argument,tammy also relied on an opinion issued by division one of this district after the completion of briefing in this case,komarova national credit acceptance,th,d komarova.tammy contends that under these cases,the section b privilege does not apply to acts that violate a specific statute,as the attorney respondents actions here are alleged to have done.we find all of these cases inapposite.
in sial,supra,wl,dist.lexis,the plaintiff had been sued unsuccessfully in state court by the defendant collection agency,represented by the defendant law firm,to collect the balance due on a used car loan.the plaintiff alleged that the defendants communications with her prior to the filing of the litigation violated the federal fair debt collection practices act fdcpa et and california rosenthal fair debt collection practices act rosenthal act,et.the defendants moved to dismiss,arguing that as a matter of law,their debt collection activities were immune from fdcpa liability under the doctrine and from rosenthal act liability under the section b privilege.
the trial court denied the motion.with respect to the doctrine,the court held,in light of heintz jenkins,d,that the fdcpa evidenced an intent to create an exception to the doctrine for litigation activities related to debt collection.sial,supra,wl,dist.lexis at pp.with respect to the rosenthal act,the sial court acknowledged a split in federal district court authority regarding the application of the section b privilege.it concluded that the better rule was that because the two statutes were irreconcilable,and application of the section b privilege would entirely vitiate the rosenthal act,the principle that a specific statute prevails over a general one had to be applied.accordingly,it held that privilege did not apply to causes of action under the rosenthal act.sial,supra,wl,dist.lexis at pp.
similarly,cassady,supra,wl,dist.lexis,involved a lawsuit against a debt collector for violations of the fdcpa and the rosenthal act.the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment,arguing that the fdcpa claim was barred by the doctrine,and that the rosenthal act claim was barred by the section b privilege.on the issue,cassady followed sial,wl,at pp.on the rosenthal act issue,however,cassady noted that unlike the fdcpa,the rosenthal act expressly exempts lawyers from liability.because the court had already narrowed the plaintiff claims by granting portions of the defendant summary judgment motion on the merits,the sole remaining factual basis for the claim was premised exclusively on the collection agency effort to collect the plaintiff debt through judicial proceedings.because the application of the litigation privilege to communication within judicial proceedings would not render the rosenthal act meaningless,the court differed with sial,and held that the section b privilege does immunize communications that would otherwise constitute violations of the rosenthal act.id.at,at pp.
komarova,supra,th,d,also involved alleged violations of the rosenthal act by a debt collection agency.the plaintiff was not the person who owed the debt,but had a remarkably similar name,and the debt collection agency continued to attempt to collect the debt from her even after she established that she was not the debtor.a jury awarded damages after a jury trial,based on the defendant debt collection agency conduct in calling the plaintiff without disclosing its identity making unreasonably frequent,harassing communications communicating with the plaintiff employer and bringing judicial proceedings without effecting service of process on the plaintiff.
our colleagues in division one held that these activities were not protected by the section b privilege.komarova,supra,at,d.in so holding,the court relied on the reasoning in sial,supra,wl,dist.lexis cassady,supra,wl,dist.lexis and similar cases,particularly oei star capital acquisitions,llc d.komarova,supra,at,d.the komarova court noted that application of the section b privilege would negate plaintiff rosenthal act claims.the privilege would protect defendant prosecution of judicial arbitration and subsequent petition to confirm the arbitration collect the alleged debt,when it knew that service of process in the arbitration had not been effected conduct expressly prohibited by a specific provision of the rosenthal act.id.at,d,discussing,subd.a.indeed,the court noted that the section b privilege will inevitably conflict with claims under that provision of the rosenthal act.id.at,d.
similarly,the komarova court reasoned that the defendant telephone calls to the plaintiff and her employer,which the jury had found violated other provisions of the rosenthal act,were communications in contemplation of judicial proceedings,and thus would not be actionable if the section b privilege applied.thus,the court concluded,the litigation privilege and the rosenthal act can not be reconciled in the context of this case.citation.komarova,supra,th at,d.noting that the legislature specifically prohibited certain litigation related activity when it passed the rosenthal act in,the court concluded that the legislature was presumably aware of the extant broad litigation privilege in section.id.at,d.
finally,the court noted the ease with which the rosenthal act could be circumvented if the litigation privilege applied.in that event,unfair debt collection practices could be immunized merely by filing suit on the debt.komarova,supra,th at,d.concluding that the rosenthal act would be significantly inoperable if it did not prevail over the section b privilege where,as here,the two conflict,komarova held that the rosenthal act prevails over the more general section b privilege,so that conduct in violation of the rosenthal act remains actionable even if it is litigation activity that would otherwise be immunized by section b.ibid.
in the present case,the question is whether the section b privilege immunizes communications in the course of judicial proceedings that would otherwise arguably violate the child support evasion statutes.as the methodology employed by the sial,cassady,and komarova courts implies,the answer to this question is to be determined by examining whether application of the section b privilege would vitiate the child support evasion statutes to such an extent as to render the latter meaningless.see also action apartment,city of santa monica,supra,cal th at,d,exceptions to section b privilege are found only when based on irreconcilable conflicts between the privilege and other coequal state laws.we are not persuaded by tammy argument that this is the case.
the language of the child support evasion statutes demonstrates that they are aimed at such targets as employers who hire child support obligors without reporting their employment to the appropriate government authorities,subd.b individuals who procure goods or services from child support obligors by means of untraceable barter or cash transactions,subds.b,b and persons such as friends,relatives,and notaries public who assist child support obligors in attempting to conceal their assets by transferring legal title to them,subd.b.
indeed,the final assembly report on the bill that enacted the child support evasion statutes indicates that the legislature primary focus was on the underground economy,income from employment that is not reported to the appropriate government authorities.see assem.com.on,bill analysis on concurrence in amendments of assem.bill,as of.similarly,the final senate floor analysis of the bill stated that the purpose of ab is to encourage individuals and business to not engage in the underground economy while getting thousands of children and parents the child support money that these families are owed.rules,off.of floor analyses,reading analysis of assem.bill,as amended,as of.
none of these types of wrongdoing would be immunized by a holding that the section b privilege provides a defense to actions under the child support evasion statutes.accordingly,the two statutes are not irreconcilable,and application of the section b privilege does not make the child support evasion statutes significantly inoperable.komarova,supra,th at,d.tammy therefore has not persuaded us that the child support evasion statutes must be construed to create an exception to section b.
moreover,to interpret the child support evasion statutes in the way tammy urges,as applied to the attorney respondents,would entail exposing to treble damages liability any attorney who drafts or revises the estate plan of a child support obligor relative,or who defends a child support obligor,or anyone holding assets to which the obligor has a claim,in a collection action by the child support obligee.as a practical matter,such an interpretation would tend to deter attorneys from representing child supp
