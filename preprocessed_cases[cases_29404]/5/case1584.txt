bmw san diego answered the complaint with a general denial and alleged affirmative defenses.bmw north america answered the complaint with general and specific denials and alleged affirmative defenses.
the parties engaged in discovery which included goglin noticing the deposition of bmw north america person most qualified to testify regarding bmw north america used vehicle certification program,its communications with goglin,its reasons for not repurchasing or replacing her vehicle,its policies and procedures for complying with the lemon law,and its arbitration or dispute resolution process the deposition notice included a request for production of six categories of documents.
although bmw north america person most qualified appeared for the deposition,bmw north america did not produce the requested documents,indicating the documents had previously been produced in response to another discovery request.after objecting to goglin attorney initial deposition questions,bmw north america attorney suspended the deposition and sought a protective order either precluding the deposition from occurring or limiting its scope.as the chief ground for the protective order,bmw north america asserted because it had already agreed to purchase goglin vehicle,the deposition served no purpose other than to increase the cost of litigation and artificially inflate goglin attorney fees claim.the court denied the motion and ordered bmw north america to pay goglin monetary sanctions of bmw north america is not directly challenging this ruling on appeal.
meanwhile,in february,bmw north america and bmw san diego collectively offered to repurchase the vehicle and settle the matter for.the settlement amount consisted of reimbursing goglin for prior monthly payments of,paying off her outstanding loan balance of,and paying for attorney fees and costs of.the offer was conditioned upon goglin dismissing her case with prejudice and executing a settlement agreement containing a confidentiality clause and a waiver of the provisions of civil code section.

bmw north america and bmw san diego both opposed the motion.bmw san diego argued goglin counsel should not be compensated for the time spent in,or reimbursed for the cost of,any activities because bmw san diego had offered to settle the matter before goglin filed her complaint and,consequently,any time spent in activities was unnecessary and unreasonable.bmw san diego further argued goglin counsel should be compensated no more than an hour,the same rate bmw san diego paid its own counsel,because this case was neither complex nor risky for goglin counsel.
bmw north america similarly argued the claimed fees were grossly inflated and not reasonably expended because goglin ignored repeated offers of restitution,filed an unnecessary lawsuit,and engaged in unnecessary litigation activity.bmw north america also argued the case did not warrant a large attorney fees award because the litigation was not complex,there was no uncertainty of prevailing on the merits,and goglin settled for only of the total recovery of she initially sought purchase price plus a civil penalty of twice the purchase price.finally,bmw north american argued the court should disallow any litigation costs because none of the costs were reasonably necessary given the prelitigation offer to reimburse goglin for everything she was owed.
the court granted goglin motion for attorney fees and costs in part.the court determined the total number of hours goglin counsel claimed to have incurred in prosecuting the case was reasonable.however,the court reduced the hourly rate for goglin counsel from to because goglin counsel had previously represented as part of goglin opposition to bmw north america motion for a protective order that his hourly rate was see fn,ante and the court had previously determined this rate to be reasonable.accordingly,the court awarded goglin attorney fees of and costs of,for a total award of.

although goglin complaint asserted multiple causes of action with differing statutory bases,goglin sought attorney fees solely under the song beverly act a prevailing buyer in an action under the song beverly act shall be allowed by the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses,including attorney fees based on actual time expended,determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.civ.code,subd.d.the statute requires the trial court to make an initial determination of the actual time expended and then to ascertain whether under all the circumstances of the case the amount of actual time expended and the monetary charge being made for the time expended are reasonable.these circumstances may include,but are not limited to,factors such as the complexity of the case and procedural demands,the skill exhibited and the results achieved.if the time expended or the monetary charge being made for the time expended are not reasonable under all the circumstances,then the court must take this into account and award attorney fees in a lesser amount.a prevailing buyer has the burden of showing that the fees incurred were allowable,were reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation,and were reasonable in amount.nightingale hyundai motor america th.

both bmw north america and bmw san diego contend goglin is not entitled to any attorney fees or costs because she unreasonably refused to accept bmw san diego prelitigation settlement offer.however,this contention ignores the unfavorable aspects of the offer,including requiring goglin to agree to a broad release of claims and a confidentiality clause goglin repeatedly and consistently objected to these extraneous provisions and the parties final settlement agreement does not include them.rejecting the prelitigation settlement because of these unfavorable extraneous terms was not unreasonable.mckenzie ford motor company,supra,th at court abused its discretion in denying attorney fees to a plaintiff in a song beverly act case for the period after the plaintiff rejected an initial settlement offer with extraneous nonfinancial terms,including a broad release of claims and an illegal confidentiality clause,because the plaintiff rejection of a settlement offer with such terms was not unreasonable gezalyan bmw of,llc d,the plaintiff in a son beverly act case is entitled to attorney fees after rejecting a repurchase offer containing numerous nonfinancial conditions not authorized by the act,including requiring agreement to a general release and a confidentiality clause.
additionally,the record belies bmw north america and bmw san diego assertions goglin could have avoided litigation and settled the matter earlier had she negotiated more at the outset.goglin counsel unambiguously communicated in a letter countering the prelitigation settlement offer that goglin was unwilling to agree to a general release or a confidentiality clause.there is no indication in the record bmw north america or bmw san diego ever responded to this letter.rather,several months after the litigation commenced,bmw north america and bmw san diego made another settlement offer including these same conditions even though they knew goglin objected to the conditions and they should have known the confidentiality clause was unlawful as to goglin song beverly act claims see fn,ante.
goglin counsel again unambiguously communicated in a letter countering the offer that goglin was unwilling to agree to a general release or a confidential clause.there is no indication in the record bmw north america or bmw san diego ever responded to this letter either.although,with a mediator assistance,bmw north america and bmw san diego ultimately agreed to a settlement without these conditions,their appeals are largely premised on their belief goglin should have accepted a settlement with the conditions notwithstanding statutory and case law supporting her position.accordingly,we can not conclude the failure to resolve this case earlier was attributable solely to goglin obstinacy or a desire on her counsel part to generate fees.
