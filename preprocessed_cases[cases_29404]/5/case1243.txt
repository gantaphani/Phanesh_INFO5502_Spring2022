weyerhaeuser is the record owner of acres known as sherrill farm in mccurtain county,oklahoma.this appeal arises from weyerhaeuser suit to remove carl brantley and his livestock from sherrill farm.as an affirmative defense to weyerhaeuser suit,brantley sought ownership of sherrill farm through adverse possession or,in the alternative,a prescriptive grazing easement on the entire farm.after a bench trial,the district court denied brantley property claims and awarded damages and attorney fees to weyerhaeuser.
having jurisdiction pursuant to and,we affirm.
background 
factual background 
sherrill farm is located in a scenic portion of southeastern oklahoma,along the mountain fork river and near the arkansas border.the area has historically been a farming and ranching district,with some gravel mining and timber operations.the record does not indicate how long weyerhaeuser has owned sherrill farm,but the parties stipulate weyerhaeuser is the current record owner and has been at all times relevant to this dispute,which goes back to the early.the facts in dispute center on whether brantley had exclusive use of sherrill farm for fifteen years.
brantley claims he began grazing livestock on sherrill farm as early as,though he never had permission to use it since then,brantley claims he built corrals,feed troughs,and fences on the property.he also removed brush,applied fertilizer,harvested wheat,and maintained roads.although he installed a locked gate on the farm in the early,he never paid property taxes on the land.brantley claims his adverse possession of sherrill farm began in the winter of,after weyerhaeuser last harvested a stand of trees on the property.
during and after the years when weyerhaeuser was using the area for its timber operations,weyerhaeuser also permitted a number of other uses on sherrill farm.brantley father,bobby,for example,had a license agreement to graze on sherrill farm beginning in.the parties disagree how long bobby leased grazing rights on sherrill farm,but the district court found bobby had a license with weyerhaeuser until.brantley maintained his father was no longer using sherrill farm by the winter of.brantley brother ricky and his wife,cindy,also asserted adverse possession of sherrill farm based on their grazing activities during this time,but they ultimately reached a settlement with weyerhaeuser,and the parties stipulated ricky and cindy had no lawful claim.
starting in,weyerhaeuser also leased parts of sherrill farm to oklahoma state university osu.osu planted two research sites in the southern part of sherrill farm but made no use of the northern half.osu complained to weyerhaeuser about damage to its research plantations from livestock and built a fence to protect the plantations,but it did not seek to have brantley cattle removed from sherrill farm entirely.osu did request that brantley cease grazing in the leased area,but brantley was uncooperative.osu also maintained its own locked gate to sherrill farm.because of this alternative access,brantley gate never prevented osu or weyerhaeuser from accessing sherrill farm.
in,weyerhaeuser and the oklahoma department of wildlife conservation odwc agreed to include sherrill farm in the three rivers wildlife management area.according to the agreement,the general public could access sherrill farm for hunting,fishing,and other recreation.brantley locked gate nevertheless prevented a state wildlife officer from accessing sherrill farm during some visits.brantley testified he saw hunters on the property during this time and asked them to leave.
in,weyerhaeuser granted an easement to another landowner to access her property across sherrill farm,but brantley refused to allow access to the easement through his gate.
osu lease terminated in.a weyerhaeuser employee testified weyerhaeuser had plans to put sherrill farm back in timber production at that time and to begin gravel mining.weyerhaeuser argues brantley presence on the land delayed these activities,resulting in monetary damages.
procedural background 
in,weyerhaeuser sued two of brantley relatives for trespass.it later amended the complaint on january,to include claims against brantley for trespass,ejectment,and declaratory relief.brantley asserted adverse possession or prescriptive easement as affirmative defenses,arguing that his grazing use since entitled him to the property.after a bench trial,the district court entered judgment in favor of weyerhaeuser.
ii.discussion 
in an appeal from a bench trial,we review the district court factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.keys youth servs.city of olathe,cir.in this diversity case,we apply oklahoma law.
the district court determined brantley defenses failed because his possession had not been exclusive for the prescriptive period,which required brantley to establish the elements of either adverse possession or a prescriptive easement since prior to.see.stat.tit.specifically,the court found,among other things,sherrill farm had been subject to bobby brantley grazing license until and that osu and weyerhaeuser had also conducted activities on sherrill farm incompatible with brantley exclusive possession.
the district court also determined weyerhaeuser suffered in damages because it was not able to resume timber operations in due to brantley grazing activities.the court,however,rejected weyerhaeuser claim for mining damages as speculative.it also granted attorney fees pursuant to oklahoma statute.
we agree with the district court that brantley is not entitled to adverse possession or a prescriptive easement.we also affirm the damage award,but we conclude oklahoma law does not authorize attorney fees.
adverse possession 
under oklahoma law,t o establish adverse possession the claimant must show that possession was hostile,under a claim of right or color of title,actual,open,notorious,exclusive,and continuous for the full statutory period of fifteen years.francis rogers,see.stat.tit.the burden of proof in adverse possession cases is clear and positive proof with all inferences and presumptions in favor of the rightful owner.norman smedley.adverse possession,moreover,can not be permissive permissive possession can never ripen into title against anyone.zimmerman newport.
findings support rejection of adverse possession defense 
the district court made a number of findings that fatally undercut brantley adverse possession claim.for instance,the court emphasized brantley never paid taxes on sherrill farm and cited anderson francis,the payment of taxes is not a controlling circumstance,but it is one of the means whereby a claim of ownership is asserted,and the failure to pay taxes for so long a time tends to weaken a claim of ownership by adverse possession.the court also found t he boundaries of the land carl brantley claims to own by adverse possession have evolved to suit his purpose,and explicitly found brantley testimony was not believable when it conflicted with the testimony of other witnesses.
but the district court ultimately determined brantley adverse possession claim failed because his use was not exclusive for fifteen years.to meet the requirement of exclusivity,brantley must show an exclusive dominion over the land and an appropriation of it to his own use and benefit.two persons can not hold one piece of property adversely to each other at the same time,and where two persons have entered upon land,the one who has the better title will be deemed to be in possession.sears state dep t of wildlife conservation,quotation omitted.
based on the evidence produced at trial,the district court found a number of facts indicating brantley shared the use of sherrill farm with others brantley father,bobby,had a grazing lease on sherrill farm until osu conducted significant activities on sherrill farm during the relevant period weyerhaeuser also conducted activities such as road maintenance and gravel sampling during the relevant period by agreement with weyerhaeuser,sherrill farm is part of an area managed by the odwc under the odwc agreement,sherrill farm is open to the public and hunters have used the property horses not belonging to brantley ran on sherrill farm and brantley brother also claimed grazing rights to sherrill farm by adverse possession.
we agree with weyerhaeuser that these findings support the district court conclusion brantley did not use sherrill farm to the exclusion of the record owner and other permissive users.
findings support rejection of partial adverse possession defense 
as a fallback position,brantley claims even if others used the southern part of sherrill farm,he maintained exclusive possession of the northern part and has proven adverse possession at least to that portion of sherrill farm.under oklahoma law,an adverse possessor can gain title to a portion of land he possesses exclusively even if the record owner makes use of another portion of the land.see macias guymon indus,where true title holder enters a part of his land adversely occupied by another,the statute of limitations will be arrested only as to so much of the land as has been entered and adverse possessor will be restricted to that land of which he remains in actual possession.
here,the findings support the district court judgment.while the district court findings were not entirely clear as to what portions of sherrill farm were being used by weyerhaeuser and osu,the record shows that,at the very least,bobby brantley grazing lease,which the district court found extended to,covered the whole of sherrill farm.and,as detailed above,other users claimed access and use of the northern portion of sherrill farm.moreover,brantley never clearly defined the boundaries of his use in a way that would have supported his partial exclusive possession.
these findings defeat brantley claim of partial exclusivity.
findings were not clearly erroneous 
brantley primary response to these conclusions is that the district court clearly erred in its factual determinations regarding other users of sherrill farm.in particular,he argues the district court clearly erred in finding his father had a grazing license on sherrill farm until.a finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is without factual support in the record or if,after reviewing all the evidence,we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the district court ruling and must uphold any district court finding that is permissible in light of the evidence.plaza speedway,united states,cir.the evidence supports the district court finding.
the only license agreement in the record between brantley father,bobby,and weyerhaeuser is a agreement terminating april.brantley does not argue the license was never renewed and indeed seems to acknowledge the license was renewed for some period,because he stipulates bobby would testify he can no longer recall the number of years for which he renewed his grazing license for sherrill farm.he simply argues bobby had left sherrill farm by at least.weyerhaeuser did not retain records regarding the license renewal because it periodically destroys files after they have been closed for some time.
several pieces of evidence suggest bobby grazing license extended to a later date.for example,a weyerhaeuser witness testified her records showed bobby grazing license continued until based on a document dated september,showing a grazing license on the sherrill farm area had been terminated.the lease agreement with osu also states the leased premises are currently subject to a special cattle grazing license agreement between lessor and a third party,lessee is agreeable to the continuation of said license agreement to july,at which time lessor shall terminate said license agreement.the district court noted osu behavior in not seeking to have cattle removed from the property was consistent with an understanding that weyerhaeuser allowed a licensee to use the property for grazing.based on this evidence,the district court concluded bobby brantley had a license to graze on sherrill farm until.
brantley argues the district court clearly erred because,according to his testimony and the stipulated testimony of bobby,bobby was no longer using sherrill farm after.the district court noted when the testimony diverged,the court examined the demeanor of each witness and the consistency of all the testimony at trial in evaluating the discrepancy.with regard to the term of bobby brantley grazing license,the district court chose to credit other evidence over brantley testimony.given the district court role in assessing the credibility of witnesses and the other evidence in the record,this determination was not clearly erroneous.
brantley does not seriously contest the court other factual findings.they also are supported by the record and are not clearly erroneous.
accordingly,the district court correctly concluded that,because brantley had not exclusively possessed sherrill farm for the required time,he had not established a claim for adverse possession.
prescriptive easement 
the district court also concluded brantley had failed to demonstrate the necessary elements to succeed on a claim of an easement by prescription because t he requirements for an easement by prescription in the state of oklahoma are generally the same as those for adverse possession.citing zimmerman,at see also brown mayfield,requiring clear and positive proof of actual open,notorious,exclusive and hostile possession.although the district court order is not entirely clear on this point,it rejected the prescriptive easement claim,like the adverse possession claim,because brantley use was not exclusive for the prescriptive period.
as an initial matter,it is not entirely clear oklahoma law would even entertain a prescriptive easement for grazing.but the district court oklahoma will recognize such an easement,a more subtle analysis of exclusivity is required than that employed in a typical adverse possession case.
prescriptive grazing easements 
although oklahoma has not explicitly ruled on the question,a number of courts have rejected claims for prescriptive grazing rights.these courts see the claimed easement which more or less uses all of the servient estate as a thinly veiled attempt to circumvent the requirements for adverse possession.see mcdonald bd.of.levee comm rs,platt pietras,so d,oakley valley stone alastra,idaho,burlingame marjerrison,deseret livestock sharp,utah.
some courts rejecting prescriptive grazing rights instead analyze grazing rights as falling under the doctrine of profits à prendre,a more expansive type of property right.see mcdonald.at platt,so d at oakley valley stone,at burlingame,at deseret livestock,at.a profit,in contrast to an easement,is a type of possessory interest it is a liberty in one person to enter another soil and take from it the fruits not yet carried away.d easements and licenses see also bonner.rock,distinguishing easements from profits à prendre.a profit is an easement plus common examples include the right to enter and remove timber,minerals,oil,gas,or game from the burdened property.restatement third property servitudes restatement cmt.
these cases considering claims for prescriptive grazing rights have rejected them whether analyzed as a profit or an easement when the right claimed approximates total possession.as the montana supreme court reasoned in burlingame,the claimed prescriptive grazing profit or have the effect of leaving the landowner with an empty fee title.at.in other words,where an easement or profit would amount to possession of an entire parcel,the claim is not one of prescriptive right but actually of adverse possession.in that situation,one can not gain rights to the profits of the land through a claim of prescription but instead must meet all of the requirements of adverse possession.see also platt,so d at oakley valley stone,at deseret livestock,at.in short,if the property right claimed is the functional equivalent of possession,a prescriptive easement is not available,because it would effectively oust the rightful owner from the property.see platt,so d at oakley valley stone,at.because the rights brantley asserts approximate total possession,the preceding line of cases,if followed by oklahoma,would deny brantley a prescriptive easement for grazing rights.
other lines of authority,however,suggest grazing easements may be acquired by prescription.the colorado supreme court,for example,recently recognized a prescriptive easement to graze livestock based on an historical right to access spanish land grant property.see lobato taylor,relying on historic use and grant documents see also checketts thompson,idaho,schwenker sagers,iowa both recognizing prescriptive easements for grazing on a narrower scale.and the other cases cited above stop short of concluding that one can never obtain a profit or easement to graze by prescription.
to summarize,many courts have been wary of granting prescriptive property rights for an easement or profit amounting to total possession of a parcel.most courts nevertheless recognize at least the possibility of a prescriptive easement to graze cattle on another property.oklahoma statutes and case law are silent on this point.given the basic principle that a ny easement which may be acquired by grant may also be acquired by prescription,in the absence of a statute to the contrary,d easements and licenses,we will assume the possibility that a prescriptive easement could be obtained for grazing under oklahoma law.see.stat.tit,identifying the right of pasture as an easement.
whether brantley claimed use was exclusive 
we now turn to the district court determination that brantley claimed use was not exclusive for the purpose of establishing a prescriptive easement.
certain analytical difficulties flow from oklahoma retention of exclusivity as an element of prescriptive easements.an easement is by definition a interest in land.see restatement an easement creates a nonpossessory right to enter and use land in the possession of another.comments to the restatement discussing prescriptive easements describe how they differ from adverse possession to acquire an interest by adverse possession,the claimant must maintain exclusive possession of the claimed property during the statutory period.to acquire a servitude,however,the claimant is only required to use the property during the prescriptive period.the use need not be,and frequently is not,exclusive.restatement cmt.
some states nevertheless continue to refer to exclusivity as an element of prescriptive easements.see,albert hastetter,d easements and licenses e xclusive use generally is a prerequisite to the establishment of a prescriptive easement.because oklahoma references the elements of adverse possession in its definition of a prescriptive easement,oklahoma is among the states retaining an exclusivity requirement.see willis holley,to acquire possession by prescription the possession must be open,visible,continuous,and exclusive,with a claim of ownership,actual,notorious,and hostile.citing zimmerman,at,and quoting irion nelson,emphasis added.nevertheless,oklahoma has not explained exactly what exclusive means in the context of a prescriptive easement.
comments to the restatement describe the difficulty of defining exclusive in this context the term exclusive,borrowed from doctrine,causes confusion in prescription cases because servitudes are generally not exclusive.restatement cmt.g.the exclusivity requirement in prescriptive easement cases thus puts courts into the awkward position of explaining that the requirement does not mean that the use is such as to exclude others,or,that the user in fact has excluded others from the servient estate.id.
instead,courts must apply a different understanding of exclusivity.courts explain exclusivity simply requires that the user have acted independently of rights claimed by others.see also d easements and licenses the term exclusive does not mean that the easement must be used by the claimant only,however it simply means that the claimant right to use the easement does not depend on a similar right in others.the exclusivity requirement is most often applied to deny prescriptive rights to one whose use is indistinguishable from uses being made by the general public or to one whose use is similar to and concurrent with a use made by the owner.restatement cmt.most typically,then,exclusivity in the context of prescriptive easements connotes a use different than that of others on the property.
the restatement acknowledges this reading of the exclusivity requirement can be redundant because it serves a notice function already served by the requirement.id.for example,brantley adverse use would be neither open and notorious nor exclusive if he used the easement along with the public or another person who was entitled to graze on the property.this is because his use would not give weyerhaeuser notice that brantley,and not an authorized user,was grazing on sherrill farm.
in sum,to be exclusive in the prescriptive easement context,a use need not physically exclude others from the land,but it must at least be sufficiently distinct from the uses made by authorized users to give the owner notice of a potential claim.
with this background,we turn to whether the district court erred in concluding brantley claimed easement was sufficiently exclusive to establish a prescriptive easement.applying these principles,we see no error.in particular,as discussed above,the district court found bobby brantley held a grazing license on the sherrill farm until.if bobby brantley had a license to graze cattle on the sherrill farm until,brantley was not the exclusive user of the sherrill farm for grazing prior to that date.and,until at least his grazing use was not sufficiently distinct from his father licensed use to put weyerhaeuser on notice that brantley was claiming a grazing easement separate from his father license.the court,moreover,also concluded that other members of the brantley family used and claimed rights to graze on sherrill farm.and it is also clear that a substantial portion of sherrill farm was used by osu,and then by odwc.
accordingly,the district court did not err in concluding brantley use of sherrill farm for grazing was not sufficiently exclusive for the full prescriptive period to establish a prescriptive grazing easement under oklahoma law.
brantley argues weyerhaeuser is not entitled to the damages it received for three reasons weyerhaeuser failed to plead special damages under federal rule of civil procedure g the damages awarded were excessively speculative and uncertain and weyerhaeuser failed to mitigate its damages.the district court did not abuse its discretion by allowing weyerhaeuser to amend its pleadings by pleading special damages in the pretrial order.we affirm the district court damage award.
failure to plead special damages 
rule g,covering pleadings,requires that w hen items of special damage are claimed,they shall be specifically stated.special damages depend on particular circumstances of the case general damages,on the other hand,are the ordinary result of the conduct alleged.charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure ed.thus,general damages for trespass would be injury to the land itself restatement second of torts.lost profits,by contrast,are special damages subject to the pleading requirement of rule g because they depend on circumstances unrelated to the trespass,weyerhaeuser plans for the property.see quinones.ins,cir.
brantley claims weyerhaeuser failed to adequately plead its damages attributable to lost profits.weyerhaeuser did not describe lost profits from timber or mining in its complaint.instead,it first raised lost profits as a measure of damages in a response to brantley motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.weyerhaeuser argues it complied with rule g by amending its pleadings through the pretrial order and that brantley suffered no prejudice through the amended pleading because he otherwise had notice of the special damages claim.
federal rule of civil procedure a allows a party to amend its pleadings at any time by leave of the court.the subsequent pretrial order supercedes the pleadings.see wilson muckala,cir calling a new claim raised in a pretrial order obviously an attempt to amend the pleadings at a rather late date.although the court never explicitly permitted an amended pleading,it implic
