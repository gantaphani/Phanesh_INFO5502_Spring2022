this is the second appeal in a dispute among several outdoor advertising companies and the city of los angeles over certain billboards with digital displays.in the first appeal,we affirmed the trial court finding that a settlement agreement between two of the companies and the city,allowing the companies to digitize many of their existing billboards,was illegal and void,because a municipal ordinance expressly prohibited alterations or enlargements of such signs.summit media llc city of los angeles th,summit media i.we also concluded,contrary to the trial court judgment,that it was necessary to revoke all digital conversion permits granted under the illegal settlement agreement.ibid.we directed the trial court to amend its order so that it invalidates all digital conversion permits issued by the city to real parties under the settlement agreement.id.at.
the trial court,after hearings,promptly amended its order,declaring the digital conversion permits invalid.the trial court order also identified the signs at issue,and ordered the immediate discontinuation of digital use of the signs.in compliance with the trial court order the april order,the parties turned off the digital displays,and the signs went dark.

after extensive litigation,the trial court denied plaintiff motion to demolish the signs and denied the attorney fee motion.plaintiff timely appealed.
we affirm the trial court orders.
the background 
we will not repeat here the facts surrounding the initial disputes that led to our decision in summit media i.the interested reader may find the details in that decision.for our purposes here,this brief summary should suffice.
plaintiff and real parties are all engaged in the lucrative outdoor advertising business in the city,owning and maintaining numerous signs billboards in locations other than at a property owner business.in april,the city established a permanent,general ban on new signs with exceptions that are irrelevant to this appeal,and a ban on alterations or enlargements of legally existing signs the sign ban.this sign ban,along with other ordinances calling for inspections and inspection fees for signs,generated a maelstrom of lawsuits in state and federal courts filed by real parties,plaintiff,and others.
eventually,in september,the city and real parties entered into an agreement settling their disputes.the settlement agreement exempted real parties from the sign ban,the inspection program,and numerous other zoning and building laws regulating signs.the agreement required the city to issue new permits allowing real parties to modernize a large number of their signs,despite the ban on that kind of modification,and whether or not the signs violated present or prospective building and zoning ordinances.the settlement agreement also exempted real parties from the usual procedures for obtaining permits.real parties immediately undertook significant modifications of their signs,otherwise prohibited by the sign ban,including the conversion of existing static,wood and vinyl signs to digital displays.we describe the scope of the modifications more fully post.
in august,plaintiff filed this lawsuit,challenging the settlement agreement as illegal and void.while that litigation was pending,the city enacted an ordinance,effective in august,explicitly banning signs with digital displays.the ordinance whereas clauses indicated that real parties digital conversions were causing unanticipated negative impacts including negative impacts on residential neighborhoods 
as noted above,the trial court granted plaintiff motion for a writ of mandate,ordering the city to set aside and cease implementing the settlement agreement.real parties appealed,proffering numerous bases for error in voiding the settlement agreement.plaintiff,contending the trial court should also have revoked the digital conversion permits the city issued in violation of the sign ban.plaintiff argued the de minimis burden that might be shouldered by real parties if they must apply for new permits under the same laws that apply to everyone,remove the digital displays,is far outweighed by public policy requiring fair and consistent application of the zoning laws.no one asked the superior court or this court to order that the digital displays be destroyed.this is not a matter of demolition of a structure or the loss of a property right.rather,real parties must go through the process that everyone else must use to obtain a sign permit.plaintiff concluded by asking this court to enter judgment invalidating all digital conversion permits issued by the city to real parties under the settlement agreement.
we agreed with plaintiff,concluding the settlement agreement was illegal and void,and there was no legal basis for the trial court refusal to revoke digital conversion permits issued under an illegal agreement and in violation of unambiguous municipal ordinances.we ordered the trial court to amend its order to invalidate all digital conversion permits issued under the settlement agreement.summit media i,supra,th at.
proceedings after the remittitur in summit media i 
our remittitur issued on march,and the parties immediately began filing proposed orders and other papers in the trial court.
a.the april order 
after hearings,the trial court amended its november,order granting the writ of mandate.the april order stated that the digital conversion permits issued by the city to real parties under the settlement agreement,identified in the order,are hereby declared invalid and the digital use of the digital signs shall be discontinued.the april order identified,by permit number and address,clear channel outdoor digital permits and cbs outdoor digital permits that were declared invalid.the order further stated this order does not consider nor enter judgment regarding any rights concerning signs or aspects of digital sign permits.the parties retain all of their rights as to those matters.the court stated it retained jurisdiction,including over any motion for attorney fees or costs.
proceedings after the april order 
real parties discontinued digital use of their signs,in compliance with the court april order.
a few weeks later,plaintiff filed a motion for orders for removal and demolition of digital sign faces and structures that are subject to the court order of april,the demolition motion.plaintiff demolition motion also asked for orders invalidating all other permits or issued to real parties pursuant to the settlement agreement and further orders effectuating this court writ of mandate and in conformance with this court summit media i decision.
on the same day,real party outfront media notified the city that it intended to continue to use its permitted sign structures for signage and proposes to install vinyl copy over the digital faces on or after may.the city sought an order preserving the status quo,and on may,the court ordered real parties to retain the status quo and not install any advertising on their digital structures pending a hearing on plaintiff demolition motion.
c.the work performed in converting the signs to digital displays 
the parties conducted a great deal of discovery in anticipation of the hearings on the demolition motion,including on the scope of the work that had occurred in connection with the conversion of real parties signs to digital displays.there is no significant disagreement on what was done to the signs when they were modernized with digital displays.
as plaintiff describes the work,real parties removed the static faces from the steel superstructures.they placed led units on the superstructures using a crane,typically attaching them to an existing steel framework mounted on the sign structure horizontal girder or crossbar,using clamps or clips.these led units can be removed from the signs without any changes to the sign structure.
in addition,real parties removed the platforms or catwalks that had been used by workers to change static advertisements,removed existing lighting,upgraded the electrical system,and added web cameras and satellite dishes to the signs.many of the signs required the addition of gussets or braces or reinforcement of the existing foundation.
ricky tiedeman,who oversaw the digital sign face installations for clear channel,described the reinforcement work this way clear channel upgraded the existing sign support structures that framed the new digital displays to ensure the adequacy of the structural system in resisting seismic and wind loads,and supporting dead loads the increased weight of the digital face,and at some locations,was required to improve the concrete support slabs at the pole base to address seismic and wind loads and support dead loads.
under the illegal settlement agreement,clear channel converted more than existing nondigital sign faces to digital signs.clear channel obtained three other permits for digital modernization,but these expired before any work was done.outfront media modernized of its signs to include digital displays 
under the settlement agreement,real parties also made other alterations to their signs that would not otherwise have been allowed.for example,clear channel installed six nondigital second sign faces on signs under the settlement agreement,and obtained for two sign structures.occurred in cases where a building permit for the existing sign could not be found.outfront media likewise installed second sign faces and obtained it could not have otherwise obtained.
according to tiedeman,installation of the digital sign faces did not change the location of the existing sign or sign structure in any instance did not increase the size in any instance and did not require replacement or rebuilding of the existing sign structure primary column.nor was the height or orientation changed,except in three instances.
d.the hearings on the demolition motion 
the court held several hearings on plaintiff demolition motion and related discovery issues.at the first,on september,plaintiff urged the court to issue a categorical order requiring real parties to undo all work that was done pursuant to permits issued under the settlement agreement.real parties contended they had the right to resume static advertising on the signs that were digitized.
the city explained to the trial court its understanding of how the los angeles municipal code lamc or municipal code applied to real parties illegal digital signs at this juncture t he code grants the sign companies the right to obtain building permits,through a ministerial process,to return the digital signs to their original state prior to the execution of the settlement agreement,as static billboards.the code also allows clear channel and cbs to apply for a discretionary significant modification to allow the digital faces to stay in place and be wrapped with static advertising copy.the city also told the trial court that the municipal code does not authorize,so any were invalid.counsel for the city observed that the department of building and safety would need to get involved to ensure the structural safety of any proposed sign alterations.
the court stated that any sign that has its existence solely because of the settlement agreement has to be taken down or replaced the court set a further hearing to determine which of these signs at issue have independent viability apart from the settlement agreement.
at a hearing on november,the trial court ruled on plaintiff demolition motion.the court entered its written order on march.with respect to the structures that were subject to the april order,the court denied plaintiff request for removal of the digital sign faces from the structures denied plaintiff request for demolition of the structures and partially granted plaintiff request for removal of other alterations performed on the structures pursuant to the settlement agreement,ordering that two of clear channel digital signs be lowered to their agreement permitted heights.the court also granted plaintiff request for invalidation of all permits for the erection of second faces issued under the settlement agreement six clear channel signs and two outfront media signs,and ordered the second sign faces removed.and,the court granted plaintiff request for the invalidation of all issued under the settlement agreement two clear channel signs and three outfront media signs.
developments after the trial court ruling 
before the trial court ruling,and continuing thereafter,real parties began the process of seeking permits from the city to return their digitized signs to their original state as static billboards 
outfront media obtained permits to alter of its digital signs to resume legal nonconforming use,by removing the inoperative digital apparatus and reinstalling conventional steel frame catwalks and lighting.for its other two digital signs,outfront media applied to the city for permission to maintain the digital apparatus in place to be wrapped with static,printed messages,and the city approved those requests.
similarly,real party clear channel applied for and received permits to remove digital sign faces installed pursuant to the settlement agreement,and to replace the sign face with conventional frame panels for the display of printed vinyl messages.for of these signs,clear channel further sought and received approval of significant modifications allowing clear channel,in the alternative,to leave in place the digital sign faces,wrap them with printed vinyl messages and lights and catwalks.
the city findings approving the significant modifications indicated that the removal of the digital sign faces was impractical because its exterior frame and face can be utilized as backing for conventional vinyl wrap sign copy,and removing the display would be wasteful,costly,and would not serve any benefit to the public or the sign users in regards to improved legibility,readability,visibility,traffic safety,and public safety.allowing the disabled digital sign faces to remain would not interfere with traffic safety or otherwise endanger public safety,while removing them and constructing a new conventional frame and static display would.lengthy construction activities would require the temporar y clo sure of traffic lanes and sidewalks for the placement of construction vehicles and a crane,directly affecting traffic flow and potentially traffic safety.wrapping the exterior faces of the signs will not require a crane or multiple construction vehicles and the resulting sign display will be functionally and aesthetically identical to the previously approved conventional sign display.
f.the attorney fee motion 
while the parties were litigating the demolition motion,plaintiff was also seeking attorney fees under section for the legal work that successfully voided the illegal agreement and rid the city of most digital billboards.on april,plaintiff filed its motion for attorney fees,seeking an award of a lodestar amount of fees and costs in the trial court with a multiplier.plaintiff also sought costs incurred in the appeal in summit media i in fees and in expenses.by the time of the hearing in january,supplemental filings showed plaintiff sought a total lodestar amount of more than million.
at a hearing on january,the trial court denied plaintiff motion for attorney fees.the court found that,while plaintiff lawsuit resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest,and conferred a significant benefit on the general public,the litigation did not meet the third requirement for fees it did not impose a financial burden on plaintiff that was out of proportion to plaintiff individual stake in the matter.
plaintiff filed a timely appeal from the trial court orders.
discussion 
the demolition motion 
plaintiff contends on appeal that,in order to fully effectuate the writ of mandate invalidating the digital conversion permits,the trial court was required not only to order the digital displays extinguished as it did,but also to order the physical removal of all changes real parties made to the signs and structures under the digital permits.in other words,the trial court should have ordered any improvements made to the support structure of a sign to accommodate the heavier digital display such as upgrading the concrete support slabs at the pole base,reinforcing the existing foundation,adding gussets or braces,and so on to be destroyed.at a minimum,plaintiff contends,the trial court should have ordered the digital display equipment to be taken down rather than simply turned off,pointing out that it can be removed without damaging the equipment or the sign structure.otherwise,plaintiff argues,the writ has no effect,and the illegality that provided the grounds for the writ continues.
we find no error in the trial court disposition of plaintiff demolition motion.
a.the standard of review 
we may reverse a trial court determination of whether there has been compliance with its writ only for abuse of discretion.cosgrove county of sacramento d,not much,if any,leeway is left to an appellate court to control the action of the trial court,when the trial court had before it substantial evidence upon which to act rules governing the scope of review in civil actions generally apply to appeal in mandamus proceedings t he judgment is presumed to be correct,and the burden is on appellant to show reversible error.
b.a preliminary consideration the waiver issue 
the trial court expressed its concern that plaintiff did not seek demolition of the signs until after issuance of our remittitur.the parties argue at length over whether,by failing to seek demolition of the signs in the trial court in the original proceedings,or in our court in the summit media i appeal,plaintiff forfeited the right to do so now.we think not.
the trial court has the authority to grant additional relief not expressly sought by the petitioner in writ proceedings,if the relief is necessary to enforce the writ.housing authority city of los angeles cal d,ordering city to comply with a previously issued writ by annexing certain territory the annexation question was not specifically presented in the earlier writ proceeding california trout,superior court d,that petitioners originally prayed for a different remedy does not preclude the court from granting an appropriate remedy not made the subject of the prayer.
in short,if enforcement of the writ requires,for its effectuation,the demolition of real parties signs,then the signs must be demolished,and whether or not plaintiff sought that relief in the first instance is of no consequence.but that is not the case.
elimination of digital displays versus demolition and removal 
here,we see no abuse of discretion in the trial court refusal to require either the demolition of the structural improvements or the removal of the digital equipment.the trial court said this in so ruling i do see a functional difference between ordering the digital signs turned off never to be displayed again until or unless at some point they are legal under the process under the level playing field or wrapping them,having them remain black or static if the city approves of that.i see no functional difference there.either way,the digital conversion,which is what the court of appeal said was invalid,is no more.these digital conversions will now cease to exist unless the appropriate governmental agencies at some point in the future pursuant to rules that apply to all citizens and entities equally say otherwise.
plaintiff protests that the invalid digital permits allowed real parties to make structural and electrical changes to their signs to accommodate the digital displays,and ultimately erect those heavy and costly monitors.these illegally altered billboards continue to exist and violate the law regardless of whether they are turned on or off,or wrapped with new vinyl advertisements.
we do not see it that way.of course it is indisputable that the signs were altered in violation of the law,as we found in summit media i.but it does not follow,as a necessary consequence,that they must be destroyed on that account,so long as the illegality at their core is eliminated and the central illegality is the digital display,not the structural reinforcement and equipment that made the display possible.indeed,in its motion for attorney fees discussed in pt,post,plaintiff pointed out that it is beyond debate that plaintiff entirely succeeded in its lawsuit it obtained invalidation of the settlement agreement from the trial court invalidation of the digital conversion permits from the court of appeal and o n remand,the trial court took the step necessary to give meaning to its writ,and ordered the digital signs turned off.the two concrete benefits that flowed to the public from plaintiff lawsuit were the existing digital billboards have been turned off,and their permits have been revoked and residents no longer face the prospect of real parties erecting hundreds of additional digital billboards throughout the city,without any opportunity to be heard.the writ completely effectuated these benefits.
plaintiff offers no persuasive authority for its claim that,to effectuate its writ,the trial court was required to do more than eliminate the digital displays.the only authority it cites for requiring removal is section of the municipal code.that section provides that e very existing sign sign support structure constructed without a valid building permit shall be made to conform to the current provisions of this code or shall be demolished and removed.any use of an existing sign constructed without a valid building permit shall be discontinued.plaintiff,without further analysis,tells us that the unambiguous language of section requires removal or demolition of all unpermitted signs or sign support structures we do not agree.
lamc section on its face requires demolition and removal only if signs or structures without valid permits can not be made to conform to current municipal code provisions.plaintiff has not shown this is so.plaintiff apparent position is that the illegally digitized signs can not be made to conform to the current provisions of this code,because the current provisions ban signs entirely.that position ignores other provisions of the municipal code,including provisions governing sign rights that existed when the ban on signs was enacted.we decline to construe section without regard to other pertinent provisions of the code.it seems to us quite plain that section requires real parties digitized signs to be brought into conformance with the municipal code,which means that use of the signs for digital displays must be discontinued.demolition would be necessary only if the signs could not be brought into conformance with the current code requirements.
plaintiff also asserts that demolition is required because real parties,by illegally altering their signs for digital display,lost their right to engage in static advertising at those sites,as a legal nonconforming use the only authority plaintiff offers for this proposition is a municipal code provision,lamc section c.that section provides any existing nonconforming sign may be continued,provided that no structural,electrical or mechanical alterations are made to the sign except as permitted in section of this code.section is entitled electrical and incorporates the provisions of an appendix to the california building code.according to plaintiff,this means that,because real parties altered their signs,the signs may not be returned to their original use.but lamc section does not say so it merely says that alterations must be made in conformance with the building code.plaintiff offers no other authority suggesting that the municipal code prohibits return of the signs to their previously permissible use.
lacking any authority for the proposition that signs,once altered with invalid permits,may not be returned to their original nonconforming use,plaintiff argues that real parties abandoned their grandfathered rights when they modernized the signs and stopped engaging in the legal nonconforming use for more than one year.they cite lamc section b.section b is entitled nonconforming use of buildings,and paragraph states discontinuance of use.a building or structure or portion of a building or structure,which contains a nonconforming use which is discontinued for a continuous period of one year,shall only be occupied by a use that conforms to the current use regulations of the zone and other applicable current land use regulations.
we are not persuaded that real parties abandoned the use of their signs by digitizing them.lamc section b does not apply to prevent real parties from returning their signs to their original use for static,rather than digital,advertising.the nonconforming use in this case is the maintenance of an sign,which with irrelevant exceptions is otherwise forbidden.lamc.we can not say that real parties at any time abandoned or discontinued their nonconforming use of the signs.while they converted their signs from static to digital displays,an alteration that was illegal,that hardly constitutes abandonment of the right to use their signs to display advertising.
plaintiff cites no persuasive authority to the contrary.plaintiff merely points out that public policy favors the elimination of nonconforming uses that generally there can be no resumption of a nonconforming use which has been relinquished city of los angeles wolfe cal d,and that public policy does not favor the expansion or change of nonconforming uses people ex rel.of pub.wks.ryan outdoor advertising,d.all that is so,but none of those principles supports the proposition that real parties at any time abandoned their nonconforming use of the signs.they expanded that nonconforming use through a settlement agreement that was illegal and void,but that expansion has been nullified,and no authority supports plaintiff claim that the preexisting nonconforming use was relinquished.indeed,the pertinent authorities suggest the contrary.see hansen brothers enterprises,board of supervisors cal th,hansen brothers when it appears that a nonconforming use is being expanded,the county may order the operator to restrict the operation to its former level.
pallco enterprises,beam th pallco demonstrates the point.there,an outdoor advertising company pallco contended that removal of a competitor advertising display was required,because the prior nonconforming use was voluntarily abandoned through nonuse when the property owners added illumination an illegality that had continued for five years.id.at.the court first stated the applicable principles abandonment of a nonconforming use involves both an intent to abandon and an overt act,or failure to act,which carries the implication the owner does not claim or retain any interest in the right to the nonconforming use.citation.id.at,quoting hansen brothers,supra,cal th at.mere cessation of use alone is not enough pallco,at.
pallco rejected the claim that the abandoned legal,nonconforming use could not be resumed,stating we are not persuaded.the property owners never abandoned their legal,nonconforming use.rather,they expanded that use by adding illumination.this is akin to an owner of a easement increasing the traffic over the easement.the increase may be improper,but there was never an abandonment of the original use.pallco,supra,th at pallco cites nothing to support its novel theory that an expansion of a use is an abandonment of the original use.the same is true here.
finally,we do not find persuasive plaintiff argument that,because the signs have not been demolished,the city is providing special treatment to real parties,who continue reaping benefits of the settlement agreement to this day the only continuing benefit of the settlement agreement that plaintiff identifies is that the signs have been repurposed for static advertising instead of being demolished plaintiff says the maintenance of inoperative digital signs and changes to the sign structures is a benefit of the settlement agreement.
in our view,the pertinent word is inoperative.plaintiff has not proven that the maintenance of digital displays that can not be used,or the continued existence of the reinforced structures,provides any tangible benefit to real parties.instead,real parties have invested in expensive equipment and structural reinforcements that are,respectively,inoperable and unnecessary,and now they must incur the expense of seeking permits for and reverting the signs to permissible static use.the only benefit we see is that real parties need not incur the further expense of removing the inoperative digital displays and tearing down the reinforced portions of the sign structures.but that benefit did not flow from the terms of the illegal settlement agreement.it occurred because real parties followed legal processes,with notice to the public and an opportunity to be heard,to obtain permits for significant modifications to the signs,to leave in place the digital sign faces to be used as backing and wrap them with vinyl messages.
in short,on the record in this case we can find no abuse of discretion in the trial court enforcement of the writ.
the attorney fee motion 
plaintiff sought attorney fees under section.a filing in the trial court shortly before the january,hearing on fees showed fees incurred including estimated fees for january of more than million.
a.the general legal principles 
e ligibility for section attorney fees is established when plaintiffs action has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest,a significant benefit,whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary,has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons,and the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement are such as to make the award appropriate.conservatorship of whitley cal th,whitley,quoting woodland hills residents,city council cal d,woodland hills.utilizing its traditional equitable discretion,the trial court must realistically assess the litigation and determine,from a practical perspective citation whether or not the statutory criteria have been met.baggett gates cal d.
the trial court judgment on whether a plaintiff has proved each of the prerequisites for an award of attorney fees under section will not be disturbed unless the appellate court is convinced that it is clearly wrong and constitutes an abuse of discretion.planned parenthood aakhus th,robinson city of chowchilla th,if the superior court order is not consistent with the applicable principles of law,the order necessarily falls outside the scope of the superior court discretion.
b.the legal principle at issue in this case 
in this case,there is no dispute that two of the three prerequisites for an award of fees under section have been met plaintiff lawsuit resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest,and conferred a significant benefit on the general public.the dispute is over whether the trial court abused its discretion when it concluded plaintiff did not prove the third prerequisite namely,that the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement are such as to make the award appropriate.
the supreme court has given us direction on the meaning of the financial burden of private enforcement.whitley,supra,cal th at.c ourts have long construed this language to mean,among other things,that a litigant who has a financial interest in the litigation may be disqualified from obtaining such fees when expected or realized financial gains offset litigation costs.whitley,at.whitley further explains that the purpose of section is not to compensate with attorney fees only those litigants who have altruistic or lofty motives,but rather all litigants and attorneys who step forward to engage in public interest litigation when there are insufficient financial incentives to justify the litigation in economic terms.ibid.
a n award on the private attorney general theory is appropriate when the cost of the claimant legal victory transcends his personal interest,that is,when the necessity for pursuing the lawsuit placed a burden on the plaintiff out of proportion to his individual stake in the matter.citation.citation.this requirement focuses on the financial burdens and incentives involved in bringing the lawsuit.citation.whitley,supra,cal th at see also california licensed foresters state board of forestry th,california licensed foresters our concern under section is whether the plaintiff had an individual stake that was out of proportion to the costs of litigation,not whether it was financially able to bear the costs.financial status is not the criterion.
c.the trial court ruling 
the trial court concluded that the litigation vindicated an important public right,and conferred a significant benefit on the general public.but the court did not find the litigation imposed a financial burden that was out of proportion to plaintiff individual stake in the matter.instead,the court concluded that plaintiff had an enormous personal stake in this litigation.the court found the evidence showed plaintiff believed it would be ruinous for its business if it could not compete with real parties in the digital billboard industry as a result of the settlement agreement.the court found the public benefit bestowed by this litigation was only incidental to plaintiff stake in getting a level playing field to compete in a very lucrative business,and therefore denied the motion.
d.the record 
the record on which the trial court based its ruling included the following evidence.
a declaration from kouba,plaintiff principal owner,dated june,stated that the city settlement agreement with real parties puts plaintiff at a competitive disadvantage to these competitors because plaintiff is being prevented from upgrading to this new technology,while real parties are freely allowed to do so.kouba further stated that digital displays were more attractive to advertising buyers,and preventing plaintiff from upgrading to digital displays will injure plaintiff business goodwill because plaintiff is not able to offer the latest technology that these competitors are able to offer.while it is difficult to quantify the nature and extent of this injury at the present time,plaintiff is clearly being placed at a competitive disadvantage and being severely injured in its business by the city grant of special rights to its competitors.
plaintiff january second amended complaint in federal court against the city and real parties alleged that unless the city was restrained from applying the sign ordinances in a discriminatory fashion,plaintiff will be irreparably injured and will suffer substantial loss of rents,profits and goodwill,the nature and extent of which will be extremely difficult or impossible to ascertain 
kouba june declaration in support of plaintiff request for a preliminary injunction stated that plaintiff desired to build new signs throughout the city,but was prohibited from doing so because of the sign ban,and this has caused and continues to cause irreparable injury to plaintiff business,goodwill,and its right to free speech,an injury that is impossible to quantify and damages alone will not make plaintiff whole.this irreparable injury will grow each day until and unless the city is enjoined from continuing to enforce its unconstitutional ban against plaintiff.
at his july deposition,kouba stated i see our action as as trying to preserve or restore our our civil rights and to build our company in a way that our competitors have been allowed to.
in a november pleading in this case,plaintiff pointed out that its interest was greater than that of the public at large,because it is an outdoor advertising company whose economic survival depends on its signs,and fair competition and compliance with the law by other sign companies in los angeles.
in a july pleading,plaintiff asserted that each of real parties digitized signs can generate approximately million per year in advertising revenue.
in addition,as further evidence of plaintiff financial interest in the litigation,real parties proffered a letter from plaintiff counsel dated october,a month or so after filing this lawsuit.in the letter,plaintiff proposed a structure for a global settlement under which real parties would each pay plaintiff million would each assign to plaintiff of the modernization credits permitting digital displays they obtained under the settlement agreement and would support plaintiff effort to obtain its own settlement with the city.in return,plaintiff would dismiss both this suit and the federal suit it had filed,withdraw a public records request,and agree to a mutual release and covenant not to sue.
in the october,letter,plaintiff said that its goal in this litigation was not to injure real parties or the sign business in los angeles,but rather to obtain rights which are functionally equivalent to its competitors.plaintiff stated it had been heavily burdened and damaged by this unfair competitive advantage enjoyed by real parties,and without a global settlement,plaintiff has no option than to level the playing field by challenging the settlement agreement in court.a better option than bringing down the current regulatory structure including the settlement agreement is to craft an agreement that permits plaintiff to continue to do business in the same manner as real parties.
plaintiff presented declarations to the trial court indicating that,when it filed this lawsuit,the odds against plaintiff were very long.kouba told the trial court that plaintiff has not benefitted financially from this lawsuit,and never expected to do so.he stated that neither he nor plaintiff have received or will receive any monetary or special damages,sign permits,or other rights from this lawsuit.he told the trial court that it is not possible to quantify the financial value to plaintiff of being treated equally under the law,and the uniform application of the law confers plaintiff with no special advantages in the billboard industry or other tangible financial benefits to its business.
contentions and conclusions 
on appeal,plaintiff contends there is a complete lack of evidence that plaintiff stood to ever gain anything by seeking mandate.plaintiff contends that pecuniary benefits must be direct and certain to disqualify a litigant from obtaining fees.at its core,plaintiff position is that it sought no monetary damages,and therefore its reasonably expected financial benefits when it undertook this litigation were none,too indirect,unascertainable.plaintiff also asserts that the trial court erroneously denied fees on the rationale that plaintiff is in the billboard business and had financial resources to pay lawyers.neither assertion has merit.
the latter contention is plainly mistaken.the trial court discussion at the hearing shows it was well aware of the legal standard applicable to the financial burden requirement namely,whether the litigation imposed a financial burden that was out of proportion to plaintiff individual stake in the matter.plaintiff suggestion that the trial court ruling was based on plaintiff ability to pay or on plaintiff lack of altruistic motives has no support in the record.the court correctly focused on plaintiff objective financial incentives,as whitley directed.whitley,supra,cal th at objective financial incentives and subjective motives may overlap,and indeed sometimes may be indistinguishable,but it is clear from the language and purpose of the statute that only the former is the proper subject of the court inquiry when assessing the financial burden of litigation under section.
nor do we agree with plaintiff contention that its reasonably expected financial benefits when it undertook this litigation were zero,or that the trial court erred in failing to apply the whitley test for weighing costs and benefits.
the test plaintiff cites is a method for weighing costs and benefits that whitley endorsed,quoting with approval from los angeles police protective league city of los angeles d los angeles police protective league.in that case,the court of appeal explai
