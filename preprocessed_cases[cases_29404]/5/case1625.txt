ii.discussion 
sufficiency of the evidence 
the minor contends the evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he engaged in conduct that would constitute first degree residential burglary if committed by an adult.we disagree.
standard of review 
the standard of proof in juvenile proceedings involving criminal acts is the same as the standard in adult criminal trials.citation.in re jose d.in considering the sufficiency of the evidence in a juvenile proceeding,the appellate court must review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment below to determine whether it discloses substantial evidence such that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.we must presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier of fact could reasonably deduce from the evidence citation and we must make all reasonable inferences that support the finding of the juvenile court.citation.in re babak th.substantial evidence is evidence which is reasonable,credible,and of solid value people johnson cal d.
sufficient evidence supports the juvenile court finding 
at the jurisdictional hearing,the prosecutor argued that the minor aided and abetted the residential burglary by standing lookout for the burglar and whistling to alert him as fountaine approached.a person aids and abets the commission of a crime when he or she,acting with knowledge of the unlawful purpose of the perpetrator and the intent or purpose of committing,encouraging,or facilitating the commission of the offense,by act or advice aids,promotes,encourages or instigates,the commission of the crime.people beeman cal d.
the minor does not dispute that the boy who entered the home committed burglary.rather,he argues that his mere presence at the burglary did not constitute aiding and abetting.indeed,mere presence at the scene of a crime which does not itself assist the commission of the crime does not amount to aiding and abetting.caljic pinell superior court of san francisco d.but the evidence in this case is sufficient to support a reasonable inference that the minor here was not merely present at the scene of the crime,but intended to facilitate or encourage the burglary,and engaged in conduct that did so.
among the factors which may be considered in making the determination of aiding and abetting are presence at the scene of the crime,companionship,and conduct before and after the offense.in re lynette d.in addition,flight is one of the factors which is relevant in determining consciousness of guilt.id.at.
fontaine testified that he had previously seen the minor riding his bicycle on his street with the other three boys on the day of the offense,after fontaine entered the backyard of gomes house,the minor stopped his bicycle and waited in front of the same house.furthermore,when the burglar exited gomes home through the front door,the minor was still there waiting for him,together with the other boys who had been on the street.a reasonable trier of fact could infer from this evidence that the boys were companions acting in concert according to a common plan such that the minor had foreknowledge of the burglary and harbored the intent to encourage or facilitate it.
the minor contends he did not engage in any conduct or take any action aiding the burglary.the evidence,however,supports a contrary conclusion.fontaine testified that the minor appeared nervous when fontaine first approached the back of gomes house.at that point,the minor began whistling.a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that the minor was acting as a lookout for the burglar and attempted to alert the burglar to fontaine presence.by protecting a burglar from being caught,a lookout necessarily encourages and facilitates the commission of the offense.such conduct is a textbook example of aiding and abetting.people campbell th.
for these reasons,we find the evidence sufficient to support the juvenile court finding,and the minor claim is without merit.
assessment of attorney fees 
the minor also contends the juvenile court lacked authority to assess attorney fees against him as a minor.he argues that the order must be modified to clarify that his parents are solely responsible for the fees.he also argues that the court erred by failing to make any finding of his ability to pay the fees.
the attorney general argues that the court had the authority to impose the fees because the minor was an adult when the fees were assessed.as to the minor ability to pay the fees,the attorney general contends the eviden
