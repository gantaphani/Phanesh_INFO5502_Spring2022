lorillard tobacco lorillard appeals from the district court order granting attorney fees to isaac engida under the lanham act fee provision,a,and alternatively under section of the colorado revised statutes.we exercise jurisdiction under and,and reverse the award of attorney fees to engida.
background 
lorillard sued engida,who was doing business as i g liquors,for allegedly selling counterfeit newport cigarettes,a lorillard cigarette brand.lorillard sought injunctive relief and damages for alleged violations of the lanham act,and,and also for alleged violations of colorado common law of unfair competition,colorado deceptive trade practices statute,and colorado statute governing service mark infringement.a.the district court granted lorillard request for a temporary restraining order tro and for an ex parte seizure order on february.when the marshals initially attempted to execute the seizure order,they found the doors to engida store locked.it was during regular business hours,the store open sign was lighted,and its lights and a television were on.the officers waited for some time,but eventually left.the next day,a subsequent search of engida store uncovered no newport or otherwise.however,the search did locate business records indicating that engida had purchased newport cigarettes from an unknown source outside of ordinary distribution channels.
on february,the district court dissolved the tro and denied lorillard motion for a preliminary injunction at a hearing without issuing a written opinion.at that same hearing,the district court offered to try to find an attorney to represent engida and on march,the district court appointed two attorneys to represent engida on a pro bono basis.immediately following the february hearing,the district court sua sponte issued an order directing lorillard to show cause why its counterfeiting case should not be dismissed.lorillard responded to the order on march,and on july,the district court vacated that order.on january,we affirmed the district court denial of the preliminary injunction,see lorillard tobacco engida,app x cir,and a little more than two weeks later we denied lorillard petition for rehearing,see lorillard tobacco engida,slip op.at order den.pet.for reh g,dated.
then,on april,lorillard filed a petition for certiorari,which the supreme court denied.see lorillard tobacco engida.during these appellate proceedings,the underlying case was stayed.specifically,after the tenth circuit denied relief,lorillard filed unopposed two motions to reschedule status conferences,which the district court granted.following the supreme court denial of the petition for certiorari,neither party sought to get the litigation back on track.
after the case returned to the district court but before engida filed an answer,lorillard filed a notice to dismiss the case without prejudice and without a court order pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a a i on november.in response to the notice,engida moved for an award of attorney fees.the district court awarded engida attorney fees pursuant to a of the lanham act and section of the colorado revised statutes,but limited the award to those fees incurred by engida in defending against lorillard unnecessary and vexatious appeals from the court denial of its request for a preliminary injunction.at.lorillard filed its first notice of appeal from this order.the parties then stipulated that the fees and costs authorized by the district court january order were,and the district court memorialized that agreement in an order entered on august.lorillard filed a second notice of appeal from that order.the cases were consolidated for procedural purposes on appeal.
discussion 
standard of review 
the parties disagree regarding what standard of review we should apply to the district court award of attorney fees under the lanham act.lorillard argues that de novo review applies,while engida argues that review applies.we have previously made clear that w e review a district court decision on whether to award attorney fees under the lanham act for abuse of discretion,but we review de novo the district court application of the legal principles underlying that decision.ass of prof l baseball leagues,very minor leagues,cir see also united phosphorus,midland fumigant,cir stating that in reviewing fee award under the lanham act u nderlying factual findings will only be upset when clearly erroneous.however,a district court statutory interpretation or legal analysis which provides the basis for the fee award is reviewable de novo.quoting bishop equinox int l,cir.
under the abuse of discretion standard,a trial court decision will not be disturbed unless the appellate court has a definite and firm conviction that the lower court made a clear error of judgment or exceeded the bounds of permissible choice in the circumstances.fed.deposit ins.rocket oil,cir.elaborating on that standard,we have stated a district court abuses its discretion where it commits a legal error or relies on clearly erroneous factual findings,or where there is no rational basis in the evidence for its ruling.davis mineta,cir citation omitted.
we apply this same standard of review in determining the propriety of the district court award of attorney fees under section of the colorado revised statutes.engida does not dispute that the applicable standard of review is abuse of discretion.but he relies on colorado cases in advocating for this position.see aplee.br.at citing consumer crusade,clarion mortgage capital,archer farmer.in reviewing state law awards of attorney fees,however,it has been our consistent practice to look to our own precedent on this purely procedural,the applicable standard of review see,hofer unum life ins.of,cir scott liquid gold,lexington ins,cir pub.serv.of cont l cas,cir.pipeline lario,cir although erie dictates we apply kansas law to the merits of this case,as a matter of independent federal procedure we utilize the normal federal standards of appellate review to examine the district court decision process.engida has offered us no reason why we should deviate from this settled practice.therefore,even though this matter would be very unlikely to materially affect our analysis of the district court fee award under section we decline engida tacit invitation to rely on colorado law and,instead,look to our own precedent for guidance concerning the appropriate standard of review and the parameters of that standard,as described above 
attorney fee award under the lanham act 
the portion of the lanham act at issue in this appeal reads as follows the court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.a.therefore,in order to uphold the district court award under the lanham act,we must conclude that the district court properly determined that engida was a prevailing party and properly found this to be an exceptional case.because we conclude that engida was not a prevailing party,the district court fee award under the lanham act must be reversed 
the district court conclusion that engida was a prevailing party is a legal question that this court reviews de novo.holder,cir holding status is a legal question reviewed de novo under the equal access to justice act also bailey mississippi,cir in the context of fee awards under,holding that every circuit to address the issue has determined that the characterization of status for awards under statutes is a legal question subject to de novo review.
lorillard argues that engida was not a prevailing party because lorillard voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice and without a court order under federal rule of civil procedure a a i.under the facts of this case,we agree.under rule a a i,a plaintiff may dismiss an action voluntarily before the defendant files an answer or a motion for summary judgment.schmier mcdonald llc,cir.voluntary dismissal of an action ordinarily does not create a prevailing party because in order to create a prevailing party there must be a judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties.buckhannon bd.care home.dep t of health human,see also rfr,century steps,holding voluntary dismissal under rule a a i does not bestow prevailing party status because the action may be and it is not judicially sanctioned.under the plain language of rule a a i,a plaintiff may dismiss the action without a court order no judicial sanction is required.see.a a i.
in determining that engida was a prevailing party,the district court pointed to engida defeat of the preliminary injunction before the district court,the tenth circuit court of appeals,and the united states supreme court,and also to what the district court perceived to be the preclusive effect of this defeat in future proceedings.however,the district court denial of injunctive relief was based on lorillard failure to carry the burden of proof on the likelihood of irreparable harm and the balance of harms,not on lorillard failure to establish that it was likely to prevail on the merits.see.at at th e preliminary injunction hearing,i reviewed the evidence obtained pursuant to the february,search and held that plaintiff had failed to meet its burden of showing it would suffer irreparable harm if an injunction did not issue.see also engida,app x at discussing lorillard failure to show it would suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction and its failure to show that the threatened injury to it outweighed any harm that would be caused to engida as a result of the injunction.
we have previously made clear that a preliminary injunction that does not provide a plaintiff with relief on the merits of his claim can not serve as the basis for prevailing party status.biodiversity conservation alliance stem,cir.if a plaintiff who is granted a injunction can not be a prevailing party,see,it logically and ineluctably follows that a defendant who defeats an injunction can not be a prevailing party if the denial similarly is based on grounds.
engida argues,however,that he in fact did materially alter the legal relationship between the parties and achieved success because the district court rejected some portion of the plaintiff claim,and consequently,he was allowed to proceed as before the suit was filed.however,this argument does not address lorillard contention that the denial of the preliminary injunction was not a decision.because the district court granted him no relief,engida can not demonstrate that he was a prevailing party.
engida cites maine school administrative district v,cir,in support of his argument that a defendant who defeats the imposition of a preliminary injunction can be a prevailing party.in maine school administrative district,a school district filed suit against the parents of a disabled child and sought a tro and preliminary injunction prohibiting the parents from using the stay put provisions of the individuals with disabilities education act,j,to keep their child in a mainstream school while an administrative review of his placement was being conducted.id.at.when the district court denied the tro,the school district voluntarily dismissed its complaint and the parents asserted that they were entitled to attorney fees and costs.id.at.the district court denied the parents requested fees on the basis that they were not prevailing parties.id.on appeal,the first circuit reversed the district court and concluded that the parents attorney fees request should be granted because they were in fact prevailing parties who had defeated the school district suit on the merits.id.at.
engida argues that his claim for status is as solid as that of the parents in maine school administrative district.aplee.br.at.in making this argument,engida overlooks the many material distinctions between his case and maine school administrative district.for example,in that case,the quest for injunctive relief was the sole object of the plaintiff suit,at noting that injunctive relief was the raison of the school district suit and the parties legal relationship was materially altered by the denial of the preliminary injunction because the injunction was denied on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to show that it would prevail on the merits,see id.at because the district court denied injunctive relief on the basis that the school district had not adduced sufficient proof,it is readily evident that the appellants successfully defended the suit on the merits.see id.by defending,the appellants not only deprived the school district of the benefit that it sought in bringing suit but also blocked it from implementing a course of action inimical to the disabled student interests.the appellants victory was,therefore,material.
in contrast,the district court denial of lorillard request for a preliminary injunction was not.the district court itself explained in its order granting engida fee request that it denied the injunction on the basis that lorillard had failed to show irreparable harm.in addition,lorillard request for injunctive relief was not the sole object of its suit for example,it also sought damages.although we need not definitively opine on the subject here,engida may well be correct that a defendant who defeats the imposition of a preliminary injunction is not categorically excluded as a matter of law from status.however,we conclude in this case that engida is not a prevailing party because he can not show that the district court granted him any relief.specifically,the district court order did not afford engida relief from the merits of the claims against him and did not provide a alteration in the parties relationship.consequently,engida was not a prevailing party with respect to the district court order.the appellate rulings of our court and the supreme court that,respectively,affirmed and left in place this denial also did not make engida a prevailing party because these rulings did not judicially alter the parties legal relationship or provide relief.
finally,the district court determined that engida was the prevailing party due to what it perceived to be the preclusive effect of the denial of the preliminary injunction in any subsequent litigation.however,t he injunction standard of probable success on the merits is not equivalent to actual success on the merits.arapahoe tribe hodel,cir.consequently,a party claim to have succeeded at the preliminary injunction stage does not necessarily transform a party into a prevailing party.it is of course literally true that every preliminary injunction effects some judicially sanctioned change in the parties legal relationship.if that were all the supreme court decision in buckhannon requires,then every recipient of a preliminary injunction becomes a prevailing party eligible for an attorneys fee award.cheyenne tribe jackson,cir.following the district court rationale,every denial of a preliminary injunction would similarly make each defendant a prevailing party.that rationale ignores the fact that a preliminary injunction that grants only temporary relief pendente lite is not,without more,a judicially sanctioned material alteration of the parties legal relationship.id.at.as previously discussed,to be a prevailing party on the basis of a preliminary injunction requires relief on the merits,biodiversity,at,and because this is not the case with engida,he is not a prevailing party and therefore is not entitled to fees under the lanham act.
attorney fee award under section of the colorado revised statutes 
alternatively,the district court granted attorney fees to engida on the basis of section of the colorado revised statutes,which reads in part 
in any civil action of any nature commenced or appealed in any court of record in this state,the court shall award,by way of judgment or separate order,reasonable attorney fees against any attorney or party who has brought or defended a civil action,either in whole or in part,that the court determines lacked substantial justification.
the court shall assess attorney fees if,upon the motion of any party or the court itself,it finds that an attorney or party brought or defended an action,or any part thereof,that lacked substantial justification or that the action,or any part thereof,was interposed for delay or harassment or if it finds that an attorney or party unnecessarily expanded the proceeding by other improper conduct as used in this article,lacked substantial justification means substantially frivolous,substantially groundless,or substantially vexatious.
while section clearly may apply to claims brought in the district of colorado,see harrison luse,aff,cir,lorillard argues that because it voluntarily dismissed the case,the district court lacked jurisdiction to award the attorney fees under section.contrary to lorillard argument,the district court need not have subject matter jurisdiction to award attorney fees pursuant to section.see consumer crusade,at discussing willy coastal,sequa cooper,cir a voluntary dismissal without prejudice under rule a i does not deprive a district court of its authority to award costs.
a similar issue has been considered by the colorado court of appeals regarding section.in consumer crusade,that court held that the trial court did not lack jurisdiction to enter an award of attorney fees under section.in so holding,the court relied on the supreme court holding in willy coastal.see id.at.in willy,the supreme court held that the federal district court had jurisdiction to impose rule sanctions even though it was later found to lack subject matter jurisdiction because the complaint removed to federal court raised no claims arising under federal law.willy,at a final determination of lack of jurisdiction of a case in a federal court,of course,precludes further adjudication of it.but such a determination does not automatically wipe out all proceedings had in the district court at a time when the district court operated under the misapprehension that it had jurisdiction.
based on its reading of willy,the colorado court of appeals analogized rule sanctions to attorney fees awarded under section.the court explained that b ecause section sanctions are analogous to rule sanctions,we conclude that,like rule sanctions,section sanctions may be imposed despite a court lack of subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the underlying merits of the action.id.at.we adopt that reasoning here in addressing as a matter of federal law this jurisdictional question.although lorillard had voluntarily dismissed its case,the district court still had jurisdiction to consider collateral issues including an award of counsel fees.cooter gell hartmarx,holding that nothing in the language of rule a i,rule,or other statute or federal rule terminates a district court authority to impose sanctions after such a dismissal.it is well established that a federal court may consider collateral issues after an action is no longer pending,including an award of attorney fees.id.
having established that the district court had jurisdiction to issue the award,we nevertheless conclude that the district court abused its discretion in awarding attorney fees to engida under colorado law.more specifically,we conclude that there is no rational basis in the record for the district court fee award and,consequently,the court committed a clear error of judgment in granting engida motion for fees.see davis,at fed.deposit ins,at.under section,the district court may award reasonable attorney fees against any attorney or party who has brought a civil action that the court determines lacked substantial justification.an award of appellate attorney fees pursuant to section is appropriate only if the appeal itself lacks substantial justification.padilla ghuman,emphasis added citing.accord front range home enhancements,stowell.
an action lacks substantial justification if it is substantially frivolous,substantially groundless,or substantially vexatious.an appeal lacks substantial justification and is substantially frivolous under when the appellant briefs fail to set forth a coherent assertion of error,supported by legal authority.giguere sjs family,see also ritchey mccreath in re estate of mccreath,wl,at.a vexatious claim or defense is one brought or maintained in bad faith.bad faith may include conduct that is arbitrary,vexatious,abusive,or stubbornly litigious,and may also include conduct aimed at unwarranted delay or disrespectful of truth and accuracy.zivian,emphasis added accord stowell,at.
further,a claim lacks substantial justification if it lacks supporting evidence or the party pursing the claim can not make a rational argument in its support based on the evidence or governing law.see consumer crusade,at holding that if a party persists in pursuing a claim,despite knowing that it lacks admissible evidence to support that claim,the claim may properly be characterized as substantially groundless,and the party conduct,as substantially vexatious citation omitted zivian,at rejecting a request for appellate attorney fees under section,noting that a claim is frivolous if the proponent has no rational argument to support it based on the evidence or the law and that a claim is groundless if there is no credible evidence to support the allegations in the complaint.
in support of its fee award,the district court explained that even if attorney fees were not appropriate under the lanham act,engida would still be entitled to attorney fees under colorado law.at.the district court stressed that it viewed lorillard repeated appeals of the denial of the preliminary injunction as unnecessary and vexatious.id.thus,lorillard decision to appeal the denial of the preliminary injunction to the tenth circuit and then to seek certiorari relief from the united states supreme court,in the district court view,justified the fee award.id.in that vein,engida argues vigorously on appeal that lorillard repeated appeals served no legitimate purpose,were maintained to annoy and harass engida,and were the epitome of stubbornly litigious.aplee.br.at.based upon our review of the record,however,we conclude that nothing supports the district court adverse findings concerning lorillard conduct.
a brief review of salient aspects of this litigation procedural lends support to this point because it reveals no unwarranted delay.on february,lorillard filed its initial complaint in this case along with a motion for a tro.the district court granted lorillard motion the next day,february.in a hearing on february,the district court dissolved the tro and denied lorillard request for a preliminary injunction.less than thirty days later,on march,lorillard timely filed its notice of appeal as to the district court denial of a preliminary injunction.on june,lorillard filed a motion to stay the proceedings in the district court or for a scheduling conference,and on june,filed a motion for default judgment because engida still had not filed an answer to lorillard initial complaint.on july,the district court granted the motion to stay the proceedings,denied the motion for default,and vacated its order.
on january,this court issued its order and judgment affirming the district court ruling,concluding that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying lorillard request for a preliminary injunction.we denied lorillard petition for rehearing on january and issued the mandate in this matter on february.on february,engida filed a motion with the district court for a regarding a scheduling conference,and on march,lorillard filed its first unopposed motion to continue the conference.the next day,the district court granted lorillard unopposed motion and rescheduled the hearing to may.on april,lorillard filed its second unopposed motion to stay the proceedings,and the next day,the district court granted this motion to continue,thereby vacating the may status hearing and staying the proceedings.
less than ten days later,on april,lorillard filed its petition for certiorari with the supreme court.the supreme court denied that petition two months later,on june.neither party moved the district court to lift the stay or to enter a scheduling order.then,approximately four months later,on november,lorillard filed its notice of dismissal without prejudice.at this point,there still was no scheduling order in would have imposed deadlines and moved the litigation engida had yet to file an answer.
notwithstanding engida stubbornly litigious characterization of lorillard conduct,this of events does not support his argument that lorillard en
