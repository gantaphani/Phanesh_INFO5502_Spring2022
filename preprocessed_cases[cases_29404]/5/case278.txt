after multiple proffer sessions and negotiations concerning a possible deferred prosecution or dismissal,jeffrey schneider was tried in on charges of fraud.despite the testimony of several witnesses that schneider was involved in the fraudulent scheme,he was acquitted.schneider then moved for attorney fees and expenses under the hyde amendment,which permits such an award where the position of the united states was vexatious,frivolous,or in bad faith,stat,reprinted in,historical and statutory notes.the district court denied the motion,and the instant appeal ensued.
this case presents questions of first impression for the second circuit.specifically,we are called upon to analyze when a court may deny a hyde amendment motion for attorney fees and expenses,and when an evidentiary hearing or other compulsion of evidence is warranted under the hyde amendment.
background 
in january,jeffrey schneider was charged in a indictment with conspiracy to defraud the government,in violation of,and wire fraud,in violation of.the charges stemmed from a dollar fraud scheme by principals and officers of island mortgage network,imn,a mortgage bank in melville,new york.
a.the scheme 
evidence introduced at trial supported the following.imn originated and arranged funding for residential loans.warehouse lenders usually funded of the total loan amount,and imn was supposed to fund the remaining portion,also referred to as a haircut.the undisclosed principal of imn,paul skulsky,a convicted felon,conceived of a scheme whereby imn monies would not be used to fund the haircut.instead,funds that had been deposited into escrow accounts by the warehouse lenders to fund the loans were illegally diverted to pay imn operating expenses and to fund imn contributions to the loans.this was achieved by taking advantage of the time between when the warehouse lenders money was deposited in imn escrow accounts and when the checks drawn off of those funds would clear.money sitting in the escrow account during this time,known as the float,was used to fund imn haircut contribution.cindy eisele,the chief financial officer at imn,diverted the float into the operating accounts at skulsky direction.
joseph casuccio,a certified public accountant and partner with the accounting firm of werblin,casuccio moses werblin,was imn independent outside auditor.casuccio supervised werblin accounting team that prepared imn periodic audits and statements from until.schneider,a cpa who joined werblin in late,was a member of that team.after casuccio discovered discrepancies in imn books and questioned skulsky about them,skulsky expressed his desire not to disclose the debts that had been created by the diversion of funds from the escrow accounts.casuccio then conceived of a plan to disguise the growing deficit in the escrow accounts on imn statements by reporting it in a footnote as a debt owed by related parties to the skulsky trust.although the skulsky trust was a genuine entity,it had minimal assets.
in late,with the escrow account liability having grown would reach million by decided to withdraw as imn independent auditor.skulsky asked casuccio to find a replacement accounting firm and casuccio asked schneider if he knew of a firm that might take imn as a client.in december schneider contacted aaron chaitovsky,a partner at citrin cooperman citrin,where schneider had worked prior to joining werblin,and proposed that citrin take on the imn account.once citrin was formally engaged in january,schneider and his two audit assistants remained at imn to assist with the transition and help close out the books,although according to schneider,casuccio specifically told the werblin team that they were not to be engaged in the practice of auditing.during this transition,schneider discussed with citrin accountants the debt owed to the escrow account,and the use of the skulsky trust to disguise the debt.
eventually,the united states attorney office and the fbi began an investigation.casuccio,eisele,skulsky and others engaged in proffer sessions with the united states attorney,pled guilty to fraud charges,and agreed to cooperate.prior to his testimony at schneider trial,the government apparently granted chaitovsky a deferred prosecution agreement.schneider maintained his innocence.
proceedings 
assistant attorney jodi avergun ausa oversaw the investigation into imn illegal activities from july until january.schneider and his counsel,james druker,agreed to a proffer session on december.prior to the session,avergun faxed druker a copy of a proffer agreement.druker informed avergun that it contained some objectionable language,and according to druker,avergun stated that she would address his concerns at the meeting.
the december,proffer session was contentious.the following is druker account.initially,he asked avergun for confirmation of what he had been told by an fbi case schneider was considered a fact witness.avergun responded that he was a target or subject.druker objected again to the proffer agreement avergun answered that the language was required by the second circuit.druker stated that he could not allow schneider to participate under those terms,and then asked if schneider would be a candidate for immunity avergun replied that he could not be so considered unless she spoke to him first.she refused druker offer of an attorney proffer.avergun stated that she would subpoena schneider to appear before the grand jury,and druker asserted that,if subpoenaed,schneider would assert his fifth amendment privilege.druker claims that avergun retorted,if he takes the fifth amendment,we will indict him.after an additional acrimonious exchange,followed by avergun grabb ing the proffer agreement from druker hand and again point ing to the door,avergun addressed schneider,stating,i want to say one thing to you,schneider.i think that your attorney is making a very big mistake here.druker interjected that it was inappropriate for avergun to address his client directly.later that day,druker faxed a letter memorializing his memory of the meeting to avergun,stating that he would accept service of the grand jury subpoena on schneider behalf.he also wrote a letter to the chief ausa in central islip,george stamboulidis,enclosing the letter he had sent to avergun.
on december,avergun responded to druker letter,stating that fbi agents had left her office on december with the subpoena to serve on schneider.she termed druker account of the proffer session incorrect in several respects.she maintained that she had not threatened to prosecute schneider if he took the fifth amendment before the grand jury,but that any prosecution would stem from aiding and abetting mail fraud and securities fraud in which he appears to have engaged.avergun further claimed that she had told druker that if schneider did not wish to proffer,she would subpoena him and that an indictment could follow.she added that she was certain that she did not say that an indictment would follow as a result of schneider asserting his right against.id.emphasis in original.she named two cases,without citation,united states fagey and united states raymond cruz,as authority for the language used in the proffer agreement,and apologized for speaking directly to schneider 
apparently,the subpoena was eventually served on druker rather than schneider.on january,druker wrote to avergun inquiring whether schneider personal appearance before the grand jury would be necessary,given that he would assert his fifth amendment privilege.receiving no response,druker wrote to stamboulidis,with the same request.schneider grand jury appearance was then cancelled.
the case remained dormant for almost a year.then,in january,druker wrote the new chief ausa in central islip,joseph conway,observing that the case appeared to be heating up again,and requesting a conference.on january,druker met with avergun and jonathan sack,the chief of the criminal division,and was told that he would receive an answer shortly concerning schneider possible indictment.on january,schneider was indicted shortly thereafter,avergun left to assume a justice department post and new prosecutors were assigned to the imn case.
on july,schneider participated in a proffer session attended by conway,ausas gary brown and demetri jones,an fbi agent,and an sec attorney.according to druker,schneider told the government exactly what he later testified to at trial.druker maintains that after hearing schneider version of events,the government attorneys agreed that the prosecution should not go forward,and the parties agreed to pursue an adjournment of the july trial date so that the prosecutors could seek permission to dismiss or grant a deferred prosecution.druker further asserts the prosecutors later informed him they drafted a memorandum urging these options on their superiors.the government eventually decided to pursue the case against schneider,however.the trial lasted from october.
trial testimony 
skulsky testified that he discussed with schneider imn use of the float to pay the haircut and operating expenses.moreover,skulsky testified that,during,when schneider was doing the internal auditing for the company,imn set aside an office for him to work in,and he worked in the conference room next to skulsky office as well.
casuccio testimony also supported the case for schneider knowledge of the fraud.casuccio testified that schneider was in attendance at a meeting where the imn project was explained to chaitovsky.at this meeting,casuccio wanted the new auditing firm to understand that there were problems at island mortgage,and so he said to chaitovsky that island was not paying its two percent haircut on the closing of the mortgage,and that those funds were winding up in island account when the loans sold,and that obligation to the escrow account,attorney account,whichever,which they were all called,were then assigned to the skulsky trust and it was reflected on the financial statements as a debt to the skulsky trust.casuccio asserted as well that he explained to schneider that the liability due the skulsky trust rose out of the two percent haircut,and that he and schneider were trying to ascertain whether or not that two percent could in fact have grown to the number that it grew to and could the float have been that high.he and schneider performed calculations to attempt to determine the amount of the float.
chaitovsky related a discussion in which schneider explained to him the mechanics of how imn avoided its obligation to fund the haircut.chaitovsky testified that early on in the audit,schneider explained that the two percent of the mortgage not funded by the warehouse lender is originally recorded as a haircut payable,which is the amount they are supposed to fund.apparently still explaining what schneider told him,chaitovsky continued and then they immediately make an entry that removes the haircut payable and shows it as amount due the skulsky trust.so i understood that the skulsky trust those haircut payables that they were funding,among other things,but that was the majority of what was in there.chaitovsky also described a meeting that he,schneider,and casuccio attended,where chaitovsky questioned why are all these escrow agents letting you not pay this amount that you owe.chaitovsky stated that at this meeting,the liability to the skulsky trust was explained as a net amount pretty much owed to the escrow agents that the skulsky trust is taking on.
henry dimeglio,a junior accountant from citrin,testified that he,schneider,and another citrin accountant had a discussion about how the liabilities to either the escrow agents or the loan warehouses could grow to such an enormous size without requiring somebody screaming for repayment.
schneider testified in his own defense,denying any knowledge of or participation in the fraud.schneider said that,upon learning of the skulsky trust account,he went to casuccio,who explained to him falsely that the skulsky trust was loaning to imn the money necessary to fund the haircut.according to schneider,casuccio stated that the skulsky trust beneficiaries and the skulsky trust itself owned large stakes in imn,and this explained their willingness to extend credit to imn they anticipated being repaid when the company was sold.schneider testified that casuccio explanation,together with his statement that casuccio would be auditing the skulsky trust account,satisfied schneider that he did not need to pursue the matter further.schneider maintained he was never aware that the money to fund the haircut,instead of coming from the skulsky trust,was in fact coming from the float on the escrow accounts.according to schneider,at the initial meeting with casuccio,chaitovsky,and schneider to discuss transferring the imn account to citrin,the skulsky trust was brought up,but the possibility of fraud or improprieties was never mentioned.
patrick lyons,a werblin accountant,and monica stasko,eisele assistant,testified that they were unaware of any illegal activity at imn or any participation by schneider in the meetings that took place in and among skuslky,casuccio,and eisele.stasko testified that eisele,skulsky,skulsky brother,and casuccio were part of an inner circle that schneider was not a part of.
schneider was acquitted after jury deliberations lasting three and one half hours.
proceedings 
in november,schneider moved for attorney fees and expenses pursuant to the hyde amendment,alleging that the government had based its decision to prosecute him not on the evidence,but on avergun animus,which arose from schneider refusal to sign the proffer agreement and to cooperate with prosecutors and that the prosecution continued out of personal pique and in retaliation for schneider lawful exercise of his constitutional rights.he also asserted that the government had not properly investigated the case,relied on witnesses who were not credible,and gave a deferred prosecution to a more culpable participant,chaitovsky,to secure his cooperative testimony,all out of its vindictive desire to harm schneider.in addition,schneider requested that the record be expanded to have the court review,in camera,the memorandum written by the ausas who had evaluated his case and who had offered an opinion on whether it should be tried,and to hold a hearing so those ausas could be.
in august,the government opposed the motion,submitting affidavits from avergun and sack.in avergun affidavit,she stated the following.as a result of her research into the case,she had concluded that schneider was criminally liable for his role in auditing the books of imn and in managing the transition of the imn account from werblin to citrin cooperman.moreover,she asserted that her decision to present an indictment to the grand jury had nothing to do with schneider choice not to participate in the proffer session rather,she honestly believed that the government witnesses and documents established that schneider knew or should have known that the accounting records submitted by imn were materially false and misleading.she further stated that,after leaving the eastern district united states attorney office in january,she was not in touch with anyone from that office regarding the schneider prosecution until july when ausa jones informed her that schneider had participated in a proffer session and was seeking dismissal or deferred prosecution.she offered her opinion to jones and to sack that such a disposition would be inappropriate.though she continues to believe that schneider was guilty of the offenses charged,she never harbored any animus toward him and never acted out of bad faith.
in his affidavit,sack averred that,after discussing the case with druker,he determined that an indictment should be presented to the grand jury.after avergun left the office,he communicated with the ausas handling the case,as well as with avergun,in order to determine the appropriate course of action.he then decided that the case should proceed to trial based on his belief that the evidence showed that schneider was guilty of the offenses charged.he asserted that he never harbored any animosity toward schneider,nor had he acted out of bad faith,and expressed his view that avergun was pursuing the prosecution because she sincerely believed in schneider guilt and that the evidence was sufficient to establish his guilt at trial.
in a thorough memorandum and order entered on november,the district court denied schneider motion.united states schneider,d.the district court found that schneider had failed to prove,by a preponderance of the evidence,that his prosecution was frivolous,vexatious,or in bad faith within the meaning of the hyde amendment.specifically,the court found that the case was not frivolous because government witnesses had implicated schneider in the crimes and,if their testimony was believed,he would have been convicted.the case was not vexatious because the government had more than adequate evidence to establish each element of the crimes and the jury credibility determinations did not undermine the legal merit or factual foundation of the prosecution.in addition,the prosecution was not undertaken in bad faith because the instances cited by schneider as evidence of avergun vindictiveness were,for the most part,not germane to the analysis.
with regard to schneider discovery request,the district court was skeptical of the government position that the hyde amendment did not authorize compelled production of privileged government documents for review,and assumed that the review may be undertaken if the appropriate threshold showing has been established.the district court found that schneider had not met that threshold.
schneider filed a notice of appeal on november.
this circuit has not previously interpreted the hyde amendment.it was enacted as part of,the billion commerce,justice and state,the judiciary,and related agencies appropriations act of,and is found as a statutory note to.united states gilbert,cir.it provides 
during fiscal year and in any fiscal year thereafter,the court,in any criminal case other than a case in which the defendant is represented by assigned counsel paid for by the public pending on or after the date of the enactment of this act,may award to a prevailing party,other than the united states,a reasonable attorney fee and other litigation expenses,where the court finds that the position of the united states was vexatious,frivolous,or in bad faith,unless the court finds that special circumstances make such an award unjust.such awards shall be granted pursuant to the procedures and limitations but not the burden of proof provided for an award under section of title,united states code.to determine whether or not to award fees and costs under this section,the court,for good cause shown,may receive evidence ex parte and in camera which shall include the submission of classified evidence or evidence that reveals or might reveal the identity of an informant or undercover agent or matters occurring before a grand jury and evidence or testimony so received shall be kept under seal.fees and other expenses awarded under this provision to a party shall be paid by the agency over which the party prevails from any funds made available to the agency by appropriation.no new appropriations shall be made as a result of this provision.
we first consider schneider claim for attorney fees and expenses,and then analyze his claim that the hyde amendment required the district court to review certain government material ex parte and in camera.
claims for attorney fees and expenses 
schneider argues on appeal that his prosecution was vexatious,frivolous,and in bad faith mainly because the evidence of his guilt was insufficient.he contends that the primary witnesses testifying against him lacked credibility.he also asserts that the government failure to dismiss the prosecution despite the dismissal recommendation of the attorneys assigned to the case,and avergun behavior relating to the proffer session,including her alleged threat to indict schneider if he asserted his fifth amendment rights before the grand jury,only strengthen his argument that the government should be held liable under the hyde amendment.
we are called on to interpret and apply statutory language providing that the court may award to a prevailing party,other than the united states,a reasonable attorney fee and other litigation expenses,where the court finds that the position of the united states was vexatious,frivolous,or in bad faith,stat.at bottom,our task is to be faithful to legislative meaning,consistent with the legislative purposes that guided congress in enacting the penalize government for prosecutorial abuses and to deter such inappropriate conduct.in this case,we need not parse the precise meaning of the words vexatious,frivolous and in bad faith because,as will be developed below,schneider case clearly falls short of the type of abusive prosecutorial conduct that would trigger hyde amendment liability.it may be that some future case may require such an exegetical exercise,but we need not and do not engage in it here.that said,we note that the dictionary definitions of the particular words at issue are consonant with our determination here that the hyde amendment does not provide schneider the relief he seeks 
we can not accept schneider argument that the government prosecution of him was vexatious,frivolous,or in bad faith because of the insufficiency of the evidence.the government witnesses here directly implicated schneider in the crime.chaitovsky testified that schneider gave him a virtual primer on how imn avoided its obligation to fund the haircut skulsky declared that he discussed with schneider imn use of the float to fund loans,and casuccio stated that schneider was in attendance at a meeting where casuccio explained the essence of the fraudulent scheme to chaitovksky.indeed,defense counsel acknowledged as much in the defense summation if you believe casuccio that they were all talking about the float and that he told schneider in some words or manner that there was fraud going on and if you believe him beyond a reasonable doubt,then you are going to convict schneider.at oral argument,counsel for schneider again admitted that the thrust of schneider hyde amendment argument rested on the credibility of the witnesses arrayed against him.of course,these witnesses had shortcomings skulsky had a prior criminal record,and skulsky,casuccio,and chaitovsky each played a central role in the dishonest scheme they were discussing.however,as the district court pointed out,the government is often saddled with imperfect witnesses,requiring juries to sift through and evaluate the testimony despite these shortcomings.d at.in this case,the shortcomings of witnesses who directly implicated schneider in the crime are inadequate to show that the government lacked a reasonable legal basis for prosecution.
ultimately,schneider argument concerning the sufficiency of the evidence appears to us to be based on the which he extrapolates backwards and concludes that the case had no merit.however,as the ninth circuit has remarked,
t he trial process is fluid and involves multiple strategic and evidentiary decisions,many of which can not be predicted at the outset,and many of which depend on contested evidentiary and other trial to mention the uncertainties associated with witnesses testimony.the trial process also implicates judgment,strategy,and prosecutorial discretion.this is not to say that prosecutors may operate without limits,but simply that the test for awarding fees under the hyde amendment should not be an exercise in hindsight 
sherburne,at.an acquittal,without more,will not lead to a successful hyde amendment claim,as it was congress intent to limit hyde amendment awards to cases of affirmative prosecutorial misconduct rather than simply any prosecution which failed.knott,at.similarly,the facts that the jury was out for only three and a half hours,and that schneider counsel informs us certain jurors expressed to him anger that schneider had been prosecuted,do not alter our view that the government had multiple witnesses directly implicating schneider.
schneider posits that the government bad faith was demonstrated by the events surrounding the proffer session,during which avergun allegedly became incensed when counsel told schneider not to engage in the proffer session advanced the questionable claim that certain language in the proffer agreement was mandated
