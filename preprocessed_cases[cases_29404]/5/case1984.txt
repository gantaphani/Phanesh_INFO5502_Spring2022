background and procedural summary 
discussion 
ii.the appeal by olson and seidenberg issues pertaining to the nomination deadline,bylaws claims,and other discovery and damages matters 
the claim by olson and seidenberg that the auto club nominations missed the deadline is without merit.bylaw a required the nominating committee to submit its list of nominees to the secretary before the december,nomination deadline,and the committee submitted the list on november.the contention that the list of nominees represented action by unanimous consent,which could not be counted until the last committee member signed,is belied by the evidence,which reveals that the committee did not act by unanimous consent.in fact,the committee finalized its recommendations at a teleconference meeting on november.
regarding the contention that the court erred in approving unspecified bylaw amendments,the opening brief fails to present the issues with sufficient analysis or argument likewise,the mere assertion without argument that the court erred in refusing to rule on claimed violations and in finding that the auto club interpretation was based on the bylaws plain meaning,does not preserve the complaint for appeal.a contention made without a serious attempt to support its argument is deemed waived.aicco,insurance of north america th,d see also people turner cal th,fn,d.
the contention that the trial court erred in striking the compensatory damage claim and the punitive damage claim is also unavailing.we acknowledge that proxy expenses are logical damages haas wieboldt stores,cir,and that punitive damages are recoverable see courtesy ambulance service superior court th,d.however,olson and seidenberg have not challenged the finding that the changes ordered by the court would not have affected the outcome of the election.absent any causation,the compensatory damage claim was properly stricken.as to punitive damages,olson and seidenberg have simply failed to argue the requisite elements necessary to establish an exemplary damages claim.see.
also without merit is the contention that the trial court erroneously denied certain discovery on constitutional grounds when only statutory privileges are recognized.although california accepts only statutory privileges,evidence code section defines statutes as including constitutional provisions.the argument is thus frivolous.
proposed restrictions on campaign spending and campaign speech 
olson and seidenberg contend that the general reasonableness requirement for election procedures in section,subdivision a means that the auto club must limit its campaign spending to reasonable and proportionate amounts in relation to the amount spent by the petition nominees,and must include opposition campaign statements and biographies in auto club proxy solicitations.they also urge the trial that court should have restricted the time during which the auto club could campaign,and that the auto club board violated its fiduciary duties in authorizing campaign spending.however,these claims are meritless,as they are inconsistent with the statutory scheme and misconstrue the board fiduciary duties.
as aptly discussed by the trial court,the question of whether it is unfair and unreasonable for a board to spend money to elect nominees it supports has been dealt with by the legislature in section,which permits spending on elections with the restriction that such expenditures are approved by the board.even though the auto club directors will likely continue to have an advantage,the matter has been debated and the legislature has never modified the statute on corporate spending in elections.
regarding the amount of spending,campaign spending decisions are subject to the fiduciary duty standard in section see,stating that governs the duties of directors as to any acts or omissions in connection with the election of directors,rather than any proportionate spending limits urged by olson and seidenberg.after directors have made a reasonable investigation,they must act in what they in good faith believe is in the best interests of the corporation,subd.a.moreover,no arbitrary campaign spending limits and no restrictions on the timing of campaign advocacy are imposed by the safe harbor elections procedures.see.
the auto club asserts that it need not include opposition statements in any letters supporting its nominees.section,one of the safe harbor provisions,states what the legislature has determined is a reasonable equal space requirement,and it refers by its terms to a corporation publishing any material soliciting a vote and to the issue of the publication by the corporation,which the trial court has properly interpreted.
attorney fees 
the litigation spanned approximately two years,and counsel for olson and seidenberg claimed hours of attorney time devoted to the case.according to counsel for olson and seidenberg,under the established lodestar method of computing fees in complex public interest litigation,they were entitled to fees based on an unadjusted lodestar of million,even without a multiplier.and counsel volunteered to adjust the lodestar downward percent.
the trial court,however,awarded fees totaling,including in expert witness fees under code of civil procedure section,but nothing for other than ordinary costs.counsel for olson and seidenberg complain that the court erred in refusing to compensate for thousands of hours devoted to the case,and assert that they spent a very high percentage of their total time on claims that were successful.they also complain that the court did not factor in any attorney time after december,which was even before the date of the final statement of decision,and that the court denied fees related to inspection and disclosure issues and denied or reduced some of the costs for expert witnesses.counsel for olson and seidenberg thus seek a remand to have the trial court apply the lodestar approach to all hours reasonably spent on prevailing claims including work on losing issues related to prevailing claims and in obtaining catalytic relief triggered by this suit.
the award of attorney fees is appropriate,under a private attorney general theory baggett gates cal d,when a litigant has been successful in any action which has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest.code civ.t he fee setting inquiry in california ordinarily begins with the lodestar,the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.california courts have consistently held that a computation of the time spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a determination of an appropriate attorneys fees award.citation.the reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar work.citations.the lodestar figure may then be adjusted,based on consideration of factors specific to the case,in order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services provided.citation.such an approach anchors the trial court analysis to an objective determination of the value of the attorney services,ensuring that the amount awarded is not arbitrary.plcm group,drexler cal th,d,plcm.
successful litigants must be assured of compensation that fairly covers the legal services required,and fee awards should cover all hours reasonably spent unless special circumstances render an award unjust.serrano unruh cal d.we also acknowledge that litigants should be accorded breathing room to raise alternative legal grounds without fear that merely raising an alternative theory will threaten the subsequent request for attorney compensation.see sundance municipal court d.and,w here a lawsuit consists of related claims,and the plaintiff has won substantial relief,a trial court has discretion to award all or substantially all of the plaintiff fees even if the court did not adopt each contention raised.downey cares downey community development com.d.
nonetheless,a reduction in fees for limited litigation success is permitted.see plcm,supra,cal th at,d,sokolow county of san mateo d.sokolow.the trial court may reduce the amount of the attorney fees to be awarded where a prevailing party plaintiff is actually unsuccessful with regard to certain objectives of its lawsuit.sokolow,supra,at.
the trial court has discretion to determine that time spent on issues and claims on which plaintiff did not prevail was time not reasonably spent.boquilon beckwith th,d.there is no precise rule or formula for making these determinations.the trial court may attempt to identify specific hours that should be eliminated,or it may simply reduce the award to account for the limited success.the court necessarily has discretion in making this equitable judgment.sokolow,supra,d at.see also plcm,supra,cal th at,d.
the award of attorney fees is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court and absent a manifest abuse of discretion the determination of the trial court will not be disturbed.citation.lerner ward th,d.in assessing attorney fees myriad factors may be considered see city of oakland oakland raiders d,and the trial court may rely on its own experience and knowledge in determining the reasonable value of the attorney services.niederer ferreira d.
in the present case,olson and seidenberg argue that the attorney fees must be calculated from the time spent,with deductions for excessive charges,unrelated losing claims and similar items,and that the trial court deductions from the lodestar were unjustified.however,as both parties ultimately acknowledge,the court actually did not make deductions from the lodestar.instead,the court reasonably estimated the time that should have been spent,rather than calculating that time from the lodestar.it did so for two reasons.
first,a lodestar analysis was difficult for several related reasons articulated by the trial court in its ruling on the motion for attorney fees the case was in the opinion of the court grossly a great majority of the claims were unsuccessful excessive time was spent on the winning claims,showing the size,nature and operations of the auto club and proving context for their election claim and the main focus of the trial was not on reasonable election procedures.nor did olson and seidenberg establish for the trial court that their percent safety factor lodestar deduction was adequate.
second,these problems could not be remedied by reference to many of the billing time sheets submitted,because the court found that block billing,describing all tasks performed on a day and giving the total time spent that day made it difficult or impossible in many instances to determine from the records how much time had been reasonably spent on successful claims.although block billing is certainly not prohibited,when block billing is used,the trial court may exercise its discretion in assigning a reasonable percentage to the entries,or simply cast them aside.bell vista unified school dist.th,d,italics added.similarly,where allocation between fee and nonfee claims is a near impossibility,the court may simply make a reasonable estimate.track mortgage group,crusader ins.th,d.
moreover,fees must be reasonable in light of the results achieved,whether or not the claims are related.a reduced fee award is appropriate if the relief,however significant,is limited in comparison to the scope of the litigation as a whole.computerxpress,jackson th,d.as explained in hensley eckerhart,d,if a plaintiff has achieved only partial success,the product of hours reasonably expended on the litigation as a whole times a reasonable hourly rate may be an excessive amount even where the plaintiff claims were interrelated,nonfrivolous,and raised in good faith.
on appeal,in arguing the attorney fees issue olson and seidenberg largely ignore unfavorable evidence and unfavorable aspects of the judgment.for example,they assert they won their election case,but fail to describe in their opening brief the election claims they lost in the context of the attorney fees issue.thus,while they identify nine election claims on which they prevailed,some of which the auto club agreed to in mediation,olson and seidenberg lost what the trial court referred to as a fundamental and overriding election claim pertaining to the auto club right to spend its funds campaigning for its nominees,and many of the contested aspects of the election were resolved in favor of the auto club since olson and seidenberg have failed to describe in their argument the claims they lost,they have failed to provide a factual basis for comparing their winning and losing claims.thus,they have arguably waived their challenge to any evaluation of the evidence on that issue.see foreman clark fallon cal d.
similarly,olson and seidenberg have provided time estimates for supposed winning claims and ignore evidence supporting the judgment on the attorney fees issue.for example,they contend the court erroneously denied compensation of hours reasonably spent,that over percent of their time related to winning claims,that they spent percent of their time on election claims,and that over percent of the trial related to the election claims.however,they ignore certain declarations cited by the trial court which explained that only percent of the discovery requests by olson and seidenberg and only percent of the trial testimony related to issues they won,and only percent of the deposition questions directed to auto club directors related to the issues on which olson and seidenberg prevailed.
also without merit is the related assertion by olson and seidenberg that the court erred in denying fees for their inspection,accounting and reporting claims.the auto club acknowledges that olson and seidenberg obtained some information through discovery,and that the court said inspection was justified as to some of those discovery requests.the problem is that olson and seidenberg ignore applicable statutory standards.section authorizes fees only for the failure without justification to comply with a proper inspection demand see also,subd.b,and the court found the demands grossly excessive also,the trial court is not required to but may,subd.b award reasonable expenses including attorney fees,and olson and seidenberg do not specifically argue the court abused its broad discretion.
nor would we find any abuse of discretion,as the court did in some fashion factor these matters into the award of attorney fees.as the trial court stated in its written ruling on attorney fees,there is a likely catalytic effect arising from the litigation of some of the issues that were lost,in particular the causes of action for inspection rights and accounting books and records.while the court ruled against olson and seidenberg on these causes of action,the court is of the view that the judgment and statement of decision,and other aspects of the litigation,provide some guidance for the future and therefore are likely to have a catalytic effect.it is thus apparent that the trial court gave some credit on this matter in the nature of a fee award,acknowledging that the lawsuit served as a catalyst for beneficial change.see maria riles cal d.
olson and seidenberg,however,properly contend that the trial court erred in denying attorney fees for work performed in as the auto club notes,the trial court ruling on attorney fees,filed on may,stated that it included fees for the time necessa
