the globecon group llc new globecon,a new york corporation,appeals the district court grant of summary judgment to the hartford fire insurance company hartford,a connecticut corporation,in a breach of contract action.new globecon also appeals the district court earlier,and at the time interlocutory,grant of hartford motion to dismiss new globecon claims for consequential damages and attorneys fees.new globecon argues that hartford breached its insurance agreements by failing to compensate it for alleged property damage and loss of business income suffered by new globecon predecessor in interest,the globecon group,old globecon,as a result of the september,terrorist attack on the world trade center.hartford contends that,pursuant to a clause in the insurance agreement with old globecon,its obligations under the policy did not survive new globecon acquisition of old globecon in january.
we conclude that under new york law,an insured may,at least for some purposes and in some circumstances,make over to an assignee the indemnification it is owed under an insurance contract,and do so notwithstanding a clause in the insurance policy.because it can not be determined at the summary judgment stage whether old globecon claims for property damage and for loss of its business income were of a sort that could validly be assigned to new globecon,we vacate the district court grant of summary judgment on these claims.we affirm,however,the grant of summary judgment on new globecon claims for business losses allegedly incurred after its acquisition of old globecon assets,and we affirm the rule b dismissal of new globecon claims for consequential damages and attorneys fees.
background 
old globecon was a financial educational services company.it presented educational workshops to financial professionals,both online and through classroom instruction.in november,old globecon entered into an agreement with hartford for property insurance and business interruption insurance.specifically,the policy provided compensation to old globecon for direct physical loss of or damage to covered property and for the actual loss of business income sustain ed due to the necessary suspension of operations during the period of restoration.as one of its common policy conditions,the agreement stated that the rights and duties of the insured under th e policy may not be transferred without hartford written consent except in the case of death of an individual named insured.
old globecon place of business was approximately feet from the world trade center.on september,old globecon suffered physical damage to its office,its telephone and data lines,and its computer servers,and was subsequently forced to suspend its operations.
the parties dispute what,exactly,happened subsequently.what is undisputed is that sometime after september,hartford contacted old globecon and,around september,established two claim files,for old globecon property damage and for its business income losses respectively.hartford contends that old globecon ceo,gerald kramer,and its cfo,lorenzo vanore,told hartford that old globecon sustained minimal property damage and no loss of income as a result of the september attack.hartford asserts further that old globecon did not provide any itemization of its property damage and ultimately chose not to file a claim with hartford.new globecon insists that old globecon was in the process of establishing its claim at the time of its asset sale.
approximately one month after september,old globecon filed for chapter bankruptcy reorganization in january,starweaver venture partners i,llc starweaver entered into an asset purchase agreement with old globecon.the agreement provided that starweaver would acquire substantially all of the assets of old globecon,including all right,title and interest of old globecon in,inter alia,a ll of old globecon insurance policies and insurance claims and other claims against third parties for any matter asset purchase agreement nothing in the record indicates that hartford either consented to,or was informed of,the purchase agreement at the time.
the purchase agreement was approved by the bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york on january.soon after,starweaver changed its name to the globecon group llc called new globecon herein and relocated old globecon offices to midtown manhattan.
on march,new globecon,through counsel,wrote a letter to hartford asserting a claim on behalf of globecon for.this amount included for property damage,for business interruption and lost business income,and for extra expenses relating to globecon costs in mitigating lost business income,in relocating to midtown,and in litigating a dispute with its previous landlord.the letter did not mention old globecon bankruptcy reorganization,or starweaver purchase of old globecon assets.
on april,new globecon chairman and ceo,paul siegel,sent an message to hartford underwriter,bk international,for the purpose of changing the name of the insured on old globecon hartford policy to the globecon group llc.attached to the were,inter alia,the asset purchase agreement between old globecon and starweaver,and the order of the bankruptcy court approving the acquisition.three days later,hartford issued an endorsement changing the name of the insured as requested.hartford thereafter accepted insurance premiums from new globecon.
having received no response from hartford to the letter of march,siegel sent another letter on april.in the second letter,siegel referenced old globecon chapter reorganization and complained of hartford to new globecon prior letter.
a series of communications followed in which each party attempted to substantiate the losses.in an internal document dated june,hartford preliminarily set business income loss for the insured at,and physical damage at.on october,new globecon submitted to hartford a sworn statement in proof of loss,in the amount of.this amount included in business interruption losses,in property damage,and in claim preparation costs.
hartford responded to new globecon claim with a november,letter stating that it neither accepted nor rejected new globecon proof of loss,and would need additional time to investigate both the accuracy of the claim and the question of whether any part of the claim is covered under the policy.in that letter,as in all of its official correspondence with new globecon,hartford inserted language reserving its rights under the policy and under applicable law.
new globecon filed the original complaint in this action on january.on or about february,hartford sent a letter to new globecon reporting the results of its investigation.hartford concluded that new globecon was not insured under any hartford policy,citing the provision of its agreement with old globecon.hartford stated,moreover,that it had fixed old globecon loss at,which represented property damage alone.hartford enclosed a check in that amount with its letter,again reserving its rights to contest any obligation whatsoever that it might have to new globecon.
new globecon filed an amended complaint on march.in the amended complaint,new globecon claimed that,through february,globecon sustained physical damage as well as business income losses and extra expenses amounting to,as a direct result of the september attack.amended complaint.new globecon argued further that hartford had breached an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing through the delays in responding to new globecon communications and through hartford alleged failure to adhere to the language of the policy.new globecon claimed consequential damages,ranging from forced layoffs and attrition,to in sales and marketing efforts,to the use of inadequate office equipment,all stemming from hartford alleged breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.id.
hartford then moved,successfully,to dismiss new globecon claims for consequential damages and attorneys fees.in an order dated september,the district court held that consequential damages are not available in an insurance action under new york law unless the alleged injury was covered by a specific contractual provision,and that attorneys fees are not available in an affirmative action brought by an insured to settle its rights under an insurance policy.
on july,the district court granted hartford motion for summary judgment on new globecon remaining claims.the court ruled that,because hartford did not consent in writing to old globecon assignment of its policy to new globecon,it did not have insurance obligations towards new globecon.the court also rejected new globecon contention that hartford had waived its defenses to coverage through consent,waiver,or estoppel.
new globecon appeals the district court september,grant of hartford motion to dismiss,as well as its july,grant of hartford motion for summary judgment.as to summary judgment,new globecon argues in principal part that the presence of a clause in an insurance agreement does not preclude recovery for the assignee when the transfer of the policy occurred after the loss for which the assignee seeks recovery.new globecon also argues that genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether,by treating new globecon as the insured after april,hartford either consented to the assignment or is equitably estopped from asserting any defense to coverage.finally,new globecon argues that the district court misapplied new york law in dismissing its claims for consequential damages and for attorneys fees.

summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.at the summary judgment stage,the judge function is not himself to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.anderson liberty lobby,d.our review of a district court grant of summary judgment is de novo.peck baldwinsville cent.sch,cir.
the district court granted summary judgment to hartford based on the provision in its policy with old globecon.globecon group,llc hartford fire ins,wl,dist.lexis.the enforceability of a clause in an insurance contract is limited under new york law.as a general matter,new york follows the majority rule that such a provision is valid with respect to transfers that were made prior to,but not after,the loss has occurred.see travelers indemnity israel,cir although assignment of the policy prior to loss is ineffective without the consent of the insurer,no such approval is necessary for an assignment of the right to the proceeds after the loss.footnote omitted sr int l bus.ins.world trade ctr,d,under provisions,any unauthorized assignment of a property insurance policy before a loss occurs is invalid but a fter a loss occurs a party to an insurance contract may assign its right to accrued insurance proceeds to another party,even in the face of express policy language prohibiting assignments.citations omitted.
the idea behind the majority rule is that,once the loss has occurred,the essentially is transferring a cause of action rather than a particular risk profile.as the ninth circuit has explained 
risk characteristics of the insured determine whether the insurer will provide coverage,and at what rate.an assignment could alter drastically the insurer exposure depending on the nature of the new policyholder.no assignment clauses protect against any such unforeseen risk.when the loss occurs before the transfer,however,the characteristics of the assignee are of little importance regardless of any transfer the insurer still covers only the risk it evaluated when it wrote the policy.

the district court acknowledged the general rule permitting transfer of a cause of action notwithstanding a clause in an insurance policy but held this rule inapplicable to certain claims for business interruption insurance.c overage for lost business income,the district court stated,generally requires a more complex calculation than many other types of insurance coverage.globecon group,llc,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the court held that,because claims for lost business income are more difficult to substantiate than claims for property damage,assigning such claims involves a considerable amount of risk for the insurance company.that is,according to the district court,old globecon obligation to substantiate its claim is,in effect,a duty,the assignment of which would require hartford to seek verification of the claim from new globecon,a to the policy with,at best,information about old globecon property damage and income loss when hartford contracted to acquire that information from the damaged party itself.id.at at,dist.lexis,at.noting that an insurer simply issuing a check to a different party may not be the only consequence of all assignments,id.at,dist.lexis,at,the district court held that a clause will be upheld not only when a loss has yet to occur,but whenever the transfer exposes the insurer to additional risk.
we agree with the district court that,under new york law,a clause may,in certain unusual circumstances,remain valid as to some claims even though the loss occurred before the transfer.for example,a claim for loss of business income may well not be validly assignable to the lost income of the assignee,at least where such lost income is uncertain at the time of the assignment.thus,in holt fidelity phoenix fire ins,the appellate division did not honor a movie theater owner assignment of business interruption insurance to a new owner who took over shortly after a fire forced the theater to close.the court held that the insurer obligation under the policy was to reimburse the original owner for the loss which it sustained,arising by reason of its loss of profits,because an interruption of its business to be measured by its business experience before the loss and of its probable experience thereafter.id.at emphases in original.because the new owner was no party to this policy,an assignment to him was void.id.
more recently,a district court in the southern district of new york applying new york law held that an insured who suffered property damage and made claims for its own losses could not subsequently assign its business interruption policy to a third party.the court held that the assignee may maintain an action for the original insured losses that accrued as of the date of the assignment but was not entitled to those business losses which had yet to occur at the time of the assignment.bronx entm t llc paul mercury ins,d.but see int l bus.ins,d at distinguishing between claims for lost rental income,which is fixed or easily ascertained at the time of the assignment,and those for lost business income,which inherently require speculation about future earnings.
the reasoning of these cases does not,however,seem to us to oblige an insured to present a claim before executing a transfer,on pain of losing its rights under a clause in an insurance policy prohibiting the insured from transferring its rights and duties under the policy without the consent of the insurer.hartford relies on federal cases applying new york law that have drawn a distinction between the assignment of a party rights under a contract,which is generally permitted,and a delegation of a party duties,which generally requires the consent of the obligee.see,viacom int l tandem,cir contemporary mission,famous music,cir see also ucc a party may perform his duty through a delegate unless otherwise agreed or unless the other
