this appeal arises out of the award of attorney fees to certain criminal the denial of fees to the hyde amendment,which authorizes fees in limited circumstances in criminal cases.in the underlying case that led to the fee award,the united states prosecuted thirteen defendants for alleged abuses in the funding and construction of a housing development on the blackfeet indian reservation in montana.among the thirteen defendants there were sixteen counts and over fifty charged offenses,but no convictions.
following the unsuccessful prosecution,the defendants sought attorney fees under the hyde amendment.the district court awarded fees to blaze construction,blaze and scott sherburne concluding that their prosecution had been vexatious,and denied fees to various other claimants,including appellant william harvey aubrey.the united states now appeals the award of fees to blaze and sherburne.aubrey separately appeals the denial of his fee request.sherburne the district court decision to limit his fees to dollars per hour,the ceiling for fees under the criminal justice act.we conclude that the district court applied the wrong legal test for awarding fees under the hyde amendment,and therefore we vacate and remand.we further conclude that attorney fees awarded under the hyde amendment should not be capped at dollars per hour.
factual and procedural background 
in the early,blaze offered to prepare an application for federal grant funds for the blackfeet tribe of montana the tribe,under the home program.the home program,operated through the department of housing and urban development hud,was designed to fund the construction of private homes for low income native americans.the tribe accepted blaze offer,and its president,william harvey and submitted a grant application to hud.in the application,the tribe sought in federal funds to build homes.that federal money was to be supplemented by land donations from the tribe,federal home loans through the blackfeet bank,lease payments from the tenants,and tenant subsidy vouchers.as the contractor,blaze would receive.
the application was eventually approved,in the exact amount earmarked for blaze.blaze then submitted a bid to the tribe to perform the required construction work.blaze proposed to build homes,at a cost of each.it requested to fund the project the grant would fund the construction of units,and blaze would p rovide,obtain and manage all other monies or contributions required for additional units beyond the homes funded by this hud home grant.trial testimony suggested that this would be accomplished by mortgaging some of the original homes,and using the resulting funds to build the remainder of the proposed units.other evidence presented at trial suggested that the funds would have come from the tribe itself.in the end,only about fifty homes were built,but all of the hud money was spent.
from beginning to end,from initial application to eventual construction,the process was plagued with difficulty and controversy.to give a flavor of the allegations,we set forth only a few of the issues that arose.according to various hud employees,blaze application was deficient,and was successful only because it was muscled through by a hud supervisor,defendant gloria dale,according to the united states,was in cahoots with blaze.lewis ostensibly sought to bypass the bidding process and to award the contract directly to blaze.following an internal investigation,lewis was removed from supervision of the program,and the situation was reported to the office of the inspector general.
other difficulties arose out of the financial management of the grant.the tribe requested a drawdown of grant money,an advance,although the money on these projects was typically distributed only as reimbursement.moreover,according to another hud employee,the tribe sought money to pay for land that it had promised to donate.
the housing lottery used to distribute the homes was attacked as fixed.many of the homes were awarded to individuals with personal connections to tribal insiders,and there was a pretrial admission by a blaze recanted at aubrey had manipulated the lottery.
the united states initiated its criminal investigation in.the grand jury issued a first,sealed indictment in august,and a second sealed indictment in december in early,the grand jury returned a third and final indictment,this time including sherburne as a defendant.
trial began in september,and ended without any convictions.some of the charges were dismissed pursuant to judgments of acquittal,see.other charges led to a hung jury,a mistrial,and eventual dismissal of the charges and the jury acquitted on the remaining charges.in the defendants view,this result was no surprise,as the government never really understood the intricacies of the transactions,the roles of hud and the tribe,or the details of the construction funding and the selection of tenants.they believe that the government jumped to conclusions based on superficial evidence,and ignored the complexities of the mortgage financing.
following the trial,defendants blaze,aubrey,lodgebuilder,sherburne,mckay,and the wilsons moved for attorney fees under the hyde amendment,which permits a criminal defendant to recover fees when the government position was vexatious,frivolous,or in bad faith.note.in awarding fees to blaze and sherburne,the court expressed misgivings about the prosecution tactics.for instance,the court stated that the government decision to dismiss the remaining charges following the mistrial,rather than to pursue a retrial,raised issues about the government motivation in this prosecution.indeed,the court found that the government insistence that it could prove the mistried charges,if it chose to proceed,was nothing more than an effort to defeat applications for attorney fees under the hyde amendment.
the court then analyzed the fee applications under the vexatious prong of the hyde amendment.citing a district court case from virginia,united states holland,the court stated that the proper inquiry is whether a reasonable prosecutor should have concluded that the applicable law and the available evidence were insufficient to prove the defendants guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.united states aubrey,no.cr,slip op.at,filed may,order granting attorney fees quoting d,vacated in part on other grounds,d,aff,cir.
the court first awarded fees to sherburne,finding that t he government agents distorted the truth as to sherburne involvement,specifically regarding certain letters attributed to sherburne by the government,as t he letters were written by another person.moreover,in the court view,t he government refused to allow sherburne to explain himself fully,and therefore,it ignored evidence.finally,regarding the allegations of wire fraud,the court determined that the government had not presented any facts establishing any false representation made by sherburne.in awarding fees,the court held that the rate is limited to dollars per hour,as specified in the criminal justice act.
the court also awarded fees to blaze,concluding that the government proceeded blindly without a sufficient understanding of the facts and the law on which it proceeded.the government misapprehended the issue of the mortgage financing and the reason why it was not accomplished.
finally,the court denied fees to aubrey and lodgebuilder.it noted the suspicious nature of aubrey and lodgebuilder involvement in securing the grant funds suggested that the circumstances surrounding aubrey and lodgebuilder draw on the grant funds was questionable and further pointed to their acquisition of hud insider information,and the possibility that the housing lottery had been rigged.
