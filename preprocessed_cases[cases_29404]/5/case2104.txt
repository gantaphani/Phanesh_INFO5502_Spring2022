this is a legal malpractice action in which the plaintiffs claimed their former lawyers settled the underlying inverse condemnation case for too little money,and the lawyers by sought the fee they earned in the underlying case.the trial court disposed of the plaintiffs claim by nonsuit on the ground that,assuming negligence,the plaintiffs damages were too speculative,then gave judgment to the lawyers on their.the plaintiffs appeal,claiming the lawyers were not entitled to their fee and that the trial court should not have granted nonsuit.we affirm and grant the lawyers motion for sanctions for a frivolous appeal.
a public sewer maintained by the city of los angeles runs under property owned by john barnard and his wife,virginia barnard,who is included in our references to barnard except where the context makes it clear we are referring only to him in august,the city discovered the sewer had deteriorated and caused barnard property to subside.in november,barnard retained the law firm of perona,langer,beck lallande to pursue an inverse condemnation action against the city,agreed in writing to pay all costs as incurred,and agreed to pay the perona firm percent of any benefits conferred any settlement or judgment.the inverse condemnation action was filed in january.
the perona firm retained engineers to determine the scope and cost of repairs required for barnard property,and retained a real estate appraiser michael camras to value the property.camras initially valued the property,in an undamaged condition,at but later reduced his valuation to the city appraiser valued the property at,but later reduced his valuation to.barnard engineers said the cost of repairs would be about the city said the cost would be only.
in july,the city offered to settle for,plus attorney fees and costs.barnard rejected the offer.in november,the city offered to purchase barnard property for and to pay barnard attorney fees and costs.barnard rejected the offer.about a week or two later,one of the two lawyers at the perona firm primarily responsible for barnard lawsuit against the city ellen serbin told barnard his engineers were revising their repair estimates upward,and the estimated cost of repair was later increased from to 
in december,barnard reached a settlement with the city.subject to the city council approval,the city agreed to purchase the property for,to rent it back to barnard for three years at per month well below market value,to pay barnard an additional for interest,inconvenience,and the like,and to pay barnard attorney fees and costs.the deal totaled about million.the city council approved the settlement and the city deposited the funds in an escrow account,but barnard attempted to revise the deal,made new demands,and ultimately refused to go through with the deal.the perona firm prepared for trial.
in april,barnard asked major langer the other primarily responsible perona lawyer to reduce the firm fee by.barnard ignored his own additional demands after the december settlement was made and claimed the settlement was unduly delayed and had fallen apart because the perona firm should have negotiated a higher settlement amount to include prejudgment interest barnard pressed for continued settlement discussions and asked the perona firm to negotiate a deal in which he would keep his home and be paid damages for its loss of value.
with a settlement meeting set for april,barnard told the perona firm on april that he wanted to associate in as because he had concluded that it would facilitate the closure of th e matter if he could talk directly to the city attorney office and the association was formalized two days later.at the april meeting,barnard proposed a deal where he would keep the property and the city would pay him plus his attorney fees and costs.the city rejected the offer.on may,barnard met alone and without invitation to anyone at the perona firm with the city lawyer and repeated the same demand he had made on april.the city again rejected the offer.there were further settlement discussions on may but no settlement was reached.meanwhile,expert depositions were scheduled and the perona firm prepared for trial.
on june with a mandatory settlement conference set for june,barnard sent another demand to the city but did not tell anyone at the perona firm what he was doing,and did not send the firm a copy of his letter to the city.in this demand,barnard valued his property at as is in its damaged condition and demanded more than to settle the case.
at the june settlement conference,the city rejected barnard demand but offered to settle for including attorney fees and costs,with barnard keeping the property,and the city offer the december deal remained open.barnard asked the perona firm to contribute to the settlement by reducing its fee by the firm refused.barnard then accepted the city offer which,after deducting fees and costs,meant barnard received and kept his property.the settlement was placed on the record.
barnard negotiated the details of the settlement documents with the city attorney,and the changes barnard requested were incorporated by the city by july,barnard and the perona firm had signed the final documents and the firm had sent them off to the city.before the ink was dry on july,barnard wrote to the perona firm to say he was contesting the entire attorney fee because the firm was negligent.by the end of the month,the disputed fee about was placed in the firm trust account and the undisputed balance of the settlement proceeds distributed to barnard.
in,barnard sued the perona firm,langer,and serbin for damages for legal malpractice,fraud,breach of fiduciary duty,and breach of contract,alleging that the firm and its lawyers had failed to inform barnard of the engineer increased estimate for the cost of repairs and of barnard right to recover prejudgment interest.as a result,claimed barnard,he was forced to settle with the city for an amount substantially less than he was legally entitled to.the firm and its lawyers answered,and the firm for its fees.discovery ensued,and some of barnard claims were disposed of by summary adjudication in favor of the firm.ultimately,the parties waived their right to a jury trial and barnard malpractice claims were tried to the court on offers of proof.the trial court granted the perona firm motion for nonsuit on the ground barnard damages were too speculative,then heard the for fees,rejected barnard claim that the firm had violated various ethics rules,and rendered judgment for the firm in the amount of,plus accumulated interest,plus costs.barnard appeals.
discussion 
in three related arguments,barnard contends the firm had a conflict of interest at the time of the settlement and later abandoned barnard,and hence is not entitled to its fee.see cal pak delivery,united parcel service,th,d in an action in which the lawyer admitted that he sold out his client and the class the client was seeking to represent to get a fee of about million for himself,the lawyer violation of his ethical duties deprived him of his right to a portion of his fee clark millsap cal,the violation must be serious before the lawyer is deprived of all or even a portion of his fee.barnard claims are frivolous.
barnard contends the mere fact that the city had two open for which required barnard to sell his property to the city and which would have generated a fee of about,the other which permitted barnard to keep his property and get for the damage which was accepted and generated a fee of meant the perona firm had a conflict of interest with barnard.nonsense.as the trial court put it,the tension between lawyer and client about fees always exists,which explains both the absence of any authority to support barnard position and the absence of any evidence to suggest the firm attempted to influence barnard to accept one offer rather than the other of course,there is also the fact that barnard accepted the deal that generated the lower fee.there was no conflict.santa clara county counsel woodside cal th,d.
barnard contends there was a conflict because beck came to the settlement conference to represent the firm its fee,not to represent barnard,and barnard claims the perona firm should have resigned or obtained barnard written consent to the conflict thereby created.barnard also claims the perona firm misrepresented beck status by withholding information about beck role at the conference.barnard is wrong.first,barnard was at that time,and he was the one who put the firm in the position of defending the fee that barnard had agreed to pay.second,barnard offers no authority to support his assertion that a partner presence under these circumstances is subject to criticism for any reason.this is a nonissue.santa clara county counsel woodside,supra,cal th at,d,the rules of professional conduct address tangible conflicts between the lawyer and client interest in the subject matter of the misrepresentation,not the existence of general antagonism between lawyer and client.
barnard contends the firm abandoned him after the june settlement conference.this is so,says barnard,because serbin admitted that neither she nor langer negotiated with the city lawyer about the details of the settlement documents.the problem with this argument is that it ignores the evidence that barnard in his role as dealt with the city lawyer with regard to the settlement documents,after which the firm reviewed the documents submitted by the city lawyer,signed them,returned them to the city lawyer,filed a dismissal,and did everything else that needed to be done to wind up the case.more to the point,barnard has never suggested the settlement documents were inadequate.when the firm stopped working for barnard,there was nothing left to be done.compare joseph di loreto,th,d,with estate of falco d.
barnard contends the trial court should not have granted the firm motion for nonsuit.we disagree 
in ruling on the nonsuit motion,the trial court assumed the perona firm was negligent and accepted barnard trial brief and opening statement as an offer of proof on the issue of damages.campbell general motors cal d.it was thus established that the fair market value of the property undamaged was prejudgment interest was valued at barnard nuisance claim asserted in the inverse condemnation action was worth and the current value of the damaged property was accepting these figures,the most barnard could have recovered had he kept the house was 
the court found the difference between the amount barnard received in settlement after deducting fees and costs for the property and the amount he reasonably could have recovered at trial was.the court then found that the general risks of trial avoided by the settlement,plus the specific possibility that the trier of fact might not have accepted barnard disputed and very high valuations,were worth considerably more than,and that barnard had not established that he would have been able to recover anything more in a different settlement or at trial.as the court put it,there was the risk,o ne,of getting less,and two,the cost of the proceedings,including the emotional wear and tear and the cost of people not working or whatever else they do with their time.so settlements are never equal to what the person would get at trial.as the court also noted,for barnard to win,he would have to show a significant difference,at minimum,between what the settlement was and what he would have gotten at trial.
we agree with the trial court that barnard did not and could not prove damages,which in this context required proof that,but for the perona firm negligence,the inverse condemnation action would have had a better outcome,either by a higher settlement or at trial.it is not enough for barnard to simply claim,as he did at the trial of this malpractice action,that it was possible to obtain a better settlement or a better result at trial.the mere probability that a certain event would have happened will not furnish the foundation for malpractice damages.damages to be subject to a proper award must be such as follows the act complained of as a legal certainty.marshak ballesteros,supra,th at,d,quoting agnew parks d,see also budd nixen cal d,breach of a lawyer duty that causes only nominal damages or speculative or uncertain harm does not support a malpractice cause of action thompson halvonik th,d williams wraxall th,d sukoff lemkin d.the mere probability that a certain event would have happened will not furnish the foundation of an action for damages.
none of barnard evidence does more than suggest speculative it does not demonstrate that,but for the perona firm negligence,barnard inverse condemnation case would have settled for more or gone to trial and resulted in a larger recovery,or a recovery on the same terms allowing him to keep the property.barnard offered no evidence that the city would have settled for more or that a trier of fact would have awarded more than the plus the house,leaving the harm caused by the perona firm negligence as only a subject of surmise,given the myriad of variables that affect trials of inverse condemnation actions.t he mere probability that a certain event would have happened,upon which a claim for damages is predicated,will not support the claim or furnish the foundation of an action for such damages thompson halvonik,supra,th at,d.
barnard offer of proof was woefully inadequate and was little more than a wish list of damages,unsupported by evidence that the city would have settled for more,or by expert testimony to show that barnard amounts could have been recovered had the case been tried,or by evidence even from barnard own mouth to say that he would have gone through with the trial which would require him to do more than just say that,in spite of his serious financial problems,he could have paid the costs involved in a trial in short,there is no evidence to even suggest that,had barnard gone to trial or insisted on a different settlement,he would have recovered more than he received in settlement.marshak ballesteros,supra,th at,d loube loube th,d.our de novo review of the nonsuit leads ineluctably to the conclusion that these omissions were fatal to barnard claims.saunders taylor th,d.
the perona firm has asked for in sanctions for a frivolous appeal on the ground that the appeal is totally devoid of merit and has been prosecuted for an improper motive harassment of barnard former lawyers in an effort to avoid honoring his contractual obligations to pay the attorneys their fee.barnard filed opposition,and we issued an order to show cause to make it clear to the parties before oral argument that we were considering the imposition of sanctions.we have now considered the motion and the opposition,and have determined that this is indeed a meritless appeal that was pursued for an improper purpose.
objectively or subjectively viewed,this lawsuit had no merit,less so the appeal.most of the issues discussed in barnard brief are unsupported by relevant authority and none of them can withstand scrutiny.as our discussion of the malpractice claim shows,the perona firm negotiated a fair and reasonable settlement which was accepted by a fully informed barnard who,as noted,worked for two years in the city attorney condemnation section and who,presumably,is more fully informed than most lawyers about the subject matter of the underlying case.barnard nevertheless attempted to increase his settlement proceeds by reducing the amount of the fee he had agreed to pay,then challenged the entire fee within days after the settlement was completed.quite plainly,there was no malpractice and no damage to barnard the nonsuit was unquestionably proper,as was the judgment on the.
we are persuaded that,having lost in the trial court,cost to himself because he appears in propria this appeal in an effort to force the perona firm to reduce its fee rather than incur further delays and expenses,not with a belief that there was even a possibility that he could prevail.that this is so is shown by barnard similar conduct in other cases
