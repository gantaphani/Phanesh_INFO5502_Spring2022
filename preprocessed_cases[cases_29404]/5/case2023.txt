travelers casualty and surety company of america travelers appeals from a judgment in favor of respondent alpha mechanical,heating and air conditioning,alpha,following a bench trial on alpha complaint seeking payment from travelers as surety on a payment bond for builders,ras.the parties had earlier settled a filed by ras against alpha,which ras had dismissed with prejudice before trial.at trial on alpha complaint,the trial court granted alpha motion in limine to preclude ras,on res judicata grounds,from introducing any of the facts related to ras dismissed.travelers contends the court in limine ruling deprived ras of its right to defend itself and was error because principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel are inapplicable in that for purposes of res judicata or claim preclusion,the primary rights involved in alpha complaint and ras are separate and distinct,and for purposes of collateral estoppel or issue preclusion,none of the issues in ras were actually litigated the authority relied upon by the trial judge,torrey pines bank superior court d.torrey pines bank,was wrongly decided and provides no basis for the trial court in limine order alpha agreed in the settlement agreement that ras dismissal would not affect its rights in presenting its case at trial and thereby waived its right to challenge ras evidence before trial by way of its motion and policy considerations in furtherance of judicial efficiency militate against applying the holding of torrey pines bank to this case.travelers further contends the trial court erred as a matter of law by awarding alpha prompt payment penalties,which also requires that we reverse the attorney fee award in alpha favor.
as to travelers latter claim,we agree the evidence does not support imposition of penalty interest,and modify the judgment to strike that portion of the award.we affirm the judgment as so modified.
factual and procedural background 
the essential facts are not in dispute.alpha entered into a subcontract with ras to install plumbing and perform other mechanical work for construction of a new hotel.travelers issued a payment bond on ras behalf.ras did not pay alpha a final installment of approximately,telling alpha it was withholding payment because alpha had caused damage to other trades work on the project.
alpha sued ras and travelers as well as other entities not involved in this appeal demanding payment of the balance of the subcontract.its complaint included causes of action for breach of contract,open book account,account stated,quantum meruit,foreclosure of a mechanic lien and enforcement of mechanic lien release and payment bonds against ras,and enforcement of a contractor license bond against travelers.in part,alpha alleged it had performed all covenants and conditions of its subcontract and various modifications change orders to the subcontract excluding obligations it was prevented or excused from performing,that ras breached the subcontract and change orders by refusing to pay for labor and materials furnished by alpha and also by causing alpha delay and disruption in its work,and that alpha had suffered damages of not less than approximately as a result of ras breach.
ras and travelers answered,generally denying the allegations in alpha complaint and asserting affirmative defenses.in the sixth and eighth affirmative defenses,ras and travelers alleged that alpha own negligence or unlawful conduct proximately caused in whole or in part the damages alleged in its complaint.in the eleventh affirmative defense,ras and travelers alleged alpha materially breached its agreement and further failed and refused to comply with the contractual conditions precedent to this action,thereby extinguishing its right to maintain this action in the twelfth affirmative defense,ras and travelers alleged alpha was indebted to them in a sum not yet ascertained and that said sums are an offset against any of alpha claims.ras concurrently filed a against alpha and other entities,in part alleging that alpha breached the subcontract by refusing to correct work that had been deemed defective by the hotel owner,and breached its duty to use reasonable care in performing the subcontract by negligently installing materials and failing to perform as required under the subcontract.ras sought over in damages consisting of over in costs to correct alpha assertedly defective work and over in delay damages.
alpha,ras and alpha indemnitors eventually entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release the settlement agreement in which ras agreed to dismiss its with prejudice in exchange for payment of.the settlement agreement contained terms preserving alpha right to prosecute,and ras ability to defend against,alpha complaint the payment of to ras from alpha and its indemnitors,and ras sic acceptance of said money,in no way affects alpha ability to prosecute its lawsuit against ras or ras sic ability to defend against the lawsuit pursuant to its general denial filed on or about october,by refuting elements of alpha causes of action.this term was included at several points in the settlement agreement as an exclusion to the various waivers under civil code section 
before trial,alpha moved in limine to exclude all evidence,allegations and claims related to ras affirmative defenses and.relying on torrey pines bank,supra,d,alpha argued that the settlement and ras receipt of consideration in exchange for the dismissal with prejudice of its as a matter of law prevented ras from introducing evidence regarding the subject matter of the or its sixth,eighth and eleventh affirmative defenses because those affirmative defenses involved the same nucleus of operative facts and raised the same legal issues alpha breach of contract and asserted negligence as those presented in ras.ras opposed the motion,arguing evidence of alpha defective or negligent performance was an issue raised by the filing of alpha complaint and put into controversy by ras general denial,and thus evidence of such matters was admissible under walsh west valley mission community college dist.th,d walsh.ras further argued the settlement agreement expressly reserved ras right to defend against alpha complaint.
the trial court reluctantly granted alpha motion under the authority of torrey pines bank.it ruled ras evidence of alpha assertedly defective performance was inadmissible under principles of res judicata and common law retraxit because it was new matter based on the same facts put in issue by ras.
the trial court evidentiary ruling resulted in an abbreviated trial on the matter alpha presented the testimony of its president,chief executive officer and chief financial officer,borris barshak,and ras presented that of its southern california regional vice president,walter clark.barshak testified that alpha performed all of its obligations,but still had a balance due of under the subcontract with ras.barshak admitted that at some point,ras notified alpha that it had decided to withhold the subcontract balance based on the fact alpha had caused damage to other trades work on the project.clark testified that ras had spent to pay other subcontractors to repair work that was damaged by alpha own work,and for that reason withheld payment to alpha under a provision in the subcontract that allowed ras to correct defaults of a subcontractor and deduct the cost of such correction from the subcontract sum.
the court entered a joint and several judgment in alpha favor,awarding it the principle sum in the amount of,as well as statutory prompt payment penalties of,prejudgment interest,attorney fees and costs.travelers appeals.
discussion 
effect of ras dismissal of its with prejudice 
travelers contends res judicata was not a bar to ras ability to present evidence relating to damages and delay caused by alpha negligence on the project,even despite ras dismissal of its with prejudice.it urges us to reject torrey pines bank as wrongly decided in part travelers maintains the majority reasoning is flawed because it omits the critical elements of collateral estoppel analysis that an issue be actually litigated or necessarily decided in a later proceeding.to address these contentions,we first set out the relevant legal principles and discuss the holding of torrey pines bank.we review the questions presented in this matter de novo,as the decisive facts are undisputed.ghirardo antonioli cal th,d.
principles of res judicata 
the doctrine of res judicata describes the preclusive effect of a final judgment on the merits.mycogen monsanto cal th,d,mycogen.it promotes judicial economy as it precludes piecemeal litigation by splitting a single cause of action or relitigation of the same cause of action on a different legal theory or for different relief.id.at,d.the doctrine has two aspects the first is claim preclusion,otherwise known as res judicata,which prevents relitigation of the same cause of action in a second suit between the same parties or parties in privity with them.id.at fn,d,lucido superior court cal d at.the second is issue preclusion,or collateral estoppel,which precludes relitigation of issues argued and decided in prior proceedings.mycogen,at,d,quoting lucido,at.
to determine whether claim preclusion bars another action or proceeding,courts look to whether the two proceedings involve the same cause of action.in california,the primary right theory determines whether two separate actions concern a single cause of action.mycogen,supra,cal th at,d.under this theory,a cause of action is comprised of a primary right of the plaintiff,a corresponding primary duty of the defendant,and a wrongful act by the defendant constituting a breach of that duty.citation.t he primary right is simply the plaintiff right to be free from the particular injury suffered.citation.it must therefore be distinguished from the legal theory on which liability for that injury is premised the primary right must also be distinguished from the remedy sought the violation of one primary right constitutes a single cause of action,though it may entitle the injured party to many forms of relief,and the relief is not to be confounded with the cause of action,one not being determinative of the other,italics omitted.t he harm suffered is the significant factor in defining a primary right.craig county of los angeles d.accord,balasubramanian san diego community college dist.th,d branson growers th,d.
in analyzing whether a second action or proceeding is barred by issue preclusion or collateral estoppel,we look to whether the decision in the initial proceeding was final and on the merits and the issue sought to be precluded from relitigation is identical to that decided in the first action and was actually and necessarily litigated in that action.le parc community ass workers compensation appeals bd.th,d le parc,citing lucido superior court,supra,cal d at.
the doctrine of res judicata,whether applied as a total bar to further litigation or as collateral estoppel,rests upon the sound policy of limiting litigation by preventing a party who has had one fair adversary hearing on an issue from again drawing it into controversy and subjecting the other party to further expense in its reexamination.vella hudgins cal d,italics omitted bernhard bank of america cal d.
application of res judicata to affirmative defenses 
in torrey pines bank,a majority of this court held that a party voluntary dismissal of an action with prejudice constituted a judgment on the merits with res judicata effect,serving to bar that party from asserting affirmative defenses in a different action based on the same nucleus of operative facts as those alleged in the party dismissed complaint.there,a bank sued white,who had guaranteed a bank loan and a small business administration sba loan,to enforce the guaranties favoring the bank.torrey pines bank,supra,d at.white answer included numerous affirmative defenses,including breach of fiduciary duty,fraud and misrepresentation in particular,white alleged the bank had prevented performance under the guarantee by misrepresentation of the offer of plaintiff sureties to retire one of the other respective loans.ibid.white also sued the bank in a separate lawsuit for breach of fiduciary duty,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,negligent misrepresentation,and negligence.ibid.in that action,white alleged the bank had misrepresented the terms of an offer by the debtor to the sba to restructure the loans.ibid.white later dismissed his lawsuit against the bank with prejudice.ibid.
the bank moved for summary judgment in its lawsuit on the ground white voluntary dismissal with prejudice of his own lawsuit constituted a judgment on the merits and thus collaterally estopped him from raising the same issues and claims as affirmative defenses in the bank lawsuit.torrey pines bank,supra,d at.the trial court denied summary judgment and a majority panel of this court reversed,holding white affirmative defenses were barred under principles of res judicata.specifically,the majority reasoned white voluntary dismissal of his complaint with prejudice operated as a common law to a judgment on the relitigation of issues based on the same factual grounds as alleged in his complaint.id.at.it explained a final judgment on the merits in a prior action is conclusive between the same parties in a subsequent action involving the same subject matter.citation.res judicata bars not only the reopening of the original controversy,but also subsequent litigation of all issues which were or could have been raised in the original suit.torrey pines bank,supra,d at.see also id.at.the majority specifically rejected the notion that a voluntary dismissal with prejudice could not have the same effect as a full trial,reasoning that t he dismissal with prejudice was a retraxit constituting a decision on the merits invoking the principles of res judicata.id.at,citing gagnon,nevada desert inn cal d,roybal university ford d.roybal gates superior court d.rodriguez fireman fund ins.d.wouldridge burns d.sylvester soulsburg d.palmquist palmquist d.datta staab d,sears demota d,ghiringhelli riboni d.further,the majority emphasized that i t is the title,right or obligation sought to be established or enforced,not the remedy or the relief sought,which determines the nature and substance of the cause of action.when this has once been adjudicated it can not be relitigated upon any grounds that were or that could have been determined in the former action.torrey pines bank,at.
because the bank had established the material elements of its causes of white had guaranteed payment,the debtor defaulted on its loans,the bank notified white of the defaults,and white did not remit any funds under the white affirmative defenses were barred by res judicata,this court concluded the bank was entitled to summary judgment on its complaint.torrey pines bank,supra,d at.
torrey pines bank was analyzed by the sixth district court of appeal in walsh,supra,th,d.in walsh,a construction company sci sued a college district district for breach of contract,among other causes of action,after district terminated their contract for construction of a gymnasium.id.at,d.district had filed a against sci and others,alleging sci failed to construct the gymnasium on time or in a good and workmanlike manner,that the district performed its obligations under the contract,and that it suffered damages and extra costs,including property damage,as a result of sci actions.id.at,d.district was eventually settled for,among other things,sci insurer payment to district of for its property damage and bad faith claims insurance claims.ibid.district then dismissed its with prejudice.id.at,d.
on the second day of trial,sci filed a motion for summary on the pleadings under the authority of torrey pines bank,arguing the dismissal with prejudice of district barred district from asserting any affirmative defenses in sci action.walsh,supra,th at,d.district responded with its own motion to set aside the dismissal under code of civil procedure section.id.at,d.over a week into the trial,the trial court granted the district motion,and denied sci request for judgment on the pleadings.id.at,d.it found district was not actually asserting affirmative defenses that the trial evidence was exclusively concerned with sci contract performance and sci claim that district itself breached the contract by failing to provide consistent plans and specifications,issue change orders and grant extensions of time,which cost sci money.ibid.eventually,district obtained a jury verdict in its favor,and the trial court entered judgment accordingly.id.at,d.
the court of appeal affirmed the resulting judgment in district favor.in doing so,it emphasized the critical distinction between an affirmative defense,which raises new matter,and a general denial also known as a traverse,which simply denies the allegations of the complaint.walsh,supra,th at,d.it said under code of civil procedure section,subdivision b,the answer to a complaint must include a statement of any new matter constituting a defense.the phrase new matter refers to something relied on by a defendant which is not put in issue by the plaintiff.citation.thus,where matters are not responsive to essential allegations of the complaint,they must be raised in the answer as new matter.citation.where,however,the answer sets forth facts showing some essential allegation of the complaint is not true,such facts are not new matter,but only a traverse.id.at,d,quoting state farm mut.auto.ins.superior court d.
with this distinction in mind,the court of appeal distinguished torrey pines bank,observing it involved a situation where the guarantor,white,did not simply contest the allegations of the bank complaint by a traverse,but rather sought to establish defenses constituting new matter,namely,that his guaranty was procured by the bank via negligent and intentional misrepresentations.walsh,supra,th at,d,citing torrey pines bank,supra,d at.those matters were not brought into controversy by the bank complaint in that case.walsh,at,d.in contrast,the walsh court explained,district did not raise new matter,but merely presented evidence to refute sci allegations that had been put into controversy by the district general denial.id.at,d.under those circumstances,district was properly permitted to defend itself against the allegations of sci complaint,and the trial court order granting district code of civil procedure section motion,even if error,did not prejudice sci.walsh,at,d.
ras dismissal with prejudice of its is a final judgment on the further litigation of claims therein under principles of res judicata 
we decline travelers invitation to reconsider torrey pines bank,since we do not find its analysis flawed.as torrey pines bank and a host of other authorities explain,a effected by a plaintiff filing of a dismissal of his or her action with deemed to be a judgment on the merits against that plaintiff.torrey pines bank,supra,d at.see rice crow th,d a retraxit is a judgment on the merits preventing a subsequent action on the dismissed claim long beach grand prix hunt th,d a dismissal with prejudice is equivalent to a judgment on the merits roybal,supra,d at.datta staab,supra,d,a retraxit is equivalent to a verdict and judgment on the merits of the case.in its common law form,a retraxit resulted from a plaintiff open and voluntary renunciation of his suit,in court,resulting in the loss of his or her action forever.roybal,at,citing blackstone,commentaries.a retraxit arising from a dismissal with prejudice thus operates as a legal fiction,and it is given the same finality as if the matter were adjudicated and proceeded to a final judgment on the merits.
in further proceedings occurring between the same parties following a retraxit as here,the dual principles of res judicata arise because it is necessary to determine the preclusive effect of the judgment in the defendant favor.in other words,a court will apply principles of res judicata to resolve precisely what causes of action or issues are barred as a result of the retraxit.hence,in torrey pines bank,we described retraxit as invoking principles of res judicata.torrey pines bank,supra,d at.it is therefore incorrect to suggest,as some courts have morris blank th,d,that res judicata principles somehow supplant the retraxit doctrine to the contrary,as stated,res judicata principles are applied to ascertain the scope and effect of the retraxit and thus the principles operate together 
with this understanding and applying torrey pines bank,we consider and reject travelers arguments that res judicata does not serve to bar the claims asserted in ras.as to the claim preclusion aspect of res judicata,travelers maintains the primary rights ras sought to enforce in its right to be free from alpha defective and negligent in tort,and were different from the primary right at issue in alpha complaint,namely,alpha right to payment under its contract.as alpha points out,this analysis is misplaced.ras would have us strictly compare only causes of action in our primary rights analysis,and thus compare ras causes of action with alpha causes of action,ras primary rights with alpha primary rights.torrey pines bank instructs otherwise.the question under torrey pines bank is whether in the present proceeding ras seeks to relitigate the same subject matter in its affirmative defenses as it finally resolved in its via retraxit.see fireman fund ins.companies cal d,retraxit amounts to a decision on the merits and as such is a bar to further litigation on the same subject matter between the parties torrey pines bank,supra,d at.thus,we compare the rights ras asserted in its with the rights it asserts in its affirmative defenses.
undertaking this analysis,we conclude ras sought to relitigate the same claims.in its,ras sought relief under theories of breach of contract and negligence for alpha defective or wrongful performance,which it alleged to have caused property damage and damage to the work of other trades.ras sixth,eighth,eleventh,and twelfth affirmative defenses likewise sought to hold alpha responsible for its wrongful and negligent contract performance resulting in those damages.in both proceedings,ras primary right was its right to competent performance by alpha,alpha primary duty was to competently perform under the contract,and alpha wrong was its negligent or wrongful performance,assertedly resulting in property damage.travelers attempt to distinguish the primary rights as sounding in tort or contract is irrelevant if two actions involve the same injury to the plaintiff and the same wrong by the defendant then the same primary right is at stake even if in the second suit the plaintiff pleads different theories of recovery,seeks different forms of relief adds new facts supporting recovery.tensor group city of glendale th,d.
travelers further argues claim preclusion can not be applied under these circumstances because it may be used only defensively and not offensively and that alpha assertion of res judicata under these circumstances find s no support in the law.the argument ignores torrey pines bank.in any event,because this point was made for the first time in travelers reply brief,we decline to consider it further.varjabedian city of madera cal d,fn,save the sunset strip coalition city of west hollywood th,fn,d citing cases.
although we need not reach the issue estoppel component of res judicata the same result follows if we were to analyze it under those principles.in challenging application of collateral estoppel,travelers argues none of the issues presented in ras were actually litigated or necessarily decided in view of ras voluntary dismissal with prejudice.it cites le parc,supra,th,d,and rice crow,supra,th,d,both of which declined to apply collateral estoppel to bar relitigation of issues following a dismissal with prejudice.citing the restatement second of judgments,the court in rice crow reasoned that a settlement which avoids trial generally does not constitute actually litigating any issues and thus prevents application of collateral estoppel.rice crow,at,d,citing rest d judgments,com.e,in the case of a judgment entered by confession,consent or default,none of the issues is actually litigated.however,in a footnote,the rice court recognized contrary authority,including from the california supreme court california state auto.bureau superior court cal d,holding that a consent or stipulated judgment may properly be given collateral estoppel effect.rice crow,at,fn,d.but the rice court rejected the principle,stating it had no application here because there is no judgment,stipulated or otherwise.ibid.
in the context of a dismissal with prejudice,we respectfully disagree with this reasoning.in fact,in this case there is a final judgment on the merits via retraxit,which is deemed by law to have resulted from the filing of the dismissal.thus,if we were to characterize ras affirmative defenses not as claims but as issues for purposes of applying collateral estoppel,we would hold those issues were deemed to have been actually litigated and determined when the identical issues presented by ras were reduced to a final judgment on the merits.importantly,collateral estoppel is not mechanically applied,and in each case the court must determine whether its application will advance the public policies which underlie the doctrine.citation.those policies are to promote judicial economy by minimizing repetitive litigation to prevent inconsistent judgments which undermine the integrity of the judicial system and to provide repose by preventing a person from being harassed by vexatious litigation.wright ripley th,d see also vandenberg superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
these policies are advanced by applying collateral estoppel here.ras had a full and fair opportunity to litigate its,but instead elected to enter into the settlement agreement and receive in exchange for dismissing its with prejudice.if ras were permitted to renew those claims,there would be no meaning to the phrase with prejudice gagnon,nevada desert inn cal d,roybal university ford,supra,d at.and alpha would suffer prejudice from being forced to defend against successive suits involving matters already finally determined.roybal,supra,at.under these circumstances,ras should be required to put an end to the disputes in that proceeding forever the parties must rest upon one decision in their controversy.torrey pines bank,supra,d at.res judicata in its collateral estoppel aspect thus operates to prevent subsequent litigation of all issues which were or could have been raised in the original suit,quoting gates superior court,supra,d at.
acceptance and waiver 
travelers contends that even assuming ras dismissal with prejudice triggers res judicata,ras and alpha expressly agreed in their settlement agreement that the dismissal would not have that effect,and they would each have the right to present their case at trial.under the same rationale,travelers argues alpha waived its right to bring its in limine motion.we reject both contentions.
we have no quarrel with travelers proposition that parties may by agreement limit the legal effect of a dismissal with prejudice so that it would not constitute a retraxit and affect their rights in a later pending action.american bankers ins.division d.manning wymer d.but the settlement agreement between ras and alpha here was not so broadly worded as to permit ras to present its case including its defenses.to the contrary it was very specifically worded to exclude affirmative defenses it provided ras would retain the ability to defend against alpha lawsuit pursuant to its general denial by refuting elements of alpha causes of action.exercising our ability to interpret this language de novo see morgan city of los angeles bd.of pension comrs.th,d,we easily conclude the parties agreement operated to permit ras to defend against alpha complaint by asserting matters brought into issue by its general denial,that is,by denying the allegations of alpha complaint.see walsh,supra,th at,d.ras was thus entitled to refute alpha claim that it performed the contract by presenting evidence that alpha did not perform,but it was not entitled to raise new matter by asserting alpha performance was defective or substandard.a defense in the nature of yes,those allegations are true,but is not put in issue by the denial.fpi development,nakashima d.
finally,travelers argues that even if we conclude the threshold requirements of res judicata have been met and we reject its arguments as to alpha acceptance and waiver,we should reverse the judgment purely based on the public policies underlying the res judicata doctrine.specifically,travelers maintains our adoption of torrey pines bank would deter litigants from dismissing their with prejudice even if they are convinced a trial on that proceeding is unnecessary,resulting in increased litigation of claims that would otherwise have been settled.
travelers does not articulate or discuss any of the important policy reasons underlying the doctrine of res judicata that would be defeated by its application in alpha litigation.nevertheless,we have already concluded part,ante that the policies underlying the doctrine collateral estoppel preservation of the integrity of the judicial system,promotion of judicial economy,and protection of litigants from harassment by vexatious litigation are served by applying it in the present case.
moreover,we reject the notion that our holding will have the asserted effect of increasing unnecessary litigation.parties in ras position desiring to preserve their right to litigate issues raised in a may carve out those claims by separate agreement or,failing that,dismiss the without prejudice.as this case and torrey pines bank demonstrate,parties in these circumstances should be extremely cautious about settling a part or piece of their litigation they must take great care to preserve key claims or defenses,or risk losing them.
ii.statutory penalty interest 
background 
in alpha trial brief,alpha argued ras did not comply with the requirements of business and professions code section which,alpha asserted,was a claim alleged in its eighth cause of action.according to alpha,the statute required ras to pay alpha within ten days after receiving a progress payment from the owner.alpha argued the statute was in pari materia with and mirrored the requirements of civil code section and that both statutes therefore required the contractor to give timely notice of any bona fide dispute to the subcontractor limited the amount the contractor could withhold to percent of the amount in dispute and awarded attorney fees and two percent penalty interest for a contractor withholding of funds in violation of the statute.alpha suggested the court might entertain an amendment adding a cause of action under civil code section to conform to proof.travelers did not respond to these arguments in its trial brief filed approximately two weeks later.
following trial and the court recitation of its oral statement of decision,the parties addressed the issue of alpha entitlement to these penalties.the discussion commenced as follows 
the court i have not reviewed the trial brief in some time and i do recall there being an issue regarding the additional interest.but it would appear that the parties did have a dispute as to the import of the retraxit issue.i do know what that does to the additional penalty interest.
alpha counsel your h onor,i n the briefs,i can summarize it here for you,but without the case with me,but there is case law that specifically discusses what constitutes a bona fide dispute and how the contractor must proceed to notify the contractor within ten days of discovery of that bona fide dispute of the amounts.and we do have that here.we do not have notice in any sort of timely fashion under the statutes.so that the basis for the penalty interest claim both with respect to the final payment and the retention,alpha was not timely notified of any dispute and what notice it finally got was widely out of proportion,it got the which said they were due a million dollars.
travelers counsel there no evidence of this.this is conjecture.we obviously prevented sic from putting on evidence of notice to them pursuant to your motion in limine.again the statutes talk about bona fide dispute exceptions.i think that when you read those,you look at the facts of this case,you see there was a bona fide dispute that in my opinion has not been resolved until today when this court makes its decision and the bare minimum was resolved as of march whe
