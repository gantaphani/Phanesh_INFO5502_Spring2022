the secretary of energy appeals the decision of the department of energy board of contract appeals board in favor of rockwell international rockwell.rockwell int l,nos,wl,ebca lexis,at ebca.
this case presents the question whether legal fees and other costs incurred in a successful defense against environmental criminal charges are recoverable under rockwell contract with the department of energy doe.we hold that the costs are recoverable and affirm the decision of the board,though on narrower grounds than those adopted by the board.
background 
rockwell international rockwell managed and operated the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant rocky flats in colorado under management and operation m o contract with the department of energy the department or doe from june,to december.rockwell and the department agreed to modifications of the terms of the m o contract during this period.at issue here are two modifications modification,which covered performance from january,through december,and modification,which covered performance from january,through december,
rocky flats was a facility for producing components for nuclear weapons.since the construction of the plant in the early,private industrial firms provided the management and operation of the facility,pursuant to m o contracts.because of the inherent danger in manufacturing nuclear weapons components,the contracts required the government to assume virtually all operational and financial risks in performing the contracts.rockwell,ebca lexis,at.rockwell contracts were structured as cost reimbursement contracts,which permitted rockwell to recover all allowable costs that were allocable to the contracts.the dispute here centers on the allowability of certain costs incurred by rockwell.
the specific costs for which rockwell seeks reimbursement are attorneys fees and costs incurred between june,and december,defending itself against possible criminal environmental charges by the federal government attorneys fees and costs incurred defending individual employees against possible government criminal environmental charges and the cost of a computerized litigation database used in defense against the potential charges and for other purposes.
a criminal investigation was initially undertaken by the federal bureau of investigation,the environmental protection agency epa,and the united states attorney office alleging criminal environmental practices at rocky flats.rockwell first formal notice of the investigation came through service of a search warrant on june,seeking evidence of environmental crimes.the affidavit in support of the warrant included a long list of alleged criminal violations by both rockwell and its employees.these allegations never ripened into formal criminal charges against either rockwell or its employees.
rockwell retained legal counsel both for itself and for individual employees to defend against the allegations.additionally,rockwell developed a computerized database the database,which was used in the criminal investigation and related civil actions as well as for other purposes,including civil litigation and in carrying out administrative projects and tasks.id.at.the database was used to organize,track,search,and retrieve hundreds of thousands of pages of documents.
during the government made additional allegations of criminal conduct beyond those listed in the search warrant affidavit.these new allegations comprised permit and other violations of the resource conservation and recovery act of rcra,stat.and the clean water act of,stat.cwa.rockwell continued to employ counsel for itself and its employees to respond to these charges and used the database in its defense.
beginning in early,negotiations between rockwell and the government were conducted concerning a plea agreement.the terms of the negotiated settlement were memorialized in a plea agreement dated march,the agreement.in the agreement,rockwell pled guilty to four felony violations of rcra and one felony and five misdemeanor violations under the cwa in exchange for a release for itself and its employees.none of the ten counts agreed to in the plea agreement the charged conduct w as based upon the allegations in the affidavit the uncharged conduct.id.at.an million fine was levied against rockwell,for which rockwell agreed not to seek reimbursement from the government.rockwell also agreed not to seek reimbursement of attorneys fees and costs incurred by rockwell in defending or preparing to defend against the charges to which rockwell pled guilty the charged conduct.it was agreed that rockwell would be permitted to seek recovery of its costs related to investigation of criminal conduct that never ripened into criminal charges the uncharged conduct 
both parties recognized that it would be administratively difficult to segregate the corporation defense costs for charged versus uncharged conduct.at the same time,they understood that the early stages of the investigation related almost exclusively to uncharged conduct found in the affidavit.rockwell,therefore,proposed a date of may,for dividing charged from uncharged conduct.after further negotiations,the parties agreed to move the date back to january.costs incurred for defending the corporation prior to that date would be deemed related to uncharged conduct,and costs after that date would be deemed related to charged conduct.rockwell would be free to seek costs incurred in defending the corporation for uncharged conduct,but not seek such costs for charged conduct.in this way,the parties would achieve an administratively simple means of preserving doj condition that rockwell would not seek reimbursement for defending the corporation against charged conduct.
id.at emphases added.in accordance with the negotiated agreement on uncharged conduct,the agreement provided that 
as authorized by c the major frauds act and c,rockwell may seek to recover from doe and subject to doe review and approval in accordance with the relevant contract s and applicable law and regulations a attorneys fees and costs incurred by rockwell on behalf of the corporation prior to january,but not thereafter b attorneys,fees and costs incurred by rockwell in providing legal representation to past and present rockwell employees and c costs concerning a computer system which is also used in rocky civil litigation.
id.at.the settlement agreement also stated that nothing in this agreement shall be construed as an admission by rockwell,or a determination by the department of justice,of willful misconduct or lack of good faith by rockwell managerial personnel.id.
after the settlement,rockwell submitted three vouchers to the contracting officer seeking reimbursement of costs related to the investigation of uncharged conduct.the government refused to reimburse these costs.on june,rockwell submitted a written claim for reimbursement to the contracting officer,to which no response was sent.the claim was therefore deemed to be denied pursuant to c.id.at.
following the deemed denial of its claim,rockwell brought an action before the board under the contract disputes act of.id.the board held that the major frauds act,was not a bar to recovery.id.at.the board also found that the costs for which rockwell sought reimbursement were stipulated by the parties as belong ing to the three categories of costs identified in the plea agreement.id.
the board then proceeded to analyze the disputed costs in relation to the terms of the m o contract.the board initially addressed the corporate defense costs.the contracts during the period in question included categories of allowable costs and categories of unallowable costs.the board first looked to clause c of the contract the general allowability clause,which provides 
the allowable cost of performing the work under the contract shall be the costs and expenses that are actually incurred by the contractor in the performance of the contract work in accordance with its terms,that are necessary or incident thereto,and are determined to be allowable pursuant to this paragraph c.the determination of the allowability of cost hereunder shall be based on reasonableness,including the exercise of prudent business judgment consistent application of generally accepted accounting principles and practices that result in equitable charges to the contract work and recognition of all exclusions and limitations set forth in this clause or elsewhere in this contract as to types or amounts of items of cost.
id.at.the board found that the costs were allowable thereunder,because the defense costs incurred in defending against the allegations contained in the search warrant were costs incurred within the scope of the contracts and were necessary and incident thereto.id.at.the board found that it was undisputed that the costs were reasonable as required under the general allowability clause.
the board also found that the corporation defense costs were allowable under clause d of the contract the environmental costs clause,which is a specifically negotiated provision allowing for the reimbursement of environment costs.the environmental costs clause makes allowable 
all costs incurred by the contractor with respect to any and all liabilities,claims,demands,damage costs,or penalties such as civil sanctions including fines,arising out of,or related to environmental,safety and health activities,including costs incurred with respect to investigation,removal,remedial action,ground and surface water or other of hazardous,toxic or contaminated material s,except for those costs that result from conduct identified in subparagraph e ii of the clause entitled,allowable costs,base fee and award fee.
rockwell,wl,ebca lexis,at emphasis added.subparagraph e ii expressly excludes costs that result from willful misconduct or lack of good faith on the part of any of the contractor managerial personnel.id.at.the board interpreted this clause as broad in scope and reflect ing the intent that rockwell be reimbursed to the maximum extent possible for costs incurred in the performance of contract work related to environmental,health and safety activities.id.at.the board found that its expansive interpretation comports with other evidence showing that this kind of coverage has long been doe practice and policy under m o contracts.id.at.
the definition of the contested costs as allowable under the contract,however,is subject to express contractual exclusions.the board,therefore,proceeded to review the relevant exclusions provided in clause e the fines and penalties clause and clause e the contesting actions clause.the fines and penalties clause excludes from allowable costs 
fines and penalties,including assessed interest,resulting from violations of,or failure of,the contractor to comply with federal,state,local or foreign laws or regulations,except when incurred as a result of compliance with the scope of work,specific terms and conditions,or other provisions of the contract or written instructions from the contracting officer authorizing in advance such payments.
id.at.the board interpreted this clause as not applying where th e fines and penalties were incurred by the contractor because it was performing work contracted for by doe.id.at.thus,fines and penalties would not be unallowable if the work required or authorized under the contract violate d a particular law.id.in addition to fines and penalties,the board concluded that defending against reimbursable fines and penalties should also be reimbursable since it would make little sense to reimburse contractors under the fines and penalties clause for fines and penalties incurred because of the performance of contract work and at the same time not allow the contractor the costs of defending against the imposition of those same fines or penalties.id.at.the board also found that rockwell did not waive its right to claim the costs by failing to provide written notice to,and obtain approval from,the contracting officer before incurring the costs.id.at.
the board rejected the government contention that the contesting actions clause barred recovery of the corporation defense costs.that clause excludes the cost of l egal,accounting,and consulting services and related costs incurred in connection with contesting actions of sic,or proposed actions of the united states.id.at the government urged that this clause takes priority over the allowance provisions,thus barring recovery.the board concluded that the government interpretation was inconsistent with the government prior practice and in conflict with the environmental cost and fines and penalties clauses.id.at.based on its findings,the board concluded that rockwell was entitled to reimbursement for its corporate defense costs from june,to december.
with regard to the employee defense costs,the board found that even though no indictments were ever brought against the individual employees,rockwell was required under delaware corporation law to provide independent counsel to employees subject to potential civil and criminal charges.id.at citing.ann.tit,c.the m o contracts provide for allowability of employee defense costs in the employee defense provision.the board interpreted the investigation as a legal action within the meaning of the clause,thus rendering the costs allowable.id.at.as with the corporate defense costs,the board held that the contesting actions clause did not bar the employee defense costs.the board also held that rockwell did not waive its right to reimbursement for the employee defense costs by failure to meet the notice and approval requirement of the employee defense provision and the contesting actions clause.id.at.
with respect to the database costs,the board first held the costs needed to create,update and maintain the database prior to january,were allowable for the same reasons that the corporate defense costs for that period were allowable.id.at.as to the costs incurred on or after january,the board held 
in order for the database creation and maintenance costs to be barred by the plea agreement,we must find that these costs were incurred after december,and were incurred defending the corporation in the criminal investigation,and for no other purpose.if these costs were incurred for multiple purposes,some of which alone would make the costs allowable,then the costs are still allowable regardless of the plea agreement.
id.at emphasis added.because it found no evidence of costs related solely to the charged conduct and for no other purpose,the board held that all of the costs were allowable.
the government timely appealed the board decision.
discussion 
we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to b and g b.the standard of review applied to board decisions is prescribed by statute 
t he decision of the agency board on any question of law shall not be final or conclusive,but the decision on any question of fact shall be final and conclusive and shall not be set aside unless the decision is fraudulent,or arbitrary,or capricious,or so grossly erroneous as to necessarily imply bad faith,or if such decision is not supported by substantial evidence.
at the outset we note that this case does not require us to determine the effect of the major frauds act of,and its implementing regulations on the contract in question here.that act provides in relevant part that costs incurred in connection with a criminal proceeding by the united states that is disposed of by consent or compromise are not allowable,except that the costs may be allowed to the extent specifically provided in such consent or compromise agreement.k.the board held that,under the plea agreement,the government waived application of the major frauds act in accordance with k.the government has not appealed that determination.accordingly the major frauds act can not be a ground for disallowing the costs in question.
the dispute here is whether costs incurred defending against federal environmental allegations,which never ripened into charges,are included as allowable costs under the allowability provisions of the m o contract are excluded as unallowable under the exclusions in the m o contract.the first contract provision cited by the board as providing for the allowability of rockwell defense costs was the general allowability clause.that clause quoted above broadly provides for the allowability of the costs and expenses of work under the contract that are necessary or incident thereto.rockwell,ebca lexis,at.there is little dispute that the sweeping language of the general allowability clause embraces the costs claimed here.however,that is not dispositive.the government correctly points out that the general allowability clause is subject to the express disallowance provisions of the contract.subsection c of the contract provides that allowable cost s shall not include the cost of any item described as unallowable in paragraph e of this clause except as indicated therein.id.in particular,the contesting actions clause clause e provides that l egal,accounting,and consulting services and related costs incurred in connection with contesting actions of sic,or proposed actions of the united states are not allowable.id.at.the contesting actions clause reflects a policy of the united states disallowing such costs.see generally bill strong enters.shannon,overruled on other grounds by reflectone,dalton,en banc.this policy was applied to the department of energy by the following regulatory provision,which excluded 
legal,accounting,and consulting services and related costs incurred in connection with the preparation and issuance of stock,rights,organization or reorganization,prosecution or defense of antitrust suits,prosecution of claims against the united states,contesting actions of proposed actions of the united states,and prosecution or defense of patent infringement litigation.
the parties appear to agree that the literal scope of the contesting actions clause disallows rockwell costs incurred to defend against the criminal action contemplated in the search warrant.as found by the board,t he parties do not dispute that the investigation and the grand jury proceedings were actions of the united states.rockwell,ebca lexis,at.under general rules of contract law we are to interpret provisions of a contract so as to make them consistent.lockheed martin ir imaging.west.here,it is entirely consistent to interpret the broad language of the general allowability clause as being subject to the exclusion under the contesting actions clause.the general allowability clause,therefore,does not itself support the allowability of rockwell defense costs.
the second contract clause cited by the board in support of its finding of allowability was the fines and penalties clause.that clause provides 
fines and penalties,including assessed interest,resulting from violations of,or failure of,the contractor to comply with federal,state,or local laws or regulations,are unallowable except when incurred in accordance with the written approval of the contracting officer or as a result of compliance with the provisions of this contract.
rockwell,ebca lexis,at emphasis added.
the board interpreted the language of the clause in two parts,as an express allowance of fines and penalties where those fines and penalties were incurred by the contractor because it was performing work contracted for by doe,id.at emphasis added,and as an implicit allowance of the costs of defending against the imposition of those same fines or penalties,id.at.the board reasoned that,since fines and penalties and associated legal fees for the uncharged conduct would have been recoverable if fines or penalties had been imposed,then legal fees related to uncharged conduct would have been allowable under this clause even though no fines or penalties were actually imposed.id.
it is questionable whether this clause should be construed to authorize the reimbursement of all fines and penalties attributable to work within the scope of the contracts.there is a strong public policy barring recovery of criminal fines and penalties,see tank truck rentals,comm r,d barring the deductibility of fines in the context of tax law mcbrearty united states taxpayers union,cir.this strong public policy is reflected in a statutory provision adopted in before the execution of the first contract in question here.that statute provided 
the following costs are not allowable payments of fines and penalties resulting from violations of,or failure to comply with,federal,state,local,or foreign laws and regulations,except when incurred as a result of compliance with specific terms and conditions of the contract or specific written instructions from the contracting officer authorizing in advance such payments in accordance with applicable regulations of the secretary of energy.
department of defense authorization act,stat,emphases added.the statute does not provide for a broad scope of work exception,but rather narrowly refers to compliance with specific terms and conditions of the contract.id.this suggests that the provision is applicable only to fines and penalties that resulted from particular work directly required by the contract.for example,if the contract ordered that a particular area be filled,a fine incurred for doing that very act in the manner required by the contract would be recoverable.if,however,the work could have reasonably been performed so as to avoid the levied fines or penalties,there would be no reimbursement under the exception to the general language of the fines and penalties clause.a broader scope of work interpretation would appear to render virtually all fines and penalties allowable.
the view that this exception is of limited scope is supported also by the department of defense authorization act,which included an identical limitation on allowability under department of defense dod contracts,stat.at,and imposed fines and penalties for violations of specific provisions of the act.for example,a penalty is imposed for failure to comply with reporting requirements placed on former employees of dod,stat.at.similarly,a fine is imposed under the act on contractors who knowingly employ a person convicted of a felony,stat.at.under the board interpretation these fines and penalties would be reimbursable because the costs were incurred because of the performance of contract work,rockwell,ebca lexis,at,a result that appears to be inconsistent with the congressional purpose to require that the contractor bear the costs of these fines and penalties.finally,the fines and penalties clause,unlike the environmental costs clause,does not exclude costs incurred that are unallowable under clause e ii,which relates to willful misconduct and lack of good faith by managerial personnel.thus,the performance of contract work exception as interpreted by the board would apparently permit the reimbursement of criminal fines incurred pursuant to the performance of any contract work,even if the result of willful misconduct or lack of good faith on the part of managerial personnel.this dubious result further indicates that it is unlikely that the fines and penalties clause should be given the broad scope suggested by the board,despite the fact that the department of energy had previously paid civil fines and penalties under the contract and interpreted the fines and penalties clause broadly.see id.at.
however,we need not decide whether the fines and penalties clause includes the broad scope of work exception relied upon by the board,since we conclude that another contract clause the environmental costs clause renders the costs allowable without regard to the fines and penalties clause.
the final contract clause cited by the board in support of its holding of allowability as to rockwell defense costs was the environmental costs clause.this clause provides for the allowability of 
all costs incurred by the contractor with respect to any and all liabilities,claims,demands,damage costs,or penalties such as civil sanctions including fines,arising out of,or related to environmental,safety and health activities,including costs incurred with respect to investigation,removal,remedial action,ground and surface water or other of hazardous,toxic or contaminated material s.
id.at.there is little dispute that the language of the clause covers rockwell costs incurred to defend itself and its employees against the environmental investigation.the clause refers to a ll costs with respect to any and all penalties such as civil sanctions includi
