the jury awarded a verdict in favor of the plaintiff,milton whittington,in a suit under the age discrimination in employment act,et.adea,against the nordam group.nordam appeals the district court judgment on several grounds the denial of nordam motion for judgment as a matter of law jmol,alleged errors with respect to jury instructions,and the exclusion of evidence.whittington on the district court calculation of damages.we affirm the judgment in all respects.
when reviewing a jury verdict,we give the prevailing party the benefit of all reasonable inferences to be drawn from the evidence.abuan level communications,cir.viewed accordingly,the record reveals the following.
nordam is an repair and manufacturing station.its operations are divided into five divisions repair,transparency,nacelles and thrust reversers,interiors,and structures.whittington was employed by the transparency division from,when nordam purchased his prior employer,until he was terminated on january.the transparency division included several production cells.during his tenure at nordam,whittington worked in the stretch,grind,and polish cell,which stretched a heated billet into a acrylic sheet that was sold to outside customers or used internally by the other cells in the manufacture of acrylic products for aircraft.whittington worked as the cell supervisor first in texas and then in tulsa.
the airline industry,which nordam services,experienced a severe downturn following the september,terrorist attacks.in late gregg miner,the general manager of the transparency division,decided that business conditions mandated a rif.the existing management team,at miner request,determined the criteria for selecting to employees to be terminated in the rif.the criteria used were performance evaluations and disciplinary records.the team produced a list of or names.seventeen employees,including whittington,were ultimately selected for the rif,which was announced on january.at the time of the rif a spreadsheet documenting the rif listed two reasons for whittington inclusion restructuring organization due to low sales in product line and position eliminated.aplee.app.at.
whittington was the only supervisor terminated in the rif.there were two types of supervisors within the transparency division production supervisors and leads.the two positions shared a common job description.at the time of the rif in january,the stretch,grind,and polish cell was the only cell in the transparency division that had both a production supervisor whittington and a lead herb overbey.nordam had been in the process of eliminating the title of production supervisor for several years,but it had been doing so by changing the titles of individuals holding that position,not by terminating their employment.only two supervisors had actually been terminated in the prior eight years,both for their failings as employees.whittington was the last production supervisor and nordam no longer hires under that title.although overbey reported to whittington,the leads in the other cells,in which there were no production supervisors,reported directly to managers.the leads were regularly rotated between cells.whittington,at years old,was the oldest employee included in the rif.overbey was years old at the time.
on may,whittington filed suit in the united states district court for the northern district of oklahoma,alleging violation of the adea.he sought discovery from nordam regarding its reasons for terminating him and its evaluation of his skills.in answers to interrogatories nordam stated that t he level of management occupied by whittington was eliminated due to the introduction of lean manufacturing concepts.at,an elaboration of the explanation position eliminated,which appeared on the original spreadsheet.in addition,however,it suggested personal shortcomings of whittington.one answer stated that plaintiff performance was disappointing.id.at.although nordam further stated that this was not the reason that he was included in the reduction in force,id.at,one of the reasons listed for his termination was that he was not successful in handling production problems,id.at.in response to an interrogatory asking for any differentiation s based on reasonable factors other than age on which it relied in including him in the rif,nordam answered that whittington had no other transferrable skills.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.similarly,in response to an interrogatory asking why whittington was not offered a transfer or demotion as an alternative to termination,nordam responded that whittington skill sets did not fit other supervisory positions either at the transparency division or at other divisions within nordam.id.at.
at his deposition in march,miner was unsure how whittington was selected for termination in the rif.he testified initially that it was the management team who had selected whittington for the termination list.he then testified that he could not remember whether the selection was recommended by the management team.then he changed his testimony again,returning to the claim that it was,in fact,the team who selected whittington.but he subsequently switched to an acknowledgment that he had probably been the one to select whittington before he finally returned to the position that he had no recollection of when or how whittington name came to be on the list.
at trial nordam conceded that whittington had no blots on his performance record and that he was the only outstanding employee on the termination list,aplt.at.miner testified that whittington did not satisfy the criteria for termination prior performance or disciplinary problems established by the management team.furthermore,whittington former supervisor testified that he had the skills to supervise competently any of the cells in the transparency division.the jury also heard testimony from david vance,a member of the management team,that nordam regularly transferred its leads among cells.in fact,testified vance,i t part of nordam philosophy for its frontline supervisors to be,where they can be a supervisor of production in a number of cells.id.at.such a rotation occurred only a few months after the rif four of the nine production leads were moved to positions in new cells.
in contrast to his confusion at his deposition,miner was quite clear at trial that he was the one who selected whittington for termination.he remembered the tears running down my eye at the difficult decision.id.at.in contrast to the process described in nordam interrogatory answers,miner testified that whittington selection was the only one among the that did not go through the management chain of command for approval.although he acknowledged,contrary to nordam interrogatory answer,that the introduction of lean manufacturing processes was not the reason for the elimination of the position generally,or whittington specifically,he testified that he decided to terminate either whittington or overbey because the stretch,grind,and polish cell was the only one with two supervisors.he further testified that the choice between the two came down to time on the job.at whittington was selected over overbey because he had less time with the years versus years.miner explained that there was no way to differentiate between the two men on the basis of the preferred performance criteria so tenure was resorted to as an additional differentiator.that miner alone selected whittington was consistent with vance testimony that whittington name was not on the list presented by the management team one to two weeks before the rif was announced and that the team first learned of whittington inclusion on the morning of the announcement.the testimony of laura lundquist,nordam vice president of human resources,also indicates miner role in whittington termination.she testified that two to three weeks before the rif was announced,miner mentioned to her that whittington might have to be terminated in the rif and asked her about the possibility of offering him an early retirement package.
part of whittington trial strategy was to challenge nordam original rationale for his termination.to rebut nordam statement that sales were down in his product line,he presented evidence that sales of stretched acrylic,the product line produced by the stretch,grind,and polish cell,rose in the year that ended days before whittington termination.miner responded at trial that the use of the word sales may have been a poor choice but that the statement was essentially correct.he explained that the increase in sales of stretched acrylic reflected only sales to outside customers,whereas demand had dropped substantially from the internal cabin windows cell,the single largest consumer of stretched acrylic produced by the stretch,grind,and polish cell.at oral argument on appeal nordam counsel distanced his client from the reasons for termination provided on the original spreadsheet by describing the entry as something that was made up by some clerk.it does not appear,however,that this argument was made at trial.on the contrary,susan lawyer,the human resources representative,testified that she completed the spreadsheet entries from information provided by miner.
the first trial resulted in a hung jury.the retrial resulted in a verdict in favor of whittington.this appeal and followed.
ii.discussion 
denial of jmol 
nordam challenges the district court denial of its motion for jmol.first,it raises a variety of challenges to the sufficiency of whittington evidence under the mcdonnell douglas framework.see mcdonnell douglas green,d.second,it asks us to declare that a age difference the difference in age between whittington and overbey is insignificant as a matter of law in adea claims.
as an initial matter we note that our review of several issues in this appeal,most obviously the sufficiency of the evidence,has been substantially handicapped by nordam failure to include a full transcript of the trial in the record before us.nordam assertion that i f whittington really believes that nordam appendix omits items that should have been included,his remedy was to include those items in a supplemental appendix,aplt.reply br.at,reflects a misunderstanding of the burden on an appellant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence at trial.nordam bore the responsibility to present all the evidence to us and explain why it was inadequate.although we apparently have excerpts from the testimony of every trial witness,we have less than half the testimony with consecutive pages often split between nordam appendix and supplemental appendix,none of the opening or closing statements,and only seven of whittington exhibits six of which were supplied in his appendix and five of nordam.as a result,it is very difficult,if not impossible,for us to reconstruct accurately the presentations by the parties at trial.we could dismiss the claim on this ground alone.see dilley supervalu,cir an appellant failure to submit the entire trial transcript provides a separate basis for rejecting a sufficiency of the evidence argument.roberts roadway,cir rejecting claim when appellant submitted only excerpts of trial transcript.we need not dismiss on that basis,however,because the record before us is sufficient to uphold the jury verdict.
sufficiency of the evidence 
in order to establish a claim for discriminatory termination under the adea,a plaintiff must establish that he is at least years old,see a that he was terminated by his employer,see id.at a and that his termination was because of his age,id.in assessing whether the district court erred in denying nordam motion for jmol,we do not weigh the evidence,evaluate the credibility of witnesses,or substitute our conclusions for those of the jury.see medlock ortho biotech,cir.w e determine only whether the jury verdict is supported by substantial evidence when the record is viewed most favorably to the prevailing party.substantial evidence is something less than the weight of the evidence,and is defined as such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion,even if different conclusions also might be supported by the evidence.webco,thermatool,cir internal citation and quotation marks omitted.we may reverse a jury determination only if the evidence points but one way and is susceptible to no reasonable inferences supporting the nonmoving party.medlock,at internal quotation marks omitted.
nordam argument relies on the mcdonnell douglas framework for cases under title vii.this framework was established in,when such cases were tried to the court.see lex larson,employment discrimination ed.prior to enactment of the civil rights act of,the courts,with a few exceptions,had held that there was no right to a jury trial in suits brought under title vii.mcdonnell douglas said 
the complainant in a title vii trial must carry the initial burden under the statute of establishing a prima facie case of racial discrimination.this may be done by showing i that he belongs to a racial minority ii that he applied and was qualified for a job for which the employer was seeking applicants iii that,despite his qualifications,he was rejected and iv that,after his rejection,the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applicants from persons of complainant qualifications the burden then must shift to the employer to articulate some legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the employee rejection the complainant must then be afforded a fair opportunity to show that the employer stated reason for rejecting the employee was in fact pretext.
at.the framework has been applied to cases under the adea.see,consol.coin caterers,d.in a rif context the prima facie case is established by a showing that the claimant is within the protected age group,the claimant was doing satisfactory work,the claimant was discharged despite the adequacy of his work,and there is some evidence the employer intended to discriminate against him in making the rif decision.beaird seagate,cir.
nordam contends that whittington failed both to establish a prima facie case and to establish pretext.but nordam reliance on the mcdonnell douglas framework is misplaced.in united states postal service board of governors aikens,d,the supreme court stated that triers of fact and reviewing courts should not be distracted by the legal technicalities of mcdonnell douglas in reaching the ultimate issue of discrimination 
the prima facie case method established in mcdonnell douglas was never intended to be rigid,mechanized,or ritualistic.rather,it is merely a sensible,orderly way to evaluate the evidence in light of common experience as it bears on the critical question of discrimination.where the defendant has done everything that would be required of him if the plaintiff had properly made out a prima facie case,whether the plaintiff really did so is no longer relevant.the district court has before it all the evidence it needs to decide whether the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff.
id.at.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.we have repeatedly stated that juries are not to apply the mcdonnell douglas framework and that we are not concerned with plaintiff proof of a prima facie case when we review a jury verdict.see,abuan,at.because the employer will present evidence of a proper motive in almost every case,the ultimate question for the jury simply becomes which party explanation of the employer motivation it believes.aikens,at.our role,therefore,is just to review the record for substantial evidence supporting the jury verdict.
there is no question that whittington was more than years old when he was terminated.the only issue,then,is the motive for his it because of his age,a the trial evidence hardly compelled a finding of a discriminatory motive but viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party,we can not say that the verdict was irrational.
the factfinder is entitled to infer from any weaknesses,implausibilities,inconsistencies,incoherencies,or contradictions in the employer proffered reasons for its action that the employer did not act pursuant to those reasons.miller eby realty group llc,cir internal quotation marks omitted.a showing that the employer justifications for its behavior are pretextual permits a finding of intentional discrimination.exum olympic,cir.
one indication of pretext is the extent of apparent procedural irregularities with respect to whittington selection for the rif.see garrett,cir e vidence of pretext may include,but is not limited to,the following prior treatment of plaintiff the employer policy and practice regarding minority employment including statistical data disturbing procedural irregularities,falsifying or manipulating criteria and the use of subjective criteria.internal quotation marks omitted.all other employees included in the rif were selected by a management team and approval of the selections was obtained through the management hierarchy whittington was selected by miner alone,without the knowledge of the team.as the management team was considering all other candidates for termination,miner was independently inquiring about the possibility of whittington,and no one else,being offered an early retirement package.furthermore,whittington did not meet the discipline and performance criteria used by the management team for selecting the employees for termination.
another indication of pretext is that nordam was inconsistent in the reasons it provided for the termination.nordam asserted rationales for whittington termination that were later affirmatively disclaimed the position was eliminated as part of the implementation of lean manufacturing concepts and whittington performance was deficient or abandoned in the face of contrary testimony from its own management whittington had no transferrable skills.a third rationale a decline in sales of his cell product was challenged by whittington and even though nordam proffered a reasonable explanation sales included demand from other cells,the jury was not bound to believe it.
moreover,other evidence could have undermined the jury belief in nordam credibility.for example,miner,who acknowledged being the ultimate in the rif generally,and whittington selection particularly,could not remember at his deposition how whittington was selected,but by the time of trial clearly remembered not only that he had selected whittington,but also what his rationale had been and how emotionally traumatic the decision had been for him.
the jury could infer that nordam explanation at trial for whittington termination he had less tenure than overbey,and one of them had to go was an rationalization for what had been age discrimination.the evidence is sufficient to support the verdict of discrimination reached by the jury.it certainly can not be said that the evidence points but one way.medlock,at.
insignificant age difference 
nordam urges us to establish a rule that a age difference is insignificant as a matter of law in cases,and therefore it is entitled to a jmol.it relies on,at,for the proposition that there can not be an inference of age discrimination when the plaintiff is insignificantly older than the similarly situated employees who received better treatment.in the question was whether an employer could be guilty of age discrimination when replacing an older worker by another who was within the protected class,was over years old.id.at.the court reversed the district court grant of summary judgment for the employer,emphasizing that the difference in age was obviously more important in inferring age discrimination than was whether the younger replacement was himself within the group protected by the adea.id.at.the court noted that such an inference can not be drawn from the replacement of one worker with another worker insignificantly younger,id.at,but it did not explore further whether any particular age difference would be significant.
nordam argues that overbey,who was only five years younger than whittington,was the only employee who was similarly situated to whittington and therefore the only one to whom he should be compared.it urges that an age difference of five years or less is insignificant as a matter of law and should therefore always bar a finding of age discrimination.nordam actually makes this argument in the context of whittington alleged failure to satisfy the fourth element of the mcdonnell douglas prima facie case.as we have discussed,however,we need not consider satisfaction of a prima facie case when reviewing a jury verdict.but we consider the rule proposed by nordam anyway,because it could be applied to foreclose a finding of sufficient evidence on the ultimate issue of discrimination.
there are two flaws in nordam argument.first,nordam is assuming that overbey is the only employee against whom whittington should be compared.whittington,however,claims,and the jury could have agreed,that he was similarly situated to all nine leads in the division,because all those jobs involved essentially the same skills and roles.the youngest of these leads was at the time of whittington termination.it is not contestable that several of them would be considered significantly younger than whittington.
second,even if it is appropriate to compare whittington only to overbey,we disagree with nordam that the age difference would be dispositive.to be sure,the extent of the age difference between comparable employees is obviously relevant to the ultimate question of age discrimination.that whittington was only five years older than overbey,who kept his job,makes it more difficult for the jury to infer that nordam discriminated against whittington at least insofar as he is compared to overbey because of his age.but that fact should be but one factor weighed by the jury.
nordam relies on cases from the sixth,seventh,and eighth circuits in arguing that we should adopt a rule that five years is an insignificant difference in age as a matter of law.none of those courts,however,applies such a rule.the sixth and seventh circuits both allow for other evidence to overcome a presumption that a difference is insignificant.see grosjean first energy,cir i n the absence of direct evidence that the employer considered age to be significant,an age difference of six years or less between an employee and a replacement is not significant.cianci pettibone,cir a n age disparity of less than ten years is presumptively insubstantial unless the plaintiff directs the court to evidence that her employer considered her age to be significant.internal quotation marks omitted.and the eighth circuit requires a determination.see schiltz burlington,cir on these facts,the age disparities do not raise an inference of discrimination emphasis added hammer ashcroft,cir our circuit has not decided whether a age difference preludes a prima facie case.in one case we observed that a age difference was obviously insignificant,see munoz,cir,but we did not purport to establish a firm rule outside the context of that case.
in our view,a definitive rule is unjustified.we are not convinced that all age differences are the same.the replacement of a by a would be less suspicious than the replacement of a by a.comparing a worker with one who is,an employer may think it better to retain someone who will stay with the company another eight years until age rather than one who would be retiring in three years,less than half the time.or a company may simply wish to rid itself of its older workers,beginning with the oldest.
to the extent that other circuits establish a requirement when the age difference is less than five years,we choose not to follow them.the authorities are legion that circumstantial evidence can be every bit as compelling as direct evidence.see,rogers.pac,d citing the robert edwards,wheat.circumstantial evidence is not only sufficient,but may also be more certain,satisfying and persuasive than direct evidence.united states becker,cir hand,the requirement that the jury be separately charged as to circumstantial evidence seems to us a refinement which only serves to confuse laymen into supposing that they should use circumstantial evidence otherwise than testimonial.john henry wigmore,evidence peter tillers wigmore view that circumstantial evidence may be as persuasive and as compelling as testimonial evidence,and sometimes more so,is now generally accepted.we decline to set rigid guidelines and will leave to the jury the evaluation of the evidence,subject as always to the oversight of the district court to refuse to permit unreasonable findings.
jury instructions 
nordam raises four challenges to the district court jury instructions.t he admission or exclusion of a particular jury instruction is left to the sound discretion of the trial court.coletti cudd pressure control,cir.we review the instructions as a whole de novo to determine whether they accurately informed the jury of the governing law.smith diffee,cir internal quotation marks omitted.as long as the charge as a whole adequately states the law,the refusal to give a particular instruction is not an abuse of discretion.mckenzie benton,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
mcdonnell douglas instruction 
nordam challenges the instructions to the jury on the elements and proof requirements for whittington claim.the instructions follow the framework for analysis set forth in mcdonnell douglas,at.the jury was instructed as follows 
plaintiff milton whittington,seeks damages against defendant for discharge based on age discrimination in violation of federal law.the age discrimination in employment act provides in pertinent part that it is unlawful for an employer to discharge any individual because of such individual age.plaintiff has the burden of proving each of the following elements by a preponderance of the evidence 
that plaintiff was years of age or older at the time of the discharge 
that plaintiff was doing satisfactory work 
that plaintiff was discharged despite the adequacy of his work and 
that there is some evidence the employer intended to discriminate against him in reaching its reduction in force decision.this element may be shown by circumstantial evidence that plaintiff was treated less favorably than a younger employee.
evidence that an employer terminated a qualified older employee but retained younger ones in similar positions is sufficient to meet the fourth element.in order for plaintiff to establish the fourth element,plaintiff may establish that nordam retained younger employees in similar positions.
legitimate reason 
if plaintiff fails to prove any of the elements of his age discrimination claim,you must find for defendant on plaintiff age discrimination claim.if,however,plaintiff persuades you by the greater weight of the evidence of these elements,then you must consider defendant defense that its actions regarding plaintiff employment were based upon a reasonable factor other than age discrimination.as you consider this,remember that defendant must only articulate a legitimate,reason for its actions.here,the reason articulated by defendant is that it implemented a reduction in force in january.
if defendant does articulate a legitimate,reason,you must find for defendant unless plaintiff proves,by the greater weight of the evidence,that the legitimate reason offered by defendant was false and merely an excuse for illegal age discrimination and that the true reason was intentional discrimination.plaintiff ultimate burden is to prove that he was a qualified person over the age of and this fact was a motivating factor in defendant employment decisions 
in a reduction in force case a plaintiff can demonstrate pretext in three principal ways 
proof that plaintiff termination does not accord with the reduction in force criteria articulated by the employer 
proof that the employer deliberately falsified or manipulated an evaluation of plaintiff so as to cause him to meet the reduction in force criteria or 
proof that the reduction in force is more generally pretextual.
if plaintiff proves that defendant stated reason for a decision is unworthy of belief,you may,but are not required to,infer that plaintiff age was a motivating factor in defendant decisions.
in messina kroblin transportation systems,cir,we disapproved jury instructions which delineate the intricacies of mcdonnell douglas because a jury is not well equipped to understand the shifting burdens of such a formulation.but the district court,responding to nordam criticism of an earlier draft of the instructions said that its instructions satisfied messina concerns because it had removed and legal jargon.at.
messina,however,was concerned about more than just removing jargon.it recognized that the presumptions and burdens inherent in the mcdonnell douglas formulation drop out of consideration when the case is submitted to the jury on the merits.at.t he important issue is discrimination vel non,and the instructions should not lead jurors to abandon their own judgment and to seize upon poorly understood legalisms to decide the ultimate question of discrimination.id.
we endorse again messina criticism of jury instructions that describe the mcdonnell douglas framework,jargon or no jargon.but use of such an instruction does not automatically require reversal.the appellant must establish prejudice.our concern with a mcdonnell douglas instruction is not that it favors one party over another.it is that it unnecessarily complicates the jury job,and unnecessary complexity increases the opportunity for error.here,nordam has not argued that the instructions given were misleading to the jury or otherwise prejudicial to the defense.accordingly,we have no reason to reverse on this ground.
instruction 
nordam argues that the jury instructions were also flawed because the district court declined to give the honest belief instruction sought by the defense.nordam wanted the jury to be instructed that if an employer lays off an employee based on an honestly held belief that the employee is less qualified than other employees who were not laid off,the employer is not liable even if the employer belief was mistaken.at.nordam claims that such an instruction is mandated by analogy to medley polk,cir,which held that an employer who discharges an employee honestly believing that the employee has abandoned her job would not be in violation of fmla,even if its conclusion is mistaken,since this would not be a discriminatory firing.id.at.
but even if nordam is correct that an honest belief of lesser qualification is a defense under the law,it would have been entitled to an instruction only if it had presented evidence at trial sufficient to raise the issue for the jury.see brownlow aman,cir o nly where there is sufficient evidence to support an issue or theory is the party offering an instruction entitled to have the instruction given.nordam explanation at trial was that whittington was terminated because he had less seniority than overbey,and work performance was not a factor.in rejecting the proposed instruction,the district court explained that it confusing,if it does apply,to instruct the jury on an honestly held belief as to a fact when there no evidence of a mistake as to a fact.at.nordam makes no effort in its brief to direct us to facts in the record that would support an instruction.the refusal to give the instruction was within the sound discretion of the district court.
transfer instruction 
nordam challenges the district court refusal to instruct the jury that nordam had no duty to transfer whittington to another position.one of the jury instructions stated 
refusal to allow an employee to bump less senior employees is not in itself evidence of an age discrimination in employment act violation.if a job is eliminated,the employer has no duty to allow one employee to bump a less senior,and possibly younger,employee from a different position.
id.at.but the district court decided against granting nordam request to add that r efusal to transfer an employee to another position also is not in itself evidence of an age discrimination in employment act violation.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the court rejected the addition to the instruction because e very witness testified that bumping and transfer is not an issue.id.at.nordam opening brief contends that the instruction was nonetheless necessary because there was testimony at trial regarding the rotation of leadpersons to other cells a few months after whittington termination.aplt.br.at.
we reject the challenge to the district court ruling.the instruction proposed by nordam merely precluded consideration of transfer
