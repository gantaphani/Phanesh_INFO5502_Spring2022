like many states,florida protects homeowners residences from forced sale except in limited circumstances.the exemption is contained in article x,section a of the florida constitution.while the exemption can be waived in a mortgage,for over a hundred years we have held that it can not be waived in an unsecured agreement.see carter adm rs carter,sherbill miller,so d.in these consolidated cases,an unsecured creditor an attorney who is owed fees under a retainer agreement asks us to recede from our precedent based on three subsequent developments an amendment to our constitution a purported national trend approving such waivers and our recent holdings that other constitutional rights can be waived.in short,we do not interpret the constitutional amendment as approving waivers of the homestead exemption we discern no trend approving such waivers and in fact have discovered the opposite and permitting a waiver of the homestead exemption in a mortgage but not in an unsecured agreement is consistent with our cases allowing waivers of constitutional rights,but requiring them to be knowing,intelligent,and voluntary.we therefore decline to recede from our prior decisions.
henry demayo,who is divorced,sought to modify his child support obligations and abate his alimony payments.for that purpose,he retained deborah chames and her law firm,heller chames,collectively chames.he signed a,retainer agreement that contained the following provision on page four 
it is specifically agreed that heller and chames,shall have and is hereby granted all general,possessory and retaining liens and all equitable,special and attorney charging liens upon the client interests in any and all real and personal property within the jurisdiction of the court for any balance due,owing and unpaid as well as a lien in any recovery whether by settlement or trial and such lien or liens shall be superior to any other lien subsequent to the date hereof and that the client hereby knowingly,voluntarily and intelligently waives his rights to assert his homestead exemption in the event a charging lien is obtained to secure the balance of attorney fees and costs.
demayo chames,so d,dca emphasis added.chames ultimately withdrew from representation,and obtained a charging lien and final judgment against demayo for.the trial court applied the lien to demayo home.
demayo appealed to the third district court of appeal.he argued,among other things,that his waiver of the homestead exemption in the retainer agreement was invalid,and therefore the trial court could not impose the lien on his home.in a plurality opinion,the district court reversed on that issue,finding the waiver invalid,but it affirmed in all other respects.see demayo,so d at.two judges a majority of the panel concurred in the result,recognizing our precedent but noting that they would hold otherwise if writing on a blank slate.id.at shepherd,concurring.the concurring opinion certified a question of great public importance.id both parties sought review in this court,and we accepted jurisdiction.see art.v,b.chames demayo,so d accepting jurisdiction demayo chames,so d accepting jurisdiction.we rephrase the question as follows should this court recede from longstanding precedent holding that the florida constitution exemption from forced sale of a homestead can not be waived for reasons we explain below,we answer the question no and approve the result below.we continue to hold that a waiver of the homestead exemption in an unsecured agreement is unenforceable 
ii.analysis 
the homestead exemption has been enshrined in our state constitution for over a hundred years.the exemption itself reads as follows 
a there shall be exempt from forced sale under process of any court,and no judgment,decree or execution shall be a lien thereon,except for the payment of taxes and assessments thereon,obligations contracted for the purchase,improvement or repair thereof,or obligations contracted for house,field or other labor performed on the realty,the following property owned by a natural person 
a homestead 
art.x,a.const.as we recognized in snyder davis,so d 
the homestead provision has been characterized as our legal chameleon.our constitution protects florida homesteads in three distinct ways.first,a clause provides homesteads with an exemption from taxes.second,the homestead provision protects the homestead from forced sale by creditors.third,the homestead provision delineates the restrictions a homestead owner faces when attempting to alienate or devise the homestead property.
id.at footnotes omitted.we also have explained the reason behind the exemption the public policy furthered by a homestead exemption is to promote the stability and welfare of the state by securing to the householder a home,so that the homeowner and his or her heirs may live beyond the reach of financial misfortune and the demands of creditors who have given credit under such law.mckean warburton,so d,quoting pub.health trust lopez,so d.
of course,by its own terms the exemption does not apply to mortgaged property.see art.x,c.const.the owner of homestead real estate,joined by the spouse if married,may alienate the homestead by mortgage see also howard calhoun,so d,we have long recognized that property exempt under article x of the constitution,whether real property or personal property,can be sold or mortgaged by the owner just as any other property.the question here is whether a homeowner can waive the exemption without formally mortgaging the is,in promissory notes,retainer agreements,or other purportedly unsecured instruments.
we first addressed this one like carter.specifically,the question was whether an agreement to waive all benefit and right of exemption is valid in view of the policy of the exemption laws.carter,at.there,the decedent carter had signed a promissory note waiving the benefit of all exemption laws.id.at.invoking a similar provision that exempts in personal property,see art.x,a,carter heirs sued to require the estate administrators to set aside of personal property as exempt.id.at.we surveyed the law in other jurisdictions and held that 
i n view of the recognized policy of the states in enacting exemption laws and of the practically universal concurrence of the authorities on the identical question,our conclusion is that the waiver of the benefit and protection of the exemption laws contained in this note is not valid to defeat a claim of exemption.
id.at.we specifically rejected the argument that the waiver should be permitted because the same result could be achieved through a mortgage 
when a man executes a mortgage or bill of sale upon certain specified property,the very nature of the transaction implies the exercise of discretion and the contemplation of inevitable consequences.such contracts are,therefore,upheld as well in respect to real as to personal property.we have in several cases held that a sale under a mortgage is not a forced sale because it was a sale under consent given under seal and irrevocably conveying an interest in the thing described few men would mortgage their household goods and their children clothes to a hard creditor with the inevitable result brought vividly to their understanding 
over years later,we addressed the issue again in sherbill,so d.there,the debtors executed a note waiving the benefit of their homestead exemption as to this debt.id.at.we noted that n o policy of this state is more strongly expressed in the constitution,laws and decisions of this state than the policy of our exemption laws.sherbill,so d at.relying on carter,we reiterated that the waiver was contrary to the policy of the exemption laws of this state.sherbill,so d at.
since our decisions in carter and sherbill,we have recognized some types of waivers.for example,article x,section c prohibits a devise of the homestead if the owner is survived by spouse or minor child.in city national bank of florida tescher,so d,we found valid a spouse waiver of that restriction.see also.stat.the rights of a surviving spouse to homestead may be waived,wholly or partly,before or after marriage,by a written contract,agreement,or waiver,signed by the waiving party in the presence of two subscribing witnesses.hartwell blasingame,so d,dca w e see no reason for the state to prohibit the surviving spouse from validly waiving her homestead rights at the inception of the marital relationship which invoked those rights,approved,so d in re amendment to the rules regulating the.f b of the rules of prof l conduct,so d,florida highly valued constitutional homestead protection is subject to waiver.however,we have repeatedly refused to find an exception to the protection from forced sale outside of those expressly stated.see,havoco of,hill,so d,a homestead acquired by a debtor with the specific intent to hinder,delay,or defraud creditors is not excepted from the protections of article x,section.tramel stewart,so d,finding no exception in article x,section for a violation of the forfeiture act butterworth caggiano,so d,f orfeitures are not excluded from the homestead exemption because they are not mentioned,either expressly or by reasonable implication,in the three exceptions that are expressly stated.olesky nicholas,so d,t he florida constitutional exemption of homesteads protects the homestead against every type of claim and judgment except those specifically mentioned in the constitutional provision itself.
having discussed our precedent,we next consider whether we should recede from it.we do so recognizing that the doctrine of stare decisis counsels us to follow our precedents unless there has been a significant change in circumstances after the adoption of the legal rule,or an error in legal analysis.rotemi realty,act realty,so d,quoting dorsey state,so d.
chames essentially proposes three grounds for receding from carter and sherbill a the amendment to article x,section,which substituted a natural person for the head of family,changed the purpose of the homestead exemption from one protecting the family home into a personal right that may be waived b most states now permit waivers and c permitting waiver is consistent with other cases holding that various constitutional rights may be waived.we address each argument in turn.
a.the amendment to article x,section 
chames primarily argues that a amendment to article x,section,which replaced the phrase the head of a family with a natural person,changed the purpose of the homestead exemption from one protecting the family into a personal right that may be waived.we can find no such intent.
before the amendment,the homestead exemption was limited to persons who qualified as the head of a family.see art.x,a.const.this required a showing of either a legal duty to support which arises out of a family relationship,or continuing communal living by at least two individuals under such circumstances that one is regarded as in charge.holden estate of gardner,so d.in,florida voters approved an amendment changing the phrase the head of a family to a natural person.we addressed the amendment in lopez,where we noted that the homestead exemption formerly only enjoyed by a head of a family can now be enjoyed by any natural person.so d at.we recognized that the amendment expanded the class of persons who can take advantage of the homestead provision and its protections.id.at.
we find no indication,however,that in expanding the homestead protection,florida voters also intended to alter its fundamental purpose.the ballot summary on which the people voted stated 
exemption of homestead and personal property from forced that the exemption of a homestead and of personal property to the value of from forced sale and certain liens shall extend to any natural person,not just the head of a family.
hjr at proposed amendment to art.x,a.we can not agree that in expanding the homestead exemption from protecting families to protecting all individuals,the voters also intended to approve a waiver of that right.
finally,the conclusion that this amendment changed the purpose of the homestead protection to one solely for the benefit of the homeowner is inconsistent with cases recognizing,even after the amendment,that the exemption purpose is to protect the family,see havoco,so d at,and it would ignore the state interest in protecting the home,see lopez,so d at.slatcoff dezen,so d,appellant concentrates throughout upon the interest of debtor and creditor exclusively.what she overlooks is the interest of the state in its exemption laws,to the end that owners of exempt property and their families shall not be reduced to absolute destitution,thus becoming a charge upon the public.
for these reasons,we find the amendment to the homestead exemption a slim reed on which to recede from years of precedent.
waiver in other jurisdictions 
as another basis for receding from carter and sherbill,chames argues that there has been a shift in the position of florida sister states on this issue.if this were true,it would at least furnish a valid reason for reconsidering our precedent.we have been willing to recede from precedent when it conflicted with the law in a majority of states.see,fridovich fridovich,so d,we thus hold,as a majority of the other states have held in this context,that defamatory statements voluntarily made by private individuals to the police or the state attorney prior to the institution of criminal charges are presumptively qualifiedly privileged.we therefore recede from ange state,so.and robertson industrial insurance,so d to the extent they are inconsistent with our ruling today.state soto,so d,answering in the negative a certified question as to the continued desirability of according to the uniform interstate extradition act a more restrictive construction,as reflected by the decision of ennist baden,so d,than is accorded the act by other courts of last resort,and receding from ennist.as we explain,however,because of the differing constitutional and statutory provisions involved,any such trend on this issue is difficult to discern,and to the extent it can be discerned,the trend appears to go in the opposite direction.
given the variety of state homestead provisions,comparisons to other jurisdictions are difficult and generally of limited value.see snyder,so d at o ur case law surrounding the homestead provision has its own contours and legal principles.as a result,it is not susceptible to comparisons with similar provisions in other jurisdictions.see also ryan rivera,state homestead exemptions and their effect on federal bankruptcy laws,real prop.prob.tr,in the late nineteenth century no two state homestead exemptions were the same.today,state homestead exemptions have become even more diverse,as states have afforded disparate treatment to issues such as waiver,abandonment,and noncontiguous property in determining the extent of the debtor rights to the homestead exemption.footnote omitted.nonetheless,our review fails to reveal a shift toward permitting a waiver of the homestead or personal property exemptions in an executory is,a contract for which there remains something still to be done on both sides.black law dictionary ed see also am jur d homestead in the absence of express constitutional or statutory provision for contractual waiver of the homestead exemption,such waivers have been generally held void for reasons of public policy.
we need not exhaustively analyze the plethora of disparate state constitutional and statutory homestead exemptions.suffice it to say that the majority of jurisdictions that have addressed the issue whether by constitution,statute,or judicial opinion do not permit a general waiver of homestead or personal property exemptions in an executory contract some states permit waiver in limited circumstances relatively few clearly permit a general waiver of the homestead or personal property exemptions in an executory contract 
we recognize that several of the cases cited in the third district concurring opinion contain broad statements that homestead exemptions are personal rights that may be waived.see demayo,so d at shepherd,concurring.however,many of these cases do not involve waiver in the manner attempted here.instead,they address waiver in a mortgage or deed of trust waiver of the surviving spouse homestead rights or waiver in some other context as we have noted,florida,too,allows a waiver of the exemption in a mortgage and a waiver of the surviving spouse homestead rights.therefore,to that extent,florida law is consistent with those cases.to the extent those cases discuss waiver in myriad other contexts,however,they do not inform our analysis.
we also disagree that four of the six jurisdictions that prohibited this type of waiver when we decided carter now permit it.in carter,we surveyed the law in eight states,noting that two alabama and pennsylvania permitted waiver,but six illinois,iowa,kentucky,louisiana,new york,and north carolina did not.see carter,at.of the six jurisdictions that prohibited a waiver back then,only louisiana permits it now.see.const.art.xii,the legislature shall provide by law for exemptions from seizure and sale,as well as waivers of and exclusions from such exemptions.ann.d supp any person entitled to a homestead may waive same,in whole or in part,by signing a written waiver thereof the waiver may be either general or specific and shall have effect from the time of recording.it appears that illinois has limited its decision in recht,at holding that waivers in an executory contract are invalid to waivers by heads of family,but has not overruled it.see powell daily,distinguishing a waiver by a head of family from a waiver by an unmarried man.the remaining four jurisdictions that prohibited a waiver,kentucky,new york,and north to do so moreover,pennsylvania,which at that time permitted a waiver,now prohibits it.see.ann.west mayhugh,at.
for these reasons,we are not persuaded that the law in other jurisdictions has so substantially changed as to warrant receding from our longstanding precedent.instead,florida remains in line with the majority of jurisdictions in prohibiting a waiver of homestead and personal property exemptions in the manner attempted here.
waiver of other constitutional rights 
finally,chames argues that waiver of the homestead exemption should be permitted because we have permitted waiver of other constitutional rights.this would be the most compelling reason for receding from carter and sherbill,for if indeed we have held that other constitutional rights can be waived,it would seem anomalous to prohibit waiver of the homestead exemption.we do not agree,however,that such an inconsistency exists.
it is true that we recently noted that most personal constitutional rights may be waived.in re rule f b,so d at see also in re shambow estate,so d,it is fundamental that constitutional rights which are personal may be waived.however,an individual can not waive a right designed to protect both the individual and the public.see,coastal caisson drill am.cas.of reading,so d,dca,approved,so d asbury arms dev.dep t of bus.regulations,so d,dca.we have repeatedly recognized that the homestead exemption protects not only the debtor,but also the debtor family and the state.see havoco,so d at snyder,so d at caggiano,so d at lopez,so d at slatcoff,so d at hill,so.at.therefore,the right to the homestead exemption is not purely personal as some others are.
we recognize that since carter,a trend has developed toward permitting the waiver of constitutional rights,especially rights given to criminal defendants.see,faretta california,d permitting waiver of the right to assistance of counsel under the sixth and fourteenth amendments miranda arizona,d permitting waiver of the right to counsel and right to remain silent under the fifth amendment larzelere state,so d,recognizing that a defendant may waive the right to counsel tescher,so d at finding valid an antenuptial waiver of surviving spouse homestead rights melvin state,so d,finding that a defendant who knowingly enters into a plea agreement waives the constitutional protection against double jeopardy in exchange for reduced charges in re rule f b,so d at citing examples of constitutional rights that may be waived,but declining to determine whether the rights granted to medical malpractice claimants under article i,section may be waived we have also emphasized,however,that such waivers must be made knowingly,voluntarily,and intelligently.see,state,so d,a waiver of collateral counsel and proceedings must be knowing,intelligent,and voluntary.larzelere,so d at finding the trial court met the burden of assuring that appellant waiver was made voluntarily,knowingly,and intelligently state upton,so d,an effective waiver of a constitutional right must be knowing,voluntary,and intelligent.for example,when a criminal defendant executes a plea agreement,the judge must confirm that the defendant is aware of the right to a jury trial and voluntarily waives it.see.c.the florida rules of criminal procedure prescribe a detailed colloquy judges must recite to confirm that the defendant knows the consequences of pleading guilty instead of going to trial.see.similarly,when a defendant chooses to represent himself and waives the right to counsel,the judge must confirm that the defendant understands the consequences of such actions,lamarca state,so d,t rial courts are required to make the defendant aware of the dangers and disadvantages of quoting state,so d.in the civil context,we recently allowed civil plaintiffs to waive their right to no less than of the first in damages received and of damages in excess of.see in re rule f b,so d at.in doing so,however,we approved a form that attorneys must provide to inform the client about the constitutional right and the possible consequences of waiving it.the client must initial six separate paragraphs explaining the rights involved.see regulating.bar f b,and attached form.in contrast,the waiver in this case was contained on page four of a,contract,and at the end of a sentence.this is precisely the evil that our cases have sought to avoid.
carter and sherbill do not contradict the trend toward allowing waivers of constitutional rights.to the contrary,they are consistent with the cases within this same trend holding that such waivers must be knowing,intelligent,and voluntary.to be clear carter and sherbill do not prohibit a waiver of the homestead exemption they simply require that such waivers be accomplished as the florida constitution prescribes by mortgage,sale,or gift,see art.x,c.const.they prohibit only a general waiver in an otherwise unsecured instrument.requiring that a waiver of the homestead exemption be made in the context of a mortgage assures that the waiver is made knowingly,intelligently,and voluntarily.in obtaining a mortgage,a homeowner is well aware that if the payments are not made,the home may be foreclosed upon.as we noted in carter,the very nature of the transaction implies the exercise of discretion and the contemplation of inevitable consequences.carter,at.a mortgage assures that the waiver of the homestead exemption,like the waiver of other rights,is made with eyes wide inadvertently,deep in the entrails of a retainer agreement.those who truly wish to waive their homestead do so.
iii.conclusion 
we agree with judge wells statement in her dissent to the original opinion issued below that if we were to recede from carter and sherbill,
t he waiver of the homestead exemption will become an everyday part of contract language for everything from the hiring of counsel to purchasing cellular telephone services.the average citizen,who is of course charged with reading the contracts he or she signs often fails to read or understand boilerplate language detailed in consumer purchase contracts,language which the contracts themselves often permit to be modified upon no more than notification in a monthly statement or bill s uch consumers may lose their homes because of a voluntary divestiture of their homestead rights for nothing more than failure to pay a telephone bill.this inevitably will result in whittling away this century old constitutional exemption until it becomes little more than a distant memory.
