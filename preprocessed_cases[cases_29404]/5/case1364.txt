appellant,campaign for responsible transplantation crt,is a organization dedicated to educating the public about the health risks associated with xenotransplantation,a relatively new procedure whereby animal organs or tissues are transplanted to the human body.since the late,the food and drug administration fda has permitted clinical trials of xenotransplantation products.in order to learn more about these trials,crt submitted a request to fda under the freedom of information act foia,seeking records regarding applications to conduct clinical trials that involve xenotransplantation and past and present clinical trials involving xenotransplantation.crt subsequently narrowed its foia request to include only records pertaining to xenotransplantation clinical trials in investigational new drug ind applications involving xenotransplantation.after crt foia request was constructively denied through agency nonresponse,crt initiated suit in the district court to compel the release of responsive documents.

after fda produced the revised vaughn indices,the parties again moved for summary judgment.this time,the trial court found that the indices were adequate and that the exemptions claimed by fda were valid.in its memorandum opinion,the district court also ordered fda to release documents in all other requested inds that were similar in kind to the documents that had been released for the sample inds.campaign for responsible transplantation fda,civ.action,mem.op.at,reprinted in joint appendix ja crt iii.

on this record,we reverse in part the judgment of the district court and hold that crt was a prevailing party by virtue of the september,memorandum opinion and order.a complainant substantially prevails in litigation only if the court grants some judicial relief.buckhannon bd.care home.dep t of health human,d emphasis and quotation marks omitted.the trial court final order in this fda to release sufficient judicial relief to make crt a prevailing party.crt is therefore eligible for attorney fees.before fees are awarded,however,a party must not only be eligible for attorney party must also be entitled to those fees.see edmonds.because the trial court found crt to be ineligible,it did not reach the question of whether crt was entitled to attorney fees.we therefore remand to the district court for a determination of whether crt is entitled to attorney fees.
background 
on march,crt submitted a written foia request to fda for all records concerning applications for approval to conduct clinical trials that involve xenotransplantation,and all information concerning currently and concluded clinical trials involving xenotransplantation.letter from katherine meyer,attorney representing crt,to betty dorsey,director,foia office,fda,ja.xenotransplantation is defined as any procedure that involves the transplantation,implantation,or infusion into a human recipient of either a live cells,tissues,or organs from a nonhuman animal source or b human body fluids,cells,tissues or organs that have had ex vivo contact with live nonhuman animal cells,tissues,or organs.united states public health service,omb control,guideline on infectious disease issues in xenotransplantation see.it is not disputed that fda has authority under several statutes to regulate xenotransplantation products as drugs or medical devices.see,g,a,b a pts.at the time of the foia request,fda had approved over ind applications,authorizing pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to conduct xenotransplantation clinical trials in humans.
foia is a disclosure statute enacted to facilitate public access to government documents.dep t of state ray,d.a federal agency that receives a foia request must make a determination within working days whether to release the requested documents.a a i.although an agency may seek a brief extension of this deadline,id.a b,it may only continue to withhold responsive records if they fall within one or more of the nine exemptions to the statute disclosure mandate.id.b.
in a letter dated march,fda acknowledged crt foia request and stated that it would respond to the request as soon as possible.crt i,d at.when crt did not receive a response by august,it appealed to the agency.id.after fda failed to respond to the appeal,crt filed suit in the district court on november.id.under a b,when responsive documents have been unjustifiably withheld,a district court has the power to enjoin the agency from withholding agency records and to order the production of any agency records improperly withheld.the agency bears the burden of proving that withheld information is exempt from disclosure.dep t of justice reporters comm.for freedom of the press,d.
over the course of the litigation,crt refined its foia request.initially,crt sought information submitted to fda by third parties,but crt eventually narrowed its request to include only documents.crt i,d at.in an effort to identify all responsive documents held by fda,and further narrow the scope of the litigation,crt moved for a vaughn index of all documents,stating,once defendant produces such an index,plaintiff may have a basis for deciding which,if any,such records it wishes to pursue.id.quoting plaintiff motion brackets omitted.a vaughn index is created by an agency to assist courts and foia requesters when the agency claims that responsive documents are exempt from disclosure.the index is supposed to describe with reasonable specificity the material withheld and justify why each responsive document is exempt from disclosure under foia.king dep t of justice.when creating a vaughn index,a withholding agency must describe each document or portion thereof withheld,and for each withholding it must discuss the consequences of disclosing the information.id.at emphasis omitted.
fda balked at crt request for a comprehensive vaughn index.the agency argued that it would take two years to compile the index sought by crt and require review of nearly a quarter of a million pages of documents.crt i,d at citing defendant motion.in response to crt motion,fda filed a for a sample vaughn index whereby a representative ind would be selected,and fda would compile a vaughn index of the responsive documents for that.
the trial court ruled in favor of fda,allowing the agency to produce a representative sample vaughn index.the trial court accord ed fda deference in its description of the documents in each ind as essentially uniform.id.at quotation marks omitted.fda indicated that it planned to assert the same exemptions for the documents in the sample ind and the same types of documents in the other inds.in other words,in fda view,the sample vaughn index would provide crt and the trial court with all necessary information for all of the inds.id.in order to further ensure the representativeness of the sample,the court allowed crt to choose the ind to be indexed.id.crt chose ind g to be the subject of the sample vaughn index.
in august,fda provided crt with the sample vaughn index for all records concerning ind g,and an additional vaughn index for fda records concerning xenotransplantation that were not related to any particular.br.of appellant at.at that time,fda stated that it would release all nonexempt documents associated with ind g which were not included in the sample vaughn index because they were not exempt.id.crt challenged the adequacy of the sample vaughn index,and complained that fda still had refused to actually release responsive,nonexempt documents.on december,the district court entered an order setting a briefing schedule and ordering fda to release responsive,nonexempt documents before december.id.at.subsequent to that order,fda released hundreds of responsive documents to crt.id.at.
crt and fda moved for summary judgment on the question of whether fda search was reasonable,and also on the question of whether the sample vaughn indices satisfied fda burden of showing that the withheld documents were in fact exempt from disclosure.on september,the district court reviewed the steps that fda had taken to search for responsive documents,and ruled that the agency search was reasonable and therefore adequate.crt ii,d at.the trial court then turned to the question of the adequacy of the vaughn indices.the court found that they were flawed,because t he description,reason for withholding,and do not provide enough information to give this court and the requester a clear indication of the justification for each exemption.id.at.the district court reasoned that the purpose of the vaughn index was to give the requester sufficient information to challenge an agency claim that a document was exempt,and give the court the ability to rule on the withheld documents without having to review voluminous information in camera.id.at.the trial court found that many of the descriptions given by fda only provide d a vague hint at the possible contents of the documents.id.at.the trial court also found that simply listing terms from the general legal standard for the relevant foia exemptions did not provide a clear explanation for why documents were being withheld.id.at quotation marks omitted.finally,the trial court held that fda to other documents violated the requirement that the index be one complete document.id.at.the trial court ordered fda to file new vaughn indices.
after this ruling,crt agreed to further narrow its foia request to include only documents concerning clinical trials involving pigs and nonhuman primates,leaving inds at issue.br.for appellee at.the agency then produced roughly a thousand additional records and parts of records,and substantially revised the vaughn indices for those records that it continued to maintain were exempt from disclosure.br.of appellant at.the parties again filed for summary judgment.
on september,the district court issued an opinion holding that the revised indices were adequate and that the exemptions claimed by fda were valid.crt iii,mem,ja.the court addressed two provisions of foia.first,under b,foia disclosure requirements do not apply to matters that are trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential.the trial court,after reviewing the updated vaughn index as well as supporting affidavits,held that for the five documents that the agency claimed the trade secrets exemption,the fda had fulfilled its burden of justifying nondisclosure because the documents contained confidential,commercial information and trade secrets which,if disclosed,would cause a substantial competitive injury.id.at,ja.second,under b,agencies need not release or memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.the district court agreed with fda that withheld documents were deliberative,and therefore excludable.id.at,ja.
as part of its motion for summary judgment,crt sought not only the withheld documents for the sample inds,but also the immediate disclosure of the other inds that were similar in kind to the representative sample ind id.at,ja quotation marks omitted.in response to this request,the district court ordered fda to disclose all records that were similar in kind to the records that it disclosed for ind id.at,ja.
crt then moved for an award of attorney fees under a e.in order to be eligible for attorney fees,a plaintiff must substantially prevail in its suit.crt argued that the court order stating that fda original vaughn indices were inadequate,the subsequent release of thousands of requested documents,and the september,order requiring the additional release of documents similar in kind to previously released documents were sufficient victories for crt to be a prevailing party.the district court disagreed and denied crt motion.crt iv,d at.this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
crt argues that the district court committed legal error in construing foia prevailing party requirement.thomas sci.we review de novo the district court denial of the award of attorney fees,inasmuch as it rests on an interpretation of the statutory terms that define eligibility for an award.davis dep t of justice,quotation marks omitted.
b.the legal framework for the assessment of attorney fee claims 
the buckhannon decision 
the law governing when a plaintiff is a prevailing party for purposes of statutes is stated in buckhannon and its progeny.buckhannon interpreted the meaning of the term prevailing party in the fair housing amendments act of and the americans with disabilities act of.at.noting that the term appears in n umerous federal statutes that allow courts to award attorney fees and costs.the court rejected the catalyst theory,pursuant to which a plaintiff might be found to be a prevailing party if the plaintiff achieves a desired result because the lawsuit brings about a voluntary change in the defendant conduct.id.at.
buckhannon thus establish ed a framework for construing and applying the prevailing party requirement.thomas,at.under that framework,a prevailing party is one who has been awarded some relief by the court.buckhannon,at.quotation marks omitted.a claimant is successful in litigation when there has been a change in the legal relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant.id.at.quotation marks and brackets omitted.something more than a mere judicial pronouncement is must also be judicial relief on the merits of the plaintiff claim.id.at.emphasis and quotation marks omitted.
buckhannon applied to foia cases 
in oil,chemical atomic workers international union department of energy,ocaw,we held that buckhannon applied to foia cases eligibility for an award of attorney fees in a foia case should be treated the same as eligibility determinations made under other statutes unless there is some good reason for doing otherwise.ocaw,at.we found no good reason to treat foia differently than the statutes at issue in buckhannon.id.at.therefore,in order for plaintiffs in foia actions to become eligible for an award of attorney fees,they must have been awarded some relief by a court.id.at quotations marks and brackets omitted.
the voluntary release of documents versus relief 
under the buckhannon standard,an agency voluntary release of documents does not make a plaintiff a prevailing party in foia litigation,even if the foia lawsuit is a catalyst for the voluntary release.in ocaw,a union sought documents under foia from the united states enrichment corporation and the department of energy.id.at.after the energy department began reviewing and releasing documents,id.at,the trial court approved a stipulation and order which stated in light of defendant production of substantial amounts of material responsive to plaintiff claim for relief in this action,the action is hereby dismissed with prejudice id.we determined that the agency voluntary release of documents did not constitute a decision on the merits.id.therefore,there was no judicial relief that would make the union a prevailing party.id.at.likewise,in davis,the voluntary release of tapes by the federal bureau of investigation fbi did not make the plaintiff a prevailing party,even when the fbi released the tapes because they had been played at trial.at.
in ocaw,however,we noted that if the stipulation between the union and the energy department outlined documents t
