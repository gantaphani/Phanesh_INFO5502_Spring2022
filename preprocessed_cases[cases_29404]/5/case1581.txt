this acrimonious family squabble erupted over the property of the deceased patriarch and spilled over into the courts.the appointed defendant melissa reynoso a granddaughter of the settlor as trustee.in this proceeding,the trial court determined reynoso was the most reliable and credible of the family members.the trial court found that other family members were not credible.
reynoso sold real property of the trust to karen bartholomew a daughter of the settlor.plaintiff anthony pizarro a grandson of the settlor filed a petition for relief against reynoso concerning the sale of the real property.the court denied the petition and ordered pizarro and others to pay the trust attorney fees and costs.
on appeal,pizarro contends the trial court erred in finding that reynoso acted properly as trustee.however,he fails to make a focused,organized,and coherent argument for why we must reverse the order.we therefore conclude he forfeited the argument.
also on appeal,pizarro and bartholomew contend that the award of attorney fees and costs against them was improper.we conclude that the attorney fees and costs were properly and lawfully imposed under the trial court equitable power over the trust,except to the extent the trial court made pizarro and bartholomew personally liable for attorney fees and costs,rather than liable solely from their shares of the trust assets.
we therefore reverse the award of attorney fees and costs to the extent it imposed personal liability.in all other respects,we affirm.
background 
facts and procedure 
willis earl jensen died in,leaving his property,including real property,in a trust.his children included plaintiff keith jensen who is not a party to this appeal and defendant and appellant karen bartholomew.bartholomew has two children plaintiff and appellant pizarro and defendant and respondent reynoso.reynoso was named trustee.
the real property at issue in this proceeding is located on el verano avenue in elverta.reynoso sold the property to bartholomew,as permitted by the trust.
pizarro and jensen filed petitions under probate code section against defendants reynoso as trustee and bartholomew.principally,the petitions alleged that reynoso breached her duties as trustee and that the sale of the property to bartholomew must be set aside.after trial,the court denied the petitions and awarded attorney fees and costs,which award we discuss in more detail later.
statement of decision 
because there remains on appeal a degree of dispute concerning the facts,we relate the statement of decision,which is the fact finder conclusion concerning the facts.we quote without quotation marks the main body of the statement of decision 
the principal controverted issue presented herein is whether the sale of the property located at el verano avenue,elverta,ca,by the trustee melissa reynoso,to karen bartholomew,was a sham sale as alleged by petitioners anthony pizarro and keith jensen.it was not.the court finds that the sale was a valid sale and made in good faith by the trustee reynoso to the beneficiary karen bartholomew.
the two primary witnesses to the transactions involved in the sale were melissa reynoso and karen bartholomew.the court finds melissa reynoso testimony to be credible and convincing.the court finds karen bartholomew testimony to be,in large part,incredible and unconvincing.
on or about february,decedent and settlor,willis earl jensen,executed his will.on or about february,he executed his living trust.for reasons that became obvious at trial,jensen appointed his granddaughter,trustee melissa reynoso,as successor trustee to succeed him at his death,rather than appointing any of his children or other grandchildren.
the living trust,by reference to the last will and testament of willis earl jensen executed february,states,
property located at el verano avenue,elverta,parcel to be sold to my daughter karen bartholomew or any of her children at below appraised value.if karen or her children are unable to purchase property then property to be sold for fair market value.after all debts and fees have been satisfied monies are to be equally divided to my children,except as noted if any of my children are deceased then their share gets equally divided among their children and marilyn kimbrell share gets equally divided among her children.
the el verano property appraised for.therefore,the property could be sold to either bartholomew,reynoso,or pizarro for.the decision of who to sell the property to was left to trustee reynoso.
settlor intent was for either bartholomew,or reynoso,or pizarro,to buy the property.the decision of who to sell it to was left to trustee reynoso.
pursuant to the terms of the trust,trustee reynoso could have sold the el verano property directly from the trust to herself.estate of carrie hazeltine thompson cal d.for reasons stated in her testimony,she did not.instead,she sold the property to her mother,bartholomew,for.
prior to sale,trustee reynoso gave proper notice s as required by law.
prior to the sale,bartholomew represented orally,and by confirming letter from her counsel,that she expected a personal injury settlement to come in that would be in excess of the purchase price.trustee reynoso agreed to help her mother bartholomew purchase the property.trustee reynoso and her husband,miguel,applied for a loan from wells fargo bank,which loan was approved.bartholomew would repay reynoso when her personal injury settlement monies came in.the sale transactions included the following 
on october,trustee reynoso executed a grant deed s transferring el verano from the trust to herself and her husband miguel.concurrently,she executed the corresponding note and deed s of trust to wfb wells fargo bank.this was done because the wells fargo loan was not a trust obligation it was an individual loan to reynoso and her husband.
b.the wfb loan closed on or about october,and the loan funds of approximately were immediately deposited into trust on behalf of bartholomew.the trust was whole.
on october,bartholomew executed her promissory note for to reynoso and her husband miguel.this was consistent with the agreement reynoso and bartholomew had by which reynoso would help bartholomew purchase the property by obtaining a loan in reynoso name because bartholomew could not qualify for a loan on her own and then bartholomew would pay reynoso back when bartholomew personal injury settlement monies came in.
on october,after the wfb loan proceeds were secured and placed in the trust,reynoso and her husband miguel executed trust transfer deed s transferring the property from themselves back to trustee reynoso.
on october,concurrent with the trust transfer deed s identified in above,trustee reynoso executed a trust transfer deed s transferring the property from the trust to bartholomew.
these transactions occurring,for all practical purposes,concurrently,constitute a valid sale of the el verano property from the trustee to bartholomew,all in accordance with the provisions of the trust.there is nothing sham about this transaction as petitioners pizarro and jensen allege.the trust received the net proceeds of sale of approximately and title to the property passed from the trust to bartholomew.that is a sale.the proceeds of the sale remain in the trust today.
from the point of sale to bartholomew,the el verano property was no long er trust property.the cash from the sale now sitting in the trust is trust property.what occurred between bartholomew and reynoso thereafter is outside of the trust.trustee reynoso did not breach any duty owed as a trustee herein.
discussion 
ipizarro contentions as to the merits of the order 
while it is clear pizarro does not like the order denying his petition,it is entirely unclear what specific argument he believes will establish the order must be reversed.the lack of clarity begins with the failure to provide a proper heading to the argument and continues in the text,where he jumps around,criticizing the order but never providing a solid foundation for an argument that we must reverse it.the lack of clarity and coherence continues with his failure to give proper due to the trial court factual determinations.we therefore conclude pizarro forfeited his argument the trial court order on the merits of the controversy must be reversed.
an appellant must s tate each point under a separate heading or subheading summarizing the point,and support each point by argument and,if possible,by citation of authority.cal.rules of court,rule a b opdyk california horse racing bd.th,fn.failure to provide proper headings forfeits issues that may be discussed in the brief but are not clearly identified by a heading.
pizarro briefing in this case presents a scenario similar to the briefing in landa steinberg.landa,in which case the court found the appellant forfeited most of his arguments because he did not sufficiently apprise the court of what argument he was trying to make.in landa,the court wrote we have before us in this case,which involves an appeal from the judgment in favor of plaintiff as well as from an order denying a motion for new trial,an appellant brief of pages.the headings appearing therein are as follows statement of facts,appellant grounds of appeal,excessive damages,the court should have allowed the defendant to introduce evidence of compensation insurance and defendant demurs to plaintiff complaint.under the second heading,appellant grounds of appeal,are listed specifications of error designated by letters of the alphabet,commencing with a and running to u.current rule a b of the california rules of court was designed to lighten the labors of the appellate tribunals by requiring the litigants to present their cause systematically and so arranged that those upon whom the duty devolves of ascertaining the rule of law to apply may be advised,as they read,of the exact question under consideration,instead of being compelled to extricate it from the mass.an appellant brief which fails to comply is equally confusing to the respondent,who labors under an unwarranted handicap in attempting to understandingly reply.there is no reason no great or insurmountable difficulty is presented by the rule why there should not be a compliance.it may possibly be that the heading excessive damages and the one the court should have allowed the defendants to introduce evidence of compensation insurance can be construed as a partial meeting of the requirements.for that reason we shall take note of them instead of dismissing the appeal,but treat the remainder of the brief for what it is,a presentation insufficient to require consideration or comment.landa,supra,at.
in,the supreme court,referring to the rule discussed in landa,wrote this rule has been in effect for many years and its requirements have been repeatedly called to the attention of the members of the bar.cunnyngham cal.
the strength and wisdom of this rule is that it nudges and cajoles the brief writer into focusing and specifying the precise reason we must reverse the trial court action.that did not happen here.pizarro discusses what he perceives as problems with the order,but he fails to organize the discussion into the type of argument that leaves the court with an understanding of his position,instead of just a vague idea of his thoughts.
in pizarro opening brief,the part enumerating his arguments on appeal bears the following headings 
iii.argument and summary of argument 
summary of argument 
standards of review 
statement of decision and argument 
iv.bad faith litigation 
conclusion 
these headings are entirely inadequate to raise any issue on appeal concerning the merits of the order.for that reason,pizarro forfeited any issue he intended to raise on appeal but failed to raise properly according to the rules of court.cal.rules of court,rule a b.
as did the appellant in landa,pizarro also includes a list of his arguments,not as headings but just as a list 
the uncontested facts,both as stipulated and found,constitute multiple breaches of fiduciary duties by the trustee.
the uncontested facts,both as stipulated and found,do not constitute a sale of the el verano real property by the trustee to karen batholomew in accordance with the provisions of the willis earl jensen trust.
the uncontested facts,both as stipulated and found,establish that pizarro did not commence and conduct litigation i that was unfounded and frivolous,or ii in bad faith.

this list precedes a discussion of the standard of review and then a muddle of various statements of fact and law under the heading statement of decision and argument.it is not our responsibility to act as counsel for pizarro and attempt to arrange his arguments coherently.in addition to the failure to provide proper headings,pizarro failure to provide coherent organization to his arguments forfeits consideration of those arguments on appeal.see evans centerstone development th.
pizarro failure to present complete and coherent headings and legal arguments is significant because,as the appellant,it is his burden to overcome the presumption on appeal that the underlying order is correct.denham superior court cal d,judgment of lower court presumed correct error must be affirmatively shown.pizarro manner of briefing does not overcome that presumption.
in any event,what we can decipher of pizarro arguments is without merit.
pizarro claims that reynoso,as trustee,did not sell the el verano property to bartholomew but instead to herself and her husband and selling the property to herself and to her husband violated the provisions of the trust.neither of these claims has merit.
first,pizarro argument that reynoso as trustee sold the el verano property to herself and to her husband and not to bartholomew fails.while the financing arrangement was creative,it was honest.the flexibility inherent in the trust allowed for how reynoso accomplished the sale to bartholomew,including the financing for the sale.as the trial court noted,the transactions made within the short period,all with the aim to provide financing for the purchase to bartholomew,which financing she could not otherwise obtain,were,when viewed reasonably and practically,concurrent transactions constituting a sale of the el verano property by the trust to bartholomew.pizarro offers no authority for the proposition the only way the trial court could view this creative financing arrangement is transaction by transaction when it determined whether it constituted a sale of the property to bartholomew.it would elevate form over substance to reject the financing arrangement as a violation of trust provisions when the transactions achieved an end permissible under the trust.see knapp doherty th,elevating form over substance unjustified.
and second,even if pizarro were correct that the trial court erred by finding reynoso sold the el verano property to bartholomew and that reynoso instead sold the el verano property to herself and her husband,pizarro argument would still not prevail because he provides no authority that including reynoso husband as a buyer violated the trust provision allowing the trustee to sell the property to bartholomew,reynoso in her personal capacity,or pizarro.see in re th,appellant forfeits claim of error by failing to cite authority.we view it as rather unremarkable that,had reynoso decided to sell the property to herself,her husband could be included in the transaction as a buyer.such a sale would still be to reynoso.nonetheless,pizarro argues,with no cited authority,that reynoso sold the property to herself and her husband at variance with the terms of the trust.that legal conclusion is not.and,without authority,the argument is unpersuasive.
one last element of pizarro argument bears comment.in his opening brief,pizarro makes various factual allegations concerning the transactions,which allegations are at odds with the trial court determinations as the finder of fact.for example,pizarro claims reynoso p ressured and induced bartholomew to sign papers and declarations asserting she brought sic the trust property by secretly advising she could live in the property with reynoso and her family.as support for this fact,pizarro cites only to the record of bartholomew testimony,even though the trial court expressly found bartholomew testimony in large part,incredible and unconvincing.
such disregard for the facts as found by the trial court also results in a forfeiture of arguments on appeal.foreman clark fallon cal d.
pizarro forfeited any and all arguments on appeal as to the merits of the trial court order concerning the sale of the el verano property.
award of attorney fees 
the trial court exercised its equitable power over trusts within its jurisdiction by ordering attorney fees and costs against bartholomew and pizarro.the court equitable power includes the power to charge attorney fees and costs against a beneficiary share of the trust if that beneficiary,in bad faith,brings an unfounded proceeding against the trust.rudnick rudnick th,rudnick.on appeal,bartholomew and pizarro contend the court exceeded its equitable powers in ordering attorney fees and costs.we conclude the trial court equitable power over the trust supports its award of attorney fees and costs from the beneficiaries share of the trust assets,but the same equitable power does not support making bartholomew and pizarro personally liable for attorney fees and costs to be paid for with funds that are not trust assets.
the trial court award of attorney fees stated jensen,bartholomew,and pizarro are jointly and severally liable for reynoso attorneys fees and costs incurred herein.these fees shall first be charged against the estate shares of jensen and bartholomew due to them from the trust.to the extent that reynoso fees and costs exceed such shares,jensen,pizarro,and bartholomew,jointly and severally,shall be personally liable for the unpaid portion of the fees.
the trial court relied on rudnick when it ordered attorney fees and costs against bartholomew and pizarro.in rudnick,three beneficiaries of a trust filed objections to a petition to approve a sale of real property by the trustee after a majority of the beneficiaries voted to approve the sale.the trial court overruled the objections and approved the sale.rudnick,supra,th at.after approval of the sale,the trustee filed a motion to charge the trust attorney fees and costs against the objectors share of the trust assets,based on the objector bad faith in objecting to the petition.id.at.the trial court granted the motion because the objectors actions were not in good faith but instead were to disrupt the sale.the objectors created unnecessary delays and asserted disingenuous arguments causing the trust to incur significant legal expenses.id.at.
the rudnick objectors appealed,and the court of appeal affirmed.the rudnick court rejected the objectors contention that the trial court could not impose an award of attorney fees and costs because there was no statutory authority for the award.the court concluded that the lower court did not award attorney fees and costs under its statutory supervisory powers over the action,but instead under the court broad equitable powers that a probate court maintains over the trusts within its jurisdiction.rudnick,supra,th at,original italics.
the holding of rudnick was summarized in that decision as follows w hen a trust beneficiary instigates an unfounded proceeding against the trust in bad faith,a probate court has the equitable power to charge the reasonable and necessary fees incurred by the trustee in opposing the proceeding against that beneficiary share of the trust estate.rudnick,supra,th at.
the rudnick court relied on estate of ivey th ivey,where the court of appeal similarly held that the trial court could exercise its equitable powers over trusts by charging the trust attorney fees and costs against the trust share of those who instituted an unreasonable and bad faith action against the trust.
in ivey,several beneficiaries of a trust challenged the actions of the trustee by filing objections to the trustee account.id.at.the trial court held that the challenge was frivolous and in bad faith and therefore ordered the trustee to pay the trust attorney fees and costs out of the challengers share of future trust distributions.id.at.
the ivey challengers appealed,and the court of appeal upheld the trial court exercise of its equitable powers.the ivey court reasoned that the trial court inherent equitable power over trusts allowed it to protect the trust assets for the benefit of the unoffending beneficiaries by charging the trust attorney fees and costs against the trust interest of the offending beneficiaries,those who frivolously and in bad faith instituted an action to challenge the actions of the trust.ivey,supra,th at.
bartholomew 
bartholomew challenge to the award of attorney fees and costs is that she did not institute a proceeding in this matter,take an unfounded position,and act in bad faith.we conclude that the record supports the trial court exercise of its equitable power to charge attorney fees and costs against bartholomew share of the trust.however,to the extent the trial court required bartholomew personally to pay attorney fees and costs over and above the funds available from her share of the trust proceeds,the court exceeded its equitable powers.the latter conclusion is discussed in the next part in connection with pizarro contention concerning the award.
background 
concerning the award of fees against bartholomew,the court wrote the following in the statement of decision 
bad faith of bartholomew bartholomew wanted to buy el verano even before settlor died.prior to settlor death,bartholomew and settlor discussed a purchase price of.after settlor death,and pursuant to the terms of the trust,trustee reynoso agreed to sell the property to bartholomew.at the time,bartholomew fully understood that she was buying the property for,that reynoso was securing the loan,and that bartholomew would pay reynoso back on the note when bartholomew personal injury monies came in.bartholomew was fully informed and fully on board with the entire plan through october.the property was,in fact,sold to bartholomew.when the litigation began,bartholomew sided with reynoso.she did so because what reynoso was saying was,in fact,the truth.but somewhere along the way,and this court believes that it had to do,at least in part,with jensen,bartholomew turned on reynoso.bartholomew turned so badly that she began,knowingly and willingly,offering false testimony in declaration,at deposition,and at trial,all in an effort to manipulate the outcome of the litigation.knowingly offering false evidence in litigation is a bad faith litigation tactic.
legal authority for fees rudnick rudnick th.
the trial court equitable power over trusts gives the court authority to charge attorney fees and costs against a beneficiary share of the trust estate if the beneficiary,in the words of rudnick,instigate ed an unfounded proceeding against the trust in bad faith.rudnick,supra,th at.bartholomew argues that attorney fees and costs can not be charged against her share of the trust estate because she did not bring a proceeding in this matter,she did not take an unfounded position,she did not act in bad faith,and she is not a party to this action.we find no merit in the arguments.
first,bartholomew argues that she did not instigate or bring an action against the estate and therefore can not be charged for attorney fees and costs under rudnick.however,we conclude that whether bartholomew instigated or brought an action against the estate is not material because the court broad equitable powers over trust assets are sufficient to justify an award of attorney fees and costs against any trust beneficiary who takes an unfounded position and litigates in bad faith,causing the trust to incur fees and costs.
in rudnick,the offending beneficiaries were the ones who instigated the action against the trust,objecting to the sale of trust assets.therefore,it was appropriate in the court holding to refer to that fact,stating,when a trust beneficiary instigates an unfounded proceeding against the trust in bad faith,attorney fees and costs may be charged against the offending beneficiary share of the trust estate.but we do not read that language as limiting the broad equitable powers of the
