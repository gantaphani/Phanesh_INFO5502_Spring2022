facts and procedural background 
olsen is an attorney who represented a plaintiff in an earlier personal injury case.when that case approached trial,olsen associated harbison,also an attorney,as,under a contract to split the contingent attorney fees.soon thereafter the personal injury plaintiff discharged olsen as counsel.the personal injury case was resolved by a settlement,and harbison received attorney fees.
harbison declined olsen demand for a portion of the fees to which olsen claims he is entitled under the contract.on february,olsen,in propria persona,filed a complaint initiating this action seeking to recover a portion of the fees under counts alleging breach of contract and quantum meruit.in april of,olsen amended the complaint to add counts alleging fraud and intentional interference with contractual relations.the amended complaint was served some time prior to august.in february of,olsen,now represented by the law firm of friedberg parker,filed a second amended complaint,again with the additional counts alleging fraud and interference.this complaint was served by mail on february.
a spate of acrimonious law and motion proceedings ensued.for example,there was a motion to disqualify edward freidberg as opposing counsel an appeal of denial of that motion,a motion seeking a stay,a writ seeking to overturn the denial of the stay,demurrer proceedings,interrogatories,requests for production,requests for admissions,and cross motions to compel discovery or further discovery.
the stay efforts as to the motion to disqualify freidberg were unsuccessful.the discovery disputes were resolved on november and,by orders compelling further answers to interrogatories,production of documents,and depositions of olsen and harbison.the latter deposition was to commence on december.on november,harbison filed a renewed motion to stay the proceedings pending resolution of the disqualification appeal.on november,the trial court issued a tentative ruling proposing to deny that stay motion.
that day november,harbison filed combined motions for the court to exercise discretion to hear his motion,to grant his motion on the merits,and for judgment on the pleadings.in his view,the filing of the notice of motion resulted in an automatic stay of discovery.
on december,olsen filed a motion to strike the motion on the grounds the motion could not be filed more than days after service of the complaint without first obtaining an order so permitting,and the motion was tendered solely for purposes of delay.
harbison opposition to the motion to strike replies as follows.there is no requirement for an order granting permission to file an motion more than days after service of the complaint.there is no requirement of good cause for hearing such a belated motion.nonetheless,the explanation for the delay is that it had not occurred to harbison that the case was appropriate for an motion until he consulted with counsel ronald mallen of hinshaw culbertson.then he waited to try to obtain permission from his malpractice insurance carrier,which had previously denied coverage,to retain mallen.he did not retain mallen until the carrier again refused coverage.after mallen was retained,his firm prepared the motion.the motion was not filed to obtain delay,but in the belief it had merit.
these matters came on for hearing on december.after taking the matter under submission,the court issued a written order on january,denying olsen and harbison motions.in pertinent part the ruling is as follows.an motion filed more than days after service of the complaint is not subject to a motion to strike.however,it can be heard only at the discretion of the court.the motion is denied on the ground that it is dilatory,without good cause for failing to bring the motion earlier.harbison filed such motion nine months after service of the second amended complaint,asserting an inability to file earlier due to the failure of harbison then legal counsel harbison to comprehend or consider the potential application of the slapp procedure to causes of action that had persisted in olsen complaint.such explanation does not justify a delay of more than a after the fraud and interference causes of action first appeared in the lawsuit.the slapp statute is intended to provide an aggrieved defendant with a shield through the prompt resolution of meritless claims prior to the significant expenditure of litigation resources,not a sword to be wielded whenever it becomes strategically convenient.the parties have already expended substantial resources in litigating all of the claims,including those addressed by the slapp motion.harbison has compelled and obtained discovery from olsen bearing directly upon the two target causes of action.in sum,the motion comes too late,without legitimate excuse.
on january,harbison filed a notice of appeal from the order on august,olsen filed this motion to dismiss the appeal as frivolous.
discussion 
section,subdivision f subdivision f,states in pertinent part the motion may be filed within days of the service of the complaint or,in the court discretion,at any later time upon terms it deems proper.the period commences with the service of the most recent complaint or amended complaint in the action,lam ngo th,d,and authorities cited.
here,the second amended complaint was served on february.harbison motion was filed days later,on november.exercising its discretion,the trial court found the motion untimely.
both the legislature and the supreme court have acknowledged the ironic unintended consequence that procedures,enacted to curb abusive litigation,are also prone to abuse.as to abuse occasioned by the stay of proceedings on appeal of the denial of an motion,the supreme court has encouraged us to resolve these appeals as expeditiously as possible.to this end,reviewing courts should dismiss frivolous appeals as soon as practicable and do everything in their power to prevent frustration of the relief granted.varian medical systems,delfino,supra,at,d.the question is whether this appeal is appropriate for such dismissal 
in re marriage of flaherty cal d,provides the standard.a n appeal should be held to be frivolous only when it is prosecuted for an improper harass the respondent or delay the effect of an adverse when it indisputably has no any reasonable attorney would agree that the appeal is totally and completely without merit.id.at.
olsen contends the appeal is frivolous because there is ample reason to infer that harbison motive was to delay his deposition and there is no reasonable basis for him to have concluded he might be successful on appeal.olsen notes that in order to succeed,harbison would have to show the trial court abused its discretion in declining to hear the untimely motion.olsen submits there is no basis in the record for a reasonable expectation of success in showing an abuse of discretion 
in his opposition to the motion to dismiss,harbison asserts that the trial court improperly exercised or failed to exercise the discretion accorded
