the circuit court of kane county entered an order declaring void a previous order of that court awarding attorney fees to plaintiff,ford motor credit company ford credit.the circuit court held that because the law firm representing ford credit had failed to register with this court,pursuant to our rule c c,the firm practice of law was unauthorized,and,accordingly,there was no valid basis upon which the court could award legal fees.a majority of the appellate court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court.d.for the reasons that follow,we reverse the judgment of the appellate court and vacate the order of the circuit court.
background 
in june,defendant,thomas sperry,leased an automobile from sycamore auto center,sycamore.thereafter,sycamore assigned the lease to ford credit.in december,ford credit filed suit against defendant,alleging that defendant had breached the terms of the motor vehicle lease.as a remedy for defendant breach,ford credit sought the return of the vehicle and monetary damages.
in response to the lawsuit lodged against him by ford credit,defendant filed a counterclaim against ford credit and a action against sycamore.defendant alleged that ford credit and sycamore had engaged in various fraudulent activities with respect to the vehicle lease.only defendant counterclaim against ford credit is at issue in this appeal.in august,ford credit lawsuit against defendant,as well as defendant counterclaim against ford credit,went to trial.following defendant presentation of his case,ford credit moved for a directed verdict on several counts of defendant counterclaim,including count v.in count v,defendant alleged that ford credit had violated provisions of the consumer fraud and deceptive business practices act ilcs et west.after hearing the evidence,the circuit court granted ford credit a directed verdict against defendant on this consumer fraud count.
thereafter,on november,ford credit petitioned the circuit court for statutory attorney fees available to it as the prevailing party in the consumer fraud action see ilcs c west.the evidence adduced with respect to this claim showed that,during the entire course of these proceedings,ford credit was represented by attorney mary schulz.at the time ford credit complaint was filed,schulz practiced with the professional service corporation law firm of vigil,berkley,schulz and gordon.after that firm dissolved,schulz continued to represent ford credit in these proceedings as the principal in her own newly created professional service corporation law firm,schulz associates,
on may,the circuit court awarded ford the prevailing party in the consumer fraud attorney fees in the amount of.defendant neither filed a motion with the circuit court to reconsider this award,nor filed an appeal of this judgment with the appellate court.in may year after the judgment for attorney fees was credit commenced collection proceedings against defendant on the attorney fees award.
on february,months after the circuit court entered the original judgment against defendant for attorney,pro se,filed in the circuit court a pleading entitled first amended motion to vacate the void orders of this court.in this pleading,brought pursuant to section f of the code of civil procedure ilcs f west,defendant requested that the circuit court vacate the may,order awarding statutory attorney fees to ford credit.defendant asserted that when the professional service corporation of vigil,berkley,schulz and gordon,initiated the lawsuit against him in,that firm lacked a certificate of registration with this court,as required pursuant to our rule c c.defendant also alleged that when that same law firm petitioned the circuit court for attorney fees in,it remained unregistered under rule c.based upon the firm lack of registration with this court,defendant asserted that ford credit was not represented by any entities authorized by the illinois supreme court to practice law in the state of illinois,and that the law firm was thereby prohibited from opening or maintaining an office for that purpose.accordingly,defendant argued,the filing of the lawsuit against him did not confer jurisdiction upon the circuit court.thus,defendant concluded,because the law firm was prohibited from practicing law in the state of illinois as a result of its failure to register pursuant to rule c,the attorney fees award was null and void ab initio.
a hearing on defendant motion was held on march.at that time,defendant had retained counsel and was no longer appearing pro se.counsel for defendant argued that pursuant to the corporation practice of law prohibition act ilcs et west,a corporation is prohibited from practicing law,unless that entity falls within the ambit of the professional service corporation act ilcs et west.in turn,counsel argued,the professional service corporation act specifies that it is this court which shall determine how professional corporations shall be organized to practice law,and it is through the provisions of rule that this court allows professional corporations to practice law.
counsel further argued that because the professional service corporation law firms representing ford credit were not registered with this court pursuant to rule c,those firms were engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.accordingly,counsel stated,the order granting those law firms attorney fees was therefore void.in addition,counsel further asserted that because the motion to vacate the judgment granting ford credit attorney fees was brought pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure ilcs f west,the motion was not untimely,as section provides that a void order can be set aside at any time.
at the hearing on defendant motion,ford credit was again represented by attorney mary schulz.in response to defendant arguments,ford credit counsel first noted that there was no dispute that,during these proceedings,she was a duly licensed attorney in good standing with this court.counsel then stressed that the licensing requirements imposed by this court upon attorneys is distinguishable from the registration requirements for professional service corporation law firms contained within rule c.counsel argued that rule is an administrative rule which allows this court to identify the individuals who are involved in a professional service corporation and to assure that these persons are licensed to practice law in this state.the administrative provisions of rule,counsel asserted,are in contrast to the licensing and regulation provisions in our rules.counsel emphasized that licenses to practice law are not given to law firms rather,they are awarded to individuals.further,counsel stated,the law firms for which licensed attorneys practice are not,themselves,licensed to practice law.
during the course of the hearing,counsel also advised the court that the firm with which she practiced at the time ford credit complaint was filed,vigil,berkley,schulz and gordon,had since dissolved in may,and she believed that firm had not been registered with this court pursuant to rule.counsel further stated that she then set up her own professional service corporation law firm,schulz associates,which was,at the time of the hearing,in the process of rule registration with this court.counsel concluded her argument by reiterating her position that registration under rule is purely administrative and is not analogous to the grant of a license to practice law.
on april,the circuit court granted defendant motion to vacate the judgment order of may,which had awarded ford credit statutory attorney fees.as an initial matter,the court found that it was uncontroverted that ford credit attorney throughout these proceedings,mary schulz,was duly licensed to practice law in this state.in addition,the circuit court acknowledged that,at the time of its ruling,the law firm of schulz associates,had registered with this court pursuant to rule c.
however,the circuit court also found that it was uncontroverted that the law firms with which schulz practiced during this litigation had not registered under rule c.the circuit court held that the most pertinent case was kaplan tabb associates,d,because it presented striking similarities to the cause before it.the circuit court explained that in kaplan,the plaintiff and the defendant architectural firm signed a contract for architectural services.when a monetary dispute arose between the plaintiff and the defendant firm,that firm sought to invoke the contract arbitration provision.the plaintiff sought to have the contract declared void due to the failure of the defendant firm to be licensed under the illinois architecture practice act of ilcs west.the circuit court in the instant cause emphasized that the kaplan court held that,even though the sole owner of the defendant firm was a duly licensed architect,the contract was nevertheless void due to the failure of the defendant firm to become licensed under the architecture practice act.
the circuit court acknowledged that there were factual differences between the kaplan case and the matter before it.nevertheless,the circuit court followed kaplan and held that,in the instant cause,the law firms representing ford credit were in violation of the registration requirement of rule c at the time of trial and also when the attorney fees award was made in may.the circuit court reasoned 
the kaplan case is essentially controlling here.the mere fact that the attorneys here were licensed is immaterial to the court determination.since the corporations were not registered they can not now claim the benefit of statutory fees when the lack of registration of these corporations precluded them from holding themselves out as organizations for the practice of law in the state of illinois.
as a result,the circuit court held that the order for award of attorney fees was void ab initio,and the court therefore vacated that order.
ford credit appealed.a majority of the appellate court affirmed.d.the appellate majority equated a law firm failure to register pursuant to rule c with the unauthorized practice of law.in support of this determination,the appellate majority principally relied on remole soil service,benson,d,which held that legal proceedings prosecuted by those without authority are null,and that the judgments resulting from such proceedings are void.thus,the appellate majority concluded that because the law firms representing ford credit during the instant litigation performed legal services without authorization and in violation of the law,the circuit court correctly determined that the order awarding ford credit statutory attorney fees was void ab initio.
justice kapala dissented.first,the dissenting justice asserted that the circuit court erred in allowing defendant motion to vacate the judgment granting ford credit attorney fees because that motion was an improper collateral attack on a final order.second,justice kapala believed that even if defendant had properly appealed the award of attorney fees within the applicable time to appeal that order,the appellate court prior decision in joseph storto,becker,d,controlled and defeated defendant claim.justice kapala explained that in storto,the court held that rule c was not enacted for the protection of public safety and,therefore,contractual obligations owed to a law firm not properly registered under rule c could not be voided absent a showing of prejudice resulting from a failure to register.thus,based upon the holding in storto,the dissenting justice concluded that the circuit court erred in voiding the judgment order awarding statutory attorney fees to ford credit.
we granted ford credit leave to appeal to this court.a.
in the instant cause,the circuit court,pursuant to section f of the code of civil procedure ilcs f west,vacated a prior judgment order entered on may,reasoning that the may order awarding statutory attorney fees to ford credit was void ab initio because the law firms representing ford credit lacked rule c registration with this court.at issue in this appeal is whether a law firm failure to register as a professional service corporation with this court,pursuant to the requirement set forth in our rule c,renders the legal services provided by that law firm the unauthorized practice of law,nullifies the proceedings in which the firm participated,and causes the resulting judgments of such proceedings to be void.our review of this issue is de novo.people johnson.
petitions for relief from judgments filed pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure ilcs west invoke the equitable powers of the circuit court,which should prevent enforcement of a judgment when it would be unfair,unjust,or unconscionable.smith airoom.at issue in the instant cause is subsection f of section,which provides nothing contained in this section affects any existing right to relief from a void order or judgment,or to employ any existing method to procure that relief.ilcs f west.section f codifies a common law rule allowing litigants to attack a void judgment at any time.see sarkissian chicago board of education.in a petition to vacate a void judgment brought pursuant to subsection f of section,the general rules pertaining to petitions filed under section they must be brought within two years of the order of judgment,that the petitioner must allege a meritorious defense to the original action,and that the petitioner must show that the petition was brought with due not apply.sarkissian,at.rather,t he allegation that the judgment or order is void substitutes for and negates the need to allege a meritorious defense and due diligence.sarkissian,at.
a void order or judgment is,generally,one entered by a court without jurisdiction of the subject matter or the parties,or by a court that lacks the inherent power to make or enter the order involved.in re estate of steinfeld,ill d,people wade.a void judgment is from its inception a complete nullity and without legal effect.in re application of the cook county collector for judgment sale against lands lots returned delinquent for nonpayment of general taxes for the year,d,in re marriage of allcock,d.we have cautioned,however,that in declaring a prior order to be void,the court must be mindful that it is setting aside a final judgment based upon a collateral attack.accordingly,we have recently held that b ecause of the disastrous consequences which follow when orders and judgments are allowed to be collaterally attacked,orders should be characterized as void only when no other alternative is possible.belleville toyota,toyota motor sales,quoting in re marriage of vernon,d.
in its submission to this court,ford credit contends that the lower courts erred in holding that the judgment order awarding ford credit statutory attorney fees was void ab initio.according to ford credit,the appellate court majority improperly equated a law firm failure to register with this court pursuant to rule c with the unauthorized practice of law.ford credit notes that the sole claim raised by defendant in the circuit court to support his argument that the attorney fees award is void and should be vacated is that the law firms hired by ford credit did not register with this court under rule.the circuit court held,and the appellate majority agreed,that this defect alone was sufficient to void the previously entered judgment order.
ford credit argues that there are several points upon which the appellate court should be reversed.first,ford credit notes that in arriving at its ruling,the appellate majority improperly relied upon remole soil service,benson,d,a case which ford credit asserts is factually inapposite to the matter at bar.ford credit additionally contends that,by relying upon remole,the appellate majority failed to follow its own factually relevant precedent.ford credit notes that only a few months prior to filing its ruling in the instant cause,the appellate court decided joseph storto,becker,d,wherein the court ruled that a law firm failure to register pursuant to our rule c did not result in the voiding of a contract for attorney fees.
second,ford credit observes that the appellate majority failed to consider that the judgment award for statutory attorney fees was in its own favor as the prevailing party in the consumer fraud action,and was not awarded to its law firms.third,ford credit notes that,at all times during this litigation,it was represented by attorneys who were duly licensed to practice law in this state.as such,ford credit contends,there was no unauthorized practice of law by any lawyer involved in this case.in addition,ford credit asserts that the lower courts failed to consider the fact that the law firm of schulz associates,was properly registered with this court on april,the date on which the circuit court entered its decision to void the attorney fees judgment order.finally,ford credit contends that the judgment order awarding statutory attorney fees was not void,because there was no claim that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction over either the subject matter or the parties.as such,ford credit concludes,defendant motion to vacate the judgment order awarding attorney fees was an improper collateral attack.
in response,defendant asserts that the circuit court properly granted his motion to vacate the judgment order awarding ford credit statutory attorney fees,and that the action of the circuit court was properly affirmed by the appellate majority.in his submission to this court,defendant contends that by failing to advise the circuit court that their law firms lacked registration with this court pursuant to rule c,ford attorneys had committed a fraud on the court.defendant contends that all work performed on behalf of ford credit and itemized in the fee petition occurred while the law firms lacked the required registration,and that illinois statutes and rule prohibit the collection of legal fees by a corporation that has failed to obtain a certificate of registration.as a result,defendant contends,the judgment order awarding attorney fees to ford credit is void as against public policy.
in his brief to this court,defendant further urges this court to hold that the fee award to ford was void because it exceeded the trial court inherent power and authority by infringing on the exclusive authority of the illinois supreme court to regulate the practice of law in illinois by professional service corporation law firms.defendant concludes by arguing that because ford credit had no right to recover attorney fees paid to professional service corporations which were not authorized to practice,the circuit court did not acquire subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate such a claim for fees nor to enter judgment thereon in favor of ford.we reject each of defendant arguments.
this court has the inherent power to define and regulate the practice of law in this state.in re anastaplo,people ex rel.chicago bar ass goodman.more specifically,the power to prescribe rules governing attorney conduct,and to discipline attorneys for violating those rules,rests solely in this court.people ex rel.brazen finley.
to this end,our court has promulgated rules which set forth detailed regulations for the study of law and which govern the admission of applicants to our state bar.see rs.through.this court has also created a comprehensive scheme to regulate attorneys and discipline them for misconduct.as part of this regulatory scheme,we have promulgated rules of professional conduct for attorneys see rs.through,and have constituted an attorney registration and disciplinary commission ardc,and created the office of an administrator to supervise t he registration of,and disciplinary proceedings affecting,members of the illinois bar.a.in addition,this court has promulgated detailed rules which prescribe the appropriate discipline when the rules of professional conduct are violated.see rs.through rs.this court has also created a procedural framework within which the ardc performs its duties to investigate complaints of misconduct against licensed attorneys,hold hearings on those complaints,and provide review of the findings with respect to those complaints.
the regulatory rules which govern the admission of lawyers to our state bar,regulate the practice of law and the conduct of lawyers,and prescribe discipline for lawyer misconduct are intended to safeguard the public and assure the integrity of our legal system.these regulatory provisions assure that only those individuals who are fit and qualified to practice law will be licensed in this state,that those individuals will practice law ethically and with competence,and that any infractions of the rules of professional conduct will be investigated and discipline will be imposed if appropriate.
in contrast to the regulatory rules discussed above,the provisions contained in our rule do not have as their primary purpose the protection of the public safety.rather,rule is designed to permit duly licensed lawyers the business option of organizing in professional service corporations as a means of providing them with limited liability protection.
under the corporation practice of law prohibition act ilcs et west,a corporation is prevented from practicing law.however,with the passage of the professional service corporation act ilcs et west,licensed professionals were afforded the choice of organizing their practices in a corporate form.by enacting the professional service corporation act,the legislature intended to 
provide for the incorporation of an individual or group of individuals to render the same professional service or related professional services to the public for which such individuals are required by law to be licensed while preserving the established professional aspects of the personal relationship between the professional person and those he serves professionally.ilcs west.
section of the professional service corporation act requires that the corporations organized and incorporated under this act must render professional services only through its officers,employees and agents who are duly licensed to render such professional services within this state.ilcs west.section of the professional service corporation act specifically applies to attorneys at law and provides 
t he provisions of this act shall be applicable to attorneys at law only to the extent and under such terms and conditions as the supreme court of illinois shall determine to be necessary and appropriate.ilcs west.
it is through rule that this court allows duly licensed lawyers the option to organize their law firms under one of several statutory vehicles providing limited liability,including professional service corporations.paragraph a of rule requires that each corporate shareholder and any employee engaged in the practice of law must be licensed to practice law,and that the entity shall do nothing which,if done by an individual attorney,would violate the standards of professional conduct applicable to attorneys licensed by this court.a paragraph b of this rule requires that the corporation,and the attorneys practicing through this entity,must abide by the standards of professional conduct applicable to attorneys licensed by this court.b.paragraph c requires each corporation or association that seeks to practice law to register with this court.see c.specifically,rule c provides 
c no corporation or association or limited liability company shall engage in the practice of law in illinois,or open or maintain an establishment for that purpose in illinois,without a certificate of registration issued by this court.
the initial registration application requires a fee of e,and annual renewals must be accompanied by a fee f.finally,any violation of this rule by the entity is a ground for the court to terminate or suspend the right of the entity to practice law or otherwise to discipline it.b.
in the matter before us,defendant sole claim in the circuit court to support his argument that the judgment order awarding attorney fees to ford credit is void and must be vacated is that the law firms representing ford credit throughout the litigation were not registered with this court pursuant to rule c.the circuit court held,and the appellate majority agreed,that this defect alone rendered the previously entered judgment order void,as the law firm failure to register under rule c equated with the unauthorized practice of law.we reject this analysis.we hold that a correct interpretation of the scope and purpose of our rule c was set for
