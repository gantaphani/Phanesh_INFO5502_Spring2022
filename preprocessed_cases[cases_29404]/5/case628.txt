background 
airspect entered into a lease with the city to operate a operation at the international airport.in compliance with the lease,airspect constructed a square foot building,hangar,ramp,and fuel farm collectively,the improvements.after various disputes concerning the terms of the lease,airspect withheld payments from the city.
in june,airspect sued in the court of common pleas of summit county,ohio.it asserted claims for breach of contract,misrepresentation,and constructive eviction,and prayed for million in compensatory damages and rescission of the lease.the city,in turn,alleged that airspect had materially breached the lease,and sought to recover damages,to evict airspect from its leasehold,and to recover the improvements.
in december,airspect counsel withdrew from the litigation,so airspect retained nischwitz in march,airspect filed a voluntary chapter petition in the bankruptcy court.the state lawsuit was stayed and then transferred to the bankruptcy court as an adversary proceeding in the chapter reorganization.
in may,airspect,acting as a debtor in possession,applied to the bankruptcy court for authorization to employ nischwitz as special counsel for the purpose of litigating airspect suit against the city.the application requested a retainer and stated that the parties had reached a contingency fee agreement with the following terms fees,other than expenses,are to be paid on a contingency basis and are subject to approval by this court.the fee agreement states if settled at least two weeks before trial if within two weeks of trial or,after commencement of trial if or.the bankruptcy court issued an order authorizing nischwitz employment.specifically,the order provided that airspect is authorized to pay the sum of of corporate funds as partial retainer for expenses and that nischwitz must submit application for fees to this court for approval.
the city filed a motion for a termination of the automatic stay,arguing that the lease had terminated by operation of law pursuant to d when airspect failed to assume or reject the lease within sixty days after the date of the order for relief.the bankruptcy court agreed that the lease was rejected pursuant to d.the court determined,however,that airspect had significant equity in the improvements,and denied the city motion for relief from the stay and allowed airspect to remain in possession of the property.the city appealed to the united states district court for the northern district of ohio.in july,the district court reversed the bankruptcy court denial of relief from the stay,holding that airspect rejection of the lease meant that the city was entitled to immediate possession of the leased premises.the parties settled the matter during the pendency of an appeal to this court.
meanwhile,the adversary proceeding between airspect and the city proceeded.in,the bankruptcy court transferred the matter to the district court.in,the parties reached a settlement whereby the city agreed to accept the sale of airspect assets to a new fixed base operator found by airspect,or pay airspect the sum of in exchange for airspect surrender of the leased premises and the improvements.the bankruptcy court approved the settlement and the district court dismissed the lawsuit.eventually,the city elected to pay to airspect.
in,nischwitz filed a fee application in the bankruptcy court.nischwitz requested per the contingency fee agreement.airspect sole,spasoje miskovic,filed objections to nischwitz fee application.the trustee had no objection to nischwitz application.
the bankruptcy court approved only in fees for nischwitz.it denied nischwitz request for payment under the contingency fee agreement,finding that the contingency a trial or settlement had not been met because the lawsuit had been resolved incidental to a sale of the lease and the improvements as part of a global settlement between the parties.consequently,the court awarded what it deemed reasonable compensation to nischwitz pursuant to a of the bankruptcy code it found that only those services rendered prior to september,when the bankruptcy court ruled that airspect had rejected the lease,conferred a benefit upon the estate.accordingly,the court awarded nischwitz fees of for the hours worked prior to september.
the bap reversed,holding that nischwitz had satisfied the contingency agreement by settling the case and rejecting the bankruptcy court characterization of the settlement as a sale.the bap found that the bankruptcy court had approved the contingency agreement pursuant to of the bankruptcy code and,thus,was required to honor the agreement unless it proved improvident in light of subsequent events.this decision was not appealed.
on remand,the bankruptcy court found that it had improvidently approved the contingency fee agreement in light of the lease rejection by operation of law.the court stated,had such a fact been comprehended,the need for debtor to retain special litigation counsel on a contingency basis to prosecute the only then remaining claim in the adversary proceeding breach of contract would not have been as great because,at that point,debtor had,as a matter of law,been deemed to have breached that contract.the court then evaluated nischwitz application under again,and again awarded nischwitz.the court also noted that it did not consider nischwitz retention to have been approved under of the bankruptcy code,despite the bap holding.
the bap again reversed the bankruptcy court.the bap held that the lease rejection had not rendered the fee agreement improvident because it was irrelevant since the damages that nischwitz had been retained to recover were actionable whether the lease was terminated or not.the bap also reaffirmed that the bankruptcy court had approved the contingency fee agreement under.it dismissed the bankruptcy court argument that nischwitz failure to cite in his application,and the provision in the retention order requiring nischwitz to submit application for fees to this court for approval precluded the conclusion that the fee agreement had been approved pursuant to.miskovic appealed.the trustee also appealed based on his authority to be heard on any issue in any case or proceeding under the bankruptcy code.
