background 
mhc is a real estate investment trust based in chicago.manufactured home,cnty.of san diego mhc,cir.mhc owns and operates mobile home parks throughout the united states.id.mhc has three parks in unincorporated areas of san diego county,called lamplighter village,rancho valley,and rancho mesa.id.this appeal is based on allegedly defamatory statements made by supervisor dianne jacob in response to two events at the parks.
the first event was mhc initiation of phased rent increases at all three parks in july.id.these rent increases led tenants to complain to jacob about mhc.
the second event was a sewage backup at rancho valley.the backup occurred at the mobile home of mike dmochowski and his family on thursday,december.dmochowski informed mhc of the backup on december.mhc hired mbg construction to clean up the sewage.mbg construction,in turn,subcontracted to flood rescue service.
on saturday,december,a member of the rancho valley homeowners association reported the backup to san diego county hazardous incident report team hirt.tony torres at hirt contacted terry hanifin at mhc.according to a chronology of events prepared by chimene adams,jacob policy advisor,hanifin told torres that the situation was under control.according to llew munter,an employee of the san diego department of environmental health deh,hanifin told torres that the problem had been resolved.hanifin also told torres that the carpet at the dmochowskis mobile home had been removed and that the home would be cleaned and sanitized by monday,december.based on hanifin assurance that the situation was under control,or that the problem had been resolved,hirt did not send a team to rancho valley during the weekend.
after receiving more complaints about the sewage backup,hirt sent a team to rancho valley on monday,december.when the team arrived at six that evening,it discovered that,although flood rescue service had indeed been working on the problem,the dmochowskis home was still unfit for habitation.according to a report by richard haas,deputy director of deh,the dmochowskis were still living in the home despite its condition.the dmochowskis stated that they wanted to leave but could not afford to do so.many of the owners complained to the hirt team about the backup and about mhc inaction.
supervisor jacob criticized mhc in numerous statements both before and after the sewage backup.we describe here the six statements on which mhc bases its appeal.
first,jacob spoke at a lamplighter village tenant meeting on november,three weeks before the sewage backup.mhc,at.jacob criticized mhc and its decision to increase rents.she said 
we are working with county counsel,our new district attorney bonnie dumanis and your attorneys to determine whether or not there are civil criminal actions that should be filed against the company.
second,on november,one of jacob assistants,with jacob approval,sent an email to residents of the three parks.the email included a summary of jacob statements at the november meeting at lamplighter village.the email included the following statement 
i have already talked with county counsel and district attorney elect bonnie dumanis and they are very interested in following up to determine whether or not there are civil criminal actions that should be filed against the company.
third,on december,jacob was interviewed during a television broadcast about the sewage backup at rancho valley.jacob made the following statement 
this company in this case lied to the county.said to the county that everything was fine,the sewage situation was fixed.and,in fact,it was not.
fourth,as part of the same televised interview on december,jacob said 
mhc has a reputation throughout the country of running people out of older mobile home parks,increasing the value of the park,and then selling it at a profit.
fifth,on december,an article in the san diego union tribune quoted jacob as saying the following about mhc rent increases 
it a deliberate attempt to force these people out of their homes in order for the company to move newer mobile homes in,increase the value of the park and sell it for a profit they have done this throughout the country,not just here in san diego county.
sixth,on january,jacob spoke at a meeting at lamplighter village.according to the talking points she used at the meeting,she said 
december,mhc deliberately lied to the county about the sewage in the dmochoskis sic mobilehome.mhc told the county not to respond to the sewage in this unit because mhc said that it had everything under control.that was a lie.it was a dangerous lie for the family that lives there and who had to contend with raw sewage in their home.mhc put the health and safety of this family in jeopardy and mhc should be ashamed of itself.
mhc filed suit against san diego county in federal district court for the southern district of california on november,alleging a variety of claims a violation of the equal protection clause,a violation of the first amendment,a taking in violation of the fifth and fourteenth amendments,and a violation of substantive due process.in its first amended complaint,mhc added jacob as a defendant,alleging a violation of the first amendment.mhc,at.in its second amended complaint,mhc added claims of trade libel defamation and tortious interference with prospective economic advantage against the county and supervisor jacob,based on jacob statements.id.
defendants filed an motion to strike mhc two causes of action.the district court granted the motion,concluding that jacob statements were statements of opinion rather than false assertions of fact.a week later,the court dismissed mhc federal claims against defendants.the court separately awarded attorney fees on mhc claims under and on the motion to strike under the statute.
a prior panel of this court affirmed the dismissal of the federal claims,but reversed the grant of the motion to strike mhc claims.the panel described mhc argument as follows 
mhc notes,for instance,jacob statement that mhc lied to the county.said to the county that everything was fine,the sewage situation was fixed.and,in fact,it was not.mhc argues that this statement refers to specific circumstances and times and therefore is susceptible of interpretation as a provably false assertion of fact similarly,mhc argues that a reasonable person could interpret jacob statement that mhc has a reputation throughout the country of running people out of older mobilehome parks,increasing the value of the park,and then selling it at a profit as a falsifiable assertion of fact.finally,mhc calls attention to jacob claim that the incoming district attorney was very interested in following up to determine whether there are civil criminal actions that should be filed against mhc.
mhc,at bracketed numbers added.
the panel concluded that although the district court may have been correct in its assessment that each of these statements is properly interpreted as an assertion of opinion rather than fact,a reasonable factfinder could disagree with that assessment.id.at.it therefore held that as to the statements concerning these matters,we can not declare as a matter of law that no reasonable person could construe them as provably false.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the district court as to these statements.id.the panel declined to reach the issue of whether mhc had proffered sufficient evidence to establish a probability of success in demonstrating that jacob statements were false,leaving that issue to the district court in the first instance.id.at.judge callahan dissented.id.at callahan,dissenting.she argued that all of the statements were statements of opinion rather than fact,and that even if they were statements of fact,mhc had failed to make a prima facie case that the statements were false.id.
on remand,defendants filed a renewed motion to strike under the statute.the district court granted the motion.manufactured home,cnty.of san diego,d.the court analyzed only the three statements to which our prior panel had referred in its opinion.id.at.the court concluded that mhc had failed to make a prima facie showing that any of these statements was false.id.it did not discuss the other statements making similar criticisms of mhc.
in a separate order,the district court awarded attorney fees under the statute.the award included fees not only for the motion to strike,but also for the original motion to strike.
mhc appealed both the grant of the motion to strike and the award of attorney fees.we have consolidated the two appeals.
ii.standard of review 
we review a district court decision to grant a defendant motion de novo.price stossel,cir.under california law,we review a trial court award of attorney fees for abuse of discretion.we must consider whether the district court award exceeded the bounds of reason.dove audio,rosenfeld,meyer susman,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
iii.discussion 
anti slapp motion to strike 
california statute provides 
a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states constitution or the california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.
b.the statute is based on the california legislature finding that it is in the public interest to encourage continued participation in matters of public significance,and that this participation should not be chilled through abuse of the judicial process.id.a see also gilbert sykes.the legislature instructed courts that the statute shall be construed broadly.a.
the california supreme court has described the burden a plaintiff must carry in opposing an motion 
t he plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.in deciding the question of potential merit,the trial court considers the pleadings and evidentiary submissions of both the plaintiff and the defendant though the court does not weigh the credibility or comparative probative strength of competing evidence,it should grant the motion if,as a matter of law,the defendant evidence supporting the motion defeats the plaintiff attempt to establish evidentiary support for the claim.
wilson parker,covert chidester,cal th,internal quotation marks and citations omitted,superseded by statute in part as stated in hutton hafif.lower california courts have described plaintiffs burden in responding to an motion as being similar to the standard used in determining motions for nonsuit,directed verdict,or summary judgment.gilbert.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also mindys cosmetics,dakar,cir.
we note that mhc may be a limited purpose public figure for the purposes of this defamation suit.see gilbert.at.if mhc were a limited purpose public figure,it would be required to prove by clear and convincing evidence that jacob statements were false and made with actual malice.id.at.however,defendants have not argued that mhc is a limited purpose public figure,and we therefore treat it as a private figure.
california law requires,in the case of a defamation claim by a private figure,that the allegedly defamatory statements be false.taus loftus,cal th.the issue in this case is whether mhc made a sufficient prima facie showing that jacob statements were false to carry its burden under the statute.
mhc contends that the district court erred in analyzing only the three statements to which we referred in our previous opinion.those three statements follow the bracketed numbers in the quotation from our prior opinion.see,supra.those statements correspond to the second,third,and fourth statements quoted in chronological order at the beginning of this opinion.see,supra one statement on november,and two statements on december.mhc contends that these three statements were provided as examples rather than as an exhaustive list of the relevant statements made by jacob.it contends that the district court should have also considered the first,fifth,and sixth statements quoted at the beginning of this opinion.see,supra statements on november,december,and january.we agree that the three statements to which the panel referred were intended to be examples rather than an exhaustive list.we therefore consider all six statements on appeal.we divide the statements into three groups.
statements concerning mhc reputation 
two of jacob statements concern mhc reputation.one was made during the television interview on december.jacob stated that mhc has a reputation throughout the country of running people out of older mobile home parks,increasing the value of the park,and then selling it at a profit.the second was quoted in the article in the san diego union tribune on december.jacob stated that mhc rent hike was a deliberate attempt to force these people out of their homes in order for the company to move newer mobile homes in,increase the value of the park and sell it for a profit they have done this throughout the country,not just here in san diego county.
jacob contends,relying on a series of news articles,that these statements are true.one of the articles notes that after mhc bought willow lakes estate outside of chicago,residents began seeing price increases of up to percent,making their rents the highest known in the state.a resident quoted in the article said,in effect,what they telling us is if you ca afford it,get out.a second article discusses an attempt by mhc to challenge a local rent control ordinance and to triple rents at a park in los osos,california.a resident said,there people who are going to go hungry and lose their homes if we lose our law.a third article describes a public hearing in los osos during which audience members shouted and hissed at mhc representatives.a fourth article,focusing on mhc rent increases at a park in santa cruz,california,describes mhc as having filed a slew of simultaneous federal lawsuits against cities that have rent control laws.the article describes mhc strategy as filing so many suits that cities can not afford to defend them all and eventually will seek compromises with the mobile home park owners.santa cruz already has amassed almost in legal bills defending its rent control ordinance since mhc first filed suit.the article notes that the outcome of these suits could affect hundreds of thousands of californians,many of them seniors on fixed incomes.
mhc introduced no evidence that it does not have a reputation for driving up rents and forcing out existing tenants to increase the value of its parks.instead,it contends that its activities are undertaken not to sell parks at a profit,but as part of its investment in the parks.defendants concede that mhc does not have a reputation for selling parks but contend that the part of jacob statement discussing the sale of parks was not defamatory.
under california law i t is well settled that a defendant is not required in an action of libel to justify every word of the alleged defamatory matter it is sufficient if the substance,the gist,the sting of the libelous charge be justified,and if the gist of the charge be established by the evidence the defendant has made his case.gilbert.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.furthermore,a slight inaccuracy in the details will not prevent a judgment for the defendant,if the inaccuracy does not change the complexion of the affair so as to affect the reader of the article differently.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
