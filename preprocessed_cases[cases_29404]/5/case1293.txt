during her stay at the desert inn,tilton participated in several activities with sexual themes.tilton participated in two wet contests,which were observed by a crowd of to people,many of whom had video cameras.tilton also participated in a banana sucking contest,a muff eating contest,and a sexual positions contest.
deslin hired a company to provide a disc jockey for the contests in which tilton participated and also to film the activities.the company used its recordings to produce a promotional video for deslin.paul prewitt also recorded video footage of the contests,which appeared in commercial video products unrelated to deslin promotional video.
while in daytona beach,chad ciani,owner of bv bk productions,lllp,heard an advertisement of the wet contests at the desert inn.ciani went to the desert inn,observed the contests,and took photographs.in april,ciani posted these photographs,as well as video footage of the contests that he obtained from another observer,on his website,www.bikinivoyeur.com,which provided paying subscribers with access to pictures and video images documenting various public events such as spring break activities,wet contests,bikini contests and other events.

iii.discussion 
our discussion is divided in three parts.first,we address whether the district court erred when it granted summary judgment in favor of deslin.second,we address whether the district court erred when it granted summary judgment in favor of ciani.third,we address whether the district court abused its discretion when it declined to award attorney fees against prewitt.
a.the district court did not err when it granted summary judgment in favor of deslin.
tilton argues that the district court erred when it granted summary judgment in favor of deslin for three reasons.first,tilton argues that she presented substantial evidence that deslin induced her to engage in sexually explicit conduct.second,tilton argues that she presented substantial evidence that deslin used her to induce other people to engage in sexually explicit conduct.third,tilton argues that she presented substantial evidence that deslin created an atmosphere that it knew would be conducive to sexually explicit conduct that others might photograph.
these arguments fail.tilton first argument fails because tilton has not produced any evidence that she engaged in sexually explicit conduct.tilton second and third arguments fail because tilton misreads the statute upon which she bases her complaint.
tilton has not produced substantial evidence that she engaged in sexually explicit conduct.
tilton argues that she presented substantial evidence that deslin induced her to engage in sexually explicit conduct.tilton had to prove that deslin induced,employed,used,or persuaded her to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of that conduct.a.sexually explicit conduct is defined as actual or simulated 
i sexual intercourse,including,or,whether between persons of the same or opposite sex 
ii bestiality 
iii masturbation 
iv sadistic or masochistic abuse or 
v lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person 
tilton alleged that deslin produced images that violated sections a i and a v.the district court ruled that tilton participation in the contests did not involve simulated sexual intercourse,under section a i,because tilton conduct did not create the realistic impression of an actual sex act,and that the evidence did not depict lascivious exhibition of tilton genitals,under section a v.tilton challenges both rulings.
we agree with the district court that tilton conduct must have created the realistic impression of an actual sex act to constitute simulated sexual intercourse.the starting point for interpreting a statute is the language of the statute itself.aig baker sterling heights,llc am.multi cinema,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the district court relied on the merriam webster online dictionary,which defines simulated as made to look genuine.merriam webster online dictionary,last visited.to the extent that any ambiguity exists in the plain language of the term simulated,our interpretation is guided by the doctrine of constitutional doubt,which instructs us to construe a statute that is genuinely susceptible to two constructions in favor of the construction that avoids a serious likelihood that the statute will be held unconstitutional.united states stone,cir per curiam internal quotation marks omitted.other courts have recognized,and we agree,that a definition of simulated sexual intercourse broader th
