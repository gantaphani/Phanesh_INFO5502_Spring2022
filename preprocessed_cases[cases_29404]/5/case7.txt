c neither the law firms nor the united states,as amicus curiae,offers a persuasive theory for why a should override the american rule in this context.
the law firms view that litigation is part of the services rendered to the estate administrator not only suffers from an unnatural interpretation of the term services rendered,but would require a particularly unusual deviation from the american rule,as it would permit attorneys to be awarded fees for unsuccessfully defending fee applications when most provisions permit awards only to a prevailing party,hardt,supra,at.
the government argument is also unpersuasive.its theory that fees for litigation must be understood as a component of the reasonable compensation for the underlying services rendered so that compensation for the actual services rendered will not be diluted by unpaid time spent litigating fees can not be reconciled with the relevant text.section a does not authorize courts to award reasonable compensation,but reasonable compensation for actual,necessary services rendered,and the government properly concedes that litigation in defense of a fee application is not a service.and a,which presupposes compensation for the preparation of a fee application,does not suggest that time spent defending a fee application must also be compensable.commissioner jean,distinguished.
the government theory ultimately rests on the flawed policy argument that a judicial exception is needed to compensate litigation and safeguard congress aim of ensuring that talented attorneys take on bankruptcy work.but since no attorneys are entitled to such fees absent express statutory authorization,requiring bankruptcy attorneys to bear the costs of their litigation under a creates no disincentive to bankruptcy practice.and even if this court believed that uncompensated litigation would fall particularly hard on the bankruptcy bar,it has no roving authority to allow counsel fees whenever it might deem them warranted,alyeska pipeline,supra,at.

justice thomas delivered the opinion of the court.
section a of the bankruptcy code allows trustees to hire attorneys,accountants,and other professionals to assist them in carrying out their statutory duties.a.another provision,a,states that a bankruptcy court may award reasonable compensation for actual,necessary services rendered by those professionals.the question before us is whether a permits a bankruptcy court to award attorney fees for work performed in defending a fee application in court.we hold that it does not and therefore affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.

asarco appealed various aspects of the award to the district court.as relevant here,the court held that the firms could recover fees for defending their fee application.
the court of appeals for the fifth circuit reversed.it reasoned that the american rule the rule that each side must pay its own attorney fees applies absent explicit statutory authority to the contrary and that the code contains no statutory provision for the recovery of fees for defending a fee application.in re asarco,internal quotation marks omitted.it observed that a provides that professional services are compensable only if they are likely to benefit a debtor estate or are necessary to case administration.at.because t he primary beneficiary of a professional fee application,of course,is the professional,compensation for litigation defending that application does not fall within a.ibid.
we granted certiorari,and now affirm.
our basic point of reference when considering the award of attorney fees is the bedrock principle known as the american rule each litigant pays his own attorney fees,win or lose,unless a statute or contract provides otherwise.hardt reliance standard life ins,internal quotation marks omitted.the american rule has roots in our common law reaching back to at least the century,see arcambel wiseman,dall,and s tatutes which invade the common law are to be read with a presumption favoring the retention of and familiar legal principles,fogerty fantasy,internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted.we consequently will not deviate from the american rule absent explicit statutory authority.buckhannon board care home,west virginia of health and human resources,quoting key tronic united states.
we have recognized departures from the american rule only in specific and explicit provisions for the allowance of attorneys fees under selected statutes.alyeska pipeline service wilderness society.although these s tatutory changes to the american rule take various forms,hardt,supra,at,they tend to authorize the award of a reasonable attorney fee,fees,or litigation costs,and usually refer to a prevailing party in the context of an adversarial action,see,d a b,k see generally hardt,supra,at,and nn.collecting examples.
the attorney fees provision of the equal access to justice act offers a good example of the clarity we have required to deviate from the american rule.see d a.that section provides that a court shall award to a prevailing party other than the united states fees and other expenses incurred by that party in any civil action other than cases sounding in tort brought by or against the united states under certain conditions.ibid.as our decision in commissioner jean,reveals,there could be little dispute that this provision which mentions fees,a prevailing party,and a civil action is a statut e that trumps the american rule,at.
congress did not expressly depart from the american rule to permit compensation for litigation by professionals hired to assist trustees in bankruptcy proceedings.section a authorizes the employment of such professionals,providing that a trustee,with the court approval,may employ one or more attorneys,accountants,appraisers,auctioneers,or other professional persons,that do not hold or represent an interest adverse to the estate,and that are disinterested persons,to represent or assist him in carrying out his duties.in other words,a professionals are hired to serve the administrator of the estate for the benefit of the estate.
section a in turn authorizes compensation for these professionals as follows 
after notice to the parties in interest and the united states trustee and a hearing,and subject to sections,and,the court may award to a trustee,a consumer privacy ombudsman appointed under section,an examiner,an ombudsman appointed under section,or a professional person employed under section or 
a reasonable compensation for actual,necessary services rendered by the trustee,examiner,ombudsman,professional person,or attorney and by any paraprofessional person employed by any such person and 
b reimbursement for actual,necessary expenses.emphasis added.
this text can not displace the american rule with respect to litigation.to be sure,the phrase compensation for actual,necessary services rendered permits courts to award fees to attorneys for work done to assist the administrator of the estate,as the bankruptcy court did here when it ordered asarco to pay roughly million for the firms work in the bankruptcy proceeding.no one disputes that a authorizes an award of attorney fees for that kind of work.see alyeska pipeline,supra,at,and listing a predecessor as an example of a provision authorizing attorney fees.but the phrase reasonable compensation for actual,necessary services rendered neither specifically nor explicitly authorizes courts to shift the costs of adversarial litigation from one side to the other in this case,from the attorneys seeking fees to the administrator of the estate as most statutes that displace the american rule do.
instead,a provides compensation for all a professionals whether accountant,attorney,or auctioneer for all manner of work done in service of the estate administrator.more specifically,a allows reasonable compensation only for actual,necessary services rendered.emphasis added.that qualification is significant.the word services ordinarily refers to labor performed for another.webster new international dictionary def.ed.see also black law dictionary ed.duty or labor to be rendered by one person to another oxford english dictionary def.action of serving,helping or benefiting conduct tending to the welfare or advantage of another thus,in a case addressing a predecessor,this court concluded that the phrase reasonable compensation for services rendered necessarily implies loyal and disinterested service in the interest of a client.woods city nat.bank trust of chicago,accord,american united mut.life ins.avon park.time spent litigating a fee application against the administrator of a bankruptcy estate can not be fairly described as labor performed for let alone disinterested service to that administrator.
this legislative decision to limit compensation to services rendered is particularly telling given that other provisions of the bankruptcy code expressly transfer the costs of litigation from one adversarial party to the other.section i,for instance,provides that i f a bankruptcy petition preparer commits any act that the court finds to be fraudulent,unfair,or deceptive,on the motion of the debtor,trustee,united states trustee or the bankruptcy administrator,if any,the bankruptcy court must order the bankruptcy petition preparer to pay the debtor reasonable attorneys fees and costs in moving for damages under this subsection.i c.had congress wished to shift the burdens of litigation under a in a similar manner,it easily could have done so.we accordingly refuse to invade the legislature province by redistributing litigation costs here.alyeska pipeline,at.
the law firms,the united states as amicus curiae,and the dissent resist this straightforward interpretation of the statute.the law firms and the government each offer a theory for why a expressly overrides the american rule in the context of litigation in defense of a fee application,and the dissent embraces the latter.neither theory is persuasive.
we begin with the law firms approach.according to the firms,litigation is part of the services rendered to the estate administrator under a.see brief for petitioners.as explained above,that reading is untenable.the term services in this provision can not be read to encompass adversarial litigation.see part,supra.even the dissent agrees on this point.see post,at opinion of breyer.
indeed,reading services in this manner could end up compensating attorneys for the unsuccessful defense of a fee application.the firms insist that estates do benefit from fee defenses and thus receive a service under a because the estate has an interest in obtaining a just determination of the amount it should pay its professionals.brief for petitioners internal quotation marks omitted.but that alleged interest and hence the supposed provision of a service exists whether or not a a professional prevails in his fee dispute.we decline to adopt a reading of a that would allow courts to pay professionals for arguing for fees they were found never to have been entitled to in the first place.such a result would not only require an unnatural interpretation of the term services rendered,but a unusual deviation from the american rule as well,as m ost provisions permit a court to award attorney fees only to a prevailing party,a substantially prevailing party,or a successful litigant,hardt,at footnote omitted.there is no indication that congress departed from the american rule in a with respect to litigation,let alone that it did so in such an unusual manner.
the government theory,embraced by the dissent,fares no better.although the united states agrees that the defense of a fee application does not itself qualify as an independently compensable service,it nonetheless contends that compensation for such work is properly viewed as part of the compensation for the underlying services in the bankruptcy proceeding.brief for united states as amicus curiae.according to the government,if an attorney is not repaid for his time spent successfully litigating fees,his compensation for his actual services rendered to the estate administrator in the underlying proceeding will be diluted,at.the united states thus urges us to treat fees for work as a component of reasonable compensation.at accord,post,at breyer,dissenting.we refuse to do so for several reasons.
first and foremost,the government theory can not be reconciled with the relevant text.section a does not authorize courts to award reasonable compensation simpliciter,but reasonable compensation for actual,necessary services rendered by the a professional.a a emphasis added.here,the contested award was tied to the firms work on the litigation and is correctly understood only as compensation for that work.the government and the dissent properly concede that litigation in defense of a fee application is not a service within the meaning of a it follows that the contested award was not compensation for a service.thus,the only way to reach their reading of the statute would be to excise the phrase for actual,necessary services rendered from the statute 
contrary to the government assertion,a does not presuppose that courts are free to award compensation based on work that does not qualify as a service to the estate administrator.that provision specifies that a ny compensation awarded for the preparation of a fee application shall be based on the level and skill reasonably required to prepare the application.the government argues that because time spent preparing a fee application is compensable,time spent defending it must be too.but the provision cuts the other way.a a professional preparation of a fee application is best understood as a servic e rendered to the estate administrator under a,whereas a professional defense of that application is not.by way of analogy,it would be natural to describe a car mechanic preparation of an itemized bill as part of his services to the customer because it allows a customer to understand and,if necessary,dispute his expenses.but it would be less natural to describe a subsequent court battle over the bill as part of the services rendered to the customer.
the government used to understand that time spent preparing a fee application was different from time spent defending one for the purposes of a.just a few years ago,the trustee explained that r easonable charges for preparing fee applications are compensable because the preparation of a fee application is not required for lawyers practicing in areas other than bankruptcy as a condition to getting paid.fed.reg.emphasis deleted.by contrast,time spent defending fee applications is ordinarily not compensable,the trustee observed,as such time can be properly characterized as work that is for the benefit of the professional and not the estate.ibid.
to support its broader interpretation of a,the government,echoed by the dissent,relies on our remark in jean that w e find no textual or logical argument for treating so differently a party preparation of a fee application and its ensuing efforts to support that same application.at see post,at.but that use of jean begs the question.jean addressed a statutory provision that everyone agreed authorized fees for litigation,at.the only dispute in that context was over what finding was necessary to support such an award.ibid.in resolving that issue,the court declined to treat and work differently given that the relevant statutory text a court shall award to a prevailing party fees and other expenses incurred by that party in any civil action could not support such a distinction,at.here,by contrast,the operative language reasonable compensation for actual,necessary services rendered reaches only the work.the fact that the provision at issue in jean did not mention work,post,at,is thus irrelevant.
in any event,the government textual foothold for its argument is too insubstantial to support a deviation from the american rule.the phrase reasonable compensation,standing alone,is not the sort of specific and explicit provisio n that congress must provide in order to alter this default rule.alyeska pipeline,at.
ultimately,the government theory rests on a flawed and irrelevant policy argument.the united states contends that awarding fees for litigation is a judicial exception necessary to the proper functioning of the bankruptcy code.brief for united states as amicus curiae,internal quotation marks omitted.absent this exception,it warns,litigation will dilute attorney fees and result in bankruptcy lawyers receiving less compensation than nonbankruptcy lawyers,thereby undermining the congressional aim of ensuring that talented attorneys will take on bankruptcy work.accord,post,at.
as an initial matter,we find this policy argument unconvincing.in our legal system,no attorneys,regardless of whether they practice in bankruptcy,are entitled to receive fees for litigation absent express statutory authorization.requiring bankruptcy attorneys to pay for the defense of their fees thus will not result in any disparity between bankruptcy and nonbankruptcy lawyers 
the united states nonetheless contends that uncompensated fee litigation in bankruptcy will be particularly costly because multiple parties in interest may object to fee applications,whereas nonbankruptcy fee litigation typically involves just a lawyer and his client.but this argument rests on unsupported predictions of how the statutory scheme will operate in practice,and the government conduct in this case reveals the perils with relying on such prognostications to interpret statutes the united states took the opposite view below,asserting that requiring a professional to bear the normal litigation costs of litigating a contested request for payment dilutes a bankruptcy fee award no more than any litigation over professional fees.reply brief for appellant united states trustee in sd.the speed with which the government has changed its tune offers a good argument against substituting predictions for statutory text.
more importantly,we would lack the authority to rewrite the statute even if we believed that uncompensated fee litigation would fall particularly hard on the bar.our unwillingness to soften the import of congress chosen words even if we believe the words lead to a harsh outcome is longstanding,and that is no less true in bankruptcy than it is elsewhere.lamie united states trustee.whether or not the government theory is desirable as a matter of policy,congress has not granted us roving authority to allow counsel fees whenever we might deem them warranted.alyeska pipeline,supra,at.our job is to follow the text even if doing so will supposedly undercut a basic objective of the statute,post,at.section a itself does not authorize the award of fees for defending a fee application,and that is the end of the matter.
as we long ago observed,the general practice of the united states is in opposition to forcing one side to pay the other attorney fees,and even if that practice is not strictly correct in principle,it is entitled to the respect of the court,till it is changed,or modified,by statute.arcambel,at emphasis deleted.we follow that approach today.because a does not override the american rule with respect to litigation,it does not permit bankruptcy courts to award compensation for such litigation.we therefore affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.
it is so o
