background 
plaintiffs brought this action in to challenge california treatment of disabled inmates and parolees.in all defendants except the officials of the bpt stipulated that adequate emergency evacuation plans for disabled prisoners were lacking in some facilities,that a smaller range of vocational programs was available to disabled prisoners than to prisoners,and that sentence reduction credits had been improperly denied to some disabled prisoners.armstrong wilson,cir.these defendants cdc defendants asserted,however,in a summary judgment motion,that the ada and ra did not apply to state prisoners,and that the defendant state officials were immune from liability under the eleventh amendment.the district court denied the motion,armstrong wilson,and issued a remedial order and injunction.the cdc defendants appealed,and we affirmed,holding that the ada and ra apply to inmates and parolees in the state penal system and that this suit may proceed in federal court under the doctrine of ex parte young,which provides an exception to eleventh amendment immunity.armstrong,at.under the remedial order and injunction,the cdc defendants evaluate their programs and develop remedial plans,while plaintiffs monitor defendants compliance.
the remedial order and injunction provides that plaintiffs are the prevailing party and are entitled to attorney fees,litigation expenses,and costs,for litigation as well as for monitoring for compliance.the procedure for collecting fees is set forth in a stipulation and order for periodic collection of attorney fees,which was agreed upon by the parties.disputes regarding the periodic fees are resolved through negotiation or,where negotiation fails,through a motion to compel.
the cdc defendants filed a petition for writ of certiorari,seeking review of our decision in armstrong and our decision in a related case,clark california department of corrections,cir.while the petition was pending,two other petitions were filed raising the issue whether the ada applies to state prisoners.see amos.dep t of pub.safety,cir holding ada does not apply to state prisons,cert.granted,judgment vacated,case remanded by,d yeskey.dep t of,cir holding ada does apply to state prisons,aff,d.
counsel for the plaintiff in yeskey asked the prison law office,which was counsel for plaintiffs in armstrong,whether,if certiorari were granted in yeskey,rather than in armstrong,that office would represent the yeskey plaintiff before the united states supreme court.because a supreme court decision on the application of the ada to prison inmates would affect the armstrong plaintiffs with equal force regardless of which case the court chose as its vehicle to address the issue,the prison law office agreed to represent the yeskey plaintiff in such circumstance.
the supreme court granted certiorari in yeskey,and the prison law office appeared on behalf of the yeskey plaintiff.the court then held that the ada does apply to state prisoners,as yeskey and armstrong had both concluded.yeskey,at.one week later the court denied the petition for certiorari in armstrong and clark.wilson armstrong,d.thus,plaintiffs counsel successfully protected the armstrong decision of this court by prevailing in yeskey in the supreme court.
the bpt portion of the original case went to trial.during discovery,plaintiffs deposed a number of bpt officials and one expert,and arranged for their own experts to inspect certain prison facilities and to conduct other types of investigation.before trial,the bpt defendants filed two motions to dismiss,a motion for summary judgment,and a motion for continuance of trial.shortly before trial,the district court permitted plaintiffs to add a claim for due process violations under.after motions were resolved,a bench trial was held.the district court then found the bpt liable for violations of the ada,the ra,and the due process clause of the constitution.after further proceedings,the court issued a permanent injunction requiring the bpt to bring its policies and practices into compliance with the law.the bpt defendants appealed,and we affirmed the main elements of the district court decision and injunction.armstrong davis,cir.
district court award of attorney fees 
defendants appeal from four orders by the district court awarding plaintiffs fees and costs for litigation and for monitoring defendants compliance with the injunctions.
order of march,awarding attorney fees and costs incurred in yeskey 
in october,plaintiffs sought attorney fees from defendants for the work performed in litigating yeskey before the supreme court.plaintiffs argued that their attorneys work in yeskey was reasonably necessary to further their interests in their litigation against the armstrong defendants.defendants objected that they can not be compelled to pay fees in a case that did not involve them.
the district judge granted plaintiffs motion in part.relying primarily on hasbrouck texaco,cir,in which we affirmed an award of attorney fees in an antitrust suit for work done on an amicus brief before the supreme court in a separate case that did not involve the hasbrouck defendants,the district court held that plaintiffs could collect fees from the armstrong defendants for the amount of work that would have been necessary to file an amicus brief in yeskey.further briefing was ordered to establish the appropriate fees.
in response to the parameters set by the district court in the march,order,plaintiffs lowered their fee request for the yeskey litigation from somewhat over to.defendants then raised four objections to the request fees should be limited by a provision of the prison litigation reform act plra that limits attorney and paralegal fees in certain actions brought by prisoners,d even if the plra limit does not apply to the ada and the ra claims,it applies to the claim,and for this reason the district court should apply the limit to one third of the claimed work the fees and costs exceed what would have been necessary to file an amicus brief in yeskey and the hours claimed are excessive.
on march,the district court rejected defendants first three objections but agreed that the hours claimed were excessive.accordingly,it awarded a reduced amount.it is from this reduced amount that defendants appeal.
order of march,awarding fees and expenses incurred during the first quarter of in the cdc portion of the case 
this order arose from a motion to compel the cdc defendants to make the periodic payment for the first quarter of.defendants disputed the fees for the first quarter of on three grounds that the plra limit on attorney and paralegal fees should apply that the limit on expert fees of should apply and that plaintiffs attorneys claimed excessively high rates.plaintiffs moved to compel payment.the district court awarded the full amount requested by plaintiffs,including interest.
order of march,awarding fees and expenses for work arising from the proceedings against the bpt 
this order granted plaintiffs motion for attorney fees arising from litigation and from monitoring of the bpt compliance with the injunction during the first quarter of.the bpt defendants here made all the same objections that were addressed in the march order concerning first quarter fees in the cdc portion of the case,discussed above.they also raised two additional objections plaintiffs were seeking attorney fees for items,such as parking and office supplies and because certain monitoring issues remained unresolved,it was premature to award fees for monitoring activities.the district court awarded the full amount requested by plaintiffs,including interest 
order of march,awarding fees and expenses for work arising from the proceedings against the bpt and setting rates 
this order granted plaintiffs motion for payment of attorney fees and expenses for work performed between april,and december,and plaintiffs motion to set the rate for fees for.defendants made all the same objections that were addressed in the march order concerning first quarter fees in the cdc portion of the case,discussed above.the district court awarded the full amount requested by plaintiffs,including interest.
discussion 
it is not disputed that plaintiffs were the prevailing party and were therefore entitled to reasonable fees and costs,under fees provision of ada,fees provision of section of ra,b civil rights fees provision we review an award of attorney fees for an abuse of discretion.corder brown,cir citing hensley eckerhart,d.any elements of legal analysis which figure in the district court decision are,however,subject to de novo review.corder,at.
although this appeal arises from four orders,to each of which defendants raise more than one objection,in order to reach our decision we need address only three issues whether the district court acted properly in awarding fees for work plaintiffs counsel conducted in litigating yeskey whether the district court acted properly in declining to apply the plra attorney fees limits to the present case and whether the district court acted properly in approving the various fees and expenses that defendants believe were excessive or duplicative,or not properly compensable.
litigating yeskey 
the district court must base its determination whether to award fees for counsel work on its judgment as to whether the work product was both useful and of a type ordinarily necessary to advance the litigation.webb bd.of,d g g fire sprinklers,bradshaw,cir quoting webb,rev on other grounds,g g fire sprinklers,lujan.
the district court found that to protect plaintiffs interests in armstrong,it would have been useful and necessary at least to have filed an amicus brief in yeskey,because yeskey involved an issue central to the litigation in armstrong.on that basis,the court awarded a fee that it found would have been appropriate for the work necessary to prepare an amicus brief,rather than for the full work necessary to represent the yeskey plaintiff in the supreme court.defendants contend that no fees are chargeable to them for the work done in yeskey,because they were not parties in that case.
hasbrouck is dispositive of defendants argument.in hasbrouck,an antitrust case,we approved the award of attorney fees to the plaintiffs for their counsel preparation of an amicus brief to the supreme court in a case involving different parties,because,we held,the award of fees should cover every item of service which,at the time rendered,would have been undertaken by a reasonably prudent lawyer to advance or protect his client interest in the case at bar.hasbrouck,at internal quotation marks omitted see also gates gomez,cir awarding fees pursuant to for filing an amicus brief with a district court.
defendants next argue that hasbrouck is an antitrust case and armstrong is a prisoner case.the argument consists simply of that statement of fact.defendants offer no reason why the hasbrouck rule is not applicable in all classes of cases,and we are aware of none.
alternatively,defendants seek to distinguish hasbrouck.they do so on the basis that the plaintiffs counsel in that case actually filed an amicus brief.here,as they put it,the district court pretend ed that plaintiffs counsel filed an amicus brief,but,in fact,plaintiffs counsel represented a party.this argument fails,in part because it rests upon the unstated and mistaken premise that a reasonably prudent lawyer would not determine it to be in his client interests for him to undertake to represent another party in an appellate proceeding in which the result would likely substantially affect his client interests.contrary to defendant assumption,in some circumstances prudence would compel a lawyer,as part of his obligation to protect his client interests,to accept an offer to represent a party whose interests coincided with those of his client.
the yeskey case presented such circumstances,because the issue to be decided by the supreme court in yeskey was likely to have an important effect on the outcome in armstrong.contrary to the assertion of defendants,therefore,the prison law office did not misplace its loyalty by agreeing to handle the yeskey supreme court proceeding.rather,it acted in the best interests of its armstrong clients by providing assistance in yeskey in whatever capacity it representing the yeskey plaintiff in the supreme court.surely,undertaking that representation served to protect its clients rights even more than the filing of an amicus brief would have.
because the yeskey plaintiff prevailed in the supreme court,had an award of attorney fees been available to him,defendants here would likely have received a free ride.california position would have been represented before the court by pennsylvania,which would probably have borne the full cost of asserting that position,including paying the prison law office attorney fees.in such case,the california officials would have received this benefit for no other reason than that the supreme court happened to have chosen yeskey,rather than armstrong,as the vehicle for deciding an issue common to both cases.however,unfortunately for the armstrong defendants,following the supreme court decision in yeskey,the plaintiff in that case lost on a summary judgment motion in the district court and,as a result,no fees were available from pennsylvania for any part of that case,including the successful work done in the supreme court by the prison law office.yeskey.dep t of,d.thus,fees for that work were,from a practical standpoint,available only from defendants here.because the work in yeskey was important to the preservation of the armstrong plaintiffs rights,and because their counsel performed the work in order to protect their interests,they would be entitled as the prevailing party in the armstrong litigation to an award of attorney fees for that work from the armstrong defendants.
because plaintiffs here do not the district court order,we do not address whether that court abused its discretion by declining fees for work in excess of that which would have been necessary to file an amicus brief.we note,however,that because the work necessary to file an amicus brief is less than that necessary to act as a party counsel,it can not be defendants who suffered from the district court reliance on the fiction of an amicus brief.
defendants raise further objections.first,they note that the supreme court in yeskey addressed the application of the ada to state prisons but not the application of the ra the armstrong defendants were found to have violated both acts,and yet a violation of either act would have been sufficient to justify the injunction that was ordered against them.they argue,therefore,that it addressed only one of the two bases for the decision against not determinative of the outcome in armstrong and that litigating yeskey was,for that reason,not a proper undertaking for plaintiffs counsel.
this argument has no merit.the ada was thoroughly litigated in armstrong and was a principal ground on which the decision in favor of the armstrong plaintiffs was based.by then litigating the ada issue in yeskey,plaintiffs counsel protected its ruling in armstrong and thereby advanced its clients interests.defendants argument is also baseless for the reason that the ada and ra issues are such that a decision concerning one might possibly have affected the other 
defendants also argue that it is unfair to award fees for a case in which they were not involved because they are unable to conduct a meaningful review of plaintiffs billing requests.we do not see why that is so.detailed billing information was submitted,and the briefs and oral argument transcript for the supreme court proceedings are available.also,discovery could have been undertaken.the court itself did conduct a careful review,find that the fees requested by plaintiffs were excessive,and award an accordingly lower amount.
moreover,the same diffi
