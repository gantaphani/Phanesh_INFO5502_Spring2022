background 
the facts of this case are not disputed.doe,a boston resident,suffers from a severe mental disability.accordingly,she is entitled to special education services under the idea.pursuant to the idea,boston was obligated to draft an individualized education program iep for doe and propose an appropriate placement.a,b,d.
initially,doe received an education at mckinley vocational high school,a public school in boston.on december,while doe was hospitalized,doe father requested that she be placed at the department of mental health dmh lighthouse program at the children community support collaborative,a private residential school also located in boston.on january,in accordance with the statutory requirement,doe and boston conducted a team meeting to discuss her situation.boston rejected doe request for the private placement and offered to continue her schooling at mckinley.concerned that mckinley did not meet her needs,doe reiterated her request to be placed in a residential program.boston responded with an offer of providing educational services at mckinley and providing living services at another dmh facility.doe rejected this proposal.
on july,the parties unsuccessfully attempted to mediate their disputes before the bureau of special education appeals bsea.see id.e.on july,doe filed for a hearing before the bsea and requested placement at a small therapeutic day school.see id.f.on august,the parties unsuccessfully attempted to reach an informal resolution at a conference.
the case was scheduled for a bsea hearing on october.just before the hearing was to begin,boston presented to doe an iep that provided for placement at bay cove academy,a private,therapeutic program,for the current school year.doe accepted the offer and requested that the placement be read into the record and signed by the bsea hearing officer.the hearing officer declined,stating that it was against his usual practice.
on december,doe filed a motion seeking to affirm the placement as a final judgment and to direct implementation of the iep.on january,the hearing officer denied the motion,and on february,doe idea claims were dismissed.
on march,doe filed a complaint in the district court seeking attorneys fees.in a published opinion,the district court granted boston motion to dismiss the complaint.doe boston pub,d.the court relied upon buckhannon definition of the term prevailing party,in which the supreme court held that under certain federal statutes,attorneys fees could be awarded only to parties who received a final judgment on the merits or obtained a consent decree.doe,d at citing buckhannon,at.the district court found that doe fit neither of the categories that would make her a prevailing party,and was thus ineligible for fees under the provisions of the idea.id.at.
ii.discussion 
the central question we must decide is whether buckhannon applies to the idea definition of prevailing party,thus precluding recovery of attorneys fees following a private settlement this is a question of first impression in our circuit.see me.sch.admin.dist.v,cir expressly leaving open the question of whether buckhannon applies to the idea.we review this question of law de novo.id.at domegan ponte,cir.
a.the idea and hcpa 
the idea was enacted in to ensure that disabled children could receive an appropriate education free of cost.d a it authorizes students and their parents to enforce this substantive right by filing suit against school departments.id.b.in smith robinson,d,the supreme court held that congress had not intended to permit prevailing parties to recover attorneys fees in idea cases.this decision brought a quick response from congress,with bills filed almost immediately seeking to amend the statute to add an express provision.
in,congress passed the handicapped children protection act hcpa.hcpa was the result of a series of legislative compromises what began as a simple clause mimicking other federal civil rights statutes evolved into a more complex provision,with multiple restrictions on who could recover fees,when they could be recovered,and the amount of recovery.
hcpa basic authorization for fees provides 
in any action or proceeding brought under this section,the court,in its discretion,may award reasonable attorneys fees as part of the costs to the parents of a child with a disability who is the prevailing party.
i b.several other provisions modify this authorization.if the relief obtained is equivalent to the school system prior settlement offer,no fees are awarded for services performed after the offer was made 
i attorneys fees may not be awarded and related costs may not be reimbursed in any action or proceeding under this section for services performed subsequent to the time of a written offer of settlement to a parent if 
i the offer is made within the time prescribed by rule of the federal rules of civil procedure or,in the case of an administrative proceeding,at any time more than days before the proceeding begins 
ii the offer is not accepted within days and 
iii the court or administrative hearing officer finds that the relief finally obtained by the parents is not more favorable to the parents than the offer of settlement.
id.i d i.the exception to this rule applies if the parents were substantially justified in rejecting the offer.id.i e.section i d ii provides in relevant part that attorneys fees may not be awarded at the discretion of the state for work done in mediation conducted before the filing of a formal request for a hearing.in addition,hcpa also provides for a reduction in fees if the court finds that the parents unnecessarily delayed the final resolution of the proceeding.id.f.
in,the idea was reauthorized via the individuals with disabilities education act amendments of,stat.the legislation left intact the provisions set forth supra,but added new limitations on the recovery of fees for work pertaining to certain iep team meetings and mediation activities.id.
b.the buckhannon decision and its application to other statutes 
in,fifteen years after hcpa initially was enacted,the supreme court decided buckhannon,d.there,the plaintiffs sought attorneys fees pursuant to the fair housing amendments act of fhaa,et,and the americans with disabilities act of ada,et at.the plaintiffs cited the catalyst theory of recovery because their lawsuit had brought about a voluntary change in the conduct of the defendant,they were prevailing parties and thus entitled to recover fees.id.
the supreme court rejected the catalyst theory as a basis for the fee award.id.at.it held that the term prevailing party,as used in the fhaa,ada and numerous other federal statutes,meant a party who has received a judgment on the merits or a consent decree id.at.the court listed several statutes,in addition to the fhaa and ada,that employed the term prevailing party,and noted that the term appears in numerous other federal statutes as well.id.at.it did not specifically reference the idea.
at the core of the court reasoning was the concept of judicial imprimatur in order to prevail,a party must achieve a change in the legal relationship of the parties.id.at.absent this imprimatur,a federal court may be unable to retain jurisdiction so it can oversee execution of the settlement.id.at.our precedents thus counsel against holding that the term prevailing party authorizes an award of attorney fees without a corresponding alteration in the legal relationship of the parties.id.at.emphasis in original.
buckhannon prohibition on catalyst applies expansively.see new eng.reg l council of carpenters kinton,cir applying buckhannon to.as the district court noted,the principles underlying buckhannon holding are broadly stated and are not.doe,d at see also me.sch.admin.dist,at.the buckhannon court used prevailing party as a legal term of art meaning a party in whose favor a judgment is rendered to be interpreted consistently across statutes.at.citing black law dictionary ed.it also relied on the general baseline american rule that each party pays its own fees.id.at.moreover,the court expressed a preference for avoiding a second major litigation that would frequently ensue from an application of the catalyst theory,which would involve analysis of the defendant subjective motivations in changing its conduct.id.at.
doe urges that we follow the minority interpretation of buckhannon set forth in barrios.interscholastic fed n,cir,cert.denied,d.there,the ninth circuit held that buckhannon permitted the award of attorneys fees to an ada plaintiff who settled privately.it stated that buckhannon barred recovery of fees only by a plaintiff who was the catalyst for legislative change,and that the supreme court limitation of prevailing party status to plaintiffs who win judgments or enter consent decrees was merely dicta.id.citing buckhannon,at.
the barrios court reading of buckhannon seems to contravene the supreme court unambiguous rejection of private settlement as sufficient grounds for prevailing party status 
private settlements do not entail the judicial approval and oversight involved in consent decrees.and federal jurisdiction to enforce a private contractual settlement will often be lacking unless the terms of the agreement are incorporated into the order of dismissal.
at.accordingly,we decline to adopt the ninth circuit narrow interpretation.other circuits considering the issue have applied buckhannon as precluding fee awards in private settlement situations,explicitly or impliedly rejecting barrios interpretation.see,la grange sch.dist,cir john.county intermediate unit,cir we will not follow barrios narrow reading of buckhannon w e read buckhannon to reject the catalyst theory whole hog.state fed of taxi drivers,westchester county taxi limousine comm n,cir.
buckhannon application to the idea 
to date,each of the three circuit courts that have considered the application of buckhannon to the idea have held that idea plaintiffs who achieve their desired result via private settlement may not be considered prevailing parties,and thus can not recover attorneys fees under i,at john,at reg l sch.dist,cir.
consistent with our american rule,in which parties bear their own fees in the absence of explicit statutory authority,key tronic united states,d,we hold that buckhannon is presumed to apply generally to all statutes that use the prevailing party terminology,including the idea.see,at.because this provision employs the phrase prevailing party a term of must be interpreted and applied in the same manner as other federal statutes that use the same phraseology.me.sch.admin,at.that presumption may be rebutted,however,if the statutory text,structure,or legislative history indicate that congress intended to permit prevailing parties to recover fees where the desired result was achieved through settlement,at see also.valley auth.hill,d examining language,history and structure of legislation to determine congressional intent.we consider each of these possibilities in turn.
legislative text and structure 
doe contends that the text and structure of i suggest that congress intended prevailing party to include fee awards.she maintains that most other statutes are simply constructed,and that buckhannon holding does not extend to complex provisions such as i.doe also points out that i d i explicitly links settlement to attorneys fees by providing that under certain specified circumstances such fees may not be awarded for services performed subsequent to the time of a written offer of settlement to a parent.
we disagree that these features place the idea beyond the ambit of buckhannon.first,the structural complexity of the idea provision does not,by itself,change the meaning of prevailing party.although the provisions in the fhaa and ada are simple,buckhannon additionally referenced the complex provision in the equal access to justice act,by citing to the appendix in marek chesny,d.at.see also brickwood contractors united states,applying buckhannon to eaja to reverse award of attorneys fees.the court thus did not appear to intend to limit its holding to simple provisions while we recognize that the idea provision is more complex than most,nothing inherent in its structure indicates legislative support for preserving the catalyst theory in the idea context.brickwood,at there is no basis for distinguishing the term prevailing party in the eaja from other statutes.
second,the limiting exceptions enumerated in section i do not indicate that the term prevailing party was intended to have a broader scope than in other statutes,at john,at.t hese provisions do not inform anything about the meaning of the term prevailing party in the idea because they are relevant only after a plaintiff has been deemed a prevailing party,at.the reference in section i d i to attorneys fees speaks only to settlement offers,not actual settlements.it does not specify whether the settlement offer is followed by additional litigation and judgment or by the successful acceptance of the offer.thus,nothing in this text plainly indicates an intent to reimburse fees for work resulting in private settlements.
legislative history 
the legislative history of hcpa presents closer questions as to whether congress intended to define prevailing party to include private settlements.the most germane legislative history available suggests simply that the idea fee provisions are to be interpreted consistently with supreme court law and with other statutes.two weeks before hcpa was passed,representative williams read into the record a letter by senator hatch the right to reimbursement of reasonable attorneys fees provided for in the conference report is exactly the same right that congress has extended to other persons protected by fees more and no less.cong.rec.the letter went on to state that fees may be awarded to parents consistent with applicable supreme court decisions interpreting including interpretations of such concepts as prevailing parent see,for example,hensley eckerhart,d marek chesny,d.id.
hensley concerned attorneys fees awarded pursuant to.the congressional citation to this opinion strongly suggests an intent that the idea be interpreted in a manner consistent with that and other statutes,and not be considered sui generis.other circuits considering a similar but earlier congressional statement held that buckhannon,which expressly applied to,applies to the idea as well.see,at john,at,at 
several members of congress filed an amicus curiae brief in this case,including senators kennedy,harkin and jeffords and representatives kildee,miller and owens.they present a detailed and nuanced argument for reading the legislative history as supporting a definition of prevailing party to include those who settle privately.after careful review,however,we conclude that the history is ambiguous as to this question.while a reading of the history that supports providing attorneys fees could be teased out,it is just as susceptible to other interpretations.see,cong.rec.particularly in view of the american rule that attorney fees will not be awarded absent explicit statutory authority,ambiguous legislative history is clearly insufficient to alter the accepted meaning of the statutory term prevailing party.buckhannon,at.in short,the legislative history can not supply the intent necessary to overcome buckhannon presumption against fee awards.see cong.rec.cong.rec.cong.rec.
for example,doe first mentions a statement made by senator hatch in connection with the proposed legal fees equity act,an omnibus bill to limit fee awards against government defendants the requirement of final disposition is not intended to preclude recovery of attorneys fees where settlement is reached prior to judgment.such settlements are generally desirable and so long as it can be shown that the party has prevailed on the relief sought,such an award of attorneys fee
