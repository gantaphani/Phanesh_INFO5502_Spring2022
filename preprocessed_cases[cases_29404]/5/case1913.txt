discussion 
iadministrative exemption 
abi contends the trial court erred in determining that eicher was not an exempt administrative employee.we conclude abi did not carry its burden of showing eicher was an exempt administrative employee.
whether eicher was an exempt administrative employee presents a mixed question of law and fact because it involves the application of legal categories.ramirez yosemite water cal th,d.in interpreting the scope of an exemption from the state overtime laws,we begin by reviewing certain basic principles.first,past decisions teach that in light of the remedial nature of the legislative enactments authorizing the regulation of wages,hours and working conditions for the protection and benefit of employees,the statutory provisions are to be liberally construed with an eye to promoting such protection.citation.thus,under california law,exemptions from statutory mandatory overtime provisions are narrowly construed.citations.moreover,the assertion of an exemption from the overtime laws is considered to be an affirmative defense,and therefore the employer bears the burden of proving the employee exemption.citations.id.at,d.
facts in statement of decision 
the trial court included the following facts in its statement of decision 
abi owns the rights to abi mastermind software,which is used in sports and entertainment venues to schedule staff,manage payroll,credentialing,and security,and keep track of costs.abi primary business is to sell the software to these venues,implement the software for the customer,train the customer,and provide additional support.during the implementation phase,abi typically sends its employees to the customer site to install and train the customer,based on the specific needs of that customer.
abi hired eicher in march,with a starting salary of and no overtime compensation.hired as a consultant,eicher eventually became a senior consultant.his college degree was in sociology,not computer science.he spent half of his time in the office and the other half at customers venues.eicher primarily provided customer service and training on the abi mastermind software.he did not hire or fire employees,negotiate contracts with customers,or consult with abi or its customers about business policies and practices.
abi carefully monitored the hours eicher worked,requiring him to account for at least hours per week.it deducted from eicher pay for absences if eicher had no accrued paid time off pto for the absence.
eicher worked overtime more than eight hours per day and hours per week frequently while employed by abi.concerning eicher duties as an employee of abi,the trial court found that eicher devoted the majority of his work time in training customer employees on mastermind and trouble shooting the software when he was engaged in implementation on the customer site.eicher also spent time gathering information about the customers employment practices and entering data into the appropriate fields of the mastermind program.eicher testified that he spent the majority of his time,when in abi office,performing customer service work.the remainder of his time was spent on individual training and administrative duties.
law concerning overtime pay 
any work in excess of eight hours in one workday and any work in excess of hours in any one workweek shall be compensated at the rate of no less than one and times the regular rate of pay for an employee,subd.a.however,t he industrial welfare commission may establish exemptions from the requirement that an overtime rate of compensation be paid pursuant to sections for executive,administrative,and professional employees,provided that the employee is primarily engaged in the duties that meet the test of the exemption,customarily and regularly exercises discretion and independent judgment in performing those duties,and earns a monthly salary equivalent to no less than two times the state minimum wage for employment,subd.a.
pursuant to the authority granted by section to establish exemptions to the overtime pay provision of section,the industrial welfare commission issued wage order,applicable to professional,technical,clerical,mechanical,and similar occupations.included in title of the california code of regulations,as section,the wage order provides a test to determine whether the administrative employee exemption applies.the employee must perform office or work directly related to management policies or general business operations of the employer or its customers,customarily and regularly exercise discretion and independent judgment,perform under only general supervision work along specialized or technical lines requiring special training or execute under only general supervision special assignments and tasks,be engaged in the activities meeting the test for the exemption at least percent of the time,and earn twice the state minimum wage stated in the conjunctive,each of the five elements must be satisfied to find the employee exempt as an administrative employee.
in its statement of decision,the trial court found abi did not meet its burden of proof with respect to the first element of the eicher performed office or work directly related to management policies or general business operations of abi or its customers.the court did not consider the remaining elements 
work related to management policies or general business operations 
abi asserts the trial court failed to apply properly the first element of the test for whether eicher was an exempt administrative employee,which is whether eicher performed office or work directly related to management policies or general business operations,tit,subd.a a i.noting this test is stated in the disjunctive management policies or general business operations italics added,abi claims the court focused only on the first eicher performed work directly related to management did not sufficiently consider whether eicher performed work directly related to abi general business operations.
federal and california authorities draw a distinction between administrative employees,who are usually described as employees performing work directly related to management policies or general business operations of his employer or his employer customers,fn.omitted and production employees,who have been described as those whose primary duty is producing the commodity or commodities,whether goods or services,that the enterprise exists to produce.dalheim cir.bell,supra,th,d.employees engaged in an activity that constitutes the company primary purpose are likely production workers.martin cooper supply cir.
in bell,supra,th,d,claims representatives employed by farmers insurance exchange sued for overtime pay that they alleged had been wrongfully denied them.the trial court ruled,on undisputed testimony,that the claims representatives were production workers.in affirming that portion of the ruling the court of appeal focused on the fact that the work engaged in by the claims representatives was the core business of farmers insurance is,adjusting claims.the court concluded since the term administrative capacity imposes an independent requirement of the exemption,our conclusion that claims representatives do not work in an administrative role within the farmers business organization is dispositive and establishes their nonexempt status.we reach this conclusion through an analysis of the peculiar nature of farmers business and the claims representatives role in that business,while recognizing that a careful analysis of the employees duties may be necessary to determine exempt or nonexempt status in other cases.bell,supra,th at,d.
here,eicher duties were comparable to those of the claims representatives in bell.he regularly engaged in the core business of is,implementing the abi mastermind product at customer venues and supporting the customers,whether at the customer venues or in the abi office.while he was required to learn of the customers management policies and business operations in the course of his work,in order to ensure that the product met the needs of the customers,he did so only to implement the software in the most beneficial way for the customers and not to participate in or alter the general operation of the business.eicher service in implementing the software merely automated processes the customer had previously handled manually.
citing a former federal regulation,abi asserts an exempt administrative employee is one who carr ies out major assignments in conducting the operations of the business,or whose work affects business operations to a substantial degree.former c see webster pub.sch.emples.of,cir,discussing the federal regulation.however,abi did not cite this regulation in its trial court papers.although eicher was often the point person in working with customers,the concept of what is a major assignment with respect to abi business operations was not established with evidence or argument at trial.therefore,abi did not carry its burden of establishing that eicher employment at abi included carrying out major assignments.
furthermore,we have found no evidence that california courts have found persuasive under california law this expansive definition of an exempt administrative employee as someone who carries out major assignments.the command to interpret exemption statutes narrowly to protect employees leads us to believe such an expansive interpretation is not appropriate.see ramirez yosemite water,supra,cal th at,d.
in its opening brief,abi cites but does not discuss horne singer business.for the proposition that an employee who modifies computer programs to meet the specific needs of customers is an exempt administrative employee.that case,however,is distinguishable because the employee also participated in company,which squarely placed the employee within the realm of administrative employees.id.at.
in levie v.at t communications,fair.bna,wl affirmed at cir levie,the employee was a manager in the employer regional management.his duties included the coordination of design and implementation of internal telecommunications projects within the employer southern region,providing administrative and technical support through interaction and consultation with users of such equipment,and coordinating design configuration analysis,identifying interdepartmental impact,designing project team coordination,and user training.the district court found the employee was exempt.abi cites levie for the proposition that,in abi words,i nstallation and troubleshooting are also exempt administrative activities.this understates the extent of the employee duties in levie.he coordinated,designed,and implemented projects,not only working with the customers but also identifying impacts and designing and coordinating project teams.in other words,the employee in levie had more managerial responsibility than eicher and had an impact on how the business was run.accordingly,levie does not support abi assertion that eicher duties made him an exempt administrative employee.
in summary,eicher was an employee who engaged in the core business of abi.he had no personal effect on the policy or general business operations of abi or its customers.we therefore conclude the trial court did not err in determining that abi failed to carry its burden of establishing that eicher was an exempt administrative employee.
sufficiency of evidence 
in the statement of decision,the trial court,as only a part of the description of eicher duties at abi,stated eicher also spent time gathering information about the customers employment practices and entering this data into the appropriate fields of the mastermind program.abi contends that this fact,which was one of the facts that supported the trial court conclusion that eicher was not exempt,is not supported by the evidence.we disagree.
according to abi,the only evidence that eicher spent time manually entering data into the database fields of the mastermind program was testimony from an employee of the sacramento river cats,kristi goldbey.she testified that,in june,eicher,representing abi,worked with the river cats organization to gather information on employees,their level of training,and other characteristics to input into the mastermind system.the process of tracking,scheduling,and paying employees went from completely manual to completely automated.the impact was like night and day.eicher and another abi employee were consultants on the river cats job.they trained river cats staff and helped complete the implementation of the mastermind system and,later,continued to train and resolve any problems that came up.initially,eicher manually entered into the system information about skills,positions,and availability.he only spent about two days at this part of the implementation.
abi asserts it was improper for the trial court to rely on this evidence concerning the river cats implementation in finding that eicher spent time entering data into the systems because the river cats implementation came at a time before the period of time for which eicher is claiming overtime compensation.while it is correct that the river cats implementation in the spring of preceded the time period for which eicher is claiming overtime compensation july,to june,the trial court did not purport to rely on this evidence in making its finding of fact.furthermore,there was other evidence that supported this finding of fact.eicher,himself,testified that he commonly gathered data and entered the data into the system manually when working with a customer.data gathering and database construction took between and percent of his time.eventually,a program was developed to import some of the information about employees from the customer payroll system.this automated some of the manual data entry.although there was some evidence that parts of the process were automated,the trial court properly relied on eicher testimony that he spent to percent of his time in data gathering and entering that data into the system.
defendant contention that the facts in the trial court statement of decision were not supported by evidence is without merit.
for the purpose of billing customers,abi kept track of eicher time.eicher was required to account for at least hours per week.this included,however,paid time off pto.therefore,abi billing system record of eicher hours was not necessarily the time he worked.
eicher submitted to the court the billing system records and based his claim for the amount of damages on those records as an indicator of how many hours he worked.in the statement of decision,the trial court accepted these estimates based on the billing system records as the number of hours eicher worked and calculated eicher overtime compensation from them.abi objected to the statement of decision on the ground that the calculation of overtime compensation improperly included as hours worked the time that eicher was off with pay.the trial court overruled the objection.
on appeal,abi renews its argument that the trial court improperly included as hours worked the time that eicher was off with pay.we find merit in this argument and will order the damages award reduced accordingly.
eicher forfeiture argument 
eicher asserts abi forfeited the argument that the evidence does not support the damages award because abi did not make a motion for new trial.we disagree.
w here the ascertainment of the amount of damage requires resolution of conflicts in the evidence or depends on the credibility of witnesses,the award may not be challenged for inadequacy or excessiveness for the first time on appeal.to permit a party to do so without a motion for new trial would unnecessarily burden reviewing courts with issues which can and should be resolved at the trial court level.citation.glendale fed.sav.loan marina view heights dev.d.in this case,however,abi does not ask this court to resolve conflicts in the evidence or evaluate credibility.instead,abi asserts that,viewing the evidence in the light favorable to the is,to evidence still does not support the judgment.therefore,it was not necessary to move for a new trial in order to preserve this point for appeal.
eicher also asserts abi forfeited this argument because it accepted eicher computations without presenting any evidence of its own on the subject.although it is true abi did not present evidence,such as overtime records,to rebut eicher evidence,we must still determine whether eicher evidence supports the damages awarded.
standard for determining unpaid overtime pay 
although the employee has the burden of proving that he performed work for which he was not compensated,public policy prohibits making that burden an impossible hurdle for the employee.citation.w here the employer records are inaccurate or inadequate and the employee can not offer convincing substitutes a difficult problem arises.the solution,however,is not to penalize the employee by denying him any recovery on the ground that he is unable to prove the precise extent of uncompensated work.such a result would place a premium on an employer failure to keep proper records in conformity with his statutory duty it would allow the employer to keep the benefits of an employee labors without paying due compensation in such a situation we hold that an employee has carried out his burden if he proves that he has in fact performed work for which he was improperly compensated and if he produces sufficient evidence to show the amount and extent of that work as a matter of just and reasonable inference.the burden then shifts to the employer to come forward with evidence of the precise amount of work performed or with evidence to negative the reasonableness of the inference to be drawn from the employee evidence.if the employer fails to produce such evidence,the court may then award damages to the employee,even though the result be only approximate.citations.hernandez mendoza d.
here,eicher submitted evidence from abi billing system concerning the hours attributed to eicher.abi offered no evidence in response.it appears abi did not keep accurate records of eicher overtime.accordingly,we must determine what can reasonably be inferred from the evidence eicher submitted.
reasonable inferences from eicher evidence 
eicher testified that the time reflected in the billing summary included all of the pto he took off.for example,when asked whether the number of hours reflected for included the time off during that year,eicher replied affirmatively.from this,we must conclude that the total number of hours worked is inaccurate it is too high because it includes time eicher took off.eicher accrued at least hours of pto per year during the time for which he now claims overtime should have been paid,for a total of hours he had not used about hours of the accrued pto.therefore,it is unreasonable to conclude from the evidence that eicher worked all of the hours reflected in the billing summaries,as found by the trial court.it is necessary to subtract from that amount hours pto accrued minus hours of pto not used.accordingly,we must subtract this number of hours from the trial court award.because there is no evidence concerning when eicher used the pto,we must use the lowest overtime compensation awarded by the trial court per hour to determine the amount by which the award must be reduced,which is x hours.
by subtracting from the award of,we arrive at the highest amount of unpaid overtime pay supported by the evidence and reasonable inferences drawn from the evidence the award,therefore,must be reduced to that amount.
attorney fees 
the trial court awarded in attorney fees to eicher pursuant to section which allows a prevailing employee to recover attorney fees in a civil action for unpaid overtime compensation.abi contends the trial court was without authority to award attorney fees,because section does not apply to section appeals from administrative decisions,and section does not authorize fees in this case.we shall conclude section authorizes an award of attorney fees for fees incurred in the trial court when an employee prevails in the trial court in a section appeal from an administrative decision.
under the labor code,if an employer fails to pay overtime compensation,the employee may file a civil action fn.omitted or may pursue an administrative remedy set forth in sections et,by filing a complaint with the labor commissioner.section provides in pertinent part that an employee is entitled to recover in a civil action the unpaid balance of the full amount of overtime compensation,including interest thereon,reasonable attorney fees,and costs of suit.sampson parking service,th,d sampson.
section provides for a trial de novo after the labor commissioner issues a decision within days after service of notice of an order,decision,or award the parties may seek review by filing an appeal to the superior court,where the appeal shall be heard de novo,subd.a.the same statute provides for an award of attorney fees if the appealing party is unsuccessful if the party seeking review by filing an appeal to the superior court is unsuccessful in the appeal,the court shall determine the costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred by the other parties to the appeal,and assess that amount as a cost upon the party filing the appeal,subd.c fn,ante.
thus,section broadly allows a prevailing employee to recover attorney fees in a civil action.section,which authorizes an administrative decision to be appeal ed to the trial court,allows a prevailing employee to recover attorney fees only if it was the employer who filed the appeal in the trial court.in this case,it was the employee who filed the appeal and prevailed.by its plain language,section,subdivision c,does not provide for an attorney fees award to a successful appellant.
as we shall explain,section is a specific statute that penalizes unsuccessful appellants.section is a specific statute that allows successful employees but not successful employers to recover attorney fees.to allow the successful employee in this case to recover fees under section would not conflict with or render superfluous section.not to allow the employee to recover under section would undermine the purpose of section.
thus,the purpose of section,subdivision c,is to discourage meritless and unwarranted appeals by assessing costs and attorneys fees against unsuccessful appellants.lolley campbell cal th,d.
section,which authorizes fee awards only in favor of employees,is a statute,the purpose of which is to provide a needed disincentive to violation of minimum wage laws.rules,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended,bell,supra,th,d.
abi cites sampson,supra,th,d,for the proposition that,if an employee chooses to pursue the administrative remedy,the sole right to recover attorney fees is governed by section,not by section.however,sampson held an employee was not entitled to recover attorney fees incurred during the administrative proceedings.id.at,d.the trial court in sampson did award the employee attorney fees incurred during the trial de novo in the trial court presumably under section,subdivision c,because the unsuccessful appeal was filed by the employer.id.at,d.there was no challenge to this part of the award in the appeal to the court of appeal.
sampson,supra,th,d,said,if an employee pursues an administrative remedy under section to recover overtime compensation,the sole right to recover attorney fees is governed by section,subdivision c,and not section.id.at,d.however,sampson can not be read to preclude the employee in this case from recovering attorney fees incurred in the trial court,because sampson also said,we decide only that under the labor code an employee who initially files a complaint with the commissioner bears the cost to proceed in the administrative forum.administrative relief remains an expeditious and economical way to obtain unpaid wages and overtime compensation,and the attorney fees provision of section,subdivision c,creates a disincentive to delay payment through unmeritorious appeals to the superior court.while a civil action may ensure the recovery of all the attorney fees incurred to prosecute an overtime compensation claim,it may also result in the delay in the payment of overtime compensation because of protracted litigation and appeals.the employee must weigh the benefits and risks of the two options the legislature has established to prosecute an overtime compensation claim,and choose one or the other option,italics added.sampson also rejected the employee argument that the administrative hearing was simply one stage of the de novo proceeding in the trial court.id.at,d.
here,there is no claim for attorney fees incurred during the administrative proceedings.thus,sampson is not controlling.
as indicated,section is a statute,the purpose of which is to provide a needed disincentive to violation of minimum wage laws.rules,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended,an analysis of the bill submitted to the senate in advance of the vote stated that,t hese additional remedies are especially necessary in situations where the employees themselves pursue a private action to recover unpaid wages or overtime.bell,supra,th,d.
when an employee files a section appeal from an administrative decision,it is the employee who is pursuing the action,though in some cases the employee may be represented by the commissioner lolley campbell,supra,cal th at,d.the trial de novo,though labeled an appeal,is a trial anew in the fullest sense,in which the administrative decision is entitled to no weight whatsoever,and the parties may present entirely new evidence to the trial court.sampson,supra,th,d.
thus,for purposes of section,the section trial de novo falls within the broad definition of action as an ordinary proceeding in a court of justice by which one party prosecutes another for the declaration,enforcement,or protection of a right,or the redress or prevention of a wrong code civ.that section refers to civil action rather than action is not a reasonable basis upon which to deny fees to a successful employee.we express no view on whether a section trial de novo constitutes an action for any other purpose.see,rogers municipal court d.although section notice of appeal may be thought of as an initial trial pleading,it is not a pleading for purposes of the rule that an officer of a corporation who is not an attorney may not file a civil complaint in superior court.
our construction of section does not render section,subdivision c,superfluous.section,subdivision c,would allow a successful employer to recover attorney fees if the employer prevailed in a section appeal filed by the employee.the employer in such a situation would not be entitled to attorney fees under section,which authorizes fee awards only in favor of employees.
nor does our construction of section conflict with section.thus,the purpose of section,subdivision c,is to discourage meritless and unwarranted appeals by assessing costs and attorneys fees against unsuccessful appellants.lolley campbell,supra,cal th at,d.lolley describes some of the legislative history of section an early analysis of the bill that added the fee provision to section noted that its fiscal effect included possible moneys to the state on the basis of attorneys fees and other costs that would be assessed.citation.a later analysis of the bill observed that since the commissioner is successful in about of all appeals,this bill would result in a net increase in revenues to the commissioner.citation.before the bill was signed by the governor,the department of industrial relations submitted an enrolled bill report explaining that i n the labor commissioner was successful in of the appeals to the court so that in most appeals,attorney fees and costs would be awarded citation.it appears,therefore,that the legislature viewed the statute as providing for reasonable attorney fees and costs to be awarded for legal services provided by the labor commissioner as well as private attorneys.lolley,supra,cal th at,d.
thus,because the labor commissioner was not involved in the appeal in this case,it does no disservice to section to allow the employee to recover attorney fees under section.to the contrary,denial of fees would be inconsistent with the legislative intent of administrative hearings under section berman hearings,which is to provide a speedy,informal,and affordable method of resolving wage claims.cuadra millan cal th,d.the legislative intent in creating berman hearings stats,ch,was to expedite the handling of claims and discourage obstruction and stalling tactics engaged in by some employers knowing that the only recourse available to the labor commissioner to enforce a valid claim is to sue in the superior court.that process often delays final resolution and many times when a court decision is finally rendered on a matter,the employer is no longer in business or has declared bankruptcy or has reorganized under a different name,all of which frustrates the purpose of the labor code protections regarding timely and complete payment of wages to california workers.indus.relations,enrolled bill report,assem.bill.
in many cases,an employee attorney fees in a trial de novo will exceed his or her wage recovery.in this case,for example,the wage recovery is only about more than attorney fees.thus,after payment of his attorney fees,plaintiff eicher would recover only percent of the wages due him if he were not allowed to recover attorney fees.such a result would discourage employees from pursuing valid claims for wages owing.public policy favors employees in their efforts to recover overtime compensation.see gould maryland sound industries,th,d broad public interest in enforcing overtime laws.
abi cites dawson westerly investigations,d supp,in which the appellate department of the superior court of los angeles county held an employer who prevailed in its section appeal to the trial court was not entitled to attorney fees or costs under section,because that statute authorized only against unsuccessful appellants,not in favor of successful appellants.dawson said section was an exception to the general rule of code of civil procedure section,subdivision b,that a prevailing party is entitled to costs except as otherwise provided by statute.dawson,supra,at.however,dawson did not have occasion to consider section would not have applied in that case because section authorizes awards only in favor of prevailing employees,not prevailing employers,and in dawson the employer was the prevailing party.
abi argues that resorting to section in order to grant an attorney fee award in favor of the section appellant would nullify the implied rule of section that only respond
