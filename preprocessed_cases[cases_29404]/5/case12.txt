claiming that he was subjected to dirty tricks during his successful campaign to become the police chief of vinton,petitioner fox filed a suit against vice,the incumbent chief,and the town vice,for short.fox suit asserted both claims,including defamation,and federal civil rights claims under,including interference with fox right to seek public office.vice removed the case to federal court based on the claims.after discovery,he sought summary judgment on the federal claims,which fox conceded were not valid.the district court accordingly dismissed them with prejudice and remanded the remaining claims to state court,noting that vice attorneys work could be useful in the proceedings.vice then asked the federal court for attorney fees under,submitting attorney billing records estimating the time spent on the entire suit,without differentiating between time spent on the federal claims and on the remaining state claims.the court granted the motion on the ground that fox federal claims were frivolous,awarding fox fees for all work his attorneys had performed in the suit.although the allegations had not been found frivolous,the court did not require vice to separate out the work the attorneys had done on the two sets of claims.it also declined to reduce the fee award to reflect the surviving claims,noting that both sides had focused on the frivolous claims.the fifth circuit affirmed,rejecting fox argument that every claim in a suit must be frivolous for the defendant to recover any fees,and agreeing with the district court that the litigation had focused on the frivolous federal claims.
when a plaintiff suit involves both frivolous and claims,a court may grant reasonable fees to the defendant,but only for costs that the defendant would not have incurred but for the frivolous claims.
a section allows the award of a reasonable attorney fee to the prevailing party in certain civil rights cases,including suits.while most of this court decisions have concerned fees to prevailing plaintiffs,also authorizes a fee award to a prevailing defendant upon a finding that the plaintiff action was frivolous,unreasonable,or without foundation.christiansburg garment eeoc.just as plaintiffs may receive fees under even if they are not victorious on every claim,hensley eckerhart,so too may a defendant be reimbursed for costs under even if the plaintiff suit is not wholly frivolous.the defendant is not entitled to fees arising from these charges,see christiansburg,at,but the presence of reasonable allegations does not immunize the plaintiff against paying for the fees that his frivolous claims imposed.
b the question then becomes how to allocate fees in a lawsuit having both frivolous and claims.congress purpose in enacting to relieve defendants of the burdens associated with fending off frivolous litigation points to the proper standard section allows a defendant to recover reasonable attorney fees incurred because of,but only because of,a frivolous claim,permits the defendant to receive only the portion of his fees that he would not have paid but for the frivolous claim.a standard allowing more expansive would furnish windfalls to some defendants,who would be relieved of normal litigation costs merely because the plaintiff suit also included frivolous claims.this standard may,in some instances,allow compensation to a defendant for attorney work relating to both frivolous and claims,for instance,if the frivolous claim requires a lawyer to do more work because of the defendant greater financial exposure on that claim.the dispositive question is not whether attorney costs at all relate to a claim,but whether the costs would have been incurred in the absence of the frivolous allegation.the answers to those inquiries will usually track each other,but when they diverge,it is the second one that matters.the determination of fees should not result in a second major litigation.hensley,at.the essential goal in shifting fees is to do rough justice,not to achieve auditing perfection.the trial court has wide discretion,but must apply the correct standard.and the appeals court must determine whether the trial court asked and answered this question,rather than some other.
the lower courts used an incorrect standard in awarding fees to vice.the district court analysis suggests that vice attorneys would have done much the same work even if fox had not brought his frivolous claims.the charges arose out of vice conduct in the campaign,and with respect both to the frivolous federal claims and to the claims,his defense entailed proof or denial of essentially the same facts.it thus seems likely that vice attorneys would have,taken many of the same depositions.although the district court noted the usefulness of the attorneys work in defending against the claims,it failed to take proper account of the overlap between the frivolous and claims.its reasoning that the close relationship between the federal and claims supported the award can not be squared with the congressional policy of sparing defendants from the costs only of frivolous litigation.nor did the fifth circuit uphold the award on the proper ground.it seemed to think vice could receive fees for any work useful to defending against a frivolous claim,even if his lawyers would have done that work regardless.on this record,the case must be returned to the lower courts.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit 
justice kagan delivered the opinion of the court.
federal law authorizes a court to award a reasonable attorney fee to the prevailing party in certain civil rights cases.see.we have held that a defendant may receive such an award if the plaintiff suit is frivolous.in this case,the plaintiff asserted both frivolous and claims.we hold today that a court may grant reasonable fees to the defendant in this circumstance,but only for costs that the defendant would not have incurred but for the frivolous claims.a trial court has wide discretion in applying this standard.but here we must vacate the judgment below because the court used a different and incorrect standard in awarding fees.
this case arises out of an election for chief of police in the town of vinton,louisiana.the candidates were petitioner ricky fox the challenger and respondent billy ray vice the incumbent by fox account,vice resorted to an assortment of dirty tricks to try to force fox out of the race.in particular,vice sent an anonymous letter to fox threatening to publish damaging charges against him if he remained a candidate.vice also arranged for a third party to publicly accuse fox of using racial slurs and then to file a criminal complaint against fox repeating those allegations.and when prosecutors ignored that faux complaint,vice leaked it to the press.yet all of these machinations failed fox won the election.and vice got an even greater comeuppance he was subsequently convicted of criminal extortion for his conduct.
fox,however,chose not to let the matter rest he filed this suit in louisiana state court against vice and the town of vinton,also a respondent here.fox complaint asserted both claims,including defamation,and federal civil rights claims under,including interference with his right to seek public office.vice and the town vice,for short removed the case to federal court on the basis of the claims.
at the end of discovery in the suit,vice moved for summary judgment on fox federal claims.fox conceded that the claims were no t valid,app,and the district court accordingly dismissed them with prejudice.in the same ruling,the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claims.docket wd,app.to pet.for cert.the court instead remanded the now case to state court for adjudication.in doing so,the district court observed that a ny trial preparation,legal research,and discovery may be used by the parties in the state court proceedings.at.
vice then asked the federal court for an award of attorney fees under,arguing that fox federal claims were baseless and without merit.app.vice stated that his lawyers had had to participate in five lengthy depositions and review numerous records to defend against fox charges,at.in support of his fee request,vice submitted attorney billing records estimating the time spent on the whole suit,without differentiating between the federal and claims.see supp.app.
the district court granted the motion for attorney fees on the ground that fox federal claims were frivolous.although the allegations had not been found frivolous and indeed remained live,the court did not require vice to separate out the work his attorneys had done on the two sets of claims.docket wd,app.to pet.for cert.according to the court,such segregation was unnecessary because the various claims arose out of the same transaction and were so interrelated that their prosecution or defense entailed proof or denial of essentially the same facts.ibid.internal quotation marks omitted.similarly,the court declined to reduce the fee award to reflect the surviving claims.t hroughout the litigation,the court stated,both sides focus ed on fox frivolous claims,at.the court therefore concluded that vice should receive all of the fees he reasonably incurred in defending the suit a total of,at.
a divided court of appeals affirmed.the majority first rejected fox contention that all claims in a suit must be frivolous for the defendant to recover any fees.that rule,the court explained,would allow plaintiffs to prosecute frivolous claims without consequenc e so long as they added a single claim,at quoting hailey.the court of appeals then turned to the district court decision that vice was entitled to fees for all time thus far spent on the case,even though claims remained unadjudicated.repeating the trial court view that the whole litigation had focused on the frivolous federal claims,the fifth circuit upheld the fee award.see,at.
judge southwick dissented.he agreed that vice was entitled to some reimbursement for fees,at.but he thought the district court had erred in declining to allocate the fees separately between the successful claims and the unsuccessful ones just because all of them were interrelated.ibid.w hen some claims are dismissed as frivolous and others are not,he stated,the defendants should receive fees only for the legal work allocable solely or dominantly to the dismissed claims,at.because in this case almost all of the defendant s discovery and factual analysis would have been necessary even if no federal claims had been brought,he concluded,the fee award should have been much smaller.ibid.
the fifth circuit decision deepened a circuit split about whether and to what extent a court may award fees to a defendant under when a plaintiff asserts both frivolous and claims one court of appeals has forbidden any compensation unless all of the plaintiff claims are frivolous.see balmer hca.others have rejected this approach,but struggled with how to allocate fees in a suit that involves a mix of frivolous and claims.compare,opinion below,with colombrito kelly,declining to award fees when the frivolous claim added no additional testimony or expense to the trial we granted certiorari to resolve these questions.
our legal system generally requires each party to bear his own litigation expenses,including attorney fees,whether he wins or loses.indeed,this principle is so firmly entrenched that it is known as the american rule.see alyeska pipeline service wilderness society.but congress has authorized courts to deviate from this background rule in certain types of cases by shifting fees from one party to another.see burlington dague,listing federal provisions.
the statute involved here,allows the award of a reasonable attorney fee to the prevailing party in various kinds of civil rights cases,including suits brought under.most of our decisions addressing this provision have concerned the grant of fees to prevailing plaintiffs.when a plaintiff succeeds in remedying a civil rights violation,we have stated,he serves as a private attorney general,vindicating a policy that congress considered of the highest priority.newman piggie park enterprises,per curiam.he therefore should ordinarily recover an attorney fee from the defendant the party whose misconduct created the need for legal action.christiansburg garment eeoc,internal quotation marks omitted.fee shifting in such a case at once reimburses a plaintiff for what it cos t him to vindicate civil rights,riverside rivera,internal quotation marks omitted,and holds to account a violator of federal law,christiansburg,at.
in christiansburg,we held that also authorizes a fee award to a prevailing defendant,but under a different standard reflecting the quite different equitable considerations at stake,at.in enacting,we stated,congress sought to protect defendants from burdensome litigation having no legal or factual basis.at.accordingly,authorizes a district court to award attorney fees to a defendant upon a finding that the plaintiff action was frivolous,unreasonable,or without foundation.at see also kentucky graham.
these standards would be easy to apply if life were like the movies,but that is usually not the case.in hollywood,litigation most often concludes with a dramatic verdict that leaves one party fully triumphant and the other utterly prostrate.the court in such a case would know exactly how to award fees even if that scene is generally left on the floor.but in the real world,litigation is more complex,involving multiple claims for relief that implicate a mix of legal theories and have different merits.some claims succeed others fail.some charges are frivolous others even if not ultimately successful have a reasonable basis.in short,litigation is messy,and courts must deal with this untidiness in awarding fees.
given this reality,we have made clear that plaintiffs may receive fees under even if they are not victorious on every claim.a civil rights plaintiff who obtains meaningful relief has corrected a violation of federal law and,in so doing,has vindicated congress statutory.that result is what matters,we explained in hensley eckerhart,a court should compensate the plaintiff for the time his attorney reasonably spent in achieving the favorable outcome,even if the plaintiff failed to prevail on every contention.ibid.the fee award,of course,should not reimburse the plaintiff for work performed on claims that bore no relation to the grant of relief such work can not be deemed to have been expended in pursuit of the ultimate result achieved.ibid.internal quotation marks omitted.but the presence of these unsuccessful claims does not immunize a defendant against paying for the attorney fees that the plaintiff reasonably incurred in remedying a breach of his civil rights.
analogous principles indicate that a defendant may deserve fees even if not all the plaintiff claims were frivolous.in this context,serves to relieve a defendant of expenses attributable to frivolous charges.the plaintiff acted wrongly in leveling such allegations,and the court may shift to him the reasonable costs that those claims imposed on his adversary.see christiansburg,at.that remains true when the plaintiff suit also includes claims.the defendant,of course,is not entitled to any fees arising from these charges.see ibid.but the presence of reasonable allegations in a suit does not immunize the plaintiff against paying for the fees that his frivolous claims imposed.
indeed,we have previously said exactly this much.in hensley,we noted the possibility that a plaintiff might prevail on one contention in a suit while also asserting an unrelated frivolous claim.in this situation,we explained,a court could properly award fees to both parties to the plaintiff,to reflect the fees he incurred in bringing the meritorious claim and to the defendant,to compensate for the fees he paid in defending against the frivolous one.see,at.we thus made clear that a court may reimburse a defendant for costs under even if a plaintiff suit is not wholly frivolous.to recompense a defendant as to recompense a plaintiff is not a defendant need not show that every claim in a complaint is frivolous to qualify
