facts and proceedings below 
appeal of the dismissal 
kos pharmaceuticals,kos is a pharmaceutical company that develops and markets prescription drugs.kos completed an initial public offering of its common stock on march,selling shares at per share.from october,to october,kos completed a secondary offering of its common stock.on october,kos filed the prospectus and registration statement for the secondary offering with the securities and exchange commission.the offering price was.a total of shares were sold in the secondary offering.kos sold shares.michael jaharis,kos founder,majority shareholder and chairman,sold shares.daniel bell,kos president and chief executive officer,sold shares.
kos only prescription drug product that was publicly available at the time of the secondary offering was an extended release niacin preparation called niaspan.niaspan was approved by the food and drug administration in july.kos began shipping niaspan to wholesalers in august,and its sales force began detailing physicians in september.on november,a salomon brothers analyst,robert uhl,released a report in which he slashed kos projected revenue for by half,from million to million,and changed the rating of kos stock from buy to hold.the next day,the price of kos stock plummeted from to per share.uhl report was premised on estimates of the numbers of new and refill prescriptions for niaspan during the first eight weeks that kos sales force marketed niaspan.uhl conclusions were based on the assumption that he and many other pharmaceutical analysts apparently share that the number of new prescriptions filled during the eighth week of a new prescription drug product initial marketing is particularly predictive of the market success the product will enjoy.the eighth week of niaspan marketing ended on october.uhl stated that to achieve the original million revenue projection,new prescriptions of niaspan during the eighth week were needed.ims america estimated that only new prescriptions for niaspan were filled during the eighth week.uhl explained that,considering the small size of kos sales force and their program of providing sample packs which contain a supply of niaspan to physicians,he would have been satisfied with new prescriptions during week eight.uhl concluded by noting that due to the sampling program and the bias of many physicians,niaspan could be the first drug for which the initial weekly prescriptions are not indicative of the product ultimate success.
kos page prospectus,filed october,explained the many risks of investing in kos,among them the company ability to successfully commercialize niaspan will depend significantly on the acceptance of niaspan by physicians and their patients niaspan has been designed to minimize the severity of the side effect of flushing,but most patients taking niaspan will experience flushing and there can be no assurance that patients using niaspan will not suffer episodes of flushing that they consider intolerable.kos clinical trials indicate that less than one per cent of patients taking niaspan experience clinically significant elevations in liver enzymes,but physicians have historically been reluctant to prescribe niacin preparations because of such risk and it is possible that the actual incidence of hepatotoxicity will exceed one per cent kos has fewer marketing resources than its competitors,a smaller sales force,and limited marketing experience,which could prevent niaspan from achieving market acceptance during the initial months following the launch of niaspan,many physicians may start only a limited number of selected patients on niaspan physicians bias combined with the distribution of starter packs which are dispensed without prescription may result in only a modest increase in niaspan prescriptions for the first three to six months of its marketing and since its inception,kos had lost about million and there can be no assurance that kos will ever achieve profitability.
on august,oxford and lowey,dannenberg knapp,lowey filed this suit in the northern district of illinois.on december,the action was transferred to the southern district of florida.plaintiffs brought this action as a proposed class action oxford proposed to represent plaintiffs that purchased kos stock in the secondary offering.lowey proposed to represent plaintiffs that purchased kos stock on the open market between july,and november.the complaint alleged violations of sections a,a and of the act,a,a and,sections b and a of the act,b and a,and rule b.the complaint also alleges common law fraud,negligent misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duty.all of the causes of action in plaintiffs original complaint are based on defendants alleged material misrepresentations and omissions in press releases,the prospectus,the registration statement,and other sec filings concerning the safety,efficacy,tolerability and sales volume of niaspan.on january,the kos defendants moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to.b.the underwriter defendants so moved on february.at the dismissal hearing,the plaintiffs advanced a new basis for recovery,namely that the prospectus should have disclosed the first six weeks of ims america estimates of niaspan prescription volume.in the interests of justice,the district court considered this as an amended claim.on may,the district court granted the motions to dismiss,holding that the omission of the prescription volume data was immaterial as a matter of law and that plaintiffs allegations as to the safety,efficacy,tolerability and sales volume of niaspan were mere legal conclusions masquerading as facts.on august,the district court dismissed the complaint with prejudice.
oxford appeals the dismissal of its act and the common law claims of fraud and negligent misrepresentation,but admits that dismissal of the common law claims was proper if dismissal of the federal claims was proper.oxford does not appeal the dismissal of its act claims.lowey,which was not named as a plaintiff in the act counts,does not appeal to this court.
appeal of the attorneys fees award 
on july,the kos defendants moved for sanctions pursuant to the private securities litigation and reform act pslra and rule.on july,the underwriter defendants so moved.on january,the district court granted the motions for sanctions,finding that the plaintiffs were deliberately indifferent to the lack of factual support for the allegations in the complaint and that,therefore,the complaint was objectively frivolous.on may,the district court awarded in attorney fees to the defendants.on june,the district court clarified its earlier order and increased the award to.oxford appeals the district court grant of defendants motions for sanctions and its award of attorney fees to defendants.
consolidation 
this court subsequently granted oxford motion to consolidate the appeals for oral argument.

ii.district court consideration of documents attached to the kos defendants motion to dismiss 
in resolving the defendants motions for dismissal,the district court considered the prospectus,which was attached to the complaint kos for the period ending september,which was required to be and was actually filed by kos with the sec the uhl report,quoted in the complaint a july,press release,quoted in the complaint a november,press release,quoted in the complaint a article about niaspan,quoted in the complaint and the niaspan package insert.all of these documents were attached to the kos defendants motion to dismiss.oxford contends that consideration of such matters outside of the pleadings was improper on a motion to dismiss,and that the district court should have converted the motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment.we disagree.in a motion to dismiss a securities action,a court may consider the contents of public disclosure documents which are required to be filed with the sec and are actually so filed.bryant avado brands,cir.the documents may only be considered to show their contents,not to prove the truth of matters asserted therein.neither do we find error in the district court use of the uhl report,the press releases or the article.see harris ivax,cir.the package insert for niaspan was not referred to in the complaint,but the district court reasoned that its contents could be judicially noticed because it is a matter of public record part of the fda public file,is included in every package of niaspan,and also listed in the physician desk reference.the district court specifically stated it was not accepting the facts asserted in the insert as true,and appears only to have used it to show the bare existence of a clinical study which stated that niaspan could increase hdl cholesterol by.we find no error in this.
iii.section claims 
section a of the act,provides a cause of action to purchasers of securities where any part of the registration statement,when such part became effective,contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading section extends liability to every person who signed the registration statement,the issuer directors,and every underwriter.section a of the act,imposes liability upon one who sells a security by means of a prospectus or oral communication,which includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading section of the act,extends section and liability to persons who control entities liable under those sections.thus,to state a claim under any of these sections,oxford must properly allege a material misrepresentation or a material omission.
omission of prescription volume data 
to avoid dismissal of a section omission claim,plaintiffs must properly allege the prospectus contained an omission the omission was material defendants were under a duty to disclose the omitted material information and that such information existed at the time the prospectus became effective.cooperman individual,cir.the complaint as amended at oral argument before the district court alleges that kos possessed the first seven weeks of niaspan prescription volume history this information was material issuers have a duty to disclose all material information in the prospectus and the absence of the prescription volume information rendered the prospectus misleading.
materiality 
the district court assumed that kos was in possession of several weeks of information,but held that,because uhl based his conclusions almost entirely on the number of new prescriptions for niaspan filled during the eighth week which occurred after the close of the offering,the partial,preliminary information kos possessed was not material.the district court also noted the prospectus mention of several obstacles to the market acceptance of niaspan,including a specific warning that niaspan sales may grow slowly during the first three to six months of its marketing.
the test of materiality is well known.t o fulfill the materiality requirement there must be a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.basic incorporated levinson,d quoting tsc industries,northway,d.the trier of fact usually decides the issue of materiality.cooperman,at.only if the lack of importance of the omission is so plain that reasonable minds can not differ thereabout is it proper for the court to pronounce the omission immaterial as a matter of law.ganino citizens utilities,cir cooperman,at.
we are willing to assume,at the dismissal stage,that kos possessed whatever prescription volume information existed.we do not know how quickly the ims america estimates became available,but some delay or lag time seems inevitable.the prospectus was filed october.oxford purchased its stock on october,the last day of the seventh week of niaspan marketing.thus,oxford assertion that kos possessed seven weeks of data is literally unbelievable.even though kos probably did not possess even six weeks of information,for dismissal purposes we will assume that it did.
realizing that no argument could be made that kos possessed the critical eighth week of information,oxford characterizes the partial data as a material trend.during the sixth week,there were new prescriptions for niaspan.oxford point appears to be that,considering the first six weeks of data,it was very unlikely that niaspan would achieve the uhl goal of to new prescriptions per week,and therefore a reasonable investor would consider the total mix of information significantly altered by the data inclusion.the district court correctly observed that the prospectus explains the several reasons why niaspan may start more slowly than other drugs.however,the immateriality of the six weeks of prescription information is arguably not so plain that reasonable minds could not differ about it.accordingly,we will assume for purposes of the motion to dismiss that the six weeks of prescription volume information was material.
duty to disclose 
oxford asserts three bases for kos duty to disclose the prescription data in the prospectus a general duty to disclose,in the prospectus,all information material to the offering item a ii of regulation,a ii and the omission of the prescription data rendered the prospectus materially misleading.we address each of these arguments in turn.
general duty 
oxford first argues that issuers have a duty to disclose,in the prospectus,all information material to the offering.we disagree.section a only makes actionable the omission of a material fact required to be stated in the prospectus or necessary to make the statements in the prospectus not misleading.to hold that section a imposes liability unless the prospectus includes all material facts is simply to wholly ignore and render superfluous that section qualifying language required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.this we may not do.moreover,considering that materiality will usually be an issue for the trier of fact,to require all material information to appear in the prospectus would,like setting the threshold for materiality too low,result in registrants burying the shareholders in an avalanche of trivial result that is hardly conducive to informed decisionmaking.basic levinson,d quoting tsc industries,northway,d.we join with the first circuit in recognizing that the mere possession of material nonpublic information does not create a duty to disclose it and that the duty question is properly stated as whether the defendants had a specific obligation to disclose information of the type that the plaintiffs complain was omitted from the registration statement and prospectus.shaw digital equipment,cir.if the prospectus contains all of the material information specifically required by the securities laws,does not contain an untrue statement of a material fact and if the statements therein are not materially misleading in any respect,there has been no material misrepresentation or material omission.
in its reply brief,oxford asserts,for the first time,that disclosure of the prescription volume estimates was required by item a ii of regulation,a ii.while we need not consider this untimely argument,even if we did consider it,it,too,would fail.
other circuits have considered whether or in what circumstances section liability may be premised upon the failure to disclose information required by item.see oran stafford,cir steckman hart brewing,cir.however,we need not explore those questions because we conclude that in any event item did not require that the prospectus disclose the first six weeks prescriptions.
item a ii requires registrants to 
describe any known trends or uncertainties that have had or that the registrant reasonably expects will have a material favorable or unfavorable impact on net sales or revenues or income from continuing operations.if the registrant knows of events that will cause a material change in the relationship between costs and revenues such as known future increases in costs of labor or materials or price increases or inventory adjustments,the change in the relationship shall be disclosed.
oxford argues that the prescription data constitutes a known trend that niaspan was not selling or being prescribed and that,therefore,item a ii requires its disclosure.there are,at least,two independently sufficient reasons why this contention can not be sustained.
the first element of the item disclosure test set forth in securities act release requires management to assess whether the known trend,demand,commitment,event or uncertainty is likely to come to fruition.securities act release,wl at.as regards trends,we interpret this element to require an assessment of whether an observed pattern accurately reflects persistent conditions of the particular registrant business environment.it may be that a particular pattern is,for example,of such short duration that it will not support any conclusions about the registrant business environment.release states that management assessment must be objectively reasonable,viewed as of the time the determination is made.id.we interpret this language as establishing a negligence standard.
oxford complaint says nothing about item.moreover,it does not allege facts that,if true,would support a finding of negligence as to kos management belief that the prescription data did not reflect that the uncertainties identified in the prospectus had been resolved against the marketability of niaspan.this deficiency is highlighted by uhl discussion of kos management disagreement with his new projection,in which he specifically notes the experience and competence of kos management team and mentions several steps that could be taken to help bolster awareness of the product.uhl concludes with a significant admission niaspan could be the first product of which we know where initial weekly prescriptions are not indicative of the product ultimate success.the complaint alleges that management assessment was incorrect and repeatedly emphasizes that,as to the issuer,section imposes strict liability for material omissions.however,in determining the existence of an omission based on item disclosure requirements,release clearly established a negligence standard.oxford failure to allege facts from which the objective unreasonableness of kos management decision not to include the prescription information in the prospectus could be inferred forecloses reliance upon item as a source of a duty to disclose that information.
a second,even clearer,barrier to oxford reliance upon item a ii is that it is primarily concerned with developments that render the registrant reported results less indicative of the registrant future prospects,a concern not implicated here.instruction to paragraph a provides 
the discussion and analysis shall focus specifically on material events and uncertainties known to management that would cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future operating results or of future financial condition.this would include descriptions and amounts of a matters that would have an impact on future operations and have not had an impact in the past,and b matters that have had an impact on reported operations and are not expected to have an impact upon future operations.
item a ii essentially says to a registrant if there has been an important change in your company business or environment that significantly or materially decreases the predictive value of your reported results,explain this change in the prospectus.the obvious focus is on preventing the latest reported results from misleading potential investors,thereby promoting a more accurate picture of the registrant future prospects.
here,the prescription data was used by a market analyst to make a projection.this projection disappointed the market,which had been very optimistic about kos because of the market analyst prior,more favorable projection.however,the market disappointment in the changed revenue projection did not render kos previously reported results unreliable.see glassman computervision,cir.the prospectus stated that kos had lost almost million since its inception and that there could be no assurance that the company would ever be profitable.if booming niaspan sales had carried kos for the previous several reported quarters but suddenly and significantly declined,a potential investor could be mislead by those reported results unless kos disclosed the importance of niaspan and discussed the downward trend in niaspan sales.that is the type of situation item a ii was designed to address.but that is not this case.because the prescription information did not render kos reported results any materially less indicative of the company future prospects,item a ii does not require its disclosure 
misleading prospectus 
oxford also argues that kos had a duty to include the prescription data because the prospectus was materially misleading without it.we conclude that the prospectus thoroughly explained the risks involved in marketing niaspan,and specifically warned that niaspan might have a slow start.the uhl report mentioned the possibility that niaspan first eight weeks may not be indicative of its ultimate market success.in view of all of this,the six weeks of prescription data,which represents only a very preliminary indication that niaspan was staring slowly,did not have to be included in the prospectus.such indication did not render materially misleading the prospectus treatment of the market acceptance of niaspan as an uncertainty.
in sum,we hold that kos had no duty to disclose the referenced prescription data in the prospectus.
misrepresentation of niaspan efficacy 
the prospectus stated that niaspan could increase hdl cholesterol by to.paragraph of the complaint alleges that niaspan can not increase hdl cholesterol by up to.the only facts pleaded in support of this bald assertion were the results of two of the four clinical studies relied upon by kos in stating the to range.these two studies showed that niaspan could increase hdl by and.kos claims that one of the four studies shows niaspan can increase hdl by.a study noting such results is referred to in niaspan package insert.at oral argument before this court,oxford complained that it had never seen this study and reiterated its view that the claim was false.
the fatal flaw in oxford position is the complaint failure to allege facts that support the conclusion that the claim is false.as mentioned,the complaint only references two studies,both of which are consistent with the to range set forth in the prospectus.the district court held that because both numbers from these sources were in the range quoted in the prospectus,neither was evidence that this range was false.we agree.no two clinical trials will produce exactly the same results.two studies that show average hdl improvement of less than,even significantly less,does not tend to establish that the stated range is false.
misrepresentation of niaspan safety 
the prospectus stated that only about of patients taking niaspan experienced clinically significant increases in liver enzymes and that the threshold for clinical significance was three times the normal level paragraph of the complaint alleges that niaspan use elevated liver toxicity to an intolerable and unsafe level.by defining clinically significant elevations in liver function tests as greater than three times the upper limit of normal,kos misrepresented the industry standard as to what constitutes tolerable and safe levels of liver toxicity.
the complaint does not plead the existence of facts that would support its allegation that niaspan elevates liver enzymes to an intolerable level.the complaint fails to articulate what the proper threshold for clinical significance is,although,after the motions to dismiss were granted,oxford asserted,in its response to the defendants motions for sanctions,that it is twice the normal level.no studies are referred to,no specific facts are pleaded that indicate any basis for oxford bald assertions that niaspan elevates liver enzymes to an intolerable level or that kos employed the wrong standard in its clinical trials.
in its response to defendants motions to dismiss,oxford added an additional safety claim,which the district court,in the interest of fairness,considered.this claim was that the prospectus is misleading because it did not state that of patients taking niaspan would experience flushing.as regards the flushing issue,the prospectus stated although most patients taking niaspan will sometimes flush,the formulation and dosing regimen for niaspan have been designed to maximize patient acceptance and minimize the occurrence of flushing.there can be no assurance,however,that patients using niaspan will not suffer episodes of flushing that they consider intolerable.in view of this and other candid statements about the side effect of flushing that appear in the prospectus,we hold that the prospectus was not misleading in this respect.
misrepresentations of niaspan tolerability 
paragraph of the complaint observes that subjects in kos clinical trials were given mg of niaspan per day and alleges that only a tiny fraction of the market could tolerate such a high dose of niaspan.the complaint alleges that the clinical studies were rigged because kos only administered high doses of niaspan to subjects who were predetermined to have a high tolerance.the complaint does not even specify what side effect prevents all but a tiny fraction of the market from taking niaspan.when,at oral argument,the district court asked for an explanation of the charge that the clinical trials the fda based its approval on were rigged,oxford response was that there must be some reason why physicians do prescribe it.we agree with the district court that the complaint fails to plead any factual basis for the charges found in paragraph.
misrepresentation of million in september sales 
the prospectus estimated that kos reaped million in revenue from the sale of niaspan during the quarter ending september.on november,kos filed its for that quarter,which,consistent with the prospectus estimate,stated that kos had realized initial product sales of niaspan in the amount of million.paragraph of the complaint alleges that the claim of million in sales of niaspan was false.the complaint does not allege any facts that support the conclusion that kos had not sold million in niaspan by september,or that the million figure was inaccurate in any respect.paragraph of the complaint alleges that,even if million in sales did occur,such sales did not result from prescriptions,but rather from pipeline filling sales to wholesalers.the complaint alleges that kos statement,in the prospectus,that it intends to market niaspan directly to the specialist physicians within the cardiovascular market somehow rendered the prospectus misleading without a statement clarifying that the million in sales was to wholesalers.
the prospectus stated that kos sales force was providing as a promotion item starter packs of niaspan to physicians,which generally are dispensed without a prescription,and that sales to warehouses commenced before the sales force began to market niaspan to physicians.it is common knowledge in the pharmaceutical industry that direct marketing to physicians entails promoting the drug product to physicians and encouraging them to prescribe it for their patients.the prospectus simply does not state or imply that the million resulted from prescriptions or direct sales of niaspan to physicians.the prospectus also plainly stated that kos was selling niaspan to wholesalers.the complaint has failed to plead facts that,if true,would constitute a misrepresentation of sales revenue,and does nothing more than offer the legal conclusion that the representation in the prospectus was somehow misleading.
we hold that the dismissal of oxford federal claims,with prejudice,was entirely proper.
iv.attorneys fee award 
c and c require the district court,upon final adjudication of claims brought under the and acts,respectively,to include specific findings as to each party and each attorney compliance with.b.these subsections also provide for a presumption that the proper sanction for a rule b violation is an award,to the opposing party,of the reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred as a direct result of the violation.
the district court found that oxford legal arguments were not frivolous and that oxford performed an adequate investigation before filing its complaint,but that after such investigation a reasonable attorney would have realized that there was no evidentiary support for any of the allegations in the complaint and that such support was unlikely to be unearthed by further investigation or discovery.the district court concluded that the plaintiffs were deliberately indifferent to the lack of evidentiary support for the conclusory allegations in the complaint and that plaintiffs claims were objectively frivolous under.b.the district court awarded in fees and expenses to the kos defendants and to the underwriter defendants.the plaintiffs and their counsel were each responsible for half of the award,or.
an appellate court reviews all aspects of the district court rule determination for an abuse of discretion.worldwide primates,mcgreal,cir.
the district court concluded that plaintiffs claim regarding the omission of the prescription data was not well grounded in fact because it was essentially an amended claim that was advanced for the first time at the dismissal hearing.in a footnote,the district court observed that just because,in the interests of justice,the court decided to entertain this essentially amended claim in ruling upon the motions to dismiss,does not mean that the court has to read plaintiffs presentation at oral argument into the complaint when judging whether plaintiffs claims were well grounded in fact.it is true that the complaint reference to the uhl report is only in the context of showing that the million in niaspan sales that occurred in september did not result from prescriptions,and that the plaintiffs did not allege that the prescription data should have been included in the prospectus until the dismissal hearing.the district court appears to have concluded that it is proper to consider such a claim in a motion to dismiss,but then fail to consider the factual allegations advanced in support thereof when resolving a motion for sanctions.the district court certainly did not have to consider the claim in resolving the motions to dismiss.however,in finding that the thus amended claim was without evidentiary support simply because it was not advanced until the dismissal hearing and without considering the factual allegations advanced in support of the claim at such hearing,the district court abused its discretion.we conclude that this claim had factual support.the claim fails because we reject oxford legal argument as to a registrant duty to disclose the prescription data under item a ii.this argument,though ultimately rejected,was not frivolous and was adequately supported by the pleaded facts concerning the data and its predictive value.
as to plaintiffs other claims,we can not say that the district court findings as to their lack of evidentiary support represented an abuse of discretion.therefore,the district court finding that plaintiffs and their counsel violated rule b in advancing these other claims is affirmed.
as to the award itself,plaintiffs complain that the total number of hours billed by the not reasonable considering the claims were dismissed before any discovery took place some of the defendants billing recor
