it is a curiosity of class action litigation that often there is greater ferocity in combat among the class lawyers over the allocation of attorneys fees than there is between the class lawyers and the defendants.the contest among the lawyers is a game.but the contest between them and the defendants is a game because the class lawyers are naturally very interested in the fee component of any settlement,while the defendants care only about the size of the settlement,including fees.so the lawyers may be willing to settle for less for the class if the defendants will help them obtain a generous fee award,and the defendants will be happy to help them if the sum of the fee award and the relief granted to the class is smaller than it would be if the class lawyers pressed for more generous relief for the class,thorogood sears,roebuck,cir vollmer selden,cir reynolds beneficial national bank,cir in re general motors.truck fuel tank products liability litigation,cir weinberger great northern nekoosa,cir.
indeed,class lawyers may try to fend off interlopers who oppose a proposed settlement as insufficiently generous to the class and given the role of such interlopers in preventing cozy deals that favor class lawyers and defendants at the expense of class members,their requests for fees must not be slighted.mirfasihi fleet mortgage,cir vollmer selden,supra,at crawford equifax payment services,cir in re general motors.truck fuel tank products liability litigation,supra,at.
one such objecting lawyer in the present case,the appellant,dawn wheelahan,was awarded million in attorneys fees by the district court for her contribution to the generous settlement of the trans union corporation privacy litigation.she contends that she entitled to three times as much as she was awarded,both because the total attorneys fees awarded to class counsel were too little and because her share of them was too small.she is not opposed by the class action defendant,trans union,because this is a common fund suit attorneys fees come out of the amount of damages awarded the class,and so trans union has no stake in the dispute over fees.wheelahan only opponents are some of the other class lawyers,who fear that an increase in the amount of fees awarded to her would come at their expense.they do object to an increase in the total fees awarded,or indeed to an increase in the share awarded to her that would not reduce their fees.with the class members unrepresented and the defendant indifferent to the overall award of attorneys fees,we must decide the appeal with limited assistance from an adversary presentation.but this is a standard dilemma in class action adjudication,as we noted at the outset,and may be unavoidable without elongating the litigation disproportionately to the stakes in the fee dispute.
the other lawyers for the class with one exception were prepared to settle the case for million,consisting of million in cash plus relief in kind valued at million.wheelahan opposed the settlement,and as a result solely of her opposition she argues the case was eventually settled for a little under million we ignore the little under,of which million was in cash and the other million was the estimated value of the relief in kind included in the settlement.at the oral argument wheelahan told us that she should receive at least percent of the added value of million as her fee.that would be million,rather than the million that she was awarded.her brief,however,asks for only million.as that amount is,as we see,excessive the million is pie in the sky and can be ignored.
the dispute over fees grows out of a litigation that began in with the filing of a number of class actions charging trans union,a large agency,with violating the fair credit reporting act,et,by selling information in its consumer credit files to advertisers without the consumers authorization.the actions were consolidated for pretrial proceedings in the northern district of illinois.in lawyers referred to by the parties to the appeal as mdl counsel,who had filed the earliest cases,agreed with trans union to a million settlement.wheelahan,who had filed her own class action in,opposed the proposed settlement,and her opposition,together with that of class counsel in a case filed against trans union in texas,persuaded the district judge to rescind his preliminary approval.
he approved the final settlement of million in.the settlement placed a ceiling of million on attorneys fees for the class lawyers remember that the fees come out of the common fund created by the settlement.the lawyers urged the district court to award this percent of the estimated value of the settlement.the district judge,however,thought million excessive and reduced it to million,but later reconsidered and referred the issue of fees to a special master,who recommended an award of million,of which about million would go to the mdl counsel and most of the rest to wheelahan and to the texas counsel.the district judge accepted the recommendation.
the special master arrived at these figures by first determining the total amount of attorneys fees that would be reasonable to award and then allocating that amount among the lawyers.he placed little weight on the contingent fee agreements between the lawyers and the clients the named plaintiffs in the class actions,recognizing that named plaintiffs are usually cat paws of the class lawyers.in re cavanaugh,cir goldberger integrated resources,cir john coffee,the regulation of entrepreneurial litigation balancing fairness and efficiency in the large class action,chi.that especially true when,as in this case,the prospective relief for an individual class member is minuscule the class has million members though most have not filed claims and the deadline for filing is past.the special master recognized that his task was to estimate the contingent fee that the class would have negotiated with the class counsel at the outset had negotiations with clients having a real stake been feasible.in re synthroid marketing litigation,cir see also missouri jenkins,but see goldberger integrated resources,supra,at.
such estimation is inherently conjectural,and what the special master mainly did was examine data on awards of attorneys fees in other class actions.he relied heavily on an academic study which had found that between and the average awards of attorneys fees in common fund consumer class actions had been either or percent of the amount of the settlement,depending on which of two datasets of such awards were consulted.theodore eisenberg geoffrey miller,attorney fees in class action settlements an empirical study,empirical legal stud,tab.the average award declined in percentage terms as the size of the settlement increased,in recognition of the component of a lawyer activity in a is an irreducible minimum of lawyer activity that must be undertaken if the client is to have a reasonable chance of prevailing,no matter how small the stakes in the case.in the case of settlements of between million and million the range within which the settlement in this case fell,the study found that the average attorneys fee awards were or percent of the settlement,again depending on the dataset.id.at tab.the award that the parties to the settlement in the present case recommended just below that range percent of million,as we said.
the special master then looked at a group of securities cases and from the fee awards made in them estimated that if the settlement in such a case had as in this case been million the fee award would have been between percent and percent.he thought this range relevant because plaintiffs discovery costs tend to be higher in securities class actions than in consumer class actions.but he did not indicate how one might adjust the fee award in this case to reflect the presumed lower cost of discovery.
he then considered the noncash portion of the settlement a choice,valued as we said at million,between two free credit monitoring services that trans union would offer each class member who filed a complaint
