donald winter the navy,appeals the district court decision to award attorneys fees to plaintiffs pursuant to the equal access to justice act eaja.the navy claims that the amount of the award for some of the attorneys working on the case should not have been enhanced above the statutory rate,the limited extent of plaintiffs success merited a reduction in fees,and the award of appellate fees was improper because the fee application was filed in the district court,not in the court of appeals.we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion on the second and third issues.however,because we conclude that the standard used by the district court to determine the first issue constitutes an error of law,we vacate the district court order awarding fees and remand for additional fact finding and recalculation of fees in accordance with this opinion.
factual and procedural background 
a.the rimpac suit 
on june,the natural resources defense council nrdc,along with several other environmental groups collectively,plaintiffs filed suit hereinafter nrdc ii against winter,in his capacity as secretary of the navy,alleging that the navy had violated the national environmental policy act nepa,the marine mammal protection act mmpa,and the administrative procedure act apa.plaintiffs also filed an application for a temporary restraining order tro and a preliminary injunction to enjoin the navy use of active sonar during its rim of the pacific rimpac training exercise.rimpac was a major navy training exercise that took place in the waters surrounding the hawaiian islands from june to july.starting july,the training included the use of active sonar,which is known to disrupt some of the marine mammals that live in those waters.attorneys at the firm irell manella llp irell provided outside representation to the environmental groups.
on june,the navy invoked the national defense exemption contained in the mmpa,which had the effect of exempting all active sonar activity from compliance with the mmpa.the navy also stated its intent to comply with the mitigation measures set forth in the incidental harassment authorization approved by the national marine fisheries service on june.
on july,the district court granted the tro on the nepa claim,enjoining the use of active sonar for ten days pending a hearing on whether to grant a preliminary injunction,and also ordered the parties to meet and confer to determine if an agreement can be reached on mitigation measures that would avoid the need for further provisional relief in this case.the navy immediately appealed the tro to this court.
the parties settled four days later,on july,one day after the scheduled start of sonar training.as part of the settlement,the navy agreed to implement or modify several mitigation measures it had previously rejected.the tro appeal was voluntarily dismissed on motion by the parties prior to any ruling on the merits.in this case,we consider the propriety of the district court award of attorneys fees.
companion case 
at the time plaintiffs brought this suit,a companion case was concurrently being litigated in the same court,in front of the same judge.nrdc winter,no.cv fmc cal.filed,hereinafter nrdc i.at the time the tro was granted in nrdc ii,the attorneys were still litigating threshold issues such as jurisdiction and standing in nrdc i.in fact,the second amended complaint in nrdc i was not filed until april,and the case is still being litigated.
nrdc i challenges the navy use of active sonar in all of its testing and training exercises,including the biennial rimpac training exercise,alleging violations of nepa,apa,and the endangered species act.the same legal issues presented in this the navy complied with certain federal at issue in nrdc i.the factual issues are also substantially the same,except that nrdc i covers a wider range of navy training exercises.
finally,the nrdc i plaintiffs are all involved in this suit with the exception of the league for coastal protection.plaintiffs counsel for nrdc i included all of the irell attorneys,the senior nrdc attorneys,and one of the junior nrdc attorneys litigating this suit.at least two of the navy attorneys in nrdc i are also involved in this case.
background of plaintiffs attorneys 
plaintiffs attorneys consisted of two senior and two junior attorneys from nrdc,as well as one senior litigation partner and three junior associates from irell.the navy does not contest the award of enhanced fees for the efforts of the two senior nrdc attorneys,so we do not discuss their qualifications.
junior nrdc attorneys 
during the prosecution of this suit,one junior nrdc attorney served as counsel in nrdc i and in nrdc gutierrez,cir,the latter also being a challenge to the navy use of sonar.at nrdc,she worked primarily on marine mammal protection and developed expertise on the specific issue of underwater sound.she has a journal article and a report on the topic of sonar and has spoken at the united nations and other environmental law fora on the issue.she also served as part of a working group drafting guidelines for the conduct of activities in the mediterranean sea.
the second nrdc junior attorney had graduated from law school and had worked as a at nrdc for over ten years,but was not a member of the bar at the time this suit was settled.he also had developed expertise in the area of underwater sound.he is the author of two editions of a report and the of a journal article on the topic of noise and its effect on mammals,and the for the entry for sonar in the encyclopedia of tourism in marine environments.he had been appointed an alternate member and subcommittee member to the federal advisory committee on acoustic impacts on marine mammals convened by the marine mammal commission,and served on the review panel for the congressional research service report to congress entitled active military sonar and marine mammals.finally,he had spoken at numerous events on the impact of sonar on marine mammals.
irell attorneys 
the irell senior litigation partner who served as counsel in this case has a broad litigation practice.there is evidence in the record that he has experience in alternate dispute resolution and arbitration,appellate litigation,entertainment transactions,intellectual property litigation,and general litigation.his environmental law experience consisted of serving as counsel in nrdc i and one other case,nrdc dep t of the navy.in the case,nrdc challenged the navy testing of explosives near the channel islands national marine sanctuary on the basis of evidence of harm to marine life from sound as well as the navy alleged failure to comply with nepa and mmpa.
three junior associates at irell also served as counsel in nrdc i.according to the record,however,none of these three associates has any other prior experience in environmental litigation.nor is there any indication that any has authored any articles,done any research,participated in any fora,or otherwise developed a specialty in environmental matters.nothing in the record suggests that environmental litigation was a practice area for any of the three irell associates.
motion for attorneys fees under eaja 
after nrdc ii was dismissed,nrdc filed a motion pursuant to the eaja for fees and costs in the district court for the work done by nrdc and irell attorneys.the district court granted the motion,awarding fees totaling for work in the district court and on the tro appeal.in doing so,the district court first found that plaintiffs were eligible for attorneys fees under the eaja and that they were the prevailing parties.the court also found that the navy position was not substantially justified such that an award of fees would be unmerited.the navy does not contest these findings on appeal.the district court also deducted hours that it found did not directly and substantially contribute to meeting the plaintiffs litigation goals.nrdc and irell do not contest these deductions.
in determining the fee,the district court applied an enhanced hourly rate above the statutory cap of per hour,finding that counsel brought distinctive skills unavailable at the statutory rate.the district court found distinctive skills for two reasons.first,it found that environmental litigation is an identifiable practice specialty requiring distinctive knowledge.second,it found that all the attorneys involved in nrdc ii had highly specialized skills acquired from nrdc i because the cases involved similar factual and legal issues on behalf of nearly identical clients,against the same agency.the navy timely appeals the fee award.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we review the amount of attorneys fees awarded by a district court for abuse of discretion.pierce underwood,d.however,any elements of legal analysis and statutory interpretation which figure in the district court decision are reviewable de novo.cabrales county of los angeles,cir quoting hall bolger,cir.
discussion 
the eaja,allows prevailing parties to recover attorneys fees in cases brought by or against the united states unless the position of the united states in the litigation was substantially justified,or special circumstances make an award unjust.d a the navy does not contest the district court decision to award fees in this case,but rather the amount of the fee award.specifically,the navy challenges the district court decision to award enhanced fees to several attorneys,its refusal to reduce fees on account of limited success,and the court award of attorneys fees to plaintiffs for hours spent preparing the appeal of the tro.
enhanced fees 
in love reilly,cir,we consolidated into a test the relevant law governing what must be proven in order to be awarded enhanced attorneys fees the attorney must possess distinctive knowledge and skills developed through a practice specialty those distinctive skills must be needed in the litigation and those skills must not be available elsewhere at the statutory rate.id.at.
in this case,the navy concedes that the senior attorneys at nrdc were entitled to enhanced fees due to their experience in environmental litigation.the navy argues,however,that the junior nrdc attorneys and the irell attorneys were not entitled to an enhanced fee due to their limited experience in environmental litigation.the navy further asserts that any distinctive skills these attorneys provided were not needed in the litigation.finally,the navy claims that nrdc failed to show that the skills provided by the irell and junior nrdc attorneys were available elsewhere at the statutory rate.
we first conclude that the irell junior attorneys did not possess distinctive knowledge and skills developed through a practice specialty.we thus hold that the district court should not have awarded enhanced fees for their work on this case and we therefore need not explore the navy remaining claims with respect to them.because we conclude that both the irell senior partner and the nrdc junior attorneys did possess distinctive knowledge and skills,we will examine the navy latter two claims with respect to them.
practice specialty 
a.the award of enhanced fees to irell junior attorneys 
the eaja allows for the award of attorneys fees based upon the prevailing market rates for the kind and quality of the services furnished,capped at per hour,unless the court determines that an increase in the cost of living or a special factor,such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys for the proceedings involved,justifies a higher fee.d d a emphasis added.
in pierce,at,the supreme court examined the phrase limited availability of qualified attorneys for the proceedings involved in the eaja.the court explained that the statute contemplated attorneys qualified in some specialized sense,rather than just in their general legal competence,such that attorneys hav e some distinctive knowledge or specialized skill needful for the litigation in question.id.at.distinctive knowledge,in turn,may be an identifiable practice specialty such as patent law,or knowledge of foreign law or language.id.although a court may find that other special factors counsel in favor of an enhanced fee award,these special factors may not be of broad and general application.id.at.for example,the pierce court concluded that the district court in that case had abused its discretion by relying on broad factors such as the novelty and difficulty of issues,the undesirability of the case,the work and ability of counsel,and the results obtained.id.the court concluded that consideration of these factors was inappropriate because,as opposed to factors demonstrating specialized knowledge or skill,these factors merely reflected an extraordinary level of the general lawyerly knowledge and ability useful in all litigation.id.at.
though the pierce court mentioned only patent law and foreign law in its discussion of specialties,subsequent cases in our circuit have recognized that other practice specialties may qualify as distinctive knowledge or skills for which enhanced fees are appropriate.see,pirus bowen,cir.for example,in pirus,we affirmed an award of enhanced fees to attorneys who had developed a social security practice specialty.id.we reasoned that,like patent lawyers,they had expertise with a complex statutory scheme familiarity and credibility with a particular agency and understanding of the needs of a particular class of this case,the of how those needs could best be met under the existing statute and regulations.id.the attorneys had also litigated a similar case all the way to the supreme court.id.
with these principles in mind,we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in awarding enhanced fees to the junior irell attorneys.contrary to the requirements set forth in reilly and pirus,the plaintiffs never established that these attorneys had a practice specialty at all,much less distinctive skills that were needed in the litigation.
notwithstanding this deficiency,the district court analogized the junior irell attorneys to counsel in pirus,and found that the junior irell attorneys here acquired distinctive skills litigating a concurrent companion case before the same court,involving similar factual and legal issues,on behalf of nearly identical clients,and against the same agency,including some of the same opposing counsel.the district court further found that this experience provided plaintiffs with unique skills and knowledge unavailable elsewhere at the statutory rate.
we do not agree with the district court reasoning.although the supreme court has not precisely enumerated what may constitute a practice specialty or special factor,we decline to expand these terms to encompass the degree of expertise that the record indicates the junior attorneys may have gained here from participating in the companion case we expect all attorneys to be experts of their own cases and their clients litigation goals.
having held that the irell junior attorneys did not acquire sufficiently distinctive skills merely by participating in litigation surrounding the companion case,we see no other basis for awarding them enhanced fees.although environmental litigation may constitute an identifiable practice specialty,plaintiffs must first establish that their counsel had such a specialty.animal lovers volunteer ass n,carlucci,cir,abrogated on other grounds by sorenson mink,cir.here,the record indicates that the junior irell attorneys had no experience in environmental law other than what they gained in the concurrently litigated companion case.
plaintiffs also point to a variety of exigent circumstances surrounding the litigation in nrdc ii.specifically,they argue that the circumstances created by the fourth of july weekend,the successful resolution of the case in ten short days,and the government use of seventeen attorneys in the case justify enhanced fees for all counsel.this court has not yet addressed whether mere exigency surrounding litigation is sufficient to warrant enhanced attorneys fees under the eaja.the circuit,however,has concluded that even where the government creates an artificial emergency or where an appeal is expedited,this consideration is insufficient under the logic of pierce to support a statutory cap increase.role models,brownlee.
we agree with the reasoning of role models america and hold that the exigency reflected in the record of this case is an insufficient basis to find a special factor.producing work on a short deadline hardly satisfies th e standard in pierce of work requiring specialized skills or knowledge beyond what lawyers use on a regular basis.role models,at.we intend no denigration of the performance of counsel under and stressful conditions,including that of irell junior attorneys in this case,but the work that was done here is similar to the work and ability of counsel and results obtained that were rejected as insufficient in pierce.at.we also note that the irell junior attorneys were aided by nrdc who specialize in public interest environmental litigation and who had one month of preparation.that junior counsel from irell were able to work so quickly and ably speaks to their general litigation skills and competence.it is not,however,sufficient to qualify for an enhanced fee award under the eaja.
in rejecting the district court decision to award enhanced fees to the junior irell attorneys,we are mindful that facing a team of seventeen government attorneys is a daunting task.however,we have previously held that oppos ing the enormous resources of the federal government adds nothing to our analysis because this disincentive to file suit is the very reason that the eaja awards fees to a prevailing party.animal lovers,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.plaintiffs are not entitled to convert the very rationale for awarding fees in the first instance into a reason for awarding enhanced fees in their particular case.we thus agree with the navy that the junior irell attorneys were not entitled to enhanced fees and we reverse the district court decision to the contrary.
irell senior partner 
we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the senior irell attorney had the requisite degree of specialized experience required under pierce.the district court noted that the senior partner had previous experience in a case involving similar environmental law issues and possible damage to marine mammals resulting from loud noises.while a finding of specialized experience can not,as previously noted,be based merely on counsel work on the virtually contemporaneous companion case,we think the district court determination that this earlier,additional litigation constituted sufficient prior experience to justify an enhanced fee award was reasonable.
c.the nrdc junior attorneys 
we similarly decline to disturb the district court finding that the nrdc attorneys had the requisite practice specialty for an enhanced fee award.the declarations and resumes submitted by nrdc adequately establish that all the nrdc attorneys,including the two junior attorneys,had developed extensive knowledge in environmental law,and specifically in the effects of sonar on marine mammals.the two junior nrdc attorneys have journal articles and spoken at several national and international fora on the impact of noise on marine mammals,as well as served on a variety of committees addressing this distinct issue 
whether distinctive skills were needful to the litigation 
under love,plaintiffs must also show that counsel distinctive knowledge and skills were needful to the litigation in order to justify fees above the statutory cap.love,at.in considering whether plaintiffs have met this standard,we note at the outset that this case involved more than a straightforward application of the apa and the nepa.thangaraja gonzales,cir denying enhanced fees for an immigration attorney specializing in asylum law because the case at issue involved merely a straightforward application of immigration law.to adequately craft the complaint and negotiate a settlement agreement under the circumstances of this case,counsel knowledge of the navy exercises in rimpac and the effect of sonar on marine mammals was necessary.see love,at attorney knowledge of the federal insecticide,fungicide and rodenticide act as well as familiarity with areas of expert testimony necessary to obtain a preliminary injunction on a short timeframe constituted distinctive knowledge needful for litigation.in addition,the billing records indicate that the junior nrdc attorneys worked both on preparing the expert declarations and on possible mitigation measures.
on these facts,and in light of the district court intimate knowledge of the litigation and each attorney participation,we hold that the district court acted within its discretion in finding that the distinctive skills of nrdc attorneys and the irell senior partner were needful to the litigation.
availability of other counsel 
the navy further argues that even if plaintiffs counsel contributed distinctive skills needful to the litigation,they have not met their burden of showing that no other suitable counsel could be obtained at the statutory rate.the navy correctly asserts that the burden rests on plaintiffs to demonstrate their entitlement to higher fees.because the district court did not place the burden on plaintiffs,its decision must be vacated and remanded for consideration consistent with this opinion.
the district court found that there is no evidence that attorneys with the necessary skills and knowledge were available elsewhere at the statutory rate,and on the basis of this finding concluded that plaintiffs were entitled to a fee award at the enhanced rate.such a finding represents an error of law.the burden of providing evidence that appropriate counsel can not be found at the statutory rate rests on the plaintiff.united states dolorosa,cir.in other words,the plaintiff must show that the skills required are not available elsewhere at the statutory rate a mere absence of evidence to the contrary is insufficient.
to summarize,we remand this case to the district court for reconsideration consistent with this opinion to determine whether the plaintiffs have met their burden of proof under the third prong of love.if not,the district court should recalculate fees for the plaintiffs as required.on remand,the district court should also recalculate fees for the junior irell attorneys at the statutory rate,plus a cost of living increase.
limited success 
the navy also argues that though plaintiffs were the prevailing party,they achieved only limited success,which required the district court to reduce the number of hours for which fees were awarded.with regard to this issue,we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding for the plaintiffs.
in hensley eckerhart,d,the court held that the extent of a plaintiff success is a crucial factor in determining the proper amount of an award of attorney fees under.thus,
w here a lawsuit consists of related claims,a plaintiff who has won substantial relief should not have his attorney fee reduced simply because the district court did not adopt each contention raised.but where the plaintiff achieved only limited success,the district court should award only that amount of fees that is reasonable in relation to the results obtained.
id.however,the fact that a settlement agreement does not encompass all relief requested in the complaint does not preclude a finding that a plaintiff has nevertheless obtained an excellent result.sorenson,at.where a plaintiff has obtained excellent results,his attorney should recover a fully compensatory fee.id.quoting hensley,at.we apply the analysis from hensley to eaja fee awards.sorenson,at.
in their complaint,plaintiffs sought a declaration that the navy was in violation of nepa and mmpa vacatur of nmfs incidental harassment authorization and finding of no significant impact an injunction against the use of active sonar during the rimpac exercises unless the navy complied with mmpa,nepa,and apa and an order directing the navy to comply with nepa and mmpa in rimpac and future rimpac exercises.according to the navy,plaintiffs obtained in a settlement only a tro based on the nepa claim and a modest settlement agreement that had little impact on the navy activities.the navy also argues that the district court did not address the navy argument regarding its claim of limited success in its order awarding f
