a group of public entities are prosecuting a representative public nuisance action against a group of companies that manufactured lead paint.this action seeks abatement as the sole remedy,and it has not yet proceeded to trial.the companies filed a motion seeking to bar the public entities from compensating their private counsel by means of contingent fees.the superior court,relying on people ex rel.clancy superior court cal d,clancy,issued an order barring the public entities from compensating their private counsel by means of any contingent fee agreement.the public entities seek writ relief from the superior court order.they assert that clancy does not bar all contingent fee agreements in public nuisance abatement actions,and that their contingent fee agreements are valid.we conclude that clancy does not bar the public entities contingent fee agreements with their private counsel,and we issue a writ of mandate directing the superior court to vacate its order and issue a new order denying the companies motion.
background 
the public entities action against the companies originally included causes of action for fraud,strict liability,negligence,unfair business practices,and public nuisance county of santa clara atlantic richfield th,d santa clara i.in march,this court reversed the superior court judgment of dismissal and ordered the superior court to reinstate the representative public nuisance cause of action and the negligence,strict liability,and fraud causes of action.santa clara i,at,d.in january,the public entities filed a motion seeking leave to file a proposed fourth amended complaint that alleged a single representative public nuisance cause of action and sought only abatement.throughout this litigation,the public entities have been represented by both their counsel and private counsel.
in february,the companies filed a motion to bar payment of contingent fees to private attorneys.they asserted that the government can not retain a private attorney on a contingent fee basis to litigate a public nuisance claim.the companies sought an order that precludes plaintiffs from retaining outside counsel under any agreement in which payment of fees and costs is contingent on the outcome of the litigation.
the companies attached to their motion a number of fee agreements between the public entities and their private counsel,and the public entities filed opposition to which they attached their fee agreements and declarations from their and private counsel.the fee agreements and declarations disclose that the public entities and private counsel agreed that,other than that would be forwarded by santa clara toward costs,private counsel would pay all further costs and would not receive any fees unless the action was successful.if the action succeeded,private counsel could seek a court award of costs and would be entitled to recover any unrecompensed costs from the recovery and a fee of of the net recovery.
the fee agreements provide different definitions of recovery.some of the agreements define recovery as moneys other than civil penalties,while others define recovery as the amount recovered,by way of judgment,settlement,or other resolution.some of the agreements include both monetary and in their definitions of recovery.the san diego agreement defines net recovery as the payment of money,stock,in the value of the abatement remedy after the deduction of the costs paid or to be paid.the santa clara fee agreement provides that,i n the event that the litigation is resolved by settlement under terms involving the provision of goods,services or any other payment,the santa clara county counsel agrees to seek,as part of any such settlement,a mutually agreeable monetary settlement of attorneys fees and expenses.
in april,the superior court heard both the companies motion to bar payment and the public entities motion for leave to file the fourth amended complaint.the court granted the public entities motion for leave to file the fourth amended complaint and ordered that the pleading be filed within days.
although there were some preliminary issues about the ripe ness of the companies motion,the superior court resolved the motion on its merits the court rejected the public entities claim that clancy was distinguishable.the court concluded that,under clancy,outside counsel must be precluded from operating under a contingent fee agreement,regardless of the government attorneys and outside attorneys intentions to have all decisions in this litigation made by the government attorneys.the court granted the companies motion and preclud ed plaintiffs from retaining outside counsel under any agreement in which the payment of fees and costs is contingent on the outcome of the litigation the court allowed the public entities days to file with the court new fee agreements or declarations detailing the fee arrangements with outside counsel.
the public entities sought a writ of mandate in this court,and the superior court stayed the matter pending resolution of this writ proceeding.this court issued an order to show cause on the writ petition,the companies filed a return,and the public entities filed a reply 
ii.discussion 
the public entities claim that the superior court erred in categorically precluding contingent fee agreements.they maintain that clancy does not categorically bar the retention of private counsel to represent a public entity in a public nuisance abatement action under a contingent fee agreement.the public entities contend that their engagement of private counsel under contingent fee agreements in this action falls outside the scope of clancy holding.
propriety of writ review 
in this case,the companies,for whatever reason,did not style their motion as a motion to disqualify the public entities private counsel while an order disqualifying counsel is an appealable order chronometrics,sysgen,d,fn,the order issued by the superior court granting the companies motion was not appealable because it did not explicitly disqualify the public entities private counsel.instead,it precluded the public entities from employing their private counsel under any contingent fee arrangements.
it would be naive not to recognize that the motion to disqualify opposing counsel is frequently a tactical device to delay litigation.comden superior court cal d.in this case,the companies motion threatened not only to deprive the public entities of their choice of counsel but also to preclude them from pursuing any appellate remedies.writ review of this order is appropriate because appellate review is unavailable,and any error in the order would result in unjustifiably depriving the public entities of their right to counsel of choice.
we begin with clancy,since clancy was the basis for the superior court ruling.in clancy,the city of corona corona had hired james clancy,a private attorney,to bring nuisance abatement actions against businesses selling obscene publications in violation of a city ordinance.clancy,supra,cal d at.the employment contract between corona and clancy,who was an independent contractor rather than an employee,provided that clancy was to be paid per hour for his work in bringing public nuisance actions,but he would be paid only per hour for his work in any public nuisance action in which corona did not prevail or in which corona prevailed but did not recover its attorney fees.clancy,at.
clancy,acting as a special city attorney,filed a public nuisance complaint against a bookstore and its operator seeking abatement,a declaratory judgment and an injunction.clancy,supra,cal d at.the bookstore operator unsuccessfully sought to disqualify clancy as attorney for corona.ibid.the bookstore operator then sought writ relief,contending that it was improper for an attorney representing the government to have a financial stake in the outcome of an action to abate a public nuisance and asserting that a government attorney prosecuting such actions must be neutral,as must an attorney prosecuting a criminal case.clancy,at.
the california supreme court recognized that there is a class of civil actions that demands the representative of the government to be absolutely neutral.this requirement precludes the use in such cases of a contingent fee arrangement.clancy,supra,cal d at.a lawyer can not escape the heightened ethical requirements of one who performs governmental functions merely by declaring he is not a public official.the responsibility follows the job if clancy is performing tasks on behalf of and in the name of the government to which greater standards of neutrality apply,he must adhere to those standards.clancy,at.
the first question was whether a public nuisance abatement action fell within the class of civil cases in which the government representative must be absolutely neutral.the court noted that ordinary civil cases brought by the government do not fall within this class of cases,and therefore contingent fee arrangements in ordinary civil cases are permitted clancy,supra,cal d at.however,public nuisance abatement actions differ from ordinary civil actions brought by the government.t he abatement of a public nuisance involves a balancing of interests.on the one hand is the interest of the people in ridding their city of an obnoxious or dangerous condition on the other hand is the interest of the landowner in using his property as he wishes.and when an establishment such as an adult bookstore is the subject of the abatement action,something more is added to the balance not only does the landowner have a first amendment interest in selling protected material,but the public has a first amendment interest in having such material available for purchase.thus,as with an eminent domain action to which the absolute neutrality requirement applies,the abatement of a public nuisance involves a delicate weighing of values.any financial arrangement that would tempt the government attorney to tip the scale can not be tolerated.clancy,at.since public nuisance abatement actions generally involve a delicate weighing of values and balancing of interests,such actions fall within the class of civil cases in which the government representative must be absolutely neutral.
the next question was whether the need for the government representative in a public nuisance abatement action to be absolutely neutral precluded clancy from prosecuting corona public nuisance abatement action against the bookstore operator under the contingent fee arrangement.the court concluded that this contingent fee arrangement precluded clancy from being absolutely neutral.clancy has an interest in the result of the case his hourly rate will double if the city is successful in the litigation.obviously this arrangement gives him an interest extraneous to his official function in the actions he prosecutes on behalf of the city.clancy,supra,cal d at.w e hold that the contingent fee arrangement between the city and clancy is antithetical to the standard of neutrality that an attorney representing the government must meet when prosecuting a public nuisance abatement action.in the interests of justice,therefore,we must order clancy disqualified from representing the city in the pending abatement action.clancy,at.the court expressly noted that corona was not precluded from rehiring clancy to represent it on other terms.clancy,at,fn.
application of clancy 
as in clancy,the public entities in this case have engaged the services of private counsel pursuant to contingent fee agreements under which private counsel will participate in representing the interests of the public entities in a public nuisance abatement action.the public entities argue that clancy absolute neutrality requirement does not apply here because private counsel have not been engaged as the sole representatives of the public entities,as james clancy was in clancy,but only to assist the government attorneys who are prosecuting this action on behalf of the public entities.unlike james clancy,private counsel do not have authority and the power to control the litigation,both of which have been retained by the public entities counsel.the public entities claim that the limited and subordinate role of private counsel does not justify applying the absolute neutrality requirement to them.
it is undisputed that private counsel have been engaged to play a limited,subordinate role in this litigation.all of the public entities are represented by counsel in addition to their private counsel.the fee agreements between five of the public entities and their private counsel explicitly provide that the public entities counsel retain final authority over all aspects of the litigation.their private counsel submitted declarations confirming that the public entities counsel retain complete control of the litigation the two remaining fee agreements,those of oakland and solano,purport to grant private counsel absolute discretion in the decision of who to sue and who not to sue,if anyone,and what theories to plead and what evidence to present.however,oakland has disclaimed this fee agreement and asserts that it has retained complete control of this litigation and is revising its fee agreement to so reflect solano private counsel asserts that solano counsel has maintained and continue s to maintain complete control over all aspects of the litigation and all decision making authority and responsibility.the record before us does not contain any fee agreements between the remaining three public entity petitioners and any private counsel 
the public entities have therefore established that their private counsel serve in a subordinate role in which private counsel merely assist counsel and lack any authority to control the litigation.the only remaining question is whether the limited role of private counsel renders inapplicable clancy absolute neutrality requirement.while clancy contains language suggesting that it is establishing a broad rule banning contingent fee agreements with private counsel in public nuisance abatement actions,we are bound by only the holding in clancy,not all of its language.
we acknowledge,as we must,that we are bound to follow binding precedent of a higher court,and that the refusal to do so is in excess of our own jurisdiction.auto equity sales,superior court cal d.however,we are not bound by dicta in every case,it is necessary to read the language of an opinion in the light of its facts and the issues raised,in order to determine which statements of law were necessary to the decision,and therefore binding precedent,and which were general observations unnecessary to the decision.the latter are dicta,with no force as precedent.fireman fund ins.maryland casualty th,d.
it is a foundational principle that t he language of an opinion must be construed with reference to the facts presented by the case,and the positive authority of a decision is coextensive only with such facts.citations.a litigant can not find shelter under a rule announced in a decision that is inapplicable to a different factual situation in his own case,nor may a decision of a court be rested on quotations from previous opinions that are not pertinent by reason of dissimilarity of facts in the cited cases and in those in the case under consideration.harris capital growth investors xiv cal d.
the california supreme court holding in clancy must be construed with reference to the facts presented in clancy,and the binding authority of clancy is limited to the facts upon which the california supreme court rested its holding.james clancy was serving as corona sole representative in its public nuisance abatement action and had complete control over the litigation.clancy holding was based on the rationale that,where private counsel are performing tasks on behalf of and in the name of the government in a public nuisance abatement action in which there must be a balancing of interests,private counsel must be absolutely neutral and can not be compensated by a contingent fee arrangement,because private counsel financial interest might tip the scale on which these interests are balanced.clancy,supra,cal d at.
in contrast,where private counsel are merely assisting government attorneys in the litigation of a public nuisance abatement action and are explicitly serving in a subordinate role,in which private counsel lack any authority or control,private counsel are not themselves acting in the name of the government and have no role in the balancing of interests that triggers the absolute neutrality requirement.private counsel serving in such a subordinate role do not supplant the public entities attorneys,who must be absolutely neutral,and are not in a position where their interest in maximizing their contingent fee can influence the balancing of interests or any of the other decisions that are made exclusively by the public entities attorneys.because clancy holding is limited to the facts that were before the california supreme court in clancy,a private attorney serving as the sole representative of the government in a public nuisance abatement action and completely controlling the litigation,clancy does not justify the superior court order barring the public entities from compensating,by means of a contingent fee agreement,their private counsel,who are merely assisting counsel and lack any control over the litigation 
d.other cases 
since clancy does not support the superior court order,we must consider whether any other authority does.
none of the other cases cited by the companies provides any support for the superior court order.in tumey state of ohio.tumey,tumey was arrested for unlawful possession of alcohol and tried by the mayor of the village,who had the power to ascertain guilt and set the amount of the fine.the mayor would be paid out of the fine if tumey was convicted,but would receive no funds if tumey was not convicted.tumey,at.the united states supreme court concluded that it was a violation of due process for the mayor to adjudge tumey culpability because the mayor had a pecuniary interest in the outcome.that officers acting in a judicial or quasi judicial capacity are disqualified by their interest in the controversy to be decided is of course the general rule.tumey,at.i t certainly violates the fourteenth amendment and deprives a defendant in a criminal case of due process of law to subject his liberty or property to the judgment of a court,the judge of which has a direct,personal,substantial pecuniary interest in reaching a conclusion against him in his case.tumey,at.it is certainly not fair to each defendant brought before the mayor for the careful and judicial consideration of his guilt or innocence that the prospect of such a prospective loss by the mayor should weigh against his a c quittal.tumey,at.because tumey was solely concerned with the financial interest of the adjudicator,it is not relevant to the financial interest of private counsel assisting in the prosecution of a proceeding.private counsel here are not playing an adjudicative role in the proceedings.
ward village of monroeville,ohio,d ward,like tumey,found a due process violation where a mayor served as the adjudicator.the only difference between ward and tumey was that the mayor in ward did not personally benefit from conviction,but had an interest in conviction because the fines funded the village budget.in marshall jerrico,d marshall,the united states supreme court concluded that that the strict requirements of tumey and ward are not applicable to the determinations of the assistant regional administrator,whose functions resemble those of a prosecutor more closely than those of a judge.marshall,at.thus,the strict requirements of tumey and ward apply only to adjudicators,not to those who are functioning like prosecutors.
the public entities note that clancy distinguished sedelbauer state sedelbauer.in a footnote responding to james clancy reliance on sedelbauer,the california supreme court briefly noted that sedelbauer approved the assistance of a private attorney only because he appeared not in place of the state duly authorized counsel.clancy,supra,cal d at,fn.in sedelbauer,the indiana appellate court found no error in the fact that a private attorney with a private interest in the suppression of pornography had served as cocounsel in a criminal obscenity prosecution and appeared with a deputy prosecuting attorney,and not in place of the state duly authorized counsel.sedelbauer,at.we agree with the public entities that clancy treatment of sedelbauer suggests that there is a critical distinction between a private attorney who supplants the public entity duly authorized counsel and a private attorney who serves only in a subordinate role as to the public entity counsel.
two other cases relied on by the public entities also provide some support for their claim that absolute neutrality is not required of private counsel who are merely assisting counsel and have no control over the litigation.
in philip morris glendening,glendening,the state of maryland entered into a contingent fee agreement with private counsel to pursue a tort action against tobacco companies.private counsel would be paid only out of a money judgment,and there was no indication that the action would include a public nuisance abatement cause of action.glendening,at.the tobacco companies sought to invalidate the contingent fee agreement.the maryland court of appeals distinguished clancy in its ruling validating the agreement.n o constitutional or criminal violations are directly implicated here,and,hence,there is no potential conflict of interest.also,and more important,notably absent from clancy is a legislative enactment authorizing the special employment of outside counsel in extraordinary cases.equally important,is the absence of the oversight of an elected state official,who shall have the authority to control all aspects of outside counsel handling of the litigation,and whose authority shall be final,sole and unreviewable.citation.these,we believe,are significant material distinctions which permit a finding that the instant contingency fee contract is not violative of due process or public policy.glendening,at.although glendening was not a public nuisance abatement action,the fact that it distinguished clancy in part on the ground that control would be exercised by the state rather than by private counsel supports our conclusion that absolute neutrality is not required of private counsel here.
in city and county of san francisco philip morris.ccsf,tobacco company defendants,relying on clancy,sought to disqualify the private attorneys hired by the public entity plaintiffs to assist in the prosecution of a lawsuit.the lawsuit alleged a variety of causes of action,but it did not include any public nuisance abatement cause of action.ccsf,at.the federal district court distinguished clancy and refused to disqualify the private attorneys.ccsf,at.the private attorneys are acting here as,with plaintiffs respective government attorneys retaining full control over the course of the litigation.because plaintiffs public counsel are actually directing this litigation,the court finds that the concerns expressed in clancy regarding overzealousness on the part of private counsel have been adequately addressed the court also finds that the civil tort nature of this action meaningfully distinguishes it from clancy.this lawsuit,which is basically a fraud action,does not raise concerns analogous to those in the public nuisance or eminent domain contexts discussed in clancy.plaintiffs role in this suit is that of a tort victim,rather than a sovereign seeking to vindicate the rights of its residents or exercising governmental powers.finally,the case as it stands now will not require the private attorneys to argue about the policy choices or value judgments suggested by defendants regarding the regulation of tobacco.rather,plaintiffs attorneys simply will be arguing,as they likely have in many other cases for private sector clients,that a tort has been committed against their clients.ccsf,at.
while the litigation in ccsf was not a public nuisance abatement action,and the court distinguished clancy on that ground,the court also distinguished clancy on the ground that the private attorneys would not be controlling the litigation,which would be controlled by the public entities counsel.thus,ccsf too provides some support for our conclusion that absolute neutrality is not required where private counsel serve in a subordinate role and lack any control over the litigation.
conclusion 
clancy itself does not bar the public entities from engaging private counsel under a contingent fee arrangement to assist in this litigation,so long as the public entities counsel retain control over all.the record before us contains absolutely no evidence that private counsel have ever engaged in any conduct that invaded the sphere of control exercised by the public entities counsel no authority supports barring private counsel from assisting the public entities under a contingent fee arrangement in this litigation.therefore,the superior court order is unjustified,and we will direct the court to set it aside.
iii.disposition 
let a writ of mandate issue commanding the superior court to set aside its order granting the companies motion and to enter a new order denying the motion.the public entities shall recover their costs.
i concur in the result reached in the majority opinion that the california supreme court decision in people ex rel.clancy superior court cal d,clancy does not bar the public entity plaintiffs in this case from retaining private counsel under their current contingency fee agreements to assist the government attorneys in the litigation of this public nuisance abatement action.i write separately to express my view that the determination of whether a contingency fee agreement between a public entity and private counsel is barred in a public nuisance abatement action is a factual determination that must be made on a basis.
our supreme court has instructed that prosecutorial neutrality is required in a public entity prosecution of a public nuisance abatement action.clancy,supra,cal d at.to ensure that a contingency fee agreement is not antithetical to the standard of neutrality that an attorney representing the government must meet when prosecuting a public nuisance abatement action id.at,i believe the court must review the factual circumstances of each case to determine whether,as a result of the contingency fee agreement,the prosecutor discretionary decisionmaking has been placed within the influence or control of an interested party hambarian superior court cal th,d,hambarian or is subject to conflicting personal interests people superior court greer cal d.
as i will explain,my conclusion that a factual determination is required derives from a careful review of the decision in clancy and other decisions of the california supreme court,as well as decisions of the federal and state courts.i have also carefully considered the important public policy issues addressed in clancy and in the helpful briefs of the parties and the amicus curiae 
i also write separately to recognize the court inherent power to review contingency fee agreements roa lodi medical group,cal d,which will allow the trial court to oversee the propriety of the contingency fee agreements in this case throughout the course of the litigation.
a.the clancy decision 
the contingency fee agreement at issue in clancy was between a private attorney,james clancy,and the city of corona city.included in clancy employment contract with the city was a fee agreement providing that clancy is to be paid per hour,provided,however,that with respect to each and every suit undertaken by attorney hereunder which results in a final judgment against city,said fee shall be reduced to per hour and provided further that said fee of shall also be reduced to per hour in each and every suit undertaken by attorney hereunder in which city is a successful party if and to the extent that the city does not recover its attorney fees from the unsuccessful party or parties.clancy,supra,cal d at.
after the city adopted a resolution declaring a business selling sexually explicit materials,known as the book store,to be a public nuisance,clancy,on behalf of the city as its special attorney,filed a complaint against the book store and its owners for abatement of a public nuisance,declaratory judgment,and an injunction.clancy,supra,cal d at.city later amended its complaint to substitute city attorney of corona as clancy title in the action.id.at.the trial court denied the defendants motion to disqualify clancy as attorney for the city,and the defendants subsequently sought a writ of prohibition from the california supreme court to bar the people from proceeding with clancy instead of the regular city attorney of corona as its representative ibid.the defendants contended that it was improper for clancy to have a financial stake in the outcome because an attorney prosecuting a public nuisance action must be neutral.
to determine whether clancy should be disqualified,the california supreme court evaluated the propriety of a contingent fee agreement between a city government and a private attorney whom it hired to bring abatement actions under the city nuisance ordinance.clancy,supra,cal d at.the court began its evaluation by examining the requirement of neutrality for public prosecutors in criminal prosecutions and government attorneys in eminent domain actions.clancy,supra,cal d at.regarding criminal prosecutions,the clancy court noted that c ontingent fee contracts for criminal prosecutors have been recognized to be unethical and potentially unconstitutional id.at.the court then determined that t he justification for the prohibition against contingent fees in criminal actions extends to certain civil cases.ibid.the certain civil cases included eminent domain actions,because the government attorney in an eminent domain action occupies a position analogous to a public prosecutor and is therefore possessed of important governmental powers that are pledged to the accomplishment of one objective only,that of impartial justice.citation.id.at.
the requirement of a neutral prosecuting attorney also extended to public nuisance abatement actions,the clancy court reasoned,because a public nuisance abatement action is similar to an eminent domain action.both types of actions involve a balancing of the interests of the public and the landowner.clancy,supra,cal d at.thus,as with an eminent domain action,the abatement of a public nuisance involves a delicate weighing of values.any financial arrangement that would tempt the government attorney to tip the scale can not be tolerated.id.at.
moreover,the clancy court observed,p ublic nuisance abatement actions share the public interest aspect of eminent domain and criminal cases,and often coincide with criminal prosecutions.clancy,supra,cal d at.a suit to abate a public nuisance can trigger a criminal prosecution of the owner of the property.this connection between the civil and criminal aspects of public nuisance law further supports the need for a neutral prosecuting attorney,fn.omitted.
having determined that a neutral prosecuting attorney was required in a public nuisance abatement action,the clancy court examined clancy contingency fee agreement to evaluate whether prosecutorial neutrality would be maintained in the city public nuisance action against the book store.the court found that clancy had an interest in the result of the case his hourly rate will double if the city is successful in the litigation.obviously this arrangement gives him an interest extraneous to his official function in the actions he prosecutes on behalf of the city.clancy,supra,cal d at.consequently,the court held that clancy should be disqualified because his contingency fee agreement was antithetical to the standard of neutrality that an attorney representing the government must meet when prosecuting a public nuisance abatement action.id.at.
the clancy court issued a writ of mandate that,among other things,directed the trial court to issue an order dismissing clancy as the city attorney in the pending public nuisance abatement action.clancy,supra,cal d at.however,in a footnote the court stated that on remand the action herein should be brought in the name of dallas holmes,the corona city attorney.the city may hire clancy to represent holmes.id.at,fn.
b.the test for prosecutorial neutrality 
as i have discussed,the clancy court indicated,in holding that clancy contingency fee agreement with the city of corona violated the standard for prosecutorial neutrality,that the standard of neutrality that applies to a government attorney in a public nuisance abatement action is the same standard that applies to a public prosecutor in a criminal action.clancy,supra,cal d at.therefore,for the purpose of evaluating the propriety of a contingency fee agreement in a public nuisance abatement action,decisions concerning the disqualification of a district attorney office for a violation of the standard of neutrality are instructive.
the clancy court analysis relied in part on an earlier california supreme court decision,greer,supra,cal d,for the proposition that a government attorney,like a public prosecutor,must be absolutely neutral.clancy,supra,cal d at.in greer,the defendants sought the disqualification of the district attorney on the ground that a conflict of interest existed because the victim mother was employed in the district attorney office.greer,supra,cal d at.our supreme court affirmed the trial court order disqualifying the district attorney because the prosecutor might have an emotional stake in the case that could disturb his exercise of impartial judgment in pretrial and trial proceedings.id.at.
the greer court analysis of the disqualification issue was based upon the defendant fundamental due process right not to be deprived of liberty without a fair trial and the prosecutor obligation to respect this mandate.greer,supra,cal d at.the prosecutor is a public official vested with considerable discretionary power to decide what crimes are to be charged and how they are to be prosecuted.citations.in all his or her activities,his or her duties are conditioned by the fact that he or she is the representative not of any ordinary party to a controversy,but of a sovereignty whose obligation is to govern impartially and whose interest,therefore,in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case,but that justice shall be done.citations.people fierro cal th,d.
in greer,our supreme court also recognized that the requirement of prosecutorial impartiality arose from the prosecutor discretionary powers.i t is precisely because the prosecutor enjoys such broad discretion that the public he or she serves and those he or she accuses may justifiably demand that he or she perform his or her functions with the highest degree of integrity and impartiality,and with the appearance thereof.greer,supra,cal d at.thus,the advantage of public prosecution is lost if those exercising the discretionary duties of the district attorney are subject to conflicting personal interests which might tend to compromise their impartiality.in short,the prosecuting attorney is the representative of the public in whom is lodged a discretion which is not to be controlled by the courts,or by an interested individual citation.id.at.
in hambarian,supra,cal th,d,our supreme court also addressed the issue of prosecutorial neutrality.the court considered the merits of the defendant motion to disqualify the district attorney office on the ground that the district attorney had accepted the services of a forensic accountant who was compensated by the victim,the city of orange.id.at,d.under penal code section,a motion to disqualify a prosecutor on the ground of conflict of interest may not be granted unless the evidence shows that a conflict of interest exists that would render it unlikely that the defendant would receive a fair trial,subd.a.the court recognized,as it did in greer,that a public prosecutor is required to act in an impartial manner because he or she has broad discretion over the entire course of the criminal proceedings hambarian,supra,cal th at,d.accordingly,the hambarian court determined that the proper test for a disqualifying conflict of interest under penal code section is whether the prosecutor discretionary decisionmaking has been placed within the influence or control of an interested party.id.at,d,fn.omitted.
our supreme court in hambarian further instructed that a motion for disqualification of a district attorney office should be reviewed on a basis,because no one factor will compel disqualification in all cases the entire complex of facts must be reviewed to determine whether the conflict makes fair and impartial treatment of the defendant unlikely.citation.hambarian,supra,cal th at,d,people eubanks cal th,d.therefore,because the evidence showed that the forensic consultant had no control over critical prosecutorial decisions,the hambarian court determined that the motion to disqualify the district attorney office was properly denied.id.at,d.citing clancy,the court explained that recusal of the district attorney is not necessary to ensure the defendant right to fair treatment during all portions of the criminal proceedings.citation.hambarian,supra,cal th at,d.
review of these california supreme court cases clarifies that a public prosecutor may be disqualified if a review of the factual circumstances surrounding the claimed conflict of interest indicates that the prosecutor discretionary decisionmaking has been placed within the influence or control of an interested party hambarian,supra,cal th at,d,or is subject to conflicting personal interests greer,supra,cal d at.thus,the test for a disqualifying conflict of interest may be stated as follows where the factual circumstances in a case indicate that the public prosecutor discretionary decisionmaking is not likely to be impartial,the standard of neutrality has been violated and the prosecutor may be disqualified.
the test for a disqualifying conflict of interest established by the california supreme court in hambarian and greer is equally applicable in civil actions,because a government lawyer in a civil action occupies a position analogous to a public prosecutor and is possessed of important governmental powers that are pledged to the accomplishment of one objective only,that of impartial justice.citation.city of los angeles decker cal d.thus,a government lawyer in a civil action has the responsibility to seek justice and to develop a full and fair record,and he or she should not use his or her position or the economic power of the government to harass parties or to bring about unjust settlements or results.citation.ibid.
the california supreme court in clancy applied the test for a disqualifying conflict of interest in a civil action when the court found that a contingency fee agreement doubling the fees of a private attorney who succeeded in prosecuting a public nuisance abatement action created a conflict of interest,due to the private attorney personal financial interest in the litigation.clancy,supra,cal d at.the private attorney was apparently able,under his contingency fee agreement,to exercise the discretionary decisionmaking authority of a government attorney in litigating the public nuisance action,with the sole exception that the city council would decide whether to bring an action under the public nuisance ordinance.id.at,fn.therefore,the factual circumstances in clancy demonstrated that as a result of the contingency fee agreement,the private attorney was not likely to be impartial in his discretionary decisionmaking.the clancy court therefore determined that the contingency fee agreement in that case was antithetical to the standard of neutrality that an attorney representing the government must meet when prosecuting a public nuisance abatement action.id.at.
federal and state court decisions 
federal and state courts have also grappled with the issue of the propriety of a contingency fee agreement between a public entity and private counsel.several decisions support a general rule that a contingency fee agreement is permitted,even though private counsel retains a financial stake in the outcome,where the agreement provides that government attorneys will maintain control over the discretionary decisionmaking throughout the litigation.
in ohio,the federal court recently considered the company challenge to the contingency fee agreements between three ohio cities and private counsel in lead paint litigation.city of columbus ohio,july,no,wl,dist.lexis.the court original ruling on motion for injunctive relief directed the cities to amend their contingency fee agreements because the court found that the contingency fee agreements between private counsel and the three cities were unconstitutional insofar as the agreements reposed an impermissible degree of public authority upon retained counsel,who have a financial incentive not necessarily consistent with the interests of the public body,wl at,dist.lexis at pp.
in a subsequent ruling,the federal court in approved the two contingency fee agreements that had been amended to expressly vest in the city attorney control over the litigation and the sole authority to authorize any settlement of any claim or complaint,supra,wl,dist.lexis.however,the court found that the third contingency fee agreement was not adequately amended because the agreement provided that neither private counsel nor the city could settle or dismiss the case without the consent of the other,wl at,dist.lexis at.the court stated that it had made it abundantly clear in its previous ruling that a contingency fee agreement between a municipality and private counsel in a public nuisance action which purports to vest in private counsel authority to prevent a settlement or dismissal of a suit is unconstitutional.ibid.
in a public nuisance abatement action in california,the federal court considered the defendants motion to disqualify private counsel on the ground that their contingency fee agreement violated the government attorney duty of neutrality.city of grass valley newmont mining,wl,dist.lexis.relying on clancy,the defendants argued that a public entity could not hire private counsel on a contingency fee basis to litigate a public nuisance abatement action.the federal court rejected this argument and denied the disqualification motion,finding that defendants had not countered plaintiff showing that the city attorney for the city of grass valley is acting as in this action and the city retains ultimate authority in the case.citation.grass newmont mining,supra,wl,dist.lexis.
in tort litigation involving a state claim against the tobacco industry for recovery of the health care costs of citizens with illnesses,the defendants also relied on clancy to challenge the legality of a contingency fee agreement between a public entity and its private counsel.in philip morris glendening,glendening,the maryland court of appeals rejected the defendants challenge to the contingency fee agreement between the attorney general of maryland and the private law firm that represented the state of maryland in tort litigation against the tobacco industry.the contingency fee agreement expressly provided that the attorney general shall have the authority to control all aspects of outside counsel handling of the litigation and such authority shall be final,sole and unreviewable.citation.id.at.
after determining that state law authorized the attorney general to enter into contingency fee agreements,the glendening court addressed the defendants claim that the contingency fee agreement violated due process and public policy under the principle,as illustrated in clancy,that a public officer should not participate in a matter in which he or she has a personal or pecuniary interest.glendening,supra,at.the maryland court determined that clancy was distinguishable because the case before it did not directly implicate any constitutional or criminal violations.equally important,the court also found,was the absence in clancy of the oversight of an elected state official,who shall have the authority to control all aspects of outside counsel handling of the litigation,and whose authority shall be final,sole and unreviewable.id.at.the court therefore held that the maryland attorney general oversight prevented outside counsel financial interest in the outcome of the tobacco litigation from violating prosecutorial neutrality.id.at.
the federal court similarly determined in city and county of san francisco philip morris.philip morris that a contingency fee agreement between several public entities and the private law firm of lieff,cabraser,heinmann bernstein in tort litigation was not barred under clancy.the court stated,while the contingent fee arrangement here clearly gives lieff,cabraser a stake in the litigation,the court finds that this case is sufficiently distinguishable from clancy to allow for the government retention of private counsel.first,as plaintiffs explain,lieff,cabraser is acting here as,with plaintiffs respective government attorneys retaining full control over the course of the litigation.because plaintiffs public counsel are actually directing this litigation,the court finds that the concerns expressed in clancy regarding overzealousness on the part of private counsel have been adequately addressed by the arrangement between lieff,cabraser and the plaintiffs.id.at.the court in philip morris also found that the case before it was a civil tort action,which further distinguished it from clancy.ibid.
thus,these federal and state courts have ruled that the propriety of a contingency fee agreement between a public entity and private counsel must be evaluated on a basis,by examining the terms of the agreement to determine whether prosecutorial neutrality has been preserved by the government attorneys retaining control over discretionary decisionmaking,such as settlement and dismissal,and by considering the factual circumstances of each case.
petitioners contingency fee agreements 
based on my review of california supreme court authority and the decisions of federal and state courts,i believe that the court must evaluate the propriety of a contingency fee agreement between a public entity and private counsel in a public nuisance abatement action on a basis.the factual circumstances of each case and the terms of each contingency fee agreement should be reviewed to determine whether the prosecutor discretionary decisionmaking has been placed within the influence or control of an interested party hambarian,supra,cal th at,d,or is subject to conflicting personal interests greer,supra,cal d at.if so,the contingency fee agreements must be barred because the agreements are antithetical to the standard of neutrality that an attorney representing the government must meet when prosecuting a public nuisance abatement action.clancy,supra,cal at.
applying this test,i agree with the majority that,based on the record in this original proceeding,the current contingency fee agreements are not antithetical to the standard of neutrality that a government attorney must meet in a public nuisance abatement action.here,the terms of the contingency fee agreements expressly provide that the government attorneys retain complete control of the litigation,including,in some instances,all decision making authority and responsibility.it is therefore reasonable to assume at this point in the litigation that the government attorneys intend to retain control over all discretionary decisionmaking.moreover,the factual circumstances do not include a pending or anticipated criminal prosecution arising from the alleged public nuisance,and therefore the bar on contingency fee agreements in criminal prosecutions clancy,supra,cal d at,is not implicated.for these reasons,i believe that a contingency fee agreement is permissible in the present public nuisance abatement action and that it is not likely,under the current terms of the petitioners contingency fee agreements,that the requirement of prosecutorial neutrality in public nuisance abatement actions will be violated.
in reaching this conclusion,i recognize the trial court concern that as a practical matter,it would be difficult to determine a how much control the government attorneys must exercise in order for a contingent fee arrangement with outside counsel to be permissible,b what types of decisions the government attorneys must retain control over,settlement or major strategy decisions,or also decisions involving discovery and so forth,and c whether the government attorneys have been exercising such control throughout the litigation or whether they have passively or blindly accepted recommendations,decisions,or actions by outside counsel.
however,as i have stated,the california sup
