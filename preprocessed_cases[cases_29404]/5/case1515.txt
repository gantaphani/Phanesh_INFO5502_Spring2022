jergens markets and sells a product known as curél age defying therapeutic moisturizing lotion with coenzyme the curél lotion.in its advertising,jergens states that its lotion,which now contains the natural power of,helps reveal visibly healthier skin.jergens advertising for that product also claims that defends against the signs of aging to keep skin looking younger,smoother and more vital helps support our skin natural ability to restore itself,reducing visible signs of aging and helps to restore skin natural elasticity.in addition,the label on the curél lotion prominently displays the term and touts the benefits of,in marked contrast to the labels on jergens other therapeutic moisturizing lotions,which do not contain.
in august,filed suit against jergens in the united states district court for the western district of washington,alleging that jergens sale of the curél lotion infringed the patent.jergens counterclaimed for declaratory judgments of noninfringement,invalidity,and unenforceability of the patent and for damages for violation of the antitrust laws.during the course of discovery,repeatedly demanded from jergens information regarding the contents of the curél lotion.jergens refused to comply with those requests but,in response to motion to compel,filed a motion for summary judgment of noninfringement in which it revealed that the accused product contained no more than by weight.upon learning that information,elected to abandon its suit.in may,sought a voluntary dismissal with prejudice and agreed not to sue jergens in the future for infringement due to the sale of the curél lotion.the court subsequently dismissed with prejudice infringement claim and jergens noninfringement,invalidity,and unenforceability counterclaims,leaving only jergens antitrust counterclaim unresolved.
in september,the district court denied jergens motion for sanctions against under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure rule.the court first found that had made a sufficient inquiry to determine whether the accused product infringed.specifically,the court noted that,although did not conduct a chemical analysis of jergens curél lotion before filing suit,its attorneys performed a claim construction analysis and then relied on jergens advertising statements,which suggested that the curél lotion contained a therapeutically effective amount of.rule order,slip op.at.moreover,the court rejected jergens argument that was on notice of the patent invalidity prior to filing suit,finding that,although the patent validity had been challenged in the past,several companies had taken licenses under the patent.id.at.finally,the court found that jergens rule motion was untimely under rule safe harbor provision.c a,because it was filed after had voluntarily withdrawn its claim and therefore provided with no opportunity to cure the challenged conduct.rule order,slip op.at.

on appeal,jergens first challenges the district court denial of its motion for sanctions.jergens primary argument on this point is that investigation prior to filing suit was inadequate under rule.more specifically,jergens contends that claim construction,if any,was frivolous that reliance on jergens advertising alone did not amount to a reasonable effort to determine whether the accused product satisfied the claim limitations,especially given that could have easily performed a chemical analysis of the accused product and that should have known that the patent was invalid prior to filing suit.jergens next argues that its refusal to disclose the contents of the accused product during litigation was irrelevant to the adequacy of investigation and that the district court reliance on such behavior was improper.finally,jergens maintains that its motion for sanctions was timely.on this point,jergens contends that only during discovery did it learn of failure to conduct a reasonable investigation and that,even though had withdrawn its claim for infringement,still could have cured its omission by amending its answer to the antitrust counterclaim.
responds that the district court acted within its discretion in denying jergens motion for sanctions.argues that it satisfied the requirements of rule because its attorney conducted a nonfrivolous claim construction analysis prior to filing suit its claim of infringement was factually supported by jergens advertising and labeling statements regarding the accused product and its belief in the validity of the patent was supported,among other reasons,by the fact that several companies took licenses to the patent.also maintains that the district court acted within its discretion in evaluating jergens dilatory litigation tactics.lastly,argues that jergens motion for sanctions was untimely because it was filed after had moved to voluntarily dismiss its infringement claim,thereby depriving of an opportunity to cure under rule safe harbor provision.
we agree with that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying jergens motion for sanctions.rule b requires an attorney to conduct a reasonable inquiry into the law and facts before filing a pleading in a court and to certify that the claims contained therein are not frivolous,legally unreasonable,without factual foundation,or asserted for an improper purpose.rule c then permits a district court to impose sanctions on a party and its attorneys for violation of subdivision b.in the context of patent infringement actions,we have interpreted rule to require,at a minimum,that an attorney interpret the asserted patent claims and compare the accused device with those claims before filing a claim alleging infringement.see antonious,at view eng g,robotic vision,judin united states,bravo,containment techs.
jergens challenge to the reasonableness of inquiry under rule proceeds on several grounds.jergens first claims that there is no evidence that attorneys interpreted any of the claims of the patent prior to filing suit.however,the declaration of bruce kaser,one of attorneys,flatly rebuts that argument.in his declaration kaser stated that he,along with a patent attorney colleague,interpreted and analyzed the patent before filed suit against jergens.kaser further declared that,although he did not remember preparing a claim chart,he did review the patent claims,written description,and prosecution history and interpret the individual claim terms.in any event,a claim chart is not a requirement of a infringement analysis,as the owner,inventor,drafter of a patent ought to have a clear idea of what the patent covers without the formality of a claim chart.the district court finding that conducted a claim interpretation analysis prior to filing suit is therefore supported by the record.
jergens asserts that any claim interpretation performed by attorneys was frivolous.we disagree.claim interpretation is not always an exact science,and it is not unusual for parties to offer competing definitions of even the simplest claim language.in this case,however,it is not for us to determine whether interpretation of the asserted claims was correct,but only whether it was frivolous.see antonious,at.we conclude that it was not,for claim interpretation,while broad,followed the standard canons of claim construction and was reasonably supported by the intrinsic record.according to kaser declaration,interpreted the principal active ingredient limitation of claim to read on any effective therapeutic use of in a skin where that lotion might contain other ingredients that would moisturize skin and interpreted the term therapeutically effective amount to mean an amount sufficient to have therapeutic benefit.further read claim to require no specified minimum amount of because,unlike the dependent claims,claim includes no such limitation.those interpretations comport with the plain meaning of the claim language and do not appear to be inconsistent with the patent written description and prosecution history.indeed,we reject jergens contention that the patent written description defines the term therapeutically effective amount,which is found in the independent claim,as requiring to.even though the written description discloses percentage ranges of in its preferred embodiments which are recited in the dependent claims,nothing in the written description mandates jergens limited interpretation of the disputed claim language.thus,in light of the patent claims,written description,and prosecution history,as well as kaser declaration,we can not say that claim interpretation was baseless and made without a reasonable and competent inquiry.we therefore conclude that interpretation of the asserted claims prior to filing suit was not frivolous.
jergens next contention is that infringement analysis was inadequate in that it relied solely on jergens advertising statements and did not include a chemical analysis of the accused product.while it is true that could have conducted a more thorough investigation before filing suit,we conclude that its infringement analysis was supported by a sufficient evidentiary basis.acquired a sample of the curél lotion and reviewed its advertising and labeling,which listed the product ingredients and repeatedly touted the therapeutic effects of.concluded,however,that chemical analyses identifying the actual percentage of in the accused product would not likely have changed its infringement analysis.given nonfrivolous interpretation of claim as requiring no specified minimum amount of and jergens forthright assertions regarding the therapeutic effects of in the accused product,we conclude that it was reasonable for to believe that the accused product contained a therapeutically effective amount of as the principal active ingredient.
jergens argues nonetheless that our case law requires the imposition of sanctions in this case.first,jergens asserts that our decision in view engineering,robotic vision systems,makes clear that reliance on advertising as a basis for filing an infringement suit is not sufficient under rule.we disagree with that characterization of view engineering.in that case,we affirmed the district court award of rule sanctions because the patentee reliance on the accused infringer advertising statements alone did not provide an adequate factual basis to support the patentee infringement counterclaim.importantly,we held that sanctions were warranted because the patentee had not performed any claim construction analysis or an infringement analysis prior to filing its counterclaim for infringement.id.at.in fact,we emphasized that t he presence of an infringement analysis plays the key role in determining the reasonableness of the inquiry made in a patent infringement case under rule.id.at.in the present case,did not file suit based solely on jergens advertising critically,it also relied on its own comparison of the asserted claims with the accused product.
second,jergens relies on our decision in judin united states,in which we observed that the patentee could have purchased an accused device relatively inexpensively compared with the cost of litigation,to argue that should have performed inexpensive chemical tests to determine infringement.judin,however,is easily distinguishable from the present case in judin,we concluded that the district court abused its discretion in not awarding sanctions because the patentee had not attempted to obtain a sample of the accused product and had not compared the accused device with the patent claims prior to filing suit.id.at.here,in contrast,did obtain a sample of the curél lotion and compared that product with the asserted claims of the patent.again,our case law makes clear that the key factor in determining whether a patentee performed a reasonable inquiry is the presence of an infringement analysis.view eng g,at see also antonious,at judin,at bravo,at.and an infringement analysis can simply consist of a good faith,informed comparison of the claims of a patent against the accused subject matter.because obtained a sample of the accused product,reviewed jergens statements made in the advertising and labeling of the accused product,and,most importantly,compared the claims of the patent with the accused product,we conclude that its claim of infringement was supported by a sufficient factual basis.
jergens also argues that infringement suit was frivolous because should have known that the patent was invalid prior to filing suit.we conclude that it was not,for reasonably believed its patent to be valid in light of the statutory presumption of validity,as well as the licenses that several companies took under the patent.the two or four letters from accused infringers questioning the validity of the patent do not negate legal and factual bases for believing the patent to be valid.we therefore can not say that expectation of the patent validity was frivolous.
jergens finally argues that the district court improperly relied on its refusal to disclose the contents of the accused product during litigation.however,we do not read the district court decision as relying on jergens conduct during litigation in its assessment of investigation.rather,the district court simply stated that,if sanctions were appropriate,they could only be imposed for jergens costs and fees up to the point when the first set of interrogatories issued,reasoning that jergens could not withhold crucial information during discovery and then complain that delayed the litigation.rule order,slip op.at.in any event,the court denial of jergens motion for sanctions is fully supported by the court findings relating to the reasonableness of inquiry.see id.at.
in sum,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that filing of suit against jergens for infringement of the patent was sufficient to withstand scrutiny under rule accordingly,we affirm the district court denial of jergens motion for sanctions.
attorney fees 
jergens next argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying its motion for attorney fees.jergens maintains that the court erred in finding this case not to be exceptional under because,as argued above,should have known that its infringement suit was baseless and that the patent was invalid when it filed suit.jergens further asserts that this case is exceptional because changed its theory of infringement only after jergens filed a motion for summary judgment of noninfringement and because q pharma threatened jergens parent company with an action before the federal trade commission ftc in an attempt to gain leverage in the litigation.
responds that the district court acted within its discretion in denying jergens motion for attorney fees under.argues that the court did not clearly err in finding this case not to be exceptional because jergens did not show by clear and convincing evidence that was grossly negligent in its beliefs of infringement and validity.further asserts that jergens failed to show that decision to withdraw its claim of infringement was made in bad faith and that threatened to blackmail jergens by suggesting that the differences between jergens packaging claims and jergens admissions in this litigation raised false advertising issues.
we agree with that the district court did not clearly err in finding this case not to be exceptional.section provides that a court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.exceptional cases include those involving inequitable conduct before the patent and trademark office litigation misconduct vexatious,unjustified,and otherwise bad faith litigation a frivolous suit or willful infringement.forest,at citation omitted.for the reasons discussed above,we conclude that reasonably believed that the patent was valid and infringed when it filed suit and that its claim of infringement was therefore neither frivolous nor unjustified.moreover,we discern no evidence of bad faith on the part of during litigation.explains its decision to withdraw its claim of infringement as based on its determination that further pursuit of the lawsuit would not have been worth the investment required to prove infringement,and,in any event,we fail to see how a changed legal theory that leads to the voluntary dismissal of a lawsuit can amount to bad faith litigation.jergens contention that harassed parent company by threatening an action before the ftc,even if it were relevant,is not supported by the record.we therefore conclude that it was not clearly erroneous for the district court to find that this case was not exceptional.accordingly,we affirm the district court denial of jergens motion for attorney fees.
antitrust counterclaim 
finally,jergens challenges the district court summary judgment dismissal of its antitrust counterclaim.on the merits of antitrust immunity defense,jergens argues that infringement claim was objectively baseless because a reasonable litigant would not have,among other things,failed to create a claim chart,failed to perform chemical analyses,relied solely on a competitor advertising,and ignored letters suggesting the asserted patent invalidity.jergens also asserts that the court improperly precluded it from conducting discovery under rule f,arguing that it needed discovery relating to the declarations of president janice hess and attorney bruce kaser in order to oppose motion for summary judgment.
responds that the district court properly granted summary judgment dismissing jergens antitrust counterclaim.argues that its infringement lawsuit was not objectively baseless because it had probable cause to believe that the patent was valid and infringed.also maintains that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying jergens request for additional discovery under rule f because jergens sought to discover privileged documents that were relevant only to subjective intent and therefore would not have prevented summary judgment.
we agree with that the district court did not err in dismissing jergens antitrust counterclaim.a patent owner who brings a suit for infringement,without more,is generally exempt from the antitrust laws for that action however,the patent owner may be subject to antitrust liability for the anticompetitive effects of that suit if the accused infringer proves either of two conditions.in re indep.serv.orgs.antitrust,nobelpharma,at.first,the accused infringer may show that the asserted patent was obtained through knowing and willful fraud.nobelpharma,at citing walker process,food mach.chem,d.alternatively,the accused infringer may show that the infringement suit was a mere sham to cover what is actually nothing more than an attempt to interfere directly with the business relationships of a competitor.id.quoting presidents conference noerr motor freight,d.
here,jergens makes no claim that obtained the patent through fraud.we therefore consider only whether infringement suit falls within the sham exception to antitrust immunity.in professional real estate investors,the supreme court o
