background 
prosecution history of the patent 
the patent,issued to david knotter,donald levin,and jody numbers,and assigned to deering,is directed to a compact,scale capable of accurately weighing substances up to ten grams.the patent issued on may,and has five claims,claims,and being in independent form.claims,and are at issue in the present action.representative claim recites as follows 
a lightweight portable scale comprising a base,a beam having a substance holder at one end thereof and a scale extending toward the opposite end thereof,a sliding weight movably carried by said beam for movement along said scale,a pair of metallic fulcrum posts projecting upwardly from said base,and a pair of metallic bearing inserts in said beam for cooperation with said fulcrum posts,one pair of the pair of posts or the pair of inserts having pointed projections thereon receivable in tapered recesses in the other pair for positioning and pivotally supporting said beam,said sliding weight being movable from a zero position to a position near the said opposite end of the beam and said sliding weight when in its zero position having a portion thereof disposed substantially in an imaginary plane containing the fulcrum of the beam,whereby to minimize the weight of the substance holder required to balance the beam when the sliding weight is in its zero position.
patent,ll.emphasis added.
generally,the scale of the patent functions as any normal scale.as shown in figure of the patent below,the scale has a bottom portion that serves as a base for a weighing mechanism.id.at,ll.the weighing mechanism comprises a balance beam mounted for pivotal movement on a pair of fulcrum posts.id.at,ll.the fulcrum posts are adapted to cooperate with bearing inserts in the balance beam.the balance beam has a material holder,or tray,on one side of the fulcrum and adjustable sliding weights and on the opposite side of the fulcrum.id.at,ll.in operation,the weights are moved to balance the beam.
an important aspect of the invention is the minimization of the overall size and weight of the scale while maintaining the ability to weigh materials up to grams.to accomplish this,the inventors designed sliding weight to minimize the overall weight of the scale by moving the center of mass of the sliding weight closer to the plane created by the fulcrums of the scale.figure of the patent above shows the sliding weight in its zero position,the position where the beam balances without any material in the holder.
the written description provides that the sliding weight be constructed in such a manner that 
the heavy metallic insert therein is offset from the pointer of the weight in the direction of the fulcrum for the balance beam.indeed,the metallic insert is offset to an extent that when the coarse sliding weight is in its zero position,adjacent the portion of balance beam,the metallic insert is disposed substantially in the plane of the fulcrum,the imaginary vertical plane containing the center lines of the fulcrum posts and.with the center of insert aligned precisely in the plane of fulcrum the insert becomes essentially neutral so far as balance of the balance beam and the holder are concerned when the weight is in its zero position and the holder is empty.this greatly minimizes the amount of mass that must be incorporated into the holder portion of the weighing mechanism.
id.at,ll.emphases added.
the application filed with the united states patent and trademark office pto that matured as the patent initially contained ten claims,claims and being in independent form.original independent claim defined a portable scale having a base,a beam with a substance holder at one end and a scale extending in an opposite direction,a sliding weight movably carried by the beam for movement along the scale,a pair of metallic fulcrum posts projecting upwardly from the base,and a pair of metallic bearing inserts in the beam for cooperation with the fulcrum posts.
original independent claim was similar to original independent claim,with the additional limitation that when the sliding weight is in the zero position,a portion of the sliding weight was disposed substantially in an imaginary plane containing the fulcrum of the beam.the parties refer to this limitation as the zero position limitation.
original claim,dependent on claim,similarly included the zero position limitation 
the portable scale of claim further characterized in that said sliding weight is movable from a zero position to a position near the said opposite end of the beam and said sliding weight when in its zero position has a portion thereof disposed substantially in an imaginary plane containing the fulcrum of the beam,whereby to minimize the weight of the substance holder required to balance the beam when the sliding weight is in its zero position.
emphasis added.the zero position limitation was thus the only additional limitation in dependent claim.
after review of the application,the pto rejected claims,and under a as being obvious over patent in view of patent.the pto objected to claims,and,but indicated that they would be allowable if rewritten in independent form.
the applicants filed a response to the rejection deleting original claims and.they submitted new claim,which was original claim rewritten in independent form.with respect to original claim,which had not been rejected,the applicants stated 
it is believed that the examiner must have overlooked the fact that claim is an independent base claim and that claim is dependent only from claim.claim calls for a sliding weight when in its zero position having a portion thereof disposed substantially in an imaginary plane containing the fulcrum of the beam.this feature is not disclosed in the references.it is therefore believed that claims and are allowable as written.
emphasis added.
the pto subsequently issued the patent on may.claim issued as independent claim and original claim issued as claim.
alleged infringing product 
vector manufactures and sells the accused device,its own version of a scale,the.the is shown in figures and below.
the has two slidable weights and,each of which is movable along the balance beam of the scale.the metallic insert of the sliding weight is positioned directly beneath the pointer.the sliding weights of the,when in their respective zero positions have no portion extending into the imaginary plane containing the fulcrum.at its zero position,the sliding weights and of the are no closer than inches from the imaginary plane containing the fulcrum.the has an additional stationary counterweight affixed to the substance holder support member.this additional counterweight balances the scale in the zero position as opposed to the patent,which places the majority of the center of mass of the weight substantially in the plane of the fulcrum.the additional counterweight coupled with the placement of the sliding weights and outside the plane containing the fulcrum are the decisive design differences between the and the patent for the purposes of this action.
procedure before the united states district court 
in,deering discovered vector was selling a scale and sued vector for infringement.in its action,deering sought an injunction and damages for the sale of the,alleging that the infringed claims,and of the patent.vector filed its answer and counterclaim on april,and a motion for summary judgment of noninfringement on may.
in connection with the summary judgment motion,vector conceded that the met each and every limitation of the asserted claims except for the zero position limitation.the district court did not conduct a separate markman hearing,but construed that particular limitation to mean that the weight must enter and penetrate the imaginary plane containing the fulcrum of the beam.in arriving at this construction,the district court relied on the intrinsic evidence of the patent,including the claims and the written description,as well as the ordinary meaning of the term substantially.the district court specifically stated 
in common usage,substantially means significantly or considerably.in the claims at issue,the word substantially describes how the weight is disposed in the imaginary plane.the specification sheds further light on the proper construction when,in reference to the relationship between the weight and the imaginary plane,it states that the metallic insert rests essentially in the plane of the fulcrum for the balance beam.thus,the court construes the element requiring the sliding weight to be disposed substantially in an imaginary plane containing the fulcrum to mean that the weight must enter and penetrate the imaginary plane containing the fulcrum of the beam.
in light of this claim construction,the district court determined that the did not literally infringe any of the asserted claims of the patent.specifically,the district court held,a s deering does not argue that any portion of the weight in vector scale enters the plane of the fulcrum,there can not be literal infringement.
the district court also held that because the applicants amended the zero position limitation during prosecution by deleting original claim,this court decision in festo shoketsu kinzoku kogyo kabushiki,en banc festo i,vacated by,d festo ii,bars any equivalents for the zero position limitation for every asserted claim.the district court recognized that independent claim and dependent claim were not amended during prosecution,but nevertheless determined deering was barred from asserting the doctrine of equivalents for claims and because of this court decision in builders concrete,bremerton concrete products.the district court held that prosecution history estoppel applies to any limitation narrowed during prosecution in all claims in the patent regardless of whether the limitation is present in a claim that itself was never amended.
after vector obtained summary judgment,it moved for an award of attorney fees pursuant to.vector argued that deering failed to consult with a patent attorney to properly evaluate the prosecution history and that the purpose of the litigation was to harass,intimidate,or financially undermine vector.the district court determined that failure to obtain advice of intellectual property counsel with respect to infringement under the doctrine of equivalents was not per se gross negligence and also determined that deering conduct was far from harassing,intimidating,or overbearing behavior.accordingly,the district court denied vector motion.
both parties timely appealed to this court and we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.

claim construction 
in construing the claims of a patent,we review the intrinsic evidence,which consists of the specification and the prosecution history.interactive gift express,compuserve.claim construction analysis begins with the ordinary meaning of the disputed claim term.digital,telegenix,vitronics conceptronic.generally speaking,we indulge a strong presumption that a claim term carries its ordinary and customary meaning.tate access floors,interface architectural.
the next step is to review the written description and the prosecution history,to determine if the patentee has chosen to be his or her own lexicographer,or when the claim language itself lacks sufficient clarity to ascertain the scope of the claims.prima tek ii,polypap,ecolab,envirochem,gart logitech.
in the present appeal,deering contests the district court construction of the zero position limitation said sliding weight when in its zero position having a portion thereof disposed substantially in an imaginary plane containing the fulcrum of the beam.the zero position limitation is present in every claim at issue in this action.in particular,deering objects to the construction of the terms substantially in an imaginary plane.it specifically contends that the term substantially means at or near.
this court is asked,once again,to construe the meaning of the term substantially in a patent claim.see,epcon gas,bauer compressors,construing the terms substantially constant and substantially below zodiac pool care,hoffinger,construing the term substantially inward york,cent.tractor farm family,construing the term substantially the entire height thereof.instruments cypress semiconductor,construing the term substantially in the common plane.in conducting this analysis,we begin with the ordinary meaning of the claim terms to one of ordinary skill in the art.prima tek,at.reference to dictionaries and our cases indicates that the term substantially has numerous ordinary meanings.as the district court stated,substantially can mean significantly or considerably.the term substantially can also mean largely or essentially.webster new century dictionary.indeed,our cases recognize the dual ordinary meaning of this term as connoting a term of approximation or a term of magnitude.see epcon,at the phrase substantially constant denotes language of approximation,while the phrase substantially below signifies language of magnitude,not insubstantial.
since the term substantially is capable of multiple interpretations,we turn to the intrinsic evidence to determine which interpretation should be adopted.ecolab,at gart,at.
as is often the case,the written description does not explicitly identify the meaning of the term substantially.the specification does,however,provide the public with a significant explanation of the criticality of the location of the sliding weight in conjunction with the plane created by the fulcrum so as to support a finding that the term substantially is a term of magnitude as opposed to approximation.first,the stated object of the patent is to provide a lightweight,portable scale.the written description plainly states 
to hold down on the mass of the substance holder portion of the mechanism required to achieve equilibrium of the mechanism the sliding weight is constructed in such a manner that the metallic insert therein rests essentially in the plane of the fulcrum for the balance beam when the sliding weight is in its zero position.
patent,ll.emphasis added.figure,supra,shows an example of the position of the sliding weight that meets the limitation.in figure,the metal insert of the sliding weight is precisely in the plane,as the written description states 
with the center of insert aligned precisely in the plane of fulcrum the insert becomes essentially neutral so far as balance of the balance beam and the holder are concerned when the weight is in its zero position and the holder is empty.this greatly minimizes the amount of mass that must be incorporated into the holder portion of the weighing mechanism.
