introduction 
this appeal challenges the attorney fees and costs awarded class counsel following settlement of numerous class action complaints brought against various manufacturers of vitamin products.sandra norris,the single objecting class member,raises many issues with respect to the award of attorney fees,but the main thrust of her appeal challenges the lodestar figure requested by class counsel,the multiplier that was applied to that figure,and the size of the resulting award as a percentage of the settlement fund.we reverse and remand with directions to the trial court to provide a more complete explanation for the award of fees and costs.
ii.factual and procedural background 
in,the first antitrust class action lawsuit brought on behalf of direct purchasers of vitamins was filed in federal district court.in re vitamins antitrust litigation.ultimately,approximately federal cases were filed and coordinated in a litigation proceeding in the federal district court for the district of columbia mdl litigation.in re vitamins antitrust litigation wl.that coordinated action alleged a conspiracy to fix the prices of the following vitamins sold in bulk a,also known as choline chloride,c,e,h,beta carotene,astaxanthin,and canthaxanthin.in re vitamins antitrust litigation,supra,at fn.
in july,a similar action on behalf of indirect purchasers of bulk vitamin products was filed in yolo county,california.other indirect purchaser actions were filed in various states across the country.
somewhere in this time period,the united states department of justice doj,also suspecting that had occurred,filed a criminal information alleging that lonza lonza not a party to this appeal had fixed the price of vitamin in violation of section of the sherman act.on march,lonza pleaded guilty to those charges.on march,executives and officers of chinook,and du coa,also not parties to this appeal pleaded guilty to similar charges with respect to sales of vitamin.
six days later,on march,saveri saveri the saveri firm filed a class action in san francisco superior court on behalf of indirect purchasers.on march,lieff,cabraser,heimann bernstein,llp lchb filed a similar action in the same court.apparently,a third action was also filed in san francisco superior court because,on april,the trial court filed a pretrial order establishing the procedure for litigation in those three cases.pursuant to that order,lchb and the saveri firm were to serve as plaintiffs counsel.those two firms,along with the mogin law firm and bainbridge strauss,were to serve as the executive committee,and the executive committee along with eight additional law firms were to comprise the steering committee.
later,the trial court added four additional firms to the executive committee and additional firms to the steering committee.by the time the case settled,two more firms,for a total of firms,had been added to the executive committee.by that time the steering committee,which admittedly never met,was composed of law firms.thus,at the time the settlement agreement at issue here was executed,a total of law firms were involved in the litigation and listed as such in a schedule attached to that agreement.
on may,the trial court granted a petition for coordination of the three san francisco superior court actions and the single action filed in yolo county.on may,a first consolidated amended complaint was filed in san francisco superior court.the complaint described the plaintiff class as californians who indirectly purchased vitamins,vitamin premixes,other vitamin products from any of the named manufacturers,for use,but not for resale,at any time during the period january,through the late.the complaint contended that the defendants,manufacturers of raw vitamins,vitamin premixes,and other bulk vitamin products for bulk sales,committed in violation of both the cartwright act bus,et and the unfair competition act bus,et.
on may and september,five of the seven defendants who are parties to the settlement agreement at issue in this case entered guilty pleas in the doj criminal action in the federal district court for the district of columbia with respect to the sales of certain vitamins.
on july,eleven additional cases were coordinated in san francisco superior court.on august,three more cases were added to the coordinated proceeding,on august,eleven more cases,and on october,five more cases,were added.the total number of private antitrust class actions thus totaled 
on november,plaintiffs in the federal mdl litigation filed a motion for preliminary approval of a settlement that they had reached with some of the defendants in that action.see in re vitamins antitrust litigation,supra,wl.the defendants who settled in that case included the same defendants who have settled in this action.see ibid.on march,the federal district court granted final approval of the settlement agreement.see in re vitamins antitrust litigation wl.
on october,the california attorney general,acting on behalf of the people of the state of california,filed an action in san francisco superior court that contained allegations similar to those made in the other actions coordinated in that court.the attorney general complaint named only seven of the defendants named in the coordinated proceeding.on november,the attorney general lawsuit was added to the state court coordinated proceeding.
on august,the class representatives in the coordinated proceeding and the people filed a motion for preliminary approval of class action settlement with the seven defendants named in the attorney general complaint basf,daiichi pharmaceutical,eisai,aventis animal nutrition formerly animal nutrition,roche,roche vitamins,and takeda chemical industries,collectively,settling defendants.the settlement agreement identified separate state actions that it would resolve the claims released by the settlement included all claims based on the sale or pricing of vitamins a,c,e,h,astaxanthin,beta carotene,and canthaxanthin.
the proposed settlement agreement explained that two classes would be certified for purposes of settlement only a consumer class and a commercial class in settlement of the claims of the consumer class,million was to be distributed to charitable,governmental and nonprofit organizations that promote the health and nutrition of consumer class members or that otherwise further the purposes underlying the lawsuit.in settlement of the commercial class,million was to be made available for distribution to valid claimants.
on the subject of attorney fees,the proposed settlement agreement provided that a s an additional payment over and above the amounts provided for each class,the settling defendants agreed that they would not pay more than million in attorneys fees.the settling defendants also agreed not to object to plaintiffs counsels applications for attorneys fees consistent with the agreement.the settlement agreement provided that if the consumer settlement was approved but the commercial settlement disapproved,the fee award would not exceed million.if the situation was reversed and the commercial settlement approved but the consumer settlement disapproved,the fee request would not exceed million.
on september,the san francisco superior court ordered preliminary approval of the settlement.
on december,norris filed objections to the proposed settlement and the requested attorney fees.with respect to the requested fee award,norris argued generally that the requested fee seemed excessive and,more specifically,that there was nothing in the notice that would allow review of the request for million in attorney fees.she requested that the trial court order class counsel to file their time records.
on december,class counsel filed a motion for attorney fees and costs.the motion requested a total of million in attorney fees and in costs based on the hours committed and costs incurred by attorneys at firms a footnote in a memorandum of points and authorities in support of that motion explained that the executive committee intended to allocate to plaintiffs counsel any attorneys fees awarded by the court on the basis of each firm relative contribution to the prosecution of this case.doing so will allow the plaintiffs executive committee to recognize firms that worked particularly efficiently and to take into account the disparate billing practices of the plaintiffs counsel.
in justifying the requested amount,the motion explained that,despite the guilty pleas of some of the settling defendants,plaintiffs still needed to prove the amount of the overcharge and the portion of the overcharge that was passed on to california indirect purchasers.the motion argued that even if the trial court were to find that of counsel hours should not be reimbursed,the million figure could be arrived at by using a multiplier of.plaintiffs counsel argued that was a multiplier that falls squarely within multipliers approved by california courts.plaintiffs counsel also noted that million amounted to only of the total settlement consideration of million.
the declarations submitted in support of the motion reported that firms collectively spent hours on the litigation for a lodestar amount of.collective expenses were reported to be.a spreadsheet was submitted that reported the number of hours claimed by each law firm in seven categories investigations and factual research discovery,pleadings and motion practice,settlement and mediation,litigation strategy and analysis,court appearances,and miscellaneous.the percentage of hours attributable to each category was as follows,and.the spreadsheet also itemized the lodestar amount and expenses attributable to each of the firms.
william bernstein of lchb submitted a declaration in support of the motion for attorney fees.he averred that lchb began investigating this case before march,but it was not seeking fees or costs for any work performed prior to march,or for any work performed in connection with the federal mdl litigation because lchb had already recovered in attorney fees and was expecting reimbursement of in litigation expenses.
on the issue of risk,bernstein explained that in an indirect purchaser case such as these,the overcharge is not necessarily passed on to an indirect purchaser rather,some portion of the overcharge is inevitably or at least allegedly absorbed by the direct purchaser with the balance passed on.bernstein reported that it was the view of settling defendants that virtually none of the overcharge could be traced to the businesses in the california commercial class or,for that matter,to the consumers at the end of the line.moreover,in the defendants view,plaintiffs had an insurmountable hurdle in even attempting to determine the amount of indirect purchases from buyers within the state of california.the defendants also insisted that the alleged overcharge was minimal if it existed at all,because defendants pricing could be explained by currency fluctuations,general inflation,and specific rising costs to the defendants.
on the issue of success,bernstein averred that the california settlement required settling defendants to pay more on a percentage basis than they were willing to pay in the other indirect purchaser actions filed in other states.ultimately,settling defendants did reach agreement with the other states for settlement amounts which were disproportionately lower than the amount that the defendants agreed to pay in california.
bernstein stated that his firm incurred of its lodestar on investigations and factual research on discovery on pleadings,briefs and pretrial motions on settlement on litigation strategy and analysis on court appearances and on miscellaneous.according to bernstein declaration,lchb discovery efforts focused on the massive project of reviewing and coding tens of thousands of pages of documents produced by defendants in hard copy and format,including the effort involved in training those individuals who conducted the document review.the firm pleadings and motion efforts consisted of draft ing and fil ing complaints and amended complaints,petitions to coordinate the california cases,proposed orders regarding the organization of plaintiffs counsel and other issues,stipulations between the parties,proposed confidentiality orders,notices of entry of the court orders,an opposition to a request to stay the litigation,a motion for preliminary approval,the opposition to a motion to intervene,and the motions for final approval and for an award of attorneys fees and costs.
bernstein also submitted a report that summarized the number of hours each attorney at lchb spent working on each category and the hourly rate at which those hours were charged.detailed time records were submitted for in camera review.
guido saveri of the saveri firm also submitted a declaration in support of the motion for attorney fees and costs.saveri explained that the saveri firm participated in drafting the first consolidated amended complaint.the saveri firm also propounded a request for production of documents and a set of special interrogatories and thereafter negotiated the production of all documents that had been produced in the federal case.together with lchb,the saveri firm organized and coordinated a document review and inspection program for participation by all plaintiffs counsel.
saveri also explained that lcbh and the saveri firm were the principal negotiators of the settlements in this case.saveri declared the settlement negotiations with defendants were many,lengthy,complex and very contentious as to each aspect of the litigation,including class definition,class certification,the ability to prove damages,amount of damages,and the potential overlap of the california settlement with the multistate settlements.lchb and the saveri firm participated in drafting the lengthy,detailed and complicated settlement agreement that was the result of those settlement negotiations.
saveri also explained that the saveri firm had participated in all aspects of the cy pres basis of the consumer class had also participated in drafting the motion for preliminary approval,the opposition to the motion to intervene,and the motion for final approval.
saveri reported the firm lodestar to be based on hours.he submitted a summary of the hours worked in each category by each attorney in the firm and also submitted detailed time records for in camera review.
steven tindall,another attorney at lchb,submitted a declaration in which he verified the authenticity of declarations submitted by attorneys.tindall explained that f or all declarations that included detailed time records as an exhibit,such records are being submitted for in camera review as part of a separate declaration.
on january,plaintiffs filed a reply brief on the attorney fees issue.in that brief,they explained that norris had not filed any valid objections.the reply was also supported by a revision to the spreadsheet submitted with the original motion.the revised spreadsheet indicated the total hours spent working on the coordinated cases was and the total lodestar claimed was.
at a hearing on january,norris objected to the requested attorney fees.she challenged the number of hours claimed by class counsel on the ground that the case was rife with duplication of effort.she also challenged some of the individual fee petitions,such as the request for fees from a law firm in alabama,an attorney from illinois and an attorney from alaska.norris claimed that there was no evidence that every attorney or firm filed a complaint or actually had a client.
norris also challenged the requested hourly rates of many attorneys,including the hourly rate of joseph alioto,and the hourly rate of a law school graduate.norris additionally contended that named partners must have been doing blood and guts work rather than guiding others because some of them had billed as many as hours at to an hour.
norris supported her contention that the lodestar figure was not properly calculated by relying on plaintiffs counsel expressed intent to distribute the attorney fees on the basis of each firm relative contribution to the prosecution of these cases,to recognize firms that worked particularly efficiently,and to take into account disparate billing practices.according to norris,this assertion meant that plaintiffs counsel was disingenuous when they used these hourly figures and hourly rates to calculate a lodestar.
on the subject of the multiplier,norris contended that the case did not warrant a multiplier of.according to norris,the risk was not great because defendants agreed to criminal liability before many cases were filed,and there were numerous cases in other states and a case in federal court pending at the same time.
norris requested that the court allow her to intervene,and she asked for a statement of decision.the court denied both requests.the court denied the motion to intervene on procedural and substantive grounds.with regard to the statement of decision,the court stated that none was required,but that it would nevertheless explain its reasoning.
the court then granted the request for million in fees and in costs.the court explained its decision as follows the lodestar was with the submitted hours having been reasonably spent and the submitted hourly rates being reasonable as well and the requested multiplier of was reasonable in light of a number of factors.those factors were that plaintiffs counsel would need to devote substantial hours to carrying out the settlement even after final approval is granted the hours that plaintiffs counsel devoted to the litigation required that they forego other employment plaintiffs counsel undertook this matter solely on a contingent basis and hence with no guaranty of recovery and with significant hurdles to demonstrating damages and plaintiffs counsel obtained a very favorable result,which required a demonstration of skills above and beyond those that would be expected in counsel of their status,experience and expertise.
the court then performed a percentage of the benefit analysis,stating that t he requested million is percent of the total settlement consideration of million that percentage falls well within the percentage awarded in other class action litigation in california and other jurisdictions.the court apportioned the award as million for the consumer class and million for the commercial class.
on that same date,the trial court filed a written order consistent with the decision it announced at the hearing.the order explained that the court relied on the multiplier method and the percentage fee method,as independent bases for determining the amount of fees.the order stated that the in lodestar that plaintiffs counsel have accumulated since march,was reasonable and consistent with the litigation in this case,that the hourly rates were reasonable and that the award was a reasonable percentage of the total settlement.the order identified the following factors as those the court considered a the time and labor required b the contingent nature of the case c the continuing obligations of plaintiffs counsel d preclusion of other employment e the experience,reputation and ability of plaintiffs counsel and the skill they displayed in litigation and f the results achieved.citations.relying on these factors,the court concluded that a fee award was appropriate and that a multiplier of was reasonable.
on february,the trial court denied norris oral motion to intervene in the action.
iii.discussion 
a.the trial court was not required to provide a statement of decision 
b.the award of attorney fees and costs must be reversed and remanded to the trial court for further consideration 
norris challenges the amount of attorney fees awarded to plaintiffs counsel on a number of grounds.our review of the amount of attorney fees awarded is deferential.thayer wells fargo bank th,d thayer.because the experienced trial judge is the best judge of the value of professional services rendered in his court,we will not disturb the trial court decision unless convinced that it is clearly wrong,meaning that it is an abuse of discretion.id.at,d lealao beneficial california,th,d lealao.however,t he scope of discretion always resides in the particular law being applied,in the legal principles governing the subject of the action action that transgresses the confines of the applicable principles of law is outside the scope of discretion and we call such action an abuse of discretion.lealao,supra,th at,d see also thayer,supra,th at,d.when the record is unclear whether the trial court award of attorney fees is consistent with the applicable legal principles,we may reverse the award and remand the case to the trial court for further consideration and amplification of its reasoning.see,ketchum moses,cal th at,d,ketchum thayer,supra,th at,d ramos countrywide home loans,th,d ramos.
t he primary method for establishing the amount of reasonable attorney fees is the lodestar method.the lodestar or touchstone is produced by multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended by counsel by a reasonable hourly rate.once the court has fixed the lodestar,it may increase or decrease that amount by applying a positive or negative multiplier to take into account a variety of other factors,including the quality of the representation,the novelty and complexity of the issues,the results obtained,and the contingent risk presented.citation.the purpose of such adjustment is to fix a fee at the fair market value for the particular action.in effect,the court determines,retrospectively,whether the litigation involved a contingent risk or required extraordinary legal skill justifying augmentation of the unadorned lodestar in order to approximate the fair market rate for such services.citation.under certain circumstances,a lodestar calculation may be enhanced on the basis of a analysis.citation.thayer,supra,th at,d.
on this record,we find ourselves in a position similar to that of division one of the fourth appellate district in ramos,supra,th,d.in that case,several state actions and a federal action were filed challenging the practice of countrywide home loans,countrywide,of imposing property insurance charges on those borrowers who failed to maintain their own insurance on their mortgaged property.id.at,d.the plaintiffs all contended that the charges were being used for administrative purposes in a manner that unfairly penalized the percent of who fell into this category.id.at,d.a settlement was reached between the plaintiff class and countrywide.id.at,d.the trial court granted plaintiffs motion for attorney fees and costs,but reduced the requested lodestar figure by before applying a multiplier.id.at,d.the trial court explained its enhancement of the lodestar as follows the court finds further that an enhancement of the lodestar fee amount is appropriate given the risks undertaken,the complexity of the issues,the skill displayed,the preclusion of other employment and the public interests served.id.at,d,italics omitted.
countrywide appealed the trial court orders awarding attorney fees.ramos,supra,th at,d.the fourth district considered whether the trial court application of a multiplier was a proper exercise of discretion.id.at,d.in doing so,it lamented that its task was complicated by the terse nature of the trial court ruling itself,which gave virtually no explanation for the basis of the substantially enhanced award of fees and costs because it merely lists the enhancement factors used,without a more complete explanation of their applicability in this context,the order is subject to question regarding the factual basis of the exercise of discretion made.id.at,d.
the fourth district noted that the trial court ruling began by stating that p laintiffs succeeded in challenging perceived abuses in forced order insurance programs for homeowners,and the lawsuit sent a message to other lenders in the forced order insurance industry.ramos,supra,th at,d.the fourth district interpreted this language as arguably relying on the skilled nature of the representation and the public interest benefits conferred in setting the base amount of fees.id.at,d.the court expressed concern that the trial court also used these factors to justify the enhancement.the court stated,if the trial court lodestar calculation already reflected such factors,its order does not adequately reveal its reasoning for a further enhancement on this account.more detailed findings are essential to permit meaningful review of the award.similarly,the order refers to the possibility of future work required to administer the settlement,but without giving a basis for estimating the value of such work.ibid.
the fourth district also noted that the trial court enhanced the lodestar on the basis that the litigation precluded other employment.the fourth district concluded that more explicit findings would be of great assistance to this court in relating that factor to the figure chosen.ramos,supra,th at,d.the court additionally found the trial court enhancement of the base fee award to be somewhat inconsistent with its reduction of the lodestar by.id.at,d.
the court of appeal ultimately concluded that u nder all the relevant circumstances,it could not be justified in presuming that the trial court considered only appropriate factors in applying this particular multiplier to the lodestar figure when all applicable factors are considered,no reasonable basis for the court action is currently evident on this record,but solely with respect to the selection of this relatively large multiplier figure.citation.w hile this case presented risks for plaintiffs counsel,it was also resolved without the risks of trial.while it involved some limited novelty of issues,it was also part of a series of related litigation.further,as we have explained,the lodestar calculation apparently fully compensated counsel at their respective professional rates for the hours spent in the litigation.thus,if the trial court on remand wishes to enhance the lodestar amount by a multiplier,it must more precisely articulate why such increment is appropriate.general reference to risk,novelty and skill on this record does not support the relatively large multiplier selected by the trial court.ramos,supra,th at,d.
here,the sheer number of private putative class actions resolved by this the number of law firms seeking attorney or more raises the specter of duplicative and superfluous litigation and hence unnecessary fees and costs.the plaintiffs were represented by highly experienced counsel,an executive committee of eight additional law firms,and a steering committee which admittedly never additional law firms in fact,the law firms who were not on the executive committee contributed significantly to the expense of this of the lodestar and of the necessarily contributing an equivalent percentage of value to the litigation perhaps even more significantly,in of the private coordinated class actions,three or more law firms were listed as plaintiff counsel.in light of this record,we are concerned that affirmance of the trial court award of attorney fees,without further review by that court,might further encourage what we frankly fear happened here the filing of many substantially duplicative class actions manned by multiple law firms.
in thayer,we disapproved of fee awards that reward such conduct while meager fee awards to successful counsel may discourage able counsel from engaging in many forms of public interest litigation that should be encouraged,the unquestioning award of generous fees may encourage duplicative and superfluous litigation and other conduct deserving no such favor.thayer,supra,th at,d.we explained that a bsent a lack of confidence in the competence of counsel in the first filed case to maintain this class does not is difficult to find any need for the filing of so many essentially duplicative actions in the first place.had the four actions filed after the first action not been commenced,the plaintiffs in those cases would have been included in the class alleged in that first case.while it is therefore impossible to conclude that the filing of so many nearly identical actions significantly increased the value of this litigation to any customers of the defendant,it did substantially increase the defendant exposure to large attorney fee awards.id.at,d.
we further observed in thayer that f ederal case law raises the question whether it is appropriate at all to award attorney fees in lawsuits brought with different named plaintiffs which substantially track actions previously brought.citation.as the united states court of appeals for the second circuit has pointed out,w hile there is no rule governing the award of counsel fees where multiple litigation is brought,a duplicative action which contributes virtually nothing to the ultimate result can not justify an award of counsel fees citation.where the goal of the litigation is fully achieved by a single action,an award of compensation to latecomers who add nothing of value would encourage the bringing of superfluous litigation solely for an award of fees.citations.thayer,supra,th at,d,italics added.our supreme court has expressed similar limitations on fee awards,explaining that reasonable compensation does not include compensation for padding in the form of inefficient or duplicative efforts ketchum,supra,cal th at,d.here the large number of law firms involved including in particular those or so cases in which three or more law firms represented the named plaintiff or plaintiffs strongly suggests that the participation of some law firms achieved little more than to drive up the award of fees.while it is true that a certain amount of inefficiency,waste,duplication,and even competition in the representation of the plaintiff class was inevitable and,at least in the beginning,tolerable thayer,supra,th at,d,we reiterate that our concern is with the apparent substantial duplication of effort in this litigation when the cause was,from the beginning,ably championed by a phalanx of highly qualified law firms.
our second major concern with the award at issue here concerns the circumstances recited in the footnote in the memorandum of points and authorities filed with the trial court to the effect that the fees might not be distributed in accordance with the lodestar attributable to each firm,but would instead be distributed on the basis of each firm relative contribution to the prosecution of this case as determined by counsel 
to be sure,one case has suggested that,in some situations,it might be appropriate to distribute fees in a manner that varies from the way in which the fees were calculated.see rebney wells fargo bank d.rebney.however,here,the fact that counsel intends to distribute the attorney fees award to the law firms in a manner independent of the lodestar underscores the very concerns we have regarding the value of the services of all of the attorneys and law firms who were involved in these actions.those issues should be resolved by the trial court before an award of attorney fees,rather than by counsel afterwards.
we offer several additional observations regarding the award at issue here 
first,and with specific regard to the multiplier used by the trial court,we note that the risks presented by this case were not as large as plaintiffs counsel would portray them.like the situation in ramos,this case was both resolved without the risks of trial and was similar to litigation filed throughout the country.see ramos,supra,th at,d.indeed,at oral argument in this case,lead plaintiffs counsel conceded that several of the ten law firms on the plaintiffs executive committee were also plaintiffs counsel in the federal direct purchaser cases against the defendants,the cases coordinated in federal court for the district of columbia.
second,and related to the general risk issue,liability at least as to some of the vitamins produced and sold by the defendants was effectively established by the guilty pleas of some,if not all,of them.see a a final judgment or decree rendered in any criminal proceeding brought by or on behalf of the united states under the antitrust laws to the effect that a defendant has violated said laws shall be prima facie evidence against such defendant in any action or proceeding brought by any other party against such defendant under said laws as to all matters respecting which said judgment or decree would be an estoppel as between the parties thereto.and,to the extent the guilty pleas did not cover all of the vitamins whose sales were at issue in this litigation,the mdl litigation covered allegations concerning all of the vitamins at iss
