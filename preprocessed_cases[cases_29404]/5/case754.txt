an erisa plan the other defendants can be ignored appeals from the district judge imposition,after an evidentiary hearing,of statutory penalties and attorneys fees for failure to comply with the plaintiff requests for plan documents.the plaintiff,george lowe,challenging the judge order setting aside under rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure a default judgment that she had entered in his favor earlier and that was more favorable to him than the contested judgment,entered later,from which the plan appeals.
the facts,as distinct from their interpretation,are not in dispute.lowe wife was a retired employee of a company that was acquired by,and the company retirement plan was merged into the plan.she collected retirement benefits from the plan for several years,and then died.her executor informed the plan of her death,whereupon payments ceased because the plan had in its possession a form that indicated that she had chosen to take her benefits as a annuity,which meant that her husband would not receive any benefits should he survive her.for this cutting out of the spouse to be effective,however,a waiver had to be signed by the spouse and the signature either witnessed by a representative of the plan or notarized.c a iii lasche george lasche basic profit sharing plan,cir.the waiver that the plan had was signed by lowe,all right,but his signature was neither witnessed nor notarized.
looking through his wife papers,lowe found the same form that his wife had signed,but on his copy there was no check mark in the annuity box,as there was on the plan copy.on july,lowe wrote the plan requesting relevant documents,such as the retirement plan itself.there was no response.in september lowe wrote again,and again got no response.he turned to the department of labor for help.the department requested some of the documents from the plan.the plan complied with the department request three months later,but without bothering to send copies to lowe,who meanwhile,on january,had brought this suit against the plan for survivor benefits.not until july,did the plan give lowe the documents he had requested,and at the same time it acknowledged his right to survivor benefits of a month because his signature on the form waiving surviving spouse rights had not been witnessed or notarized.by this time lowe had obtained a default order,but it was not until march of that the judgment that the plan has appealed was entered.the judgment awarded him survivor benefits in the amount the plan had acknowledged owing him,plus statutory penalties of determined by multiplying a day by the days that had elapsed between the plan deadline see next paragraph for giving lowe the documents he had requested and the date on which it finally did give them to him,and in attorneys fees for his efforts in getting the plan to acknowledge at last that it owed him survivor benefits.we shall discuss the plan challenge to these awards first and then recount the circumstances leading up to the.we note with regret that the almost interval between the entry of the order of default and the entry of the final judgment,in a case involving simple facts and modest stakes,argues poor case management.
a failure to honor a request for plan documents by a plan participant or beneficiary within days of the request exposes the plan to a statutory penalty of now a day.c.because the statute provides no criteria to guide determination of the amount to be awarded within that limit,that determination is left to the discretion of the district judge.ziaee vest,cir mcdonald pension plan of pension trust fund,cir.the judge did not abuse her discretion in assessing a a day penalty against the plan.the plan delay in giving lowe documents to which he was clearly entitled was egregious,driving him to hire a lawyer and entangling him in litigation culminating in an absurd of which more later.the a substantial entity that can not claim to lack the resources necessary for processing document requests expeditiously.not that poverty would be a defense,but it do not hold that it would the question is not a mitigating circumstance.hicks feiock,d south suburban housing center berry,cir huber marine midland bank,cir.
pleads for lenity on the ground that its records concerning lowe were in disarray because it had just acquired her employer and also that it thought lowe had waived survivor benefits.although lowe signature on the waiver form was not witnessed or notarized,the employee of the plan who handled lowe request for documents thought that the attestation might be on another page that had gotten lost in the shuffle.he never bothered to tell lowe this,however,and the lost page never did turn up and so far as we know never existed.the plan pleas for mercy are in any event in conflict with one another,because the disorganization of its records should have alerted it to the possibility that evidence that lowe signature had been notarized would never turn up.and anyway doubt about the validity of the wife election does not explain a failure to send lowe a copy of the plan or make any other response to him.
the plan only respectable argument against the penalty ruling is that the judge made a factual error.she mistakenly believed that lowe had sent the plan his copy of his wife form,the copy in which the box for electing a annuity had not been checked.deference in appellate review of a discretionary decision by the presupposes that he has got the facts and the law right.but if it is reasonably clear that correcting the error would not lead to a different decision,the error is harmless and the decision will stand.kwasny united states,cir.that is the case here.the reason the plan could not lawfully deny survivor benefits to lowe was not that his copy of the form indicated that his wife had intended him to have those benefits,for his copy might have been erroneous or a fabrication,but that the plan copy was missing an essential element of an effective waiver of a survivor benefits,namely an attestation of lowe signature.to have assumed that the missing attestation would turn up and on that basis to decline even to communicate with lowe for nearly two years was not only unjustifiable,but flagrantly so,and we can not imagine that drawing a minor factual error to the district judge attention would have changed her decision.the plan can consider itself lucky that only half the maximum penalty was imposed.compare krueger int l,blank,cir law ernst young,cir.we add that the plan could have determined the significance of the judge factual mistake by moving under.for reconsideration of her decision.
erisa authorizes with immaterial exceptions the award of reasonable attorneys fees to a prevailing plaintiff in a suit for benefits.g.because the award will be paid out of plan assets,to the possible harm of the other participants and beneficiaries vested benefits in erisa retirement plans are federally not fully,nachman pension benefit guaranty,and,d operating engineers local health benefit fund gustafson construction,cir,prevailing plaintiffs in erisa cases are not awarded attorneys fees as a matter of course,as in civil rights litigation.instead they must show that the plan litigating position was not substantially justified.bittner sadoff rudoy industries,cir.some cases employ instead a multifactor test to determine entitlement to attorneys fees in erisa cases.but as we pointed out in bowerman stores,cir,the factors in the test are used to structure or implement,rather than to contradict,the substantially justified standard,described in little cox supermarkets,cir,as the question to be answered even when the more elaborate test is used.the only basis the plan had for refusing to pay survivor benefits was that lowe signature might have been notarized on a sheet of paper that has vanished.this the dog ate my homework defense was no defense at all,in re riggs,cir,and so the plan position can not be said to have been substantially justified and lowe was rightly reimbursed for his attorney fees.
