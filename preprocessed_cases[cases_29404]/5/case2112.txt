steven rice is the attorney for petitioner christie julie do,the defendant in the trial court.because do is indigent,rice is representing her free of charge.petitioner seeks relief from an order denying her request for monetary discovery sanctions.even though plaintiff,real party in interest quang thanh nguyen,twice failed to appear for noticed depositions,the court denied the request concluding it had no power to order sanctions in favor of a party represented by a lawyer acting without charge.we disagree with this conclusion and therefore issue a writ of mandate ordering the trial court to award monetary sanctions to petitioner.
the public law center plc,a law firm sponsored by the orange county bar association,solicits members of that association to represent indigent litigants free of charge.when real party sued petitioner,an indigent,immigrant,alleging breach of a loan agreement,petitioner sought the assistance of.plc helped her prepare and file an answer asserting the written loan agreement was obtained by fraud.as the action progressed,plc became aware the matter was too complicated for petitioner to proceed without representation.rice,a member of crowell moring llp,had previously handled similar cases for plc clients without charging a fee,and plc asked him to represent petitioner on the same basis.rice agreed to do so,substituted in as petitioner attorney of record,and continues to represent her in the trial court and here.
in the course of the litigation,rice noticed the deposition of real party,who twice failed to appear.rice then filed a motion to compel the deposition the motion also asked for monetary sanctions based on the reasonable value of rice services.after receiving the motion,real party lawyer agreed to present his client for a deposition,and by the time of the hearing,the deposition was completed,making the motion to compel moot.
however,the court heard,and ultimately denied,the motion for sanctions.the order recited as the sole reason for the denial counsel for defendant has taken this matter pro bono.in argaman ratan th,d,an attorney appearing in propria persona was not entitled to attorney fees for time spent on a discovery dispute.the court sees the situation of a litigant with pro bono counsel as analogous.ccp b refers to reasonable expenses,including attorney fees incurred as a result of a misuse of the discovery process.
discussion 
standard of review 
although we would normally review denial of a discovery sanction using an abuse of discretion standard young rosenthal d,here we deal solely with a question of statutory interpretation.thus we review the issue de novo.argaman ratan,supra,th at,d.
sanctions in the discovery scheme 
code of civil procedure section,subdivision j all further statutory references are to that code except where otherwise noted provides that if a party fails to appear for a validly noticed deposition,the noticing party may move to compel attendance.the subdivision further states if this motion is granted,the court shall also impose a monetary sanction under section against the deponent,unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.italics added.the trial court made no such finding here.therefore,considering the mandatory language of the statute,it would seem petitioner is entitled to sanctions.but the to section clouds the issue.
section,subdivision a specifies certain conduct as m isuses of the discovery process.the list does not purport to be exclusive and does not specify failure to appear at a deposition as such a misuse.section,subdivision b provides that,t o the extent authorized by the section governing any particular discovery method,t he court may impose a monetary sanction italics added.in spite of this permissive language,our courts have recognized that the court will impose the monetary sanction unless the losing party convinces the court that it acted with substantial justification.california shellfish,united shellfish th,d,italics omitted.thus here,where there is no finding of such justification,petitioner would be entitled to monetary sanctions unless her lawyer generosity bars such relief.
the purpose of discovery sanctions is not to provide a weapon for punishment,forfeiture and the avoidance of a trial on the merits citation caryl richards superior court d,but to prevent abuse of the discovery process and correct the problem presented motown record superior court d.fred howland superior court d.were we to accept the trial court interpretation of the statute and case law,those purposes would hardly be advanced.it would ill serve the objectives of the discovery statutes were we to conclude that,where a lawyer represents a party free of charge,the opponent may engage in discovery abuses with impunity.further,in agreeing to assist an impecunious litigant,a lawyer intends to confer a benefit on the client but certainly not on the client opponent.finally,it should be the policy of the law to encourage conscientious lawyers,such as rice,to represent indigents.a rule that would make discovery abuse by the opponent more likely where lawyers donate their time would discourage performance of such worthy service.
analogous supreme court decisions 
although this is a case of first impression,there are several supreme court decisions that deal with issues analogous to the one before us.they also resolve questions relating to the reimbursement of litigants who did not in fact incur additional fees as a result of their opponent actions.the cases involve lawyers who represent themselves,lawyers who represent their clients on a contingent fee basis,lawyers,and,most recently,a client represented by the labor commissioner.in none of these situations can it be said that the client incurred attorney fees based on acts of the opposing party.nevertheless,most of these cases permit recovery of fees.
four opinions issued by our supreme court in the last decade provide us with significant guidance.these are lolley campbell cal th,d,lolley,ketchum moses cal th,d,ketchum,plcm group,drexler cal th,d,plcm,and trope katz cal th,d,trope.we examine the rationales supporting each of these decisions,starting with the earliest,to determine to what extent they speak to the issue confronting us.
trope denied fees under civil code section to a.in the first paragraph of its opinion,the trope court expressed the major concern that led to this conclusion were we to construe the statute so as to permit recovery of fees,we would in effect create two separate classes of pro se who are attorneys and those who are grant different rights and remedies to each.trope,supra,cal th at,d.and later in the opinion,such disparate treatment would conflict with the legislative purpose of section.the statute was designed to establish mutuality of remedy when a contractual provision makes recovery of attorney fees available to only one party,and to prevent the oppressive use of attorney fee provisions.citations.if an attorney who is the prevailing party in an action to enforce a contract with an attorney fee provision can recover compensation for the time he expends litigating his case in propria persona,but a nonattorney pro se litigant can not do so regardless of the personal and economic value of such time simply because he has chosen to pursue a different occupation,every such contract would be oppressive and.trope,supra,cal th at,d.
the problem of identified by the trope court leads to a different conclusion here.the effect on the opposing party is the same whether the lawyer who successfully makes or resists a discovery motion is paid a fee or not.the opposite of the situation under civil code section is true were we to hold that parties represented by lawyers who provide their services free of charge are not entitled to sanctions while parties who have to pay fees are,we could say with the trope court that such a construction of the statute would in effect create two separate classes of discovery litigants,those who must pay their lawyers and those who need not,and grant different rights and remedies to eac
