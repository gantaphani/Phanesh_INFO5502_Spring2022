background 
factual background 
kennedy,the owner of kcree,created an educational curriculum called the accredited seller representative asr program.in connection with the asr program,appellants developed and registered several trademarks the asr marks in,appellants began to market and earn income from the asr program.a real estate school would pay kcree an annual fee referred to as the license fee in order to use the asr materials to teach an asr class.in addition to the license fee,kcree charged the schools a fee for each student in an asr class,and successful students also would pay yearly fees to kcree to maintain their asr registration.
in,swanepoel,the owner and president of realtyu,approached kennedy with a business proposition.realtyu represented that it could provide kcree with access to the realtyu affiliates across the country and thus to a larger number of students.kennedy and swanepoel signed a letter of intent on june,agreeing to form a new company,sac.kcree was to transfer the asr marks to sac in return for ownership of the company.realtyu would contribute working capital to sac and own the remaining.other than teaching fees earned by kennedy,all student course fees,provider licensing fees,and renewal fees related to the asr marks would belong to sac,and profits would be distributed according to the parties respective ownership shares.neither kcree nor sac was required to pay the annual licensing fee.kennedy testified that sac had discretion to waive the licensing fee for realtyu affiliated schools.
on or about september,the parties executed a series of formal agreements,including a stock purchase agreement.among other things,the agreements required sac to take the best overall actions for the company.sac was to acquire the asr marks upon closing however,sac had to meet certain conditions precedent before the closing could occur,including the transfer of sac shares to appellants.although the share transfer never occurred,sac and realtyu utilized the asr marks between september,and july,without objection by appellants.
after executing the agreements,appellants learned that a significant stream of asr program revenue was being diverted from sac directly to realtyu.on july,appellants sent a letter to swanepoel stating that your companies do not have a contract with appellants,and your continued use of their trademarks constitutes trademark infringement.sac filed a complaint for declaratory relief on july,requesting a determination that sac was the rightful owner of the asr marks.on february,appellants filed counterclaims for trademark infringement against sac,realtyu,and swanepoel.
on july,three days after commencement of the action for declaratory relief,kennedy sent an email to tom mitchell mitchell,the senior vice president of realtyu group,kennedy forwarded a complaint of a potential asr student who was having difficulty registering for an asr course.kennedy told the potential student that he was forwarding this to our it folks.mitchell responded to kennedy that it was t aken care of.more than a year later,on november,kennedy sent mitchell a facsimile regarding candidate apps.the cover page read f rom kennedy center to be placed in database.the facsimile contained several asr candidate applications and the candidates completed asr course exams.the district court found that kennedy had ask ed sac to make use of the intellectual property by requesting that it process certificates and certify members in the asr program for classes.
b.the district court determinations 
the district court determined that appellants are the rightful owners of the asr marks.it concluded that sac could not enforce the agreement requiring appellants to transfer the intellectual property because sac had not satisfied the conditions precedent contained in the stock purchase agreement,including its obligation to issue stock to appellants.the district court also found that sac could not enforce the agreement because it had unclean hands while the stock purchase agreement required sac to take the best overall actions for the company,sac in fact diverted many of the asr student course fees to realtyu rather than keeping the fees itself.
the district court noted that f rom september,until july,i t is undisputed that sac had permission or an implied license to use the asr trademarks.it also concluded that appellants conduct after the july,letter led sac,realtyu,and swanepoel to believe they had permission to continue using the asr marks,and it denied damages and royalties for that period in light of appellants acquiescence to appellees use of the trademarks after the letter and the initiation of litigation.for the same reason,the district court declined to award attorneys fees.the district court did,however,permanently enjoin sac,realtyu,and swanepoel from infringing or otherwise making use of appellants intellectual property.
ii.analysis 
appellants challenge the district court decision on several grounds.they argue that because sac had unclean hands,the court erred in sustaining sac affirmative defense of acquiescence.they also contend that the record is insufficient to support the conclusion that they gave any form of consent for realtyu to use the asr marks,either before or after the july,letter.finally,they also challenge the finding of acquiescence itself,arguing that the evidence in the record is insufficient to support the conclusion that they acquiesced to use of the asr marks by sac or realtyu.
standards of review 
to the extent that appellants challenge the district court factual findings,such findings are reviewed for clear error.a.a district court finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is illogical,implausible,or without support in inferences that may be drawn from the facts in the record.united states hinkson,cir citing anderson city of bessemer city.
the application of the equitable doctrine of unclean hands is within the discretion of the trial court and is reviewed for abuse of that discretion.see transworld airlines,am.coupon,cir citing.capitols basketball club,barry,cir finding that the application of the unclean hands doctrine was committed to the district court discretion.similarly,while the question appears to be one of first impression in our circuit,we join our sister circuits in concluding that the application of the equitable doctrine of acquiescence is within the discretion of the trial court and also is reviewed for abuse of discretion.see coach house,coach six,cir finding that b ecause acquiescence is an equitable defense,it will be reviewed for an abuse of discretion piper aircraft,cir finding that because acquiescence imports a analysis,its determination rests in the sound discretion of the trial court and only will be disturbed on review for clear abuse of that discretion.

sac equitable defenses and the district court finding of unclean hands 
appellants argue that sac unclean hands should preclude it as a matter of law from benefitting from the equitable defense of acquiescence.the doctrine of unclean hands bars relief to a plaintiff who has violated conscience,good faith or other equitable principles in his prior conduct,as well as to a plaintiff who has dirtied his hands in acquiring the right presently asserted.dollar,avcar leasing,cir citations omitted.the doctrine of unclean hand
