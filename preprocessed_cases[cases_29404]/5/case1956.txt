factual and procedural background 
the parties.
plaintiff and respondent sc manufactured homes,sc homes is a retail dealership of mobilehomes in los angeles county.plaintiff and respondent charles redick,a licensed mobilehome dealer,appears to be the owner of sc homes.we refer to sc homes and redick collectively as plaintiff.
plaintiff sued a large number of mobilehome dealers,mobilehome park managers,and mobilehome park owners.thirty of these defendants and appellants appear jointly on appeal joint defendants three named defendants and appellants,collectively referred to as parklane,are involved with the parklane mobile estates,a space mobilehome park 
the complaint.
after plaintiff filed its initial complaint,the case was referred to the complex litigation project.thereafter,plaintiff filed its first amended complaint,which is the pertinent complaint.this complaint consists of paragraphs and attached exhibits.it alleges three causes of action violation of the cartwright act bus,et intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and violation of the unfair competition law ucl,bus,et.
the substance of the complaint was that defendants were participants in a conspiracy by which mobilehome dealers paid kickbacks to park owners and operators for the exclusive right and privilege of marketing and selling their mobilehomes in the parks,thereby restraining trade,preventing competition,increasing the cost of the mobilehomes in those parks,and interfering with plaintiff contracts and potential contracts.allegedly,the conspiratorial conduct denied plaintiff the ability to sell and lease mobilehomes.
at the beginning of the first amended complaint,plaintiff summarized its allegations as follows this action is brought by a mobile home dealer,against the owners and operators of certain mobile home parks located in the city of santa clarita,who conspired with certain mobile home dealers to restrain trade and increase profits by refusing to allow buyers of new homes to locate in the park unless they bought particular homes from the defendant dealers who provided kickbacks of up to to the defendant park operators for the exclusive right to place and sell their homes on spaces within the park.defendant park operators also demanded and received economic concessions,fees,or gratuities from defendant dealers for the privilege of being allowed to broker used mobile homes in the park.these schemes prevent fair competition among mobile home dealers,unduly increase the price of mobile homes,and severely limit the choices of homes available to buyers.plaintiff is a dealer of new and used mobile homes who refused to pay kickbacks and was damaged in being foreclosed from competing equally in the marketplace of new mobilehomes because the sale of such a home is not possible without the availability of a desirable space upon which to locate the home.it is illegal to charge special entry fees to allow a mobile home owner to obtain a lease to locate his or her home in a park.it is also illegal for a park owner or operator to demand a fee or commission for the sale of a mobile home dealer either directly from the buyer or seller,or indirectly from the mobile home dealer,unless the fee is disclosed and approved in advance and the park operator performs actual sales services commensurate with the fee.plaintiff was damaged due to lost mobile home sales through the actions of the defendant park operators who conspired with defendant dealers to restrain trade.
according to the allegations in the first amended complaint,the conspiracy resulted in closed parks,parks that reserve all or virtually all of the available spaces in the park to one or more specific dealers for the placement of new model homes until they are sold,leaving none for a potential tenant to lease and place on it a new mobilehome purchased from a dealer of his own choice.
plaintiff further alleged that the conspiratorial acts of connecting the leasing of mobilehome park spaces to the sale of certain mobilehomes,was an illegal tying arrangement 
plaintiff alleged that the illegal acts of defendants,including the tying arrangements,and kickbacks,violated one or more provisions of the mrl,including,civil code sections,subdivisions a and b and,subdivision a,and that the payment and of purportedly illegal fees to mobilehome buyers violated health and safety code section.in part,plaintiff alleged the mrl and the health and safety code were violated because the kickbacks were illegal entry,installation,landscaping fees,illegal transfer or selling fees charged to a homeowner or agent as a condition of sale,and illegal fees charged to a homeowner or agent upon purchase of a mobile home as a condition for approval of tenancy.it was further alleged that when plaintiff refused to pay a kickback,there was a resulting illegal withholding of approval by park operators of a purchaser of a mobilehome that will remain in the park.allegedly,these and other acts also violated the ucl.
the bulk of the first amended complaint,paragraphs through,described particular events,by individual defendants,that purportedly violated the cartwright act,the ucl,and intentionally interfered with plaintiff prospective economic advantage.
plaintiff made additional allegations targeting parklane,including the following parklane and its attorney illegally evicted tenants so that mobilehomes of the evicted tenants could be and replaced with new mobilehomes provided by other.parklane collected a kickback from the sales proceeds.parklane acquired the mobilehomes of the evicted tenants through warehouseman liens that superficially inflated the redemption price to include the unreasonable attorney fee as a lien against the mobile home.the inflated redemption price assisted in the illegal eviction.the indirect charges,including the illegal fees and kickbacks,were prohibited by the mrl.further,parklane solicited kickbacks from defendants for the exclusive rights to place and develop mobilehomes on new spaces in its existing park.because plaintiff would not participate in the kickback scheme,it was damaged because it could not place mobilehomes on some of these spaces 
the first cause of action for violation of the cartwright act alleged that the kickback conspiracy,including the tying arrangements and lien auction sales,prevented competition and restricted commerce by forcing prospective homeowners to buy new mobilehomes only from those dealers who paid kickbacks.with regard to this cause of action,plaintiff sought more than million for damages it incurred as a result of lost sales,as well as treble damages,emotional distress damages,an injunction prohibiting defendants from restraining trade,and attorney fees and costs.
the second cause of action for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage alleged that because plaintiff would not pay kickbacks,the conspirators intentionally interfered with plaintiff relationship with home buyers,home sellers,and park operators.for example,it was alleged that when plaintiff had agreements to sell new mobilehomes to prospective tenants,defendant park owners improperly refused the buyer application to become a tenant in the park,and thus knowingly disrupted the relationship.plaintiff allegedly suffered economic harm from the lost sales as a result of the interferences.in addition to general and special damages,plaintiff requested emotional distress damages and punitive damages.
in the third cause of action for violating the ucl,plaintiff alleged the conspiracy enabled the defendants to compete unfairly against those who would not participate in the kickback scheme.further,the complaint alleged that defendant dealers received extra profits through inflated mobilehome prices and recouped illegal kickback charges by secretly increasing the amount homeowners paid for mobilehomes.plaintiff,who refused to participate in the conspiracy,allegedly lost the opportunity to make profits from the sales of mobilehomes.plaintiff additionally alleged that the fees parklane charged dealers to lease spaces was tantamount to an advance sales commission and violates the prohibitions against such entry fees and selling fees as described in the mrl,including civil code,a,b,and a.plaintiff requested an order enjoining defendants from paying any moneys in order to reserve park spaces,prohibiting the exclusion of certain dealers from certain parks,and prohibiting closed parks,as well as attorney fees for enforcing a public right.code civ.
each cause of action incorporated all of the preceding allegations in the complaint.
subsequent proceedings.
one group of defendants involved with canyon view estates mobilehome park filed an answer to the original complaint,requesting,among other relief,attorney fees and costs of suit.
the trial court issued a stay prohibiting the other defendants from filing answers to the complaint.thereafter,the trial court encouraged the parties to articulate the defenses in a master list or in joint status conference statements.
the trial court conducted a number of conferences during which the parties discussed the claims and defenses.in preparation of the september status conference,the parties filed a joint statement.in this document,parklane requested leave to file a demurrer and an motion as parklane contended,in part,that its eviction activities were legal under the mrl.
four defendants then demurred to the first amended complaint.in addition to other arguments,these defendants raised joinder and argued that the cartwright act cause of action failed because the allegations in the complaint were that these defendants acted unilaterally,and not in concert or combination with any of the other defendants.
in advance of the hearing on the demurrer,the parties appeared at a conference.they discussed joinder and whether the complaint dealt with individual wrongful acts or a grand overall conspiracy.defendants were to submit to the court a stipulation regarding threshold issues.the trial court would then make a determination on joinder.plaintiff was given time to elect to concede the misjoinder argument and advise that dismissals without prejudice would be filed and individual actions then filed.
rather than wait until the trial court addressed joinder,plaintiff dismissed without prejudice a number of defendants,including joint defendants and parklane 
the motions for attorney fees and costs.
a.the motions.
after their dismissal,joint defendants and parklane moved for attorney fees and costs arguing they were entitled to such awards pursuant to civil code section,a section of the mrl.joint defendants requested approximately and parklane requested approximately in attorney fees and costs.
the trial court directed plaintiff to file an opposition addressing whether joint defendants and parklane had a right to recover attorney fees and costs.the trial court stated that a hearing on the right to recover would be conducted first,and an additional hearing would be held if the court was required to address the amount of the fee requests.
plaintiff opposed the motions.
b.the trial court order denying the motions.
after the hearing on the motions for attorney fees and costs,the trial court issued an order on january,denying the motions.the trial court concluded that joint defendants and parklane were the prevailing parties under civil code section.the trial court noted that there was no specific cause of action under the mrl,but that,by itself,was not determinative.the trial court held that while sections of the mrl were mentioned in the complaint and incorporated by reference into all three causes of action,the case did not arise out of the mrl.rather,o n the allegations of the first amended complaint,at best,plaintiffs claims are related to the mrl.
joint defendants and parklane appeal from the order denying the motions for attorney fees and costs.we affirm.
discussion 
introduction.
joint defendants and parklane do not contend they are entitled to attorney fees and costs pursuant to the three stated causes of action,unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of the cartwright act bus,et interference with prospective economic advantage and unfair competition in violation of the ucl rather,they argue that they are entitled to attorney fees and costs pursuant to civil code section hereinafter,section,the attorney fees and costs provision of the mrl.
an order granting or denying an award of attorney fees is generally reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard of review however,the determination of whether the criteria for an award of attorney fees and costs have been met is a question of law.citations.citation.mhc financing limited partnership two city of santee th,d,citing among others,salawy ocean towers housing th,d accord,akins enterprise th,d.
joint defendants and parklane were not entitled to attorney fees and costs pursuant to section.
a.the mrl and its attorney fees and costs provision.
in california,mobilehome tenancies are governed by the mobilehome residency law,et the law extensively regulates the relationship between mobilehome park owners and residents.citation.the protections afforded by the mobilehome residency law reflect legislative recognition of the unique nature of mobilehome tenancies.see,subd.a.ordinarily,mobilehome park tenants own their homes but rent the spaces they occupy.citation.once a mobilehome is in place in a park,it is difficult to relocate.citations.its owner thus is more likely to be a resident.citation.in many cases,mobilehome park tenants have limited and undesirable options if they find living in the park no longer desirable,practical,or possible citation.people ex rel.kennedy beaumont investment,supra,th at,d.the mrl provides homeowners a measure of stability and predictability in their mobilehome park residency griffith county of santa cruz th,d.
however,the mrl does not control all aspects of a mobilehome park or its residents.for example,the housing act health,et regulates a number of items,including,sales and escrows of mobilehomes.another example is the mobilehome parks act health,et which regulates the construction and operation of mobilehome parks and recreational vehicle parks.
the state mobilehome residency law,et regulates relations between the owners and the residents of mobilehome parks.cacho boudreau cal th,d,fn.omitted.among other definitions,it defines management,homeowner,and residents.see,defining management,defining homeowner,defining resident.the regulations cover such topics as requiring management to disclose to tenants conditions under which the homeowner will be required to pay gas,water,and electricity service for common areas,when management may enter homes,and when management may remove unauthorized vehicles.the mrl also regulates sales and transfers of mobilehomes in the park,providing specified protections for management,selling homeowners,purchasers and occupants,et friedman et,cal.practice guide the rutter group ch.
the mrl attorney fees and costs provision is found in section.it reads in any action arising out of the provisions of this chapter,the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees and costs.a party shall be deemed a prevailing party for the purposes of this section if the judgment is rendered in his or her favor or where the litigation is dismissed in his or her favor prior to or during trial.italics added.
in addressing the issue before us,we examine the language of section to determine if an award of attorney fees and costs award is warranted.salawy ocean towers housing,supra,th at,d the language of the statute awarding attorney fees determines whether a specific act will result in an award.
section expressly makes defendants prevailing parties if a case against them is dismissed prior to or during trial.del cerro mobile estates proffer th,d.therefore,joint defendants and parklane are the prevailing parties as the litigation has been dismissed in their favor prior to trial.
thus,the issue becomes is this action arising out of the provisions of the mrl 
to be entitled to attorney fees and costs pursuant to section,the underlying case must arise in the context of those relationships and claims addressed by the mrl.it is not sufficient that the case relates to the mrl.
for example,in mhc financing limited partnership two city of santee,supra,th,d,a mobilehome park owner challenged a local rent control ordinance,in part,by arguing it was preempted by the mrl.id.at,d.the trial court ruled in favor of the park owner concluding several portions of the ordinance were preempted.id.at,d.however,the trial court denied the park owner request for attorney fees.id.at,d.on appeal,the park owner argued it was entitled to attorney fees under section.the park owner asserted that the term arising under in section was a broadly worded phrase that would include those claims that relate to the mrl.id.at,d.the appellate court disagreed,stating,in part,the fact that a declaratory relief cause of action relates to a particular statute or statutory scheme does not necessarily mean that the cause of action arises out of the statute or scheme.for example,in patel athow d,the court decided that the federal courts statutory exclusive jurisdiction over cases arising under the economic stabilization act of did not extend to a cause of action seeking a declaratory ruling on the applicability of regulations issued under that act to the parties lease agreement in various contexts,courts have construed the phrases arising out of and arising under more narrowly than the phrase relating to.the ninth circuit court of appeals held that an arbitration clause covering disputes arising under or arising out of an agreement is narrower in scope than one covering disputes arising out of or relating to the agreement.citations.t he phrase any action arising out of the provisions of the mrl in civil code section encompasses only those actions directly involving the application of mrl provisions in specific factual contexts addressed by the mrl,such as actions by mobilehome park residents against management for failing to maintain physical improvements in common facilities in good working order.citations.although the park owner declaratory relief the mrl preempts certain provisions of the ordinance relate to the mrl,they do not arise out of the mrl because they do not involve application of mrl provisions to a particular factual context addressed by the mrl mhc financing limited partnership two city of santee,supra,at,d.
a case may arise under the mrl even if a complaint does not allege a specific cause of action under the mrl,as long as the dispute is one within the scope of the mrl.while the defendants defenses may be considered,the foundation of the case must be grounded in the mrl.
thus,in palmer agee d,owners of a mobilehome park filed a complaint for unlawful detainer against the defendants,residents of the park.id.at.the trial court granted the defendants motion for judgment on the pleadings because the park failed to give proper notice.id.at.however,the trial court denied the defendants motion for attorney fees pursuant to former civil code section,the predecessor to section.the trial court reasoned that the action did not arise out of the mrl notice provision,but arose out of an unlawful detainer action palmer agee,supra,at.the appellate court held that the trial court erred in refusing to award attorney fees under the mrl because actions include all proceedings required to perfect rights and are not limited to the complaint or the document initiating the action but the entire judicial proceeding an action thus includes all proceedings,at least to the time of judgment,which are required to perfect the rights.the defenses raised in the answer to the complaint are a real part of any action.id.at.the tenant defense to the unlawful detainer proceedings that the landlord had not complied with mrl arose from the mrl.
in del cerro mobile estates proffer,supra,th,d,a mobilehome park del cerro rented space to margery proffer.id.at,d.del cerro lawsuit against proffer alleged that her violations of the park rules and regulations were breaches of contract and constituted a public nuisance under the mrl.ibid.after,del cerro dismissed its lawsuit,proffer was awarded attorney fees.on appeal,the appellate court concluded proffer was not entitled to attorney fees on her breach of contract based upon the rental agreement.however,she was entitled to attorney fees incurred in defending the nuisance cause of action because she had a legal basis to claim recovery of such fees grounded in the mrl id.at,d.
people mckale cal d,mckale is another situation in where the plaintiff did not allege a cause of action under the mrl,yet the underlying case discussed a specific factual situation addressed by the mrl.
in mckale,a district attorney brought an action advancing the interests of park tenants.the action was filed against a mobilehome park and a bank wells fargo under the ucl seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief for claimed violations of the mrl and related sections of the administrative code.mckale,supra,cal d at.the purported violations related to safety and sanitation and ranged from dumping waste water on the premises to improper burial of underground electrical wiring.id.at.other causes of action related to violations of the park rules and regulations governing tenants.id.at fn.mckale first held that the attorney general had standing to bring the lawsuit and the violations of the mrl could be prosecuted as acts of unfair competition.id.at.mckale also held that even though the park owner had not tried to enforce the rules and regulations that were themselves unlawful,the existence of those rules and regulations was likely to deceive tenants.thus,the rules and regulations constituted an unfair business practice,and if properly pled would state a cause of action.id.at.the supreme court further found that allegations relating to misleading advertising and discrimination could be stated.id.at.
as to wells fargo,the issue was whether it was in possession and control of the park during any of the alleged discriminatory acts.mckale,supra,cal d at.mckale held that the attorney general should have an opportunity to amend its complaint to address this concern.ibid.in the second to last paragraph of the opinion,mckale addressed wells fargo request for attorney fees and costs as prevailing party under the mrl.the court stated,w hile wells fargo appears to be entitled to fees and costs if it is determined to be a prevailing party see,that determination must eventually depend on whether it prevails on remand.mckale,supra,at.
thus,in mckale,the district attorney brought the case on behalf of mobilehome park tenants against two mobilehome landlords and mobilehome park and wells fargo,who might have had possession and control of the park during some of the alleged discriminatory acts.
b.the case against joint defendants and parklane did not arise under the mrl.
the mrl regulates the conduct between tenants and homeowners and residents and mobilehome management owners and owners agents.cacho boudreau,supra,cal th at,d.however,the case here does not involve a dispute.it does not involve a lawsuit brought by a park manager to protect its rights as against its homeowners and residents.it does not involve a lawsuit brought by residents arising from their tenancy.it does not involve a case,such as mckale,where an entity with standing brings a lawsuit to protect park residents.rather,plaintiff is a dealer of mobilehomes joint defendants and parklane are dealers of mobilehomes and managers and owners of mobilehome parks.regardless of how plaintiff framed its complaint,regardless of the titles to the three specified causes of action,and even though plaintiff cited sections of the mrl in articulating the alleged conspiratorial and tortious conduct of the
