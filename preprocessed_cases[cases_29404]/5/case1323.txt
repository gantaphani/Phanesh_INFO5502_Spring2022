the government appeals the district court order granting attorney fees in the amount of under the hyde amendment for the bad faith prosecution of steven and marlene aisenberg in connection with the disappearance of their daughter sabrina,and the wholesale disclosure of all grand jury transcripts.after review,we reverse and reduce the attorney fee award to.we also vacate the ordered disclosure of all grand jury transcripts.
factual background 
because this case has an extensive procedural history,we first outline the events leading to the wiretapping of the aisenbergs home in and,the indictment of the aisenbergs in,the dismissal of that indictment in,and the award of attorney fees and wholesale disclosure of all grand jury transcripts in.
missing child investigation 
during the early morning of november,marlene aisenberg placed a call to to report the disappearance of her daughter,sabrina aisenberg.law enforcement officials conducted an intense and exhaustive search for the child,which was ultimately unsuccessful.the child remains missing to this day.
throughout their interactions with the aisenbergs and after making no headway in their recovery efforts,law enforcement officials developed suspicions directed at the aisenbergs.on december,sixteen days after the child disappearance,the county sheriff office successfully applied to the state circuit court for authorization to intercept oral and telephonic communications in the aisenbergs home.
the december,application for electronic surveillance was supported by an affidavit signed jointly by detectives linda sue burton and william blake of the county sheriff office.the affiants claimed that probable cause existed to believe that the aisenbergs murdered or sold their child based on certain facts the state circuit court authorized the wiretap,and on december,law enforcement officials placed electronic interception devices in the aisenbergs home.
on january,and again on february,the county sheriff office applied for extensions of the wiretapping authority,relying on transcripts of the aisenbergs conversations obtained during the december wiretaps a pediatrician opinion that pictures of the child indicated that hair had been pulled out of the left side of the baby head and the area around the left eye was bruised and statements by the hair dresser of the aisenbergs children that she noticed hair missing from the child head.the state circuit court granted the extension applications,and the wiretapping continued until march,resulting in days of surveillance and including conversations recorded on audio recordings.as discussed later,the magistrate judge ultimately found that the aisenbergs conversations intercepted from the december wiretaps were largely unintelligible and that the pediatrician and the hairdresser statements in the extension applications were misquoted or taken out of context.
indictment and arrest 
on january,the united states served the aisenbergs with subpoenas to appear before the grand jury.the aisenbergs communicated their unequivocal intent to invoke the fifth amendment before the grand jury and so advised the government through correspondence and a hearing before the district court.the government insisted that the aisenbergs still appear.on february,the aisenbergs appeared before the grand jury,invoked their fifth amendment rights,and refused to answer most questions.
on september,a federal grand jury returned a indictment against the aisenbergs the indictment charged the aisenbergs with one count of conspiracy to make false statements of material facts to law enforcement officials,in violation of,and with six counts of making false statements of material facts to law enforcement officials during the initial missing child report and during the subsequent investigation,in violation of and.on the same day,the aisenbergs were arrested in maryland,where they had moved.
the aisenbergs appeared at an initial hearing at which the government urged the magistrate judge to require the aisenbergs to submit to urinalysis and to require investigation by a social services professional to protect the aisenbergs other two children.during that hearing,an assistant united states attorney asserted that the government had in its possession a taped statement in which steven aisenberg stated,i wish i had harmed her.it was the cocaine.the government also claimed to have in its possession taped statements indicating that the aisenbergs were drugged.as will be discussed later,the district court ultimately determined that the recordings purportedly containing these alleged statements were largely inaudible and the magistrate judge found them unintelligible.
motion to suppress 
on february,the aisenbergs filed a motion to suppress the audio recordings of their home and the related transcripts.the aisenbergs motion claimed that the county detectives affidavits,supporting the wiretap applications,contained false statements,that without these statements there was no probable cause for the wiretaps,and that the audio recordings of their home must be suppressed.the aisenbergs also requested an evidentiary hearing based on franks delaware,d 
during december the magistrate judge conducted a franks evidentiary hearing,which involved ten days of testimony from forty witnesses and over one hundred exhibits,primarily from the government investigative files.on february,the magistrate judge issued a comprehensive report recommending that the district court suppress all audio recordings from the wiretaps of the aisenbergs home.united states aisenberg,d,
in his report,the magistrate judge made extensive fact findings based on the voluminous evidence during the franks hearing for example,the magistrate judge found that in the initial wiretap application,the county detectives not only made false statements,but also omitted material facts regarding the aisenbergs initial missing child report that in the initial wiretap application,the county detectives statement that marlene aisenberg was calm and collected was made with reckless disregard for the truth that the county detectives failed to inform the state circuit court that they knew several people who had seen the child the day before the missing report but had not yet interviewed them that the county detectives failed to inform the state circuit court that they were still awaiting the financial analysis of the couple and the crime lab processing of the evidence that in their extension applications,the county detectives reported conversations that no reasonably prudent listener could hear from the tapes,that the county detectives quoted conversations that do not even appear at all in the supporting transcripts of the tapes or do not appear in the manner described,and that the county detectives deliberately or with reckless disregard summarized conversations out of context that after redacting the unintelligible conversations in the recordings,the county detectives applications for wiretap extensions did not support probable cause to believe that the aisenbergs committed murder that the aisenbergs intercepted communications were unrelated to offenses included in permissible wiretaps under florida wiretap scheme,and thus should be suppressed that during the wiretaps,law enforcement officials failed to minimize the recordings of conversations not otherwise subject to the interception authorization,as required by florida statute and that the county detectives had not met the elements of florida statute c,requiring that they demonstrate that they had tried other reasonable investigative procedures before applying for electronic surveillance.aisenberg,d at.
after the magistrate judge report of february,the district court never ruled on the aisenbergs motion to suppress because the united states attorney office promptly moved for leave to dismiss the indictment against the aisenbergs.on february,the district court dismissed the indictment 
aisenbergs application under hyde amendment 
on march,the aisenbergs moved for an award under the hyde amendment,which provides that the court may award attorney fees and other litigation expenses if the court finds that the position of the united states was vexatious,frivolous,or in bad faith.pub,stat,reprinted in,historical and statutory notes in response,the government conceded that an award of fees and litigation expenses was appropriate under the hyde amendment,but disputed the amount of fees owed.
at the government request,the district court ordered that the parties participate in mediation.the mediator issued a june,report stating that the parties have reached an impasse.the parties then presented their hyde amendment arguments to the district court over a hearing during october.
on january,the district court awarded the aisenbergs in attorney fees and in litigation expenses under the hyde amendment.although the government had conceded the applicability of the hyde amendment,the district court order recounted at great length the events evincing the government bad faith prosecution of the aisenbergs.aisenberg,d at 
in the district court,the government emphasized that the hyde amendment subjects awards to the procedures and limitations provided for under,which,the government pointed out,includes a hourly limitation on attorney fees in d a ii.pub,stat,reprinted in,historical and statutory notes.the district court,however,agreed with the aisenbergs that they were not limited to this hourly limitation in d a ii,but rather could recover rates up to per hour as attorney fees under b,and that even if d a ii applied,special factors justified a departure from the hourly limitation.the district court award also included a fifteen percent multiplier of the attorney fees,or,to compensate the aisenbergs for the delay in the receipt of payment.
the district court award was based on a total of attorney hours by ten attorneys in the law firm of cohen,jayson foster,in tampa,florida,and on rates varying from to per attorney.on appeal,the government does not contest the hours awarded or in litigation expenses.instead,the government contends that the district court erred in not following the hourly cap applicable under the hyde amendment,and in awarding as a fifteen percent enhancement for delay in payment.
grand jury transcripts 
in the same january,order on attorney fees,the district court ordered that the government must file and disclose all grand jury transcripts by february.the aisenbergs initially requested the grand jury transcripts in,and requested them again in to support their claim for attorney fees.after acknowledging that the government opposed this disclosure,the district court explained that it had deferred any ruling on the motions for the transcripts because hyde amendment liability was conceded by the united states,and thus discovery of the transcripts appeared most likely unnecessary.aisenberg,d at.the district court further noted that its award closes the attorney fee issue.id.
nonetheless,the district court ordered wholesale disclosure of all grand jury transcripts primarily because the aisenbergs persisted in their interest in them and the public has a strong interest in inspecting troubled prosecutions in hyde amendment cases.id.at.specifically,the district court reasoned that when a hyde amendment award is made out of public funds to reimburse defendants victimized by a vexatious,frivolous,or bad faith prosecution,the public has a strong interest in the events leading to that prosecution and in inspecting these troubled prosecutions to determine the source of the united states misdirection.id.at.
the district court also concluded that serves no remaining interest of the aisenbergs because they already had been indicted,this fact was well known,and the aisenbergs consent to the release.id.as for the government interest,the district court observed that the grand jury deliberations were completed,that the criminal investigation was at a standstill,and that this circumstance will persist indefinitely,creating what the court termed only the most minimal and inconsequential countervailing considerations.id.the district court determined that the aisenbergs and the public interest was in disclosure and that the only contrary interest remaining is that of the united states,which may want to avoid a full airing of the episode.id.at.
stay of grand jury disclosure 
after the district court ordered wholesale disclosure of all grand jury transcripts by february,the government filed a motion to stay the immediate public disclosure pending appeal the government emphasized that the aisenbergs would not suffer injury from a stay because they had obtained a dismissal of the indictment against them and an unprecedented amount of attorney fees under the hyde amendment without access to or any need for the grand jury materials.the government also stressed that this serious crime remained unsolved and disclosure would interfere with its ongoing investigation 
in reply,the aisenbergs objected to any stay and emphasized that they needed the grand jury material to support their civil lawsuit against the lawyers and law enforcement personnel responsible for the bad faith,vexatious and frivolous prosecution of the aisenbergs.see aisenberg hillsborough county sheriff office,the aisenbergs cited federal rule of criminal procedure e c i i,which permits disclosure of grand jury material when so directed by a court preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding.e c i i the aisenbergs further challenged the viability of any continuing criminal and asserted that much of the information presented before the grand jury was already public,leaving few,if any,justifications for.
on may,the district court entered an order rejecting the government request for a stay pending appeal in that order,the court concluded,inter alia,that the government putative investigation is entitled to no weight in the decision regarding the stay,and that there is apparently no meaningful investigation to endanger.the district court stated that the aisenbergs were prejudiced by the continued secrecy and that their public exoneration and the pursuit of rights they assert against the united states are impaired by continuing.
the government then moved in this court for a stay of disclosure of the grand jury transcripts pending appeal,which was granted on june.
ii.standard of review

iii.discussion 
a.the language of the hyde amendment 
we begin our construction of the hyde amendment with the words of the statutory provision themselves.gilbert,at.the hyde amendment provides in pertinent part 
t he court,in any criminal case other than a case in which the defendant is represented by assigned counsel paid for by the public may award to a prevailing party,other than the united states,a reasonable attorney fee and other litigation expenses,where the court finds that the position of the united states was vexatious,frivolous,or in bad faith,unless the court finds that special circumstances make such an award unjust.such awards shall be granted pursuant to the procedures and limitations but not the burden of proof provided for an award under section of title,united states code.
pub,stat,reprinted in,historical and statutory notes emphasis added.
this circuit prior hyde amendment decisions have dealt primarily with whether the prevailing federal criminal defendant carried his burden to show the required prerequisite to a fee award,to wit that the united states position was vexatious,frivolous,or in bad faith.see adkinson,at gilbert,at.in this case,however,the government conceded the applicability of the hyde amendment in the district court and that the aisenbergs are entitled to recover their attorney fees and expenses.this appeal requires us to determine only issues relating to the amount of the attorney fees owed.those issues are 
whether the hyde amendment incorporates the procedures and limitations in d,making the hourly limitation in d a ii applicable to all hyde amendment claims,or whether the hyde amendment also incorporates the other avenues of relief contained in b 
whether special factors exist justifying a departure from the hourly limitation on attorney fees provided in d a ii and 
whether a district court may increase a hyde amendment award by a multiplier for a delay in payment.
the parties acknowledge that the hyde amendment provides that fee awards shall be granted pursuant to the procedures and limitations but not the burden of proof provided for an award under section of the equal access to justice act eaja.pub,stat,reprinted in,historical and statutory notes.the parties dispute is over how we should construe the hyde amendment language of procedures and limitations provided for an award under.thus,at the outset we also must examine what procedures and limitations are provided for an award under.
section of the eaja contains two separate subsections relating to attorney fees b and d.of these,only d contains any procedures and limitations for an award of attorney fees under the eaja.specifically,d states that a party must file for an award of attorney fees within thirty days of final judgment,d b that attorney fees shall not be awarded in excess of per hour unless the court determines that a special factor,such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys for the proceedings involved,justifies a higher fee,d a ii and that an individual may not recover attorney fees if his net worth exceeds at the time the civil action was filed,nor may the owner of a business whose net worth exceeds and had more than employees at the time the civil action was filed,d b 
to date,all circuits to consider this issue have concluded that the procedures and limitations in incorporated by the hyde amendment are the procedures and limitations in d.see united states knott,cir holding net worth limitation of d b applies to recovery under hyde amendment,and b does not provide avenue for recovery under hyde amendment united states sherburne,cir holding cap on attorney fees provided in d a ii applies to recovery under hyde amendment united states ranger communications,cir holding limitation for filing award for attorney fees provided in d b applies to hyde amendment application.we now join those circuits 
we recognize that the aisenbergs contend that their fee award under the hyde amendment is governed by b,not d.we reject this argument for several reasons.
first,the plain language of the hyde amendment limits awards to the procedures and limitations but not the burden of proof provided for an award under section.pub,stat,reprinted in,historical and statutory notes.section d provides procedures and limitations to fee awards under the eaja,but b provides none.ranger,at noting that b provides neither procedural guidance nor eligibility limitations jones,concurring.thus,allowing defendants to elect to proceed under b would effectively read the clause under the procedures and limitations of section out of the hyde amendment.knott,at.
as the first circuit also aptly recognized in knott,any reading of the hyde amendment not incorporating the procedures and limitations of d 
undercuts the language of the provision and policy concerns underlying the incorporation of these procedures and limitations.if defendants could elect to proceed under b,it is not clear that the hyde amendment incorporation of procedures and limitations from the eaja would have any practical effect.in order to give meaningful effect to the plain language of the hyde amendment,then,the incorporation is best read to refer to the limitations contained in eaja d.
id.at see also ranger,at noting that a construction of the hyde amendment that does not apply d does not give effect to the plain meaning of the hyde amendment nor the policy considerations behind it sherburne,at stating in relation to the award of attorney fees under the hyde amendment that t he statute is limitations of the eaja apply.the eaja caps attorney fees at per hour.
second,because d of the eaja supplies an independent,substantive ground upon which a civil litigant may recover fees under the eaja,its sole incorporation comports with the plain meaning of the hyde amendment.the plain language of the hyde amendment refers to procedures and limitations provided for an award under section.pub,stat,reprinted in,historical and statutory notes emphasis added.this language supports the exclusive incorporation of d because d alone provides a,substantive means for recovering attorney fees.specifically,d provides that a court shall award to a prevailing party fees and other expenses,unless the court finds that the position of the united states was substantially justified.d a.
in contrast to d,b does not provide a substantive or independent basis for an attorney fee award under but acts as only a waiver of sovereign immunity when the common law or another statute provides for an attorney fee award.specifically,b provides that t he united states shall be liable for such fees and expenses to the same extent that any other party would be liable under the common law or under the terms of any statute which specifically provides for such an award.b.furthermore,as expressed by the first circuit in united states knott,it would create a peculiar circularity to allow a defendant relying on the hyde amendment as the substantive basis of a request for attorneys fees to elect to proceed through eaja b in order to avoid the limitations imposed in eaja d,given that the hyde amendment itself incorporates the procedures and limitations of the eaja.at ranger,at stating that it would be circular to go back to the hyde amendment to treat it as an independent statute giving the right to attorneys fees without the limitation 
third,the established principle that waivers of sovereign immunity are to be construed narrowly counsels our construction of the hyde amendment.lane pena,d stating that a waiver of sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed in statutory text,and will be strictly construed in favor of the sovereign citations omitted maritime,united states,cir noting that the eaja is a waiver of sovereign immunity and as such must be strictly construed.this principle adds further support for the incorporation of the procedures and limitations of d in awarding attorney fees under the hyde amendment.knott,at ranger,at.
fourth,although unnecessary to our review the legislative history of the hyde amendment provides support for our construction of the hyde amendment.in united states gilbert,this court reviewed the legislative history of the hyde amendment.at.in its original form,the hyde amendment was patterned after d a id.at ranger,at jones,concurring.after forceful criticism from members of congress and the executive branch due in part to the relatively low standard permitting recovery,the hyde amendment language was modified,narrowing the grounds for recovery.gilbert,at.the adopted version of the hyde amendment disavowed the burden of proof on the government contained in d a,required that the prevailing criminal defendant carry the burden of proof,and further narrowed the standard of recovery to those cases in which the position of the united states was vexatious,frivolous,or in bad faith.id.at citing pub,stat,reprinted in,historical and statutory notes.
thus,as detailed in gilbert,the hyde amendment was initially patterned after d,and the language was modified only in an effort to narrow the grounds of recovery and not,as the aisenbergs suggest,to broaden the sections under in which hyde amendment applicants may recover.thus,construing the hyde amendment to provide a narrow ground of recovery by incorporating the procedures and limitations of d is consistent not only with the principle of narrowly construing waivers of sovereign immunity,but also with the legislative history of the hyde amendment.
for all of these reasons and consistent with all other circuits that have addressed the issue,we hold that the hyde amendment incorporates all of the procedures and limitations in d and does not incorporate b.thus,the district court erred in concluding that the aisenbergs could proceed under b and avoid the hourly limitation in d a ii.
special factors removing fee cap 
the district court alternatively concluded that even if d applied,special factors existed justifying a departure from the hourly limitation in d a ii.specifically,d a ii provides that attorney fees shall not be awarded in excess of per hour unless a court determines that an increase in the cost of living or a special factor,such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys for the proceedings involved,justifies a higher fee.d a ii.the district court relied on two special factors the government concession that an attorney fees award was appropriate under the hyde amendment and its finding that the government prosecution of the aisenbergs was vexatious and in bad faith.in addition to those two factors,the aisenbergs rely on two more factors,which are the delay caused by the government litigating meritless positions and the limited availability of qualified attorneys 
much of the eaja case law defines special factor in d a ii of the eaja by what it is not.in pierce underwood,d,the supreme court stated that special factors in the context of d a ii do not include t he novelty and difficulty of issues,the undesirability of the case,the work and ability of counsel,and the results obtained,nor factors applicable to a broad spectrum of litigation including the contingent nature of the fee.id.internal quotation marks omitted.similarly,in pollgreen morris,cir,this court noted that special factors in the context of d a ii do not include the motivations of the attorneys in bringing the case,the pro bono nature of the case,the fact that the litigation served to vindicate public rights,and the hardships experienced by counsel in departing from the statutory hourly rate.id.citing jean nelson,cir this court in pollgreen further stated that a delay that occurred because the government litigated a position that lacked substantial justification is not a permissible special factor because any litigation eligible for eaja fees,by definition,involves the government pursuit of an unjustified position.at.
turning to the special factors asserted by the aisenbergs,we first conclude that the government concession that the hyde amendment applied does not supply a special factor warranting a fee cap departure.neither the unprecedented nature of the concession,nor the magnitude of the underlying error that the concession impliedly suggests,can be a special factor.as the government points out,finding otherwise would create perverse incentives that discourage useful settlements and encourage protracted litigation.see pierce,at.at observing,in award of attorney fees under eaja d,that government willingness to settle as proof that its position was not substantially justified would not only distort the truth but penalize and thereby discourage useful settlements hensley eckerhart,d stating that a request for attorney fees should not result in a second major litigation.
similarly,the district court independent finding in its attorney fees order that the government position was vexatious,frivolous,or in bad faith,does not provide a special factor.the hyde amendment requires that all successful applicants show that the government position was vexatious,frivolous,or in bad faith.as such,a district court determination that the government prosecution was vexatious,frivolous,or in bad faith does not justify a fee cap departure because every successful application under the hyde amendment would then be subject to a fee cap departure 
the aisenbergs also emphasize the delay between the aisenbergs fee application in march and ultimate recovery of fees in.in pollgreen,this court held that the government delay in litigating a case is a permissible special factor only when the motivation for the delay was improper or the length of the delay itself was inappropriate.at.the government litigation over the amount of attorney fees due,after conceding liability,does not constitute the special factor of improper purpose.specifically,the government position that d a ii limits attorney fees to per hour under the hyde amendment is supported by the statutory language,as well as other circuits case law.as such,we conclude that the government motivation for litigating the amount of attorney fees was not the result of an improper purpose.
finally,the aisenbergs argue on appeal that the limited availability of qualified attorneys for the proceedings involved justifies a higher fee.see d a ii.the district court made no such finding,and there is no evidence to support any such finding in this record.to the contrary,the record shows ten lawyers in cohen,jayson foster,in fact worked on this criminal case.
the aisenbergs also claim that their lawyers incurred a substantial economic detriment in representing unpopular clients and in handling the complex legal,factual,and professional obstacles in this case.although this practice is commendable,the supreme court and this court already have addressed this issue under d and have held that such hardship does not qualify as a special factor.see pierce,at.at stating that special factors in the context of d a ii do not include t he novelty and difficulty of issues,the undesirability of the case,the work and ability of counsel,and the results obtained nor factors applicable to a broad spectrum of litigation,including the contingent nature of the fee internal citations omitted pollgreen,at stating that special factors in the context of d a ii do not include the motivations of the attorneys in bringing the case,the pro bono nature of the case,the fact that the litigation served to vindicate public rights,and the hardships experienced by counsel in departing from the statutory hourly rate citation omitted.
in sum,we conclude that no special factors exist in this record to justify a departure from the hourly limitation provided in d a ii,as incorporated by the hyde amendment.thus,the district court abused its discretion in departing above that hourly limitation.
as discussed earlier,the government does not contest on appeal the number of attorney hours or the litigation expenses of.thus,when the fee is applied to those hours,the attorney fee due is,plus litigation expenses of,for a total of due the aisenbergs.
enhancement for delay in payment 
the district court also erred in applying a multiplier of to the attorney fees awarded based on the delay in the aisenbergs receiving reimbursement for their attorney fees.specifically,the district court concluded that t he circumstances of the present action,which has persisted for over five years,justify the application of a multiplier of to the lodestar of to compensate the aisenbergs for the delay in reimbursement.aisenberg,d at.this multiplier added to the fee award of,for a total of in attorney fees.
it is well established that interest can not be recovered in a suit against the government in the absence of an express waiver of sovereign immunity from an award of interest.library of congress shaw,d newton capital assur,cir stating that i n the absence of express congressional consent to the award of interest separate from a general waiver of immunity to suit,the united states is immune from an interest award alteration in original quoting shaw,at.at.moreover,the supreme court has admonished that compensation for delay and interest share an identical function,that they both are designed to compensate for the belated receipt of money,and that the rule can not be avoided simply by devising a new name for an old institution.shaw,at.at.thus,an award of compensation for delay is equivalent to an award of interest.id.at.at accordingly,we must view the district court compensation for delay as effectively an award of interest.
further,the supreme court has declined to find the requisite waiver of immunity from interest in the statutory requirement of awarding reasonable attorney fees,and has consistently refused to impute an intent to waive immunity from interest into the ambiguous use of a particular word or phrase in a statute.shaw,at.at.the supreme court has instructed that a statute allowing costs,and within that category,attorney fees,does not provide the clear affirmative intent of congress to waive the sovereign immunity to interest payments.id.at.at.
nothing in the hyde amendment,nor the incorporated d of the eaja,provides the required unequivocal waiver of immunity of the united states for the payment of interest or compensation for delay instead,the hyde amendment provides for only reasonable attorney fee s and other litigation expenses.pub,stat,reprinted in,historical and statutory notes.therefore,we conclude that the district court also erred in enhancing the attorney fee award by fifteen percent,or,for the delay in payment of these fees.
general grand jury principles 
we now turn to the district court wholesale disclosure of all grand jury transcripts.we first review the general principles governing the disclosure of secret grand jury material and then apply them to this case.
it has long been a policy of the law that grand jury proceedings be kept secret the english rule of grand jury secrecy has been incorporated into our federal common law and remains an integral part of our criminal justice system.blalock united states,cir citing douglas oil of cal.petrol stops northwest,d see also united states phillips,cir stating that t he secrecy of the grand jury is sacrosanct.in douglas oil,the supreme court summarized the reasons for,and interests served by,grand jury secrecy as follows if preindictment proceedings were made public,many prospective witnesses would be hesitant to come forward voluntarily,knowing that those against whom they testify would be aware of that testimony witnesses who appeared before the grand jury would be less likely to testify fully and frankly,as they would be open to retribution as well as to inducements t here would be the risk that those about to be indicted would flee there would be the risk that those about to be indicted would try to influence individual grand jurors to vote against indictment and by preserving the secrecy of the proceedings,we assure that persons who are accused but exonerated by the grand jury will not be held up to public ridicule.at.at.
rule e of the federal rules of criminal procedure codifies this secrecy principle and prohibits the disclosure of grand jury material except in the limited circumstances provided for in rule e.the only rule e exception at issue here is in rule e c i i,which permits disclosure of grand jury material when so directed by a court preliminarily to or in conjunction with a judicial proceeding.e c i i.
although rule e enumerates the exceptions to the traditional rule of grand jury secrecy,the supreme court and this court have recognized that the district courts have inherent power beyond the literal wording of rule e to disclose grand jury material and that rule e is but declaratory of that authority.pittsburgh plate glass united states,d petition to inspect and copy grand jury materials,cir hereinafter appeal of hastings nonetheless,we also have indicated that courts are not empowered to act outside of rule e in other than exceptional circumstances consonant with the rule policy and spirit.appeal of hastings,at see id.at thus,while district courts have inherent authority to act outside rule e,any inherent disclosure authority is exceedingly narrow and exists only in exceptional circumstances.see id.at concluding that a petition by a judicial investigating committee presents one of the occasions when a district court may act outside the strict boundaries of rule e 
the aisenbergs seek to uphold the grand jury disclosure based both on the district court inherent authority and on the exception in rule e c i i.the guidelines for determining when grand jury secrecy may be broken are well settled and apply in both situations.specifically,parties seeking disclosure must show 
that the material they seek is needed to avoid a possible injustice in another judicial proceeding 
that the need for disclosure is greater than the need for continued secrecy and 
that their request is structured to cover only material so needed.
douglas oil,at.at united kingdom united states,cir united states burke,cir united states elliott,cir appeal of hastings,at.
these same demanding standards apply even after the grand jury has concluded its operations.douglas oil,at.at stating that s uch a showing must be made even when the grand jury whose transcripts are sought has concluded its operations,as it had in dennis united states,d elliott,at same burke,at same.i n considering the effects of disclosure on grand jury proceedings,the courts must consider not only the immediate effects upon a particular grand jury,but also the possible effect upon the functioning of future grand juries.douglas oil,at.at.
further,the burden of demonstrating that the need for disclosure outweighs the need for,and public interest in,secrecy rests upon the private party seeking disclosure.id.at.at united states liuzzo,cir.in order to carry this burden,the party seeking disclosure of grand jury material must show a compelling and particularized need for disclosure.united states procter gamble,d stating that the indispensable secrecy of grand jury proceedings must not be broken except where there is a compelling necessity,and that instances where the need outweighs the countervailing policy must be shown with particularity internal citation omitted united states sells eng g,d stating that,w e have consistently construed rule e c i i to require a strong showing of particularized need for grand jury materials before any disclosure will be permitted united kingdom united states,at cox adm r steel carnegie,cir burke,at elliott,at united states cole,cir in re grand jury proceedings,cir city of fort pierce,cir 
to show a compelling and particularized need,the private party must show circumstances had created certain difficulties peculiar to this case,which could be alleviated by access to specific grand jury materials,without doing disproportionate harm to the salutary purpose of secrecy embodied in the grand jury process.elliott,at quoting liuzzo,at.as we stated in cox,disclosure of grand jury testimony is properly granted where there is a compelling need for such disclosure and such disclosure is required by the ends of justice.cox,at quoting,at.
even when persons requesting disclosure have carried the burden of showing that they have a compelling and particular need for the grand jury material in order to avoid an injustice and that their need for disclosure outweighs the secrecy need,access is limited and covers only those materials actually needed.cox,at disclosure even in these circumstances must be closely confined to the limited portions of the testimony for which there is found to be a particularized need.emphasis in original quoting,at in re subpoena to testify directed to custodian of records,cir stating that e ven when the person requesting such disclosure has shown a particularized need for the materials,access is limited and covers only those materials actually needed liuzzo,at noting that when particularized need is shown,access to grand jury materials must still be discrete and limited,and must be structured to cover only the material needed alterations in original quoting procter gamble,at.at,and douglas oil,at.at.accordingly,a blanket request for all grand jury materials can not be described as the kind of particularized request required for the production of otherwise secret information.united kingdom united states,at.
finally,the district court has substantial discretion in determining whether grand jury materials should be released.douglas oil,at.at see also pittsburgh plate glass,at.at united kingdom united states,at coronado bankatlantic bancorp,cir.we now apply these principles to this case.
grand jury transcripts in aisenbergs case 
at the outset,we note that the district court did not rule on the aisenbergs requests for grand jury transcripts until its attorney fees order of january.by this time,the indictment had been dismissed,the government had conceded that attorney fees were due under the hyde amendment,and the district court had determined the amount of those fees.the district court even acknowledged that it had deferred ruling on the aisenbergs grand jury request until after the fee award was made because liability was conceded and the grand jury discovery was most likely unnecessary.aisenberg,d at.nonetheless,the district court ordered disclosure.we conclude that the district court erred in ordering disclosure of all grand jury transcripts for several reasons 
first,the district court order relies heavily on the fact that hyde amendment attorney fees have been awarded in this case and that public taxpayers must pay them.based on these facts,the district court concluded that the public has a strong interest in inspecting this troubled prosecution through the aisenbergs gaining access to the grand jury materials.aisenberg,d at.although acknowledging the aisenbergs burden to show entitlement to grand jury materials,the district court in effect used its hyde amendment award as the principal means to justify grand jury disclosure.the district court suggested in a footnote that p erhaps an award under the hyde amendment ought to tilt decisively the balance of considerations under rule e to the extent that public disclosure of grand jury proceedings is the presumptive consequence absent some persuasive reason for of all or part of the grand jury transcript.aisenberg,d at.in essence,this shifts the burden to the government in hyde amendment cases to show a compelling and particularized need for of grand jury transcripts,as opposed to the aisenbergs having the burden to show such a need for disclosure.
we decline to carve out new rules for hyde amendment cases.nothing in the hyde amendment itself modifies the above legal standards for discovery of sealed grand jury materials.see gilbert,at addressing failure to introduce exculpatory evidence before the grand jury and stating that n othing in the text or legislative history of the hyde amendment indicates that congress intended to modify the law relating to discovery in criminal cases,to expand the brady doctrine,or to categorize as prosecutorial misconduct actions which clearly were not misconduct under existing law.if anything,the hyde amendment furthers the protection of grand jury secrecy.specifically,the hyde amendment allows the government to defend itself against hyde amendment motions and protect confidential information by submitting certain evidence ex parte,in camera,and under seal,such as the names of confidential informants and evidence of matters occurring before the grand jury.pub,stat,reprinted in,historical and statutory notes see united states truesdale,cir stating that the provision in the hyde amendment for in camera review of evidence was included to enable the government to defend itself against hyde amendment motions and at the same time protect confidential information.
second,to the extent that the district court properly left the burden on the aisenbergs,the district court abused its discretion by failing to follow the and demanding legal standards regarding what the aisenbergs must show to be entitled to secret grand jury material.as outlined above,whether relying on the court inherent authority or rule e c i i,the aisenbergs have the burden to show that the material they seek is needed to avoid a possible injustice in another proceeding that the need for disclosure is greater than the need for continued secrecy and that the aisenbergs request is structured to cover only material so needed.douglas oil,at.at.the aisenbergs did not satisfy any of these three prongs,and the district court erred in not requiring them to do so.
for example,the aisenbergs have not shown a compelling and particularized need for any portions of the grand jury transcripts for their civil lawsuit.instead,the aisenbergs already have a wealth of evidence about the government conduct indeed,the overwhelming nature of this evidence apparently led even the government to move to dismiss the indictment and to concede that attorney fees were owed under the hyde amendment 
third,the district court also erred in concluding that the government interest in grand jury secrecy was minimal in its attorney fees order and constituted no interest in its stay order,and that the government only interest was to avoid a full airing of the episode.aisenberg,d at.although the prior grand jury deliberations are concluded,this case involves an unsolved,serious mysterious disappearance of a old child from a private home with no forced entry.even if the government investigation is,as the district court aptly said,essentially at a standstill,the government still has a substantial interest in keeping the grand jury material secret until this serious crime is solved and while its investigation continues.release of grand jury transcripts will tell the perpetrator precisely what the government has and what it lacks.even if,as the aisenbergs argue,much of this information is already public through other means,release of the sealed grand jury materials will give the perpetrator a virtual roadmap to evade detection and capture.
in addition,future prospective witnesses would be hesitant to come forward and would be less likely to testify fully and frankly,knowing that the prior grand jury testimony about this same missing child has been made public.those witnesses would anticipate that those against whom they testify may similarly later be made aware of their testimony.as the supreme court has explained,in considering the effects of disclosure on grand jury proceedings,the courts must consider not only the immediate effects upon a particular grand jury,but also the possible effect upon the functioning of future grand juries.douglas oil,at.at.the supreme court further instructed that p ersons called upon to testify will consider the likelihood that their testimony may one day be disclosed to outside parties,and because f ear of future retribution or social stigma may act as powerful deterrents to those who would come forward and aid the grand jury in the performance of its duties,the interests in grand jury secrecy,although reduced,are not eliminated merely because the grand jury has ended its activities.id.the government,as well as the public and the aisenbergs,have a strong interest in solving this serious,missing child crime,in future witnesses not being reluctant to testify about this crime before the grand jury,and thus in the secrecy of the grand jury not being broken.the unique circumstances of this case strongly counsel in favor of grand jury secrecy in the interest of solving this serious crime.
fourth,and most importantly,we agree with the district court that the public and the aisenbergs have a strong interest in any bad faith prosecution being fully exposed.we also agree that the insulation of such prosecutions forms no part of the justification for grand jury secrecy.however,the conduct in this prosecution already has been publicly aired at great length not only in extensive hearings before the magistrate judge and district court,but also by the comprehensive orders and reports entered by the magistrate judge,the district court,and the state special prosecutor.those orders and reports exhaustively examine the evidence of the government conduct and elucidate in great detail the troublesome events in this case.further,as recounted above,the aisenbergs already have a wealth of evidence exposing the government conduct in this case.given that the government conduct already has been revealed and publicly aired,the district court erred in concluding that the grand jury transcripts must be disclosed so that the public can know about this misdirected prosecution.the public already knows.
for all these reasons,the district court erred in ordering disclosure of the grand jury transcripts.

some of the facts alleged were that marlene aisenberg sounded hysterical in her initial report,but while her husband spoke to the operator,she spoke calmly to an unknown party on another telephone there was not enough food or diapers in their home to maintain the of a child for one day during the county detectives third interview of marlene aisenberg,she made statements and gestures indicating that she knew the person who took the child and that the child was being taken care of and the county detectives telephonic interview with an fbi special agent regarding a study indicating that in of cases where the last location of a child under age one is the victim home,the child was killed in the home by a caregiver.
the indictment was returned approximately months after sabrina disappearance in late and eighteen months after the termination of the wiretapping in early.
shortly after the indictment,the government moved to disqualify the aisenbergs defense counsel and to compel retention of separate,independent counsel.the government argued that defense counsel had a conflict of interest in representing both aisenbergs.in denying the motion,the magistrate judge stressed,inter alia,that the aisenbergs had made a knowing and intelligent waiver of representation,that the government had not shown that an actual or serious potential conflict existed by the joint representation,that the government had not shown that it was likely that one defendant would testify against the other,and that the prejudice caused by disqualifying defense counsel outweighed the government perceived concerns.the government did not appeal this determination.
in franks,the supreme court held that where a defendant makes a substantial preliminary showing that a false statement knowingly and intentionally,or with reckless disregard for the truth,was included by an affiant in a search warrant affidavit,and if the allegedly false statement was necessary to the finding of probable cause,the fourth amendment requires that a hearing be held at the defendant request to determine admissibility of the fruits of the search.at.at.
although the magistrate judge report was filed on february,the district court later published the magistrate judge report as an attachment to its january,order awarding attorney fees under the hyde amendment.thus,we cite to the now published magistrate judge report.
in addition to over one hundred exhibits,there are ten volumes of transcripts from the franks hearing,which cover pages.
in his report,the magistrate judge described the wiretap application process in great detail and outlined how errors occurred in the wiretap extension applications,in the handwritten summaries of those tapes,and later in the more formal transcripts of those tapes.aisenberg,d at.
during the franks evidentiary hearing,the aisenbergs expert,bruce koenig,testified that all the wiretaps had problems.koenig previously served as the special agent supervisor in the fbi engineering section and received a bachelor of science from the university of maryland and a master degree in forensic science from george washington university,as well as completing graduate level courses at george mason university,university of utah,and massachusetts institute of technology,and electronic courses at devry institute of technology in chicago.according to koenig,the intercept system introduced extraneous sounds such as ringing phones,hissing,and humming this noise directly impacted the ability to understand the recorded speech and distortion,caused by microphones picking up the speakers voices from too great a distance,added to the unintelligibility.the qualifications of the government expert,anthony pellicano,starkly contrasted with koenig.pellicano received his high school equivalency while serving in the military and never obtained advanced schooling.although pellicano stated that he was able to hear the aisenbergs conversations set out in the county detectives applications,koenig,the district court,and the magistrate judge could not.
in addition to filing a motion to suppress,the aisenbergs also filed a motion for an audibility hearing challenging the accuracy of the transcripts of the tapes that the government sought to use at trial.on april,the government requested a delay of the audibility hearing until trial,or alternatively for each party to submit separately prepared transcripts to the jury without any audibility hearing.the government later obtained other delays of the audibility hearing before the district court.although the district court entered a november,order noting that the quality of the audio recordings was generally poor,the actual audibility hearing before the district court never occurred because on february,the magistrate judge recommended that the district court grant the aisenbergs motion to suppress,and the government then dismissed the indictment on february.

as noted in footnote,supra,the district court also published the magistrate judge earlier report,dated february,which likewise made extensive findings about the county detectives misconduct.aisenberg,d at.
in its stay motion,the government stressed that the supreme court has instructed that parties seeking grand jury materials must show that the material they seek is needed to avoid a possible injustice in another judicial proceeding,that the need for disclosure is greater than the need for continued secrecy,and that their request is structured to cover only material so needed.such a showing must be made even when the grand jury whose transcripts are sought has concluded its operations see douglas oil of cal.petrol stops northwest,d united kingdom united states,cir adopting douglas oil standard.the government argued that the aisenbergs had not met these three requirements and that the district court order was not based on an identified particularized need for the transcripts,but rather on an alleged public interest in scrutinizing the activities of a misdirected investigation.
in a january,hearing involving the intervenor media request for the wiretap recordings and other records under seal,the government offered to present information in camera to the district court about its continuing investigation of sabrina disappearance and had witnesses available to do so,but the district court refused to hear the,in the context of the government stay motion,the district court did offer to receive evidence in camera from the government about the viability of its ongoing investigation in order to evaluate whether disclosure would cause irreparable harm.the government submitted a may,affidavit of an assistant united states attorney,assigned to the general crimes section of the criminal division in the middle district of florida,stating that t he investigation is currently active and ongoing,and is being conducted with state and federal law enforcement officers,and disclosure would compromise the ongoing investigation.the government declined to present witnesses or further information in camera at the stay hearing on may.the government asserted that a court evidentiary inquiry into whether a government investigation is viable would constitute an unwarranted judicial intrusion into prosecutorial functions delegated to another branch of government.in this stay context,the government position was that the record both in camera and in the public record already established sufficiently that the crime remained unsolved and that there was an ongoing criminal investigation.
