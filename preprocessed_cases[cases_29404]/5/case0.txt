a as in any statutory construction case,this court proceeds from the understanding that u nless otherwise defined,statutory terms are generally interpreted in accordance with their ordinary meaning.bp america production burton.nothing in either the ncvia attorney fees provision,which ties eligibility to any proceeding on such petition and refers specifically to a petition filed under section,or the referenced suggests that the reason for the subsequent dismissal of a petition,such as its untimeliness,nullifies the initial filing.as the term filed is commonly understood,an application is filed when it is delivered to,and accepted by,the appropriate court officer for placement into the official record.artuz bennett.applying this ordinary meaning to the text at issue,it is clear that an ncvia petition delivered to the court clerk,forwarded for processing,and adjudicated in a proceeding before a special master is a petition filed under section.so long as it was brought in good faith and with a reasonable basis,it is eligible for an award of attorney fees,even if it is ultimately unsuccessful.had congress intended otherwise,it could have easily limited fee awards to timely petitions.
the government argument that the limitations period is a statutory prerequisite for filing lacks textual support.first,there is no to the act limitations provision in its fees provision,e,or the referenced a.second,reading the provision to provide that no petition may be filed for compensation late,as the government asks,would require the court to conclude that a petition like cloer,which was filed under that term ordinary meaning but was later found to be untimely,was never filed at all.this court inquiry ceases where,as here,the statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent.barnhart sigmon coal.
the government contrary position is also inconsistent with the fees provision purpose,which was to avoid limit ing petitioners ability to obtain qualified assistance by making awards available for claims.pt.
b the government two additional lines of argument for barring the award of attorney fees for untimely petitions are unpersuasive.first,the canon of construction favoring strict construction of waivers of sovereign immunity,the presumption favoring the retention of familiar principles,and the policy argument that the ncvia should be construed so as to minimize complex and costly fees litigation must all give way when,as here,the statute words are unambiguous.connecticut nat.bank germain.second,even if the ncvia plain text requires that special masters occasionally carry out shadow trials to determine whether late petitions were brought in good faith and with a reasonable basis,that is not such an absurd burden as to require departure from the words of the act.this is especially true where congress has specifically provided for such shadow trials by permitting the award of attorney fees in any proceeding on an unsuccessful petition if such petition was brought in good faith and with a reasonable basis.e.

justice sotomayor delivered the opinion of the court.
the national childhood vaccine injury act of ncvia or act,stat,et,provides that a court may award attorney fees and costs incurred by a claimant in any proceeding on an unsuccessful petition filed under section,if that petition was brought in good faith and there was a reasonable basis for the claim for which the petition was brought.e.the act limitations provision states that no petition may be filed for compensation more than months after the claimant initial symptoms occur.a.the question before us is whether an untimely petition can garner an award of attorney fees.we agree with a majority of the en banc court of appeals for the federal circuit that it can.
the ncvia establishes a compensation program designed to work faster and with greater ease than the civil tort system.bruesewitz wyeth llc,slip,at quoting shalala whitecotton.congress enacted the ncvia to stabilize the vaccine market and expedite compensation to injured parties after complaints mounted regarding the inefficiencies and costs borne by both injured consumers and vaccine manufacturers under the previous civil tort compensation regime,at slip,at,pt,hereinafter.
the compensation program procedures are straightforward.first,a proceeding for compensation under the program for a injury or death shall be initiated by service upon the secretary for the department of health and human services and the filing of a petition containing the matter prescribed by subsection c of this section with the united states court of federal claims.a.subsection c provides in relevant part that a petition must include an affidavit,and supporting documentation,demonstrating that the person who suffered such injury was actually vaccinated and suffered an injury.c.next,upon receipt of an ncvia petition,t he clerk of the united states court of federal claims shall immediately forward the filed petition to the chief special master for assignment to a special master.a.this special master then makes an informal adjudication of the petition.bruesewitz,at slip,at citing d.a successful claimant may recover medical costs,lost earning capacity,and an award for pain and suffering,a,with compensation paid out from a federal trust fund supported by an excise tax levied on each dose of certain covered vaccines,see,f a.but under the act limitations provision,no petition may be filed for compensation under the program for a injury after the expiration of months after the date of the occurrence of the first symptom or manifestation of onset or of the significant aggravation of the alleged injury.a.
the act also includes an unusual scheme for compensating attorneys who work on ncvia petitions.see e no attorney may charge any fee for services in connection with a petition filed under section of this title.e but a court may award attorney fees in certain circumstances.in the case of successful petitions,the award of attorney fees is automatic.e in awarding compensation on a petition filed under section of this title the special master or court shall also award as part of such compensation an amount to cover reasonable attorneys fees,and other costs for unsuccessful petitions,the special master or court may award an amount of compensation to cover petitioner reasonable attorneys fees and other costs incurred in any proceeding on such petition if the special master or court determines that the petition was brought in good faith and there was a reasonable basis for the claim for which the petition was brought.ibid.in other words,a ttorney fees are provided,not only for successful cases,but even for unsuccessful claims that are not frivolous.bruesewitz,at slip,at.
respondent,melissa cloer,received three immunizations from september to april.shortly after receiving the third vaccine,cloer began to experience numbness and strange sensations in her left forearm and hand.she sought treatment in and,but the diagnoses she received were inconclusive.by then,cloer was experiencing numbness in her face,arms,and legs,and she had difficulty walking.she intermittently suffered these symptoms until,when she began to experience the full manifestations of,and was eventually diagnosed with,multiple sclerosis ms.in,cloer became aware of a link between ms and the vaccine,and in september,she filed a claim for compensation under the ncvia,alleging that the vaccinations she received had caused or exacerbated her 
cloer petition was sent by the clerk of the court of federal claims to the chief special master,who went on to adjudicate it.after reviewing the petition and its supporting documentation,the chief special master concluded that cloer claim was untimely because the act limitations period began to run when she first experienced the symptoms of ms in.cloer secretary of of health and human,wl,fed,may,opinion of golkiewicz,chief special master citing a ncvia limitations provision.relying on federal circuit precedent,the chief special master also rejected cloer argument that the ncvia limitations period should be subject to equitable tolling,at citing brice secretary of health and human.a divided panel of the federal circuit reversed the chief special master,concluding that the ncvia limitations period did not commence until the medical community at large objectively recognize d a link between the vaccine and the injury.cloer secretary of health and human.
the en banc court then reversed the panel decision,cloer secretary of health and human,cert.denied,and held that the statute limitations period begins to run on the calendar date of the occurrence of the first medically recognized symptom or manifestation of onset of the injury claimed by the petitioner.at.the court of appeals also held that the act limitations provision was nonjurisdictional and subject to equitable tolling in limited circumstances,overruling its prior holding in brice,at.the court concluded,however,that cloer was ineligible for tolling and that her petition was untimely,at.
following this decision,cloer moved for an award of attorney fees.the en banc federal circuit agreed with her that a person who files an untimely ncvia petition assert ing a reasonable limitations argument may recover fees and costs so long as the petition was brought in good faith and there was a reasonable basis for the claim for which the petition was brought.quoting e.six judges disagreed with this conclusion and instead read the ncvia to bar such awards for untimely petitions,at bryson,dissenting.we granted the government petition for writ of certiorari.we now affirm.
as in any statutory construction case,w e start,of course,with the statutory text,and proceed from the understanding that u nless otherwise defined,statutory terms are generally interpreted in accordance with their ordinary meaning.bp america production burton.the act fees provision ties eligibility for attorney fees broadly to any proceeding on such petition,referring specifically to a petition filed under section.e.section provides that a proceeding for compensation is initiated by service upon the secretary and the filing of a petition containing certain documentation with the clerk of the court of federal claims who then immediately forward s the filed petition for assignment to a special master.a.see supra,at.
nothing in these two provisions suggests that the reason for the subsequent dismissal of a petition,such as its untimeliness,nullifies the initial filing of that petition.we have explained that a n application is filed,as that term is commonly understood,when it is delivered to,and accepted by,the appropriate court officer for placement into the official record.artuz bennett.when this ordinary meaning is applied to the text of the statute,it is clear that an ncvia petition which is delivered to the clerk of the court,forwarded for processing,and adjudicated in a proceeding before a special master is a petition filed under section.e.and so long as such a petition was brought in good faith and with a reasonable basis,it is eligible for an award of attorney fees,even if it is ultimately unsuccessful.ibid.if congress had intended to limit fee awards to timely petitions,it could easily have done so.but the ncvia instead authorizes courts to award attorney fees for those unsuccessful petitions brought in good faith and for which there was a reasonable basis.ibid 
the government argues that the act limitations provision,which states that no petition may be filed for compensation months after a claimant initial symptoms began,a,constitutes a statutory prerequisite to the filing of a petition for compensation under the program,brief for petitioner.thus,the government contends,a petition that fails to comply with these time limits is not a petition filed under section and is therefore ineligible for fees under e.see,at bryson,dissenting.
the government argument lacks textual support.first,as noted,there is no to the act limitations provision in its fees provision,e,or the other section it references,a.when these two linked sections are read in tandem they simply indicate that petitions filed with the clerk of the court are eligible for attorney fees so long as they comply with the other requirements of the act fees provision.by its terms,the ncvia requires nothing more for the award of attorney fees.a petition filed in violation of the limitations period will not result in the payment of compensation,of course,but it is still a petition filed under a 
when the act does require compliance with the limitations period,it provides so expressly.for example,a a prevents claimants from bringing suit against vaccine manufacturers unless a petition has been filed,in accordance with section of this title the limitations provision,for compensation under the program for such injury or death.emphasis added.we have long held that w here congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.bates united states,internal quotation marks omitted.the absence of any to the limitations provision in either the fees provision,e,or the instructions for initiating a compensation proceeding,a,indicates that a petition can be filed without being in accordance with the limitations provision.tellingly,nothing in a requires a petitioner to allege or demonstrate the timeliness of his or her petition to initiate such a proceeding 
second,to adopt the government position,we would have to conclude that a petition like cloer,which was filed under the ordinary meaning of that term but was later found to be untimely,was never filed at all because,on the government reading,no petition may be filed for compensation late.a emphasis added.yet the court bel
