lenard barber,who is half african american and half native american,filed suit in state court against his employer williamson,williamson,claiming that the company had discriminated against him in violation of title vii and oklahoma public policy.williamson subsequently had the case removed to federal court,and soon thereafter the district court transferred the case,with the consent of the parties,to a magistrate judge for final disposition.eventually,the case was tried before a jury but on the title vii claims only.the jury found for barber on the hostile work environment claim but concluded that he failed to prove the discriminatory termination and retaliatory discharge claims.it awarded barber nominal damages in the amount of one dollar.subsequently,the magistrate judge awarded attorney fees to barber and costs to both parties.on appeal,williamson challenges the award of nominal damages as well as the award of attorney fees.barber on the award of costs.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand.
background 
at trial,barber presented three title vii claims for the jury consideration hostile work environment,discriminatory termination,and retaliatory discharge.because the focus of this appeal is the hostile work environment claim,we need not recount in detail the facts that gave rise to the latter two claims except to note that barber was fired on june,after a complained that barber had violated a safety code.according to barber,his termination was discriminatory because a white employee,who had allegedly committed a similar infraction,had not been fired.barber also asserted that his discharge was retaliatory because,prior to being fired,he had complained of racial discrimination to management.
as for barber claim of hostile work environment,there was testimony at trial that referred to him as nigger and watermelon boy that a approached barber wearing a hat that resembled a ku klux klan hood that a showed barber a drawing and told him that it depicted a nigger at the bottom of a well with four ku klux klan members looking down and that one employee said to another that people are in general lazy and uneducated but that barber was an exception to the rule.in addition,there was testimony that barber was placed on extended probation while similarly situated white employees were not criticized for complaining about a white employee who had stolen his work threatened by a white employee with a swastika tattoo chastised for attendance problems even though a white employee record on attendance was worse and denied permission by a white employee to receive a phone call.finally,there was testimony that barber reported some of the incidents to management but that he was reprimanded for having complained and that no or limited action was taken by management.at one point,management did respond by providing a racial diversity training class,but there was evidence that the harassment did not thereafter cease.
ii.procedure 
after hearing the evidence,the jury found for barber on the hostile work environment claim but concluded that he failed to prove the remaining two claims.it then found that,even though the law was violated by williamson,barber suffered no damages,and so awarded nominal damages only in the amount of one dollar.aplt app.at verdict form,filed.
a week later,williamson moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b on three grounds barber had not presented sufficient evidence for his hostile work environment claim barber had not timely filed his title vii claims and nominal damages can not be granted under title vii.the magistrate judge ruled against williamson on all three issues.subsequently,barber moved for an award of attorney fees,which the magistrate judge granted.several weeks later,the magistrate judge determined the actual amount of attorney fees to be awarded and,after calculating that number,addressed the issue of costs.both barber and williamson had requested costs,and the magistrate judge decided that an award of costs to both was appropriate.aplt app.at magistrate judge order,filed.williamson thereafter filed a notice of appeal,challenging both the nominal damages award and the award of attorney fees.barber on the issue of costs.
iii.williamson appeal,
in his brief,barber initially argued that williamson appeal was not timely filed.subsequently,barber filed a motion with this court,asking that his objection to the timeliness of the appeal be dismissed.we grant barber motion and therefore proceed to the merits of the appeal.
nominal damages under title vii 
availability of nominal damages 
williamson argues first that the magistrate judge erred in permitting the jury to award nominal damages because,under title vii,nominal damages can not be granted.the company points out that,prior to the civil rights act of,it was clear that nominal damages could not be awarded under title vii.see griffith state of.div.of youth,cir discussing title vii prior to its amendment in holding that nominal damages are compensatory in nature and since title vii provides for equitable,not legal relief,nominal damages must not be awarded under title vii.it then concedes that the civil rights act of made legal remedies available but contends that these remedies were limited to certain specified types of compensatory and punitive damages.aplt br.at.
as a preliminary matter,we note that the verdict form provided to the jury contained the following entry under compensatory damages if you find that the law was violated but that plaintiff suffered no damages,you may award a nominal amount of.aplt app.at verdict form,filed.if williamson believed that nominal damages were not appropriate under title vii,it should have objected to this instruction before it was tendered to the jury.see.no party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless that party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict,stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.according to williamson,it did,see aplt reply br.at it is the distinct recollection of counsel for williamson that an objection on the record was made at the conference on instructions,but nothing in the record before us demonstrates such.see cir.c b noting that b riefs must cite the precise reference in the record where a required objection was made and ruled on,if the appeal is based on the giving of or refusal to give a particular jury instruction cir.a the appellant must provide all portions of the transcript necessary to give the court a complete and accurate record of the proceedings related to the issues on appeal.because,so far as the record indicates,williamson made no objection to the jury instruction,we simply review for plain error.see giron corrections of,cir.
williamson suggests,however,that even if it did fail to object to the jury instruction it raised the issue of nominal damages later in its motion for judgment as a matter of law,and so a de novo standard of review is warranted.see thompson united states,cir noting that a de novo standard of review applies to the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law.while we recognize williamson rule b motion,we are not satisfied that it served to preserve the issue of nominal damages for de novo appellate review.city of louis praprotnik,d,on which williamson relies,is not availing because,in that case,the petitioner successfully preserved the issue by raising it in two motions filed before the jury retired to deliberate,not after.see id.at.noting that the petitioner failure to object to the jury instruction was not problematic because the petitioner had raised the issue in a motion for summary judgment and in a motion for directed verdict.more to the point is noel,cir,in which this court held that,when a litigant fails to raise an issue below in a timely fashion and the court below does not address the merits of the issue,the litigant has not preserved the issue for appellate review.id.at.
because plain error is the applicable standard of review and not de novo,w e will only reverse in an exceptional where the error was patently plainly erroneous and prejudicial,giron,at internal quotation marks omitted,and fundamental injustice would otherwise occur.cadena pacesetter,cir.we conclude that williamson has failed to demonstrate patent plain error and prejudice,let alone fundamental injustice.the company cites no case law in support of its argument that nominal damages are not available under title vii,and it fails to explain the numerous title vii cases both within this circuit and beyond in which nominal damages have been awarded.see,brandau kansas,cir noting that the title vii plaintiff was awarded nominal damages bristow drake street,cir noting the same parton gte north,cir noting that i t is the law of this circuit that nominal damages are appropriately awarded where a title vii violation is proved even though no actual damages are shown.williamson has wasted this court time with a specious argument.
harm suffered by barber 
williamson argues next that an award of nominal damages demonstrates that barber suffered no harm and,if barber suffered no harm,then he failed to prove a hostile work environment.see aplt br.at contending that,a s a matter of law,an award of nominal damages is inconsistent with the definition of actionable harassment.to state it simply,instead of arguing that nominal damages can not be awarded under title vii,williamson is asserting that there can be no title vii violation if nominal damages are awarded.we review this legal question de novo.see ferguson constr,cir.
once again,we find williamson argument to be without merit.first,nominal damages do not signify a total absence of harm.see black law dictionary ed defining nominal damages as a trifling sum awarded when a legal injury is suffered but when there is no substantial loss or injury to be compensated see also griffith,at noting that nominal damages signify that the plaintiff rights were technically invaded even though he could not prove any loss or damage.second,given the verdict form,the jury did find injury to barber,answering yes to the following question do you find,from the viewpoint of a reasonable person,that the alleged actions toward lenard barber while he was employed by williamson,were so severe and pervasive as to create a hostile or abusive work environment based upon his race aplt app.at verdict form,filed,see also id.at jury awarding barber one dollar in nominal damages because it found that the law was violated but that plaintiff suffered no damages.to summarize,we conclude that nominal damages are appropriate under title vii and that,in the instant case,barber was entitled to an award of nominal damages based on the jury finding that he was subjected to a hostile or abusive work environment.
attorney fees 
williamson final argument is that,even if a nominal damages award was proper,barber should not have been granted attorney fees.we review de novo the magistrate judge legal analysis underpinning the award of attorney fees but otherwise review the fee award for an abuse of discretion.see brandau,at noting that there is an abuse of discretion if this court has a definite and firm conviction that the district court made a clear error of judgment or exceeded the bounds of permissible choice in the circumstances internal quotation marks omitted.
farrar hobby 
after the jury rendered its verdict,barber asked that the magistrate judge grant him attorney fees pursuant to k.see k t he court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney fee including expert fees as part of the costs.williamson objected,arguing that barber was not entitled to a fee award because the jury had awarded him nominal damages only and,under farrar hobby,d,w hen a plaintiff recovers only nominal damages,the only reasonable attorney fee is usually no fee at all.id.at.in his order,the magistrate judge considered williamson objection but rejected it in light of several tenth circuit cases that interpreted farrar,including gudenkauf stauffer communications,cir,and brandau kansas,at.based on these cases,the magistrate judge concluded that an award of attorney fees was justified.on appeal,williamson argues that gudenkauf and brandau are at odds with farrar and so barber should have been denied attorney fees altogether.aplt br.at.
to the extent williamson contends that gudenkauf and brandau are at odds with farrar because they misinterpreted it,we reject the argument.even if the argument had any merit,it is well established that one panel can not overrule the judgment of another panel of this court absent en banc reconsideration or a superseding contrary decision by the supreme court.in re smith,cir per curiam.of course,while we lack the authority to overrule gudenkauf and brandau,it is within our authority to clarify the cases,especially if the magistrate judge misread or misapplied them.because the magistrate judge did not altogether interpret these cases correctly,we provide clarification and remand so that the magistrate judge or the district court may reconsider the issue of attorney fees.
in farrar,the supreme court held that,w hen a plaintiff recovers only nominal damages because of his failure to prove an essential element of his claim for monetary relief such as actual,compensable injury,the only reasonable attorney fee is usually no fee at all.farrar,at.notably,justice joined the opinion of the majority but also authored a special concurrence.in her concurrence,she agreed with the conclusion of the majority that,w hen the plaintiff success is purely technical or de minimis,no fees can be awarded.id.at,concurring.however,she explained that not all nominal damages awards are in fact de minimis as she put it,n ominal relief does not necessarily a nominal victory make.id.at,concurring see also id.at.white,dissenting noting that the majority did not hold that recovery of nominal damages never can support the award of attorney fees.as to what makes a victory nominal or otherwise,the t he difference between the amount recovered and the damages sought to be a relevant consideration.id.at,concurring.but,unlike the majority,she also identified two other factors of import first,the significance of the legal issue on which the plaintiff claims to have prevailed and,second,the accomplishment of some public goal other than occupying the time and energy of counsel,court,and client.id.at,concurring.
in the instant case,the magistrate determining whether to award attorney fees to that he would be guided by two things the general rule that attorneys fees are awarded to prevailing parties absent special circumstances which would make such an award unjust,aplt app.at magistrate judge order,filed,and the analysis identified by justice in her special concurrence.in looking to both,the magistrate judge properly followed this court precedent.see,brandau,at recognizing the general rule and applying the three factors.however,we caution that the former should not be unduly emphasized to the detriment of the latter.
in gudenkauf,though a mixed motive case,this court specified the proper approach under the generally applicable approach to a fee request by a civil rights plaintiff,a court must first assess whether special circumstances would make any award unjust upon determining that the award of a fee is proper,the court must then fix a reasonable fee,gudenkauf,at emphasis added and,in certain circumstances,a reasonable fee could be zero.see farrar,at.when a plaintiff recovers only nominal damages because of his failure to prove an essential element of his claim for monetary relief such as actual,compensable injury,the only reasonable fee is usually no fee at all.of course,this statement in gudenkauf is somewhat tempered by justice statement in farrar that,w hile that exception to fee awards has often been articulated separately from the reasonableness inquiry,sometimes it is bound up with reasonableness w here the only reasonable fee is no fee,an award of fees would be unjust conversely,where a fee award would be unjust,the reasonable fee is no fee at all.farrar,at,concurring.
as to what constitutes a reasonable fee,this court looks,as noted above,to the factors.several of our sister circuits also look to the factors for guidance the first,t he difference between the amount sought and the damages recovered,id.at,concurring does not require much explanation.suffice it to say,the difference in farrar,million to after ten years of litigation including two appeals to the fifth circuit,indicated that the litigation accomplished little beyond giving the plaintiffs the moral satisfaction of knowing that a federal court concluded that their rights had been violated in some unspecified way.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.
the second,the significance of the legal issue on which the plaintiff claims to have prevailed,id.at,concurring has received different treatment in different courts.some courts appear to have equated significance of the legal issue with importance of the legal issue.see maul constan,cir w e understand the second farrar factor to address the legal import of the constitutional claim on which plaintiff prevailed.see also milton city of des moines,cir noting that the civil right the plaintiff sought to vindicate in his excessive force claim was a significant issue contrary to the issue in farrar piper oliver,cir noting that the plaintiff right to be free from illegal detention was a significant one jones lockhart,cir noting that vindication of the constitutional right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment is a significant legal issue in contrast to the injury to a business interest alleged in farrar richard city of harahan,d,noting that the plaintiff prevailed on a significant substantive fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures lucas guyton,noting that the plaintiff prevailed on a significant legal,the right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.notably,the magistrate judge in the instant case seems to have construed significance of the legal issue in this way.see aplt app.at magistrate judge order,filed,certainly prevailing on a hostile work environment claim,in the abstract,is a significant legal issue.
this court,however,has not understood significance of the legal issue to mean importance of the legal issue a sensible position as otherwise there would be little difference between the second and third factors.in this circuit,t he second factor goes beyond the actual relief awarded which is the focus of the first factor to examine the extent to which the plaintiff succeeded on his theory of liability.phelps,at emphasis added see also brandau,at affirming the district court decision that the plaintiff succeeded on a significant legal issue because,although she lost her retaliation and constructive discharge claims,she prevailed on her primary claim of sexual harassment.that the second factor focuses on the extent of success as opposed to the importance of the legal issue is supported by justice application of the second factor in farrar.she stated in her concurrence that 
the plaintiff can not be said to have achieved a true victory.respondent was just one of six defendants and the only one not found to have engaged in a conspiracy.if recovering one dollar from the least culpable defendant and nothing from the rest legitimately can be labeled a i doubt that it it is a hollow one.the plaintiff may have won a point,but the game,set,and match all went to the defendants.
farrar,at,concurring.
as for the third,the accomplishment of a public goal other than occupying the time and energy of counsel,court,and client,id.at,concurring again,there has been different treatment in different courts.some courts appear to read the factor restrictively.see pino locascio,cir noting that not every tangential ramification of civil rights litigation ipso facto confers a benefit on society see also id.concluding that a public purpose was served in cabrera,at,but only because the plaintiff in that case prevailed on a novel issue of law emphasis added maul,at concluding that a public purpose was not served because the p laintiff brought suit only on his own behalf,alleging only violations of his own rights and seeking redress for his injuries only.
other courts,however,have looked at the third factor in more generous terms,concluding that a public goal is accomplished if the plaintiff victory encourages attorneys to represent civil rights litigants,affirms an important right,puts the defendant on notice that it needs to improve,provokes a change in the defendant conduct.see,at noting that the plaintiff victory was not de minimis because,among other things,it provided an incentive to attorneys to represent civil rights litigants such as the plaintiff and it served as a deterrent to future abuses muhammad lockhart,cir stating that the verdict in favor of the plaintiff accomplished a public goal,namely,encouraging governments scrupulously to perform their constitutional duties piper,at stating that a public goal had been served by the plaintiff victory in encouraging the defendants to refashion their forfeiture procedures to avoid future illegality wilcox reno,cir concluding that a public purpose would be served if the plaintiff suit achieved tangible as sparking a change in policy or establishing a finding of fact with potential collateral estoppel effects jones,at noting that in general civil rights litigation serves an important public purpose because a plaintiff bringing a civil rights action does so not for himself alone but also as a private attorney general,vindicating a policy that congress considered of the highest priority internal quotation marks omitted cartwright,at noting that a public purpose is more likely served t he more important the right at stake and the more egregious the violation also suggesting that a public purpose would be served if the plaintiff victory had external benefits or a future deterrent effect internal quotation marks omitted lucas.at concluding that a public purpose was served based on the private attorney general theory.
in this circuit,the broader approach has been adopted,as evidenced by koopman water district of johnson county,kansas,cir,and brandau kansas,at.in koopman,this court discussed the third factor and noted that,
in farrar,the plaintiff suit could not fairly be said to have any prospect of benefitting anyone other than himself.here,koopman victory,like farrar,did little for him personally,but in sharp contrast to farrar,had significant implications in establishing basic rights for public employees holding a similar property interest.
id.at see also id.although it is true koopman received only a nominal award,the present and future employees of the defendant benefit by having their rights affirmed.in brandau,this court reiterated what it had said in koopman 
although the jury verdict in this case did not order the defendant to change its policies,according to koopman,circuit precedent does not require the judgment to order a policy change.nor does precedent require the legal victory to be novel to constitute a significant degree of success.
instead,koopman instructs us that what is controlling is plaintiff vindication of her civil rights and of important rights of her 
brandau,at 
we caution,however,that even as this court has adopted the broader approach the third factor should not be construed too liberally.for guidance,we look to justice application of the third factor in farrar.there,she noted that the attorney fee provision ensures the vindication of important rights,even when large sums of money are not at stake,by making attorney fees available under a private attorney general theory.farrar,at,concurring.she then suggested that in farrar,a deprivation of liberty and property interest case,no important right had been vindicated because it was not even clear what kind of lawless conduct might be prevented.id.the judgment can not deter misconduct any more than a bolt of lightning can its results might be devastating,but it teaches no valuable lesson because it carries no discernible meaning.
to conclude,we remand the instant case to the magistrate judge or the district court so that he may reconsider the award of attorney fees in light of this specifically,our clarification of the second factor.we emphasize that our remand s
