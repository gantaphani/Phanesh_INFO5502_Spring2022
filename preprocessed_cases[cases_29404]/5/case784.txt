backgrounda.facts 
bowles,who holds a in chemistry,was employed by quantum or one of its predecessors from june until the time he left his position on september.at the time he terminated his employment,bowles was serving as quantum director of polyolefins research and technology acquisition,which was a management position.
at trial,bowles testified as to the nature of his job prior to september.according to bowles,he was responsible for planning,organizing,and supervising the major polyolefins research projects at quantum.approximately people reported to him,roughly half of whom were degreed professionals.bowles reported directly to michael baldwin,the vice president of research and development,who in turn reported directly to ronald yocum,quantum president.the total corporate research budget was approximately million,and approximately million of that was allocated to bowles department.bowles had a particular interest in the q technology project,the purpose of which was to find ways of making quantum less dependent on its competitors technology.he had spent anywhere between twenty and fifty percent of his time on that project since its inception in the early.
as a manager,bowles was eligible for certain bonuses and benefits.pursuant to its senior manager performance plan the smpp,quantum gave annual incentive bonuses to certain employees if the company and the employee met or exceeded business goals.these bonuses were a certain percentage of the employee base salary.bowles was slated to receive target bonuses in and,and,although the testimony on this point was conflicting,it appears that those bonuses should have been thirty percent of his base salary.although quantum did not pay out target bonuses in,bowles received a target bonus of in.
additionally,bowles was eligible to participate in quantum incentive award deferral plan the deferral plan.the deferral plan allowed bowles to invest all or part of the bonuses he received in the company general fund.the money earned interest at a favorable rate,and bowles did not have to pay taxes on it until the funds were paid out to him at a time he specified,presumably during his retirement when he would be in a lower tax bracket.the deferral plan contained a provision that required the company to pay out any and all funds in the plan thirty days after a change in control.this provision was designed to ensure that employees who had invested in the fund would not lose their money if the corporation became insolvent following a takeover.during the course of his employment at quantum,bowles invested approximately in the deferral plan.
in the early,quantum began experiencing serious financial difficulties.quantum senior management actively sought out another entity that could help quantum get its financial affairs back on track.at the same time,the company revised its severance plan to protect certain key managers from the effects of an actual or possible change in control,pl.ex at.under the revised severance plan,an employee who suffered a loss of his or her employment within one year following a change in control was entitled to receive severance benefits.id.as is relevant here,there were two circumstances in which an employee could initiate the termination of his employment and still receive severance benefits for having suffered a loss of employment.first,an employee would receive benefits if he resigned following a diminution of his authority,duties,responsibilities or status the diminution trigger.id.at.alternatively,the employee would receive severance benefits if he resigned following the acquiring company 
failure to provide him with the opportunity to participate,on terms no less favorable than those existing immediately prior to the change in control,in any incentive bonus,savings,pension or other employee benefit plan of quantum in effect immediately prior to the change in control or plans and benefits which are,in the aggregate,no less favorable to him than those in effect six months prior to the change in control the trigger.
id.the occurrence of either trigger was sufficient for an employee to receive benefits under the severance plan.
an employee entitled to receive benefits under the severance plan also was entitled to receive an annual incentive bonus award.the drafter of the severance plan,william carmean,testified by deposition that the purpose of this bonus provision was to ensure that an employee who had earned a bonus prior to a change in control still would be paid that bonus following the change in control.the relevant provision of the severance plan provides 
each eligible employee who becomes entitled to benefits under the plan shall be paid an annual incentive bonus award,as described below,with respect to each year or portion thereof during the period beginning the first full year preceding a change in control and ending on the date such employee loses his or her employment.the annual incentive bonus award with respect to such year or portion thereof shall be the greater of a the amount of any such award actually granted to such employee with respect to such period,and b the amount of the award,if any,that would have been granted to such employee with respect to such period under the senior manager performance plan as such plan was in effect with respect to bonuses granted for the full year preceding the initial year the prior year and based upon such employee target bonus for the prior year 
id.at.lastly,the severance plan provided that quantum shall also pay all legal fees and expenses incurred by an eligible employee as a result of such employee seeking to obtain or enforce any right or benefit under the plan.id.at.
on september,quantum was acquired by hanson.this acquisition constituted a change in control that triggered quantum obligation to pay severance benefits,provided that the employee also suffered a loss of employment within the meaning of the severance plan.bowles testified at trial that,in his opinion,hanson acquisition of quantum significantly diminished his authority,duties,responsibilities,and status.bowles believed that the most significant change in his job following the acquisition was the termination of the q technology project.according to bowles,the company decision to discontinue the q technology project b asically gutted his job.it ripped the heart out of it.at.bowles perceived the termination of the project as an indication that the company no longer was going to pursue researching and developing its own technology.not only did bowles believe that this decision signified a decline in the importance of independent research to the company,he thought it was detrimental to the company future.
bowles also explained that,in his view,the restructuring inserted an extra layer of management between himself and the company president.bowles direct superior,baldwin,who used to report directly to president yocum,now reported to gene allspach,the vice president of manufacturing and technology.according to bowles,this change in the hierarchy detrimentally affected his own position because allspach,unlike baldwin,did not have a research background.consequently,bowles had to spend a significant amount of time educating allspach about research,whereas that process was unnecessary when baldwin could go straight to yocum on bowles behalf.
bowles also described other deleterious changes to his job,such as a lower research budget,lower expenditure authorizations for him and his subordinates,and the loss of approximately twenty people in his department,five of whom were degreed professionals who performed important research functions within the department.four additional employees who were responsible for process modeling were transferred out of the research and development department into the engineering department.according to bowles,these four employees maintained the computers his department needed for data acquisition in addition to their work.as a result of their transfer,bowles department was left without anyone who could maintain its computers on an emergency basis,which hindered the advancement of the department research and data acquisition.
in addition to these changes to his daily responsibilities,bowles lost the opportunity to participate in the deferral plan,which he believed entitled him to severance benefits under the trigger.pursuant to its terms,the deferral plan had paid out its funds,including those bowles had invested,approximately thirty days after the change in control.because the funds were distributed,bowles had to pay taxes on them,and his tax liability was approximately.prior to the time bowles terminated his employment,quantum did not implement a substitute program that allowed employees to shelter their bonuses the way the deferral plan had allowed them to do hanson did,however,introduce new employee benefits that previously were unavailable.for instance,it increased the company k contributions,increased employees travel and accident insurance,and added new employee discounts on a range of hanson products.
an additional benefit hanson implemented following the change in control was a supplemental bonus program that granted certain employees bonuses over and above the target bonuses they received under the smpp.according to myra perkinson,quantum vice president of human resources and communications,hanson added the supplemental bonus plan to continue the momentum of the company success.at.bowles earned a bonus for under this supplemental bonus plan however,bowles never was paid this bonus.perkinson explained that employees had to be employed by the company at the time of payout to receive the supplemental bonus,and employees who were eligible for severance benefits could not receive a supplemental bonus.nevertheless,bowles believed that,because the annual incentive bonus provision of the severance plan was designed to protect any bonus an employee had earned,he was entitled to receive his supplemental bonus under the plan.
bowles informed quantum management that he was terminating his employment and that he felt he was entitled to severance benefits.perkinson,who was responsible for administering the severance plan and determining whether bowles was entitled to severance benefits,consulted baldwin about the scope of the changes to bowles job following the change in control.perkinson and baldwin analysis of whether bowles job was diminished appears to have employed the hay methodology,which quantum used to evaluate the size of its employees jobs.that methodology determined the size of a job by focusing on the know how required to do the job,the problem solving associated with the job,and the job accountability.at.according to the trial testimony,the most significant factor in rating research positions under the hay methodology was the job know how,and neither perkinson nor baldwin believed that this element of bowles job was affected by hanson acquisition of quantum.thus,perkinson,together with yocum and quantum senior counsel,concluded that bowles authority,duties,responsibilities,and status had not been diminished following the change in control.
in addition,quantum did not believe that bowles was denied the opportunity to participate in an employee benefit program under the trigger simply because the deferral plan had paid out its funds.quantum viewed the payout as the fulfillment of the deferral plan rather than as its termination.quantum also believed that,in the aggregate,the benefits available to bowles had increased,which prevented the application of the trigger.for these reasons,quantum determined that bowles was not entitled to severance benefits.bowles then sued to enforce the terms of the severance plan.
b.earlier proceedings 
after holding a bench trial,the district court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law.the court first concluded that the severance plan was an employee benefit plan covered by the employee retirement income security act erisa,et,because it required ongoing,administration by persons exercising their judgment under standards not capable of mechanical application.at.then,the court found specifically that bowles authority,duties,responsibilities,and status were diminished within the year following the change in control.the court referred to the following facts as support for its conclusion the budgets for the research department in general and for the polyolefins research group in particular were reduced by amounts the q technology project,which took up at least twenty percent of bowles time,was terminated bowles authority to approve expenditures was reduced substantially,as was the authority of the persons reporting to him,which required bowles to monitor more closely the expenditures of others an extra layer of management was added between bowles and quantum president several people who worked for bowles left the company and were not replaced and bowles supervisory position with respect to process modeling was eliminated.
the district court recognized that there was conflicting testimony regarding whether bowles authority,duties,responsibilities,and status were diminished however,the court found the testimony of bowles to be credible because he knew the most about what happened to his job after the change in control and appeared candid.id.at.the court explained further that its findings were based on the totality of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses.id.because the court determined that bowles authority,duties,responsibilities,and status had been diminished in the year following the change in control,it held that bowles was entitled to severance benefits under the diminution trigger.it calculated the amount of the benefits owed to bowles as 
although the court finding that bowles was entitled to benefits under the diminution trigger was sufficient to support its award of severance benefits to bowles,the court went on to address whether bowles also was entitled to benefits under the trigger.in the district court view,an employee was entitled to benefits under the trigger if he lost the opportunity to participate in a benefit plan,unless the benefits he retained were as favorable in the aggregate as the benefits that were available to him six months prior to the change in control.the district court did not believe that bowles had demonstrated that the benefits he retained following the change in control were less favorable in the aggregate than those available to him six months prior to the change in control.thus,the court held that bowles was not entitled to severance benefits under the trigger.
the court then held that bowles was not entitled to a supplemental bonus.the court found it persuasive that the only bonus mentioned in the severance plan was the annual incentive bonus award,which the court did not believe could be read to include the supplemental bonus.the court noted that,although bowles had tried to show through extrinsic evidence that the supplemental bonus was part of the same program as the annual incentive bonus award explicitly mentioned in the severance plan,he had not met his burden of proof on this issue.consequently,the court declined to award bowles the supplemental bonus he had earned in.
lastly,in accordance with the attorneys fee provision in the severance plan,the court awarded bowles his attorneys fees.bowles had signed a contingent fee agreement with his attorney,under which bowles agreed to pay his attorney of everything he was awarded.the district court awarded bowles in attorneys fees,which is slightly less than of the amount of the severance benefits it awarded him.the court also awarded bowles prejudgment interest in the amount of.
discussion 
quantum appeals the district court award of severance benefits,attorneys fees,and prejudgment interest to bowles.bowles the district court determination that he was not entitled to a supplemental bonus he also argues that he was entitled to receive of the amount of the prejudgment interest award as additional attorneys fees.
following a bench trial,we review de novo a district court conclusions of law.see nrc amoco oil,cir.however,we afford great deference to the trial court findings of fact,and we shall reverse only if those findings are clearly erroneous.see id.a finding is clearly erroneous when the reviewing court is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.central states,southeast southwest areas pension fund kroger,cir quoting united states gypsum,cert.denied,d.if the district court account of the facts is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety,we may not reverse that decision even if we may have decided the case differently.id.furthermore,any reasonable doubts we may harbor should be resolved in favor of the district court ruling in light of its greater immersion in the case.id.quoting cook city of chicago,cir.with these standards in mind,we turn to the merits of the parties claims.
applicability of erisa 
the parties dispute whether the severance plan is covered by erisa.quantum argues that erisa applies because the terms of the severance plan require quantum to maintain an ongoing administrative scheme.bowles,on the other hand,argues that erisa does not apply because the application of the severance plan does not require the exercise of discretion instead,the severance plan provides for a,lump sum payment upon the occurrence of a specified event the district court accepted quantum argument and applied erisa.we agree with the district court conclusion.
erisa will preempt a state law breach of contract claim if the claim requires the court to interpret or to apply the terms of an employee benefit plan.see collins ralston purina,cir.an employee benefit plan can include severance payments.see b fort halifax packing coyne,d.the decisive inquiry in determining whether a severance plan falls within erisa coverage is whether the plan requires an ongoing administrative program to meet the employer obligation.see fort halifax,at.collins,at.erisa applies when a severance plan potentially places periodic demands on an employer assets that create a need for financial coordination and control.fort halifax,at.see also collins,at.in contrast,t he requirement of a,payment triggered by a single event requires no administrative scheme whatsoever to meet the employer obligation,and erisa therefore does not apply.fort halifax,at.
we previously considered a severance plan very similar to the plan involved in this case and concluded that erisa ought to apply.see collins,at.in collins,we found it persuasive that the employer could not satisfy its obligation by cutting a single check and making a single set of payments to all of its managers covered by the plan at once.id.at emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted.instead,the employer was faced with a period in which it had to budget for the prospect of multiple payments to various managers,at different times and under different circumstances.id.at emphasis omitted.additionally,the plan required the employer to consider each manager job responsibilities individually to determine whether those responsibilities had been reduced substantially.see id.at.we concluded that,because the plan required the employer to make nonclerical judgment calls on multiple occasions,an ongoing administrative scheme existed that brought the plan within erisa coverage.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
we do not believe that quantum severance plan is materially different than the plan we considered in collins.although the record does not reveal the exact number of quantum employees covered by the severance plan,it is clear that others in addition to bowles were covered.the covered employees had a period in which they could make a demand for severance benefits,which required quantum to budget for the possibility of making multiple payments throughout the course of that year.perkinson also testified that,if quantum believed that its obligation to pay severance benefits to a particular employee had been triggered within the year following the change in control,quantum would notify that employee of his right to claim benefits.thus,quantum also had to develop a mechanism for monitoring the conditions of its employees employment throughout the eligibility period.
additionally,perkinson testimony regarding the manner in which she administered the severance plan with respect to bowles demonstrates that the severance plan was not capable of a mechanical application,but required the exercise of discretion.once bowles made his demand for severance pay,perkinson did far more than simply calculate the amount of benefits to which bowles was entitled and issue him a check.see fort halifax,at.to do little more than write a check hardly constitutes the operation of a benefit plan.instead,she consulted with baldwin regarding the changes in bowles employment following the change in control and made a nonclerical judgment call as to whether those changes diminished bowles authority,duties,responsibilities,or status.collins,at.moreover,perkinson would have had to undergo a similar process for each employee subject to the severance plan who demanded severance pay under the diminution trigger.this individualized investigation and assessment demonstrates that quantum could not fulfill its obligations under the severance plan through a single,mechanical,nondiscretionary application of the plan terms.see bogue ampex,cir holding that erisa applied when the employer could not carry out its obligations under a severance benefit plan with an unthinking,nondiscretionary application of the plan terms.
we agree with the first circuit that the sort of discretion that brings a severance plan within erisa coverage is a matter of degree,the assessment of which often requires the court to draw fine lines.see simas quaker fabric of fall river,cir.we believe our decision that quantum severance plan falls on the erisa side of the line is supported not only by our own precedent,see collins,at,but by the precedent of other circuits that have considered similar plans moreover,we believe this case easily is distinguishable from those cases that have fallen on the side of the line.this case is not one in which the administrator was required simply to make an arithmetical computation.see,young.gas light,holding that erisa did not apply to a severance plan when the determinations of eligibility and the amount of the benefits to be paid were purely mechanical and were triggered solely by the employee decision to retire pursuant to the terms of the plan,which left the employer with nothing to do but calculate the amount of the separation payment pursuant to a set formula kulinski medtronic,cir holding that erisa did not apply to a severance plan because once a hostile takeover occurred and the employee resigned his employment for what he regarded as a good reason,there was nothing for the company to decide,no discretion for it to exercise,and nothing for it to do but write a check.nor is this a case in which the amount of discretion exercised is insignificant.see velarde pace membership warehouse,cir holding that the minimal quantum of discretion needed to determine whether an employee had been terminated for cause was insufficient to implicate erisa see also young,at holding that the one discretionary act of selecting an employee separation date was insufficient to implicate erisa.in light of these considerations,it seems clear to us that the severance plan at issue here falls within erisa coverage.
because we ha
