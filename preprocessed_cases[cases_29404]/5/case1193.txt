background 
robert stephens formed each of the three entities that constitute the appellants in this matter.stephens,an individual farmer in montana,incorporated both priest butte and lone pine in.stephens,with one other shareholder for each company,owns an equal ownership interest in both corporations.in,stephens formed manchester with four equal partners.
stephens successfully defeated an unrelated civil claim brought by gary schumacher in.subsequent to stephens successful defense in this suit,schumacher wife,barbara darrow,provided the department of agriculture office of the inspector general oig with a tip that stephens was operating his farms unlawfully.as a result,oig conducted an investigation.however,oig terminated the investigation because it did not find any regulation violations,and it notified darrow that it would take no further action.darrow then contacted the assistant united states attorney ausa,who began a second investigation,looking into possible criminal charges against stephens and appellants.
meanwhile,schumacher filed a qui tam action alleging that stephens defrauded government agencies the government intervened in this action.soon thereafter,the government also brought criminal charges against stephens and appellants.the charges were based on farm program payments the government made to stephens and appellants.
farm program payments are limited to individuals and up to two separate entities.however,to qualify for the payments,each farming operation must have separate interests in the crop or land,separate responsibilities,and separate costs of farming.the indictment against stephens and appellants alleged that stephens formed appellants as shell entities in order to receive additional farm program payments unlawfully.at the heart of the government case was its contention that stephens was the sole owner of appellants and that his partners and did not hold any real ownership interest.ultimately,a jury acquitted stephens and appellants of all criminal charges.
following acquittal,appellants moved to recover fees and costs associated with their defense pursuant to the hyde amendment.the district court denied their request,finding that the government litigation position was not vexatious,frivolous,or in bad faith.on appeal,appellants made thirteen arguments that the district court erred when it found that the government position was not vexatious,frivolous,or in bad faith.according to appellants,the government 
acted wrongfully when it brought the indictment 
pursued a wrongful claim when it investigated possible criminal charges 
presented false and distorted testimony to the grand jury 
joined the qui tam action after it said it had no intention of joining the litigation 
falsely characterized appellants as shell companies 
failed to negotiate a settlement in good faith 
disobeyed the district court order regarding trial exhibits 
misled the district court and appellants when it said it would not terminate appellants farm payments 
falsely stated in the indictment that stephens made insurance payments on behalf of manchester before the partnership was formed 
wrongfully ignored exculpatory evidence when it presented its case to the grand jury 
presented the jury with erroneous and misleading summary charts 
told the jury in its closing arguments that if they do return a verdict for the government,it would lose a lot of money and 
pursued a frivolous and unfounded case 
ii.standard of review and jurisdiction 
we review a district court denial of a hyde amendment motion for abuse of discretion an abuse of discretion is an error of law or a determination based on a clearly erroneous finding of fact reversal is warranted only if we find with a firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment.
we have jurisdiction over the district court denial of appellants hyde amendment motion pursuant to.
iii.requesting fees and costs pursuant to the hyde amendment 
a.the hyde amendment 
we must devote a brief discussion to the application of the hyde amendment before we delve into appellants arguments for recovering fees and costs.the hyde amendment was enacted as a method through which to sanction the government for prosecutorial misconduct.it provides in relevant part 
t he court,in any criminal case may award to a prevailing party,other than the united states,a reasonable attorney fee and other litigation expenses,where the court finds that the position of the united states was vexatious,frivolous,or in bad faith,unless pursuant to the procedures and limitations but not the burden of proof provided for an award under section of title,united states code 
modeled after the equal access to justice act eaja,the hyde amendment has a more demanding burden of proof than the eaja under the eaja,a defendant will prevail unless the government can prove its position was substantially justified however,recovering attorney fees and costs under the hyde amendment requires a stronger showing under the hyde amendment,the burden is on the defendant in the underlying case to prove the government position was vexatious,frivolous,or in bad faith the elements are disjunctive thus,the defendant need only prove one of the three elements to recover the hyde amendment does not define the terms vexatious,frivolous,or bad faith.we have,however,already defined two of the terms vexatious and frivolous.
vexatious conduct 
appellants may recover fees and costs if they can prove that any of the government actions were vexatious.appellants have ultimately failed to satisfy their burden of proof.vexatious has both a subjective and objective element subjectively,the government must have acted maliciously or with an intent to harass appellants objectively,the suit must be deficient or without merit to prove vexatiousness,the defendant must show the government had some ill intent.
appellants have failed to prove the subjective element of vexatiousness.nothing in the record suggests that the government was intentionally malicious or harassing toward appellants.the fact that the government pursued an investigation based on a vengeful tipster is not dispositive.tipsters,by their nature,often hold grudges against the reported parties.it does not follow that the government harassed,acted maliciously,or with an ill intent simply because it followed up on such a tip.
as for the objective element,the district court found that the government position had sufficient merit to submit the case to a jury.the district court did note that the government acted with deliberate indifference in pursuing this investigation.on this,we agree clearly the government performance was significantly below desirable standards.however,we can not say that the district court abused its discretion when it concluded that the poor performance in this case did not rise to the level of vexatiousness under the hyde amendment.
appellants also claim that the government presented the jury with erroneous and misleading summary charts.we disagree.the record shows that the government charts were,at most,presented in a light most favorable to its position appellants do not claim that the charts were patently false,only that they were not as complete as appellants would have liked them.the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the government did not act vexatiously 
pursuit of a frivolous case 
if appellants could satisfy their burden to show that the government pursued a frivolous case,they would recover fees and costs pursuant to the hyde amendment.however,the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that they had failed to satisfy their burde
