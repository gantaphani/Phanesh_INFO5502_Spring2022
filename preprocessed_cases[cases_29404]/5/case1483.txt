background 
this litigation began when kemin foods,and the catholic university of america filed a patent infringement suit against pigmentos vegetales del centro de piveg,alleging infringement of two patents.piveg counterclaimed,seeking a declaratory judgment that the two patents were invalid and unenforceable.piveg also filed counterclaims alleging unfair competition and antitrust violations.the unfair competition and antitrust counterclaims were severed from the remainder of the case,and the second case was stayed pending resolution of the patent issues.
kemin foods is the assignee of one of the two patents in suit,patent the patent.the catholic university of america owns the other patent,patent the patent,and kemin foods is the exclusive licensee of that patent.we refer to the catholic university of america and kemin foods collectively as kemin.the patents in suit include process and product claims pertaining to purified lutein that is extracted from plants.lutein is a carotenoid,an organic,naturally occurring pigment that kemin and piveg incorporate in dietary health supplements that they manufacture and distribute.
at trial,kemin argued that piveg infringed product claims,and of the patent and process claim of the patent.kemin also intended to pursue an allegation of infringement of process claim of the patent,but was effectively precluded from doing so by a pretrial order striking a supplemental expert report proffered by kemin.
at the end of the trial,the jury found that the asserted claims were not invalid.the jury also found that the asserted claims of the patent were not infringed,but that claim of the patent was infringed under the doctrine of equivalents.the jury awarded kemin in damages.the district court denied the parties respective motions for judgment as a matter of law,upheld the jury verdicts on validity and infringement,and enjoined piveg from infringing the patent.the court also rejected piveg claim that both patents were unenforceable because of inequitable conduct.with respect to the patent,the court concluded that kemin did not withhold any material reference or intend to deceive the patent and trademark office pto.with respect to the patent,the court concluded that the showings of materiality and deceptive intent with respect to a reference withheld during prosecution were not sufficient to render the patent unenforceable.finally,the district court determined that kemin was the prevailing party in the patent portion of this suit,and it granted kemin request for an award of costs.
in appeal,piveg challenges the portions of the court judgment holding the patent nonobvious,holding both patents enforceable,and awarding costs to kemin.on those issues,we affirm.in its,kemin challenges the court judgment that the asserted claims of the patent were not infringed.we affirm that ruling.kemin also challenges the court pretrial order striking kemin supplemental expert report.on that issue,we vacate and remand for the district court to consider the supplemental expert report and kemin claim of infringement of claim of the patent.finally,kemin asks that we modify the permanent injunction issued by the district court.we decline to do so and thus affirm the court injunctive order.
also before the court is piveg separate appeal,from a decision in the severed portion of the litigation in which the court dismissed piveg unfair competition and antitrust counterclaims and denied piveg leave to amend and supplement those counterclaims.on that appeal,we affirm.
ii.piveg appeal in the patent case 
obviousness of claim of the patent 
piveg argues that a prior art reference,a article in the journal poultry science,teaches all the limitations of claim of the patent except for the limitation requiring that the claimed purified lutein product contain no traces of toxic chemicals.with respect to that limitation,piveg argues that a person of ordinary skill in the art in the early would have known how to remove toxic solvents from purified lutein and would have been motivated to do so.piveg therefore contends that claim would have been obvious in light of the disclosure in the poultry science article 
the problem facing piveg on appeal is that the jury concluded that piveg failed to meet its burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that claim would have been obvious.piveg appeal is predicated entirely on the asserted insufficiency of the evidence to support the jury verdict.we agree with the district court that substantial evidence supported the verdict,and we therefore affirm the judgment with respect to the claim of obviousness 
the method of obtaining purified lutein disclosed in the poultry science article uses toluene as a solvent.the resulting purified lutein product contains some residual toluene.both piveg and kemin presented expert testimony on whether one of skill in the art could remove the toluene from the purified lutein.kemin expert explained the difficulties with removing toluene from purified lutein crystals and testified that,although various separation methods would remove some of the toluene,those methods would not remove all traces of the toluene,as required by claim.in light of that testimony,it was reasonable for the jury to conclude that the claimed invention would not have been rendered obvious by what the poultry science article would have taught to a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time.
kemin also presented evidence that the lutein obtained by the method disclosed in the poultry science article would not have satisfied two other requirements of claim of the patent as construed that the lutein be greater than about pure and that it contain significantly less than of other carotenoids.although piveg experts disputed some aspects of kemin evidence,piveg has failed to show that no reasonable juror could have accepted kemin version of the disputed facts.
enforceability of the patent 
piveg next argues that the patent should be held unenforceable for inequitable conduct.piveg theory of inequitable conduct focuses on christopher nelson,who was the president of kemin foods during prosecution of the patent.although nelson was not a named inventor on the patent,he had previously been involved with kemin research on purified lutein.piveg theory is that nelson knew the poultry science article was material,that he was sufficiently involved in prosecution of the patent to have a duty to disclose the reference,and that he withheld the article from the pto with deceptive intent.in response to special interrogatories posed by the district court judge,the jury,acting in an advisory capacity,found that the poultry science article was material to the patentability of the patent and that nelson withheld the article with intent to deceive the pto.although the court did not reject the jury findings,it ultimately conclude d the levels of materiality and intent are not so high as to warrant a finding of culpable intent such that the patent should be held unenforceable.piveg argues that the court erred by finding the levels of materiality and intent low,and that the court abused its discretion by refusing to hold the patent unenforceable.
with respect to materiality,the court concluded that the poultry science article was not highly material.the court first held that the poultry science article did not render the patent invalid.it further noted that the evidence of record suggested that the method disclosed in the poultry science article may not work as intended.relying on beckman instruments,lkb produkter ab,piveg argues that materiality is not negated simply because the method disclosed in the poultry science article required some modification in order to be operative.while that general principle is true,the district court did not hold that the poultry science article was immaterial because it was not enabled.the court agreed with piveg that the article was material it simply disagreed that the article was highly material,because the ability to duplicate the information disclosed is relevant to the level of materiality attached to that information,and because there was little persuasive record evidence the method disclosed in the poultry science article actually produces the composition disclosed.the district court was thus unpersuaded disclosure of the article would have had any significant impact on the patent.
piveg has not pointed to any particular evidence or made any argument that would compel a finding of high materiality.see,purdue pharma endo pharm,th e omission of information was material,but not as material as an affirmative misrepresentation would have been.perseptive biosystems,pharmacia biotech,there can be no doubt that intentional misrepresentations,omissions and to the pto,made as a persistent course of conduct,are highly material.elk of dallas gaf.materials,fact that claimed invention was developed as an improvement over a prior art patent supported finding that the prior art patent was highly material.accordingly,we see no clear error in the district court finding as to the level of materiality of the poultry science article.
with respect to the issue of intent,the district court noted that the evidence of intent to deceive was tenuous and that the jury conclusion on that prong of inequitable conduct was reached on a shallow basis.nelson testified that he did not believe the poultry science article was relevant to the prosecution of the patent,because the patent was directed to lutein fit for human consumption and the poultry science article did not contemplate preparing lutein for that purpose.in nelson view,the poultry science article was just another paper that made crystals of lutein that nobody could eat.in light of the difficulties associated with removing toxic chemicals from step that would be required before humans could consume the lutein obtained by the method described in the poultry science district court concluded that nelson testimony provided a plausible explanation for his belief that the article was not material.
piveg evidence at trial focused on the fact that nelson had previously experimented with the method described in the poultry science article.from that fact,piveg asked the district court to infer that nelson acted with deceptive intent when he did not bring the article to the attention of the named inventors or the prosecuting attorneys so that they could disclose it to the pto.the district court noted,however,that nelson was only tangentially involved in prosecution of the patent and that more than two years had passed between the time nelson experimented with the method of the poultry science article and the time of the prosecution.because those facts can reasonably be viewed as militating against a finding of deceptive intent,we see no error in the district court conclusion that piveg did not make a strong showing of intent to deceive the pto.
even when a court finds that the patentee failed to disclose material information to the pto and acted with deceptive intent,the court retains discretion to decide whether the patentee conduct is sufficiently culpable to render the patent unenforceable.see roche,promega,a n important step in the judicial resolution of inequitable conduct claims is for the court to determine whether the material misrepresentations or omissions in question are sufficiently serious in light of the evidence of intent to deceive,under all the circumstances,to warrant the severe sanction of holding the patent unenforceable.that determination is committed to the trial court discretion.in light of the district court findings that the poultry science article was not highly material and that the showing of deceptive intent was not compelling,the court did not abuse its discretion when it declined to hold the patent unenforceable.
enforceability of the patent 
piveg also argues that the patent should be held unenforceable for inequitable conduct.the patent claims a process for producing lutein crystals.one of the steps of the claimed process calls for the use of propylene glycol in a saponification reaction.during prosecution of the patent,kemin did not disclose to the pto that it and others in the industry had previously used propylene glycol to produce various poultry pigments.piveg argues that those prior uses of propylene glycol were material to the patentability of the patent and that kemin acted with deceptive intent when it failed to disclose those prior uses to the pto.in response to special interrogatories,the jury found that the prior uses of propylene glycol processes were not material to patentability,and it found that kemin did not withhold evidence of those prior uses with intent to deceive the pto.the district court agreed with the jury advisory verdict,concluding that there is a dearth of evidence to support piveg arguments of inequitable conduct related to the patent.
kemin does not dispute that before the filing of the patent application kemin employees used propylene glycol to produce other poultry pigment products.nor does kemin appear to dispute that those other products may have contained carotenoid crystals.however,kemin presented evidence that at the time of the patent prosecution,no one knew that propylene glycol processes were producing lutein crystals.although rodney ausich,one of the named inventors on the patent,testified that he had observed crystals resulting from saponification using propylene glycol,he also testified that he had no idea what chemical entity those crystals were and that he had never seen anything anywhere indicating that the products,in fact,included crystals of any xanthophyll,much less lutein.he further testified that despite a long history of use of propylene glycol in kemin and in the entire industry,no one had recognized that you could simply add propylene glycol base and marigold oleoresin to create crystals like we were able to create.that testimony supports the inference that there would have been no reason for anyone at kemin to recognize that prior uses of propylene glycol in the poultry pigment industry were material to patentability.the district court therefore did not err in rejecting the claim of inequitable conduct in the prosecution of the patent.
d.the award of costs 
following the entry of judgment on the patent issues,piveg and kemin each filed a bill of costs,each asserting that it was the prevailing party in the litigation and thus entitled to costs under federal rule of civil procedure d.the district court held that kemin was the prevailing party because kemin prevailed on one of its two infringement claims resulting in a damages award and a permanent injunction and because kemin prevailed on piveg invalidity and unenforceability claims.
piveg argues that the district court erred by declaring kemin the prevailing party in this litigation.piveg first points out that kemin prevailed on only one of its two infringement claims.the fact that a party does not prevail on all of its claims does not,however,preclude it from being the prevailing party for purposes of awarding costs under rule d.see,manildra milling ogilvie mills,holding that the plaintiff prevailed for purposes of rule d when it successfully challenged the validity of its opponent patent,even though the plaintiff lost on its antitrust and unfair competition claims.
piveg argues that it should be considered the prevailing party because its behavior was not affected by the permanent injunction issued in this case,since during the litigation piveg switched to a process that was outside the scope of the injunction.notwithstanding piveg purported alteration of its process,an injunction issued based on the court conclusion that piveg had infringed the patent,and the consequence of the injunction was to prohibit piveg from using the process described in the patent.piveg also argues that it prevailed in the litigation because the jury found that it successfully established the elements of inequitable conduct as to the patent by clear and convincing evidence.that argument ignores the fact that piveg ultimately lost on its unenforceability claim.
finally,piveg argues that the district court abused its discretion by awarding kemin its full costs rather than apportioning costs according to the relative success of the parties.cost awards are committed to the discretion of the district courts,and there is no rule requiring courts to apportion costs according to the relative success of the parties.see johnson agency,cir where each of the parties has prevailed on one or more of its claims,defense or counterclaims,the district court has broad discretion in taxing costs.in fact,apportioning costs according to the relative success of parties is appropriate only under limited circumstances,such as when the costs incurred are greatly disproportionate to the relief obtained.see james moore et,moore federal practice b ed.the present case does not present such circumstances,so we can not say that the district court abused its discretion by declining to apportion costs.while piveg prevailed on some issues,we conclude that on the whole kemin success in the litigation was sufficiently clear that the district court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that kemin was the prevailing party and declining to apportion costs.
iii.kemin in the patent case 
infringement of the patent 
kemin challenges the jury verdict of noninfringement of claims,and of the patent.claims and are dependent on claim,and kemin appeal focuses on whether piveg products meet three disputed limitations of claim.we conclude that the jury could reasonably have concluded that the accused products do not meet two of those limitations,and so we affirm the judgment of noninfringement.
claim of the patent reads 
the carotenoid composition consisting essentially of substantially pure lutein crystals derived from plant extracts that contain lutein wherein the lutein is substantially free from other carotenoids and chemical impurities found in the natural form of lutein in the plant extract.
on a previous appeal from the district court grant of a preliminary injunction,we preliminarily construed the disputed limitations of claim.kemin foods,pigmentos vegetales del centro de.the district court subsequently adopted our preliminary construction of the claims for purposes of the jury trial on infringement.kemin foods,pigmentos vegetales del centro de,d.kemin does not challenge that claim construction.rather,kemin contends that no reasonable juror could have found that piveg products fall outside the literal scope of the claim as construed.whether a product falls within the literal scope of a properly construed claim is a question of fact,on which we accord a jury substantial deference.see ppg indus.guardian indus,a fter the court has defined the claim with whatever specificity and precision is warranted by the language of the claim and the evidence bearing on the proper construction,the task of determining whether the construed claim reads on the accused product is for the finder of fact.kemin also argues that even if piveg products fall outside the literal scope of the claims,the products should be found to infringe under the doctrine of equivalents.yet that too was a question of fact for the jury in this case.see,interactive pictures infinite pictures,determination of infringement by equivalents is an issue of fact,which after a jury trial we review for substantial evidence.we will not disturb a jury finding of infringement by equivalents unless the evidence so favors the accused infringer that reasonable jurors could not arrive at a contrary verdict.citations,internal quotation marks,and brackets omitted.
with respect to the limitation requiring the lutein composition to be substantially free from other carotenoids found in the natural form of lutein in the plant extract,we construed that limitation to require significantly less than of other carotenoids.kemin foods.at.that construction was based in part on a passage in the specification noting that g enerally,the concentration of other carotenoids in the starting material should be or less.patent,ll.we reasoned that i f the starting material,marigold petal extract prior to purification generally contains or less of other carotenoids,it follows that lutein that is substantially free from other carotenoids found in the natural form of lutein in the plant extract must contain much less than of the other carotenoids.at.
on appeal,the parties disagree about the percentage of other carotenoids present in piveg products.both parties analyzed samples of those products and presented their analyses to the jury.in kemin view,the percentage of other carotenoids in piveg products ranges from to.in piveg view,the percentage of other carotenoids in its products is greater than and as high as.kemin has not argued that the phrase significantly less than has a precise upper limit.thus,the question whether the concentration of other carotenoids in piveg products is low enough to infringe the patent was properly left to the jury.as we have noted,it is possible that under such circumstances different finders of fact could reach different conclusions.that possibility,however,is a necessary consequence of treating infringement as a question of fact subject to deferential review.ppg,at.therefore,even if the jury accepted kemin carotenoid measurements,it could reasonably conclude that although piveg products had less than of other carotenoids,they did not have significantly less than of other carotenoids.similarly,the jury could have concluded that the levels of other carotenoids in piveg products were high enough that they were outside the scope of the doctrine of equivalents as applied to that limitation.
the jury also could have concluded that piveg products do not satisfy claim limitation on the presence of toxic chemicals in the lutein product.we previously construed claim to require no traces of toxic chemicals.kemin foods.at.in reaching that conclusion,we pointed to language in the specification stating that the purified lutein is required not to contain even traces of any toxic chemicals.id.quoting patent,ll.it is undisputed that piveg products contain some hexane,at levels as high as parts per million.it also appears undisputed that hexane may be considered toxic even in very low concentrations.kemin argues that chemicals are not inherently toxic or nontoxic,and that any chemical can be toxic in sufficient quantities.thus,according to kemin,toxicity has meaning only in reference to toxic amounts of a particular chemical.in kemin view,the phrase no traces of toxic chemicals simply requires that the product not contain any chemicals in an amount that would be toxic to a human.
the problem with kemin argument is that the patent and our previous construction of claim do not merely exclude toxic amounts of chemicals.rather,the patent discusses particular chemicals as toxic and explains that in order to produce lutein for human consumption one must eliminate any amount of such chemicals from the lutein product.for example,the patent suggests that methanol and isopropyl alcohol should not be used to produce the patented product because they are toxic.see patent,ll.instead of ethanol,other alcohols such as methanol or isopropyl alcohol may also be employed.however,since the purified lutein is required not to contain even traces of any toxic chemicals,the use of methanol instead of food grade ethanol in this purification process is not normally recommended.we construed claim to require no traces of such chemicals.
kemin argument,both at trial and on appeal,has been that the phrase no traces of toxic chemicals should be interpreted as limiting the claim to products in which the levels of all chemicals are below the toxic thresholds set by the food and drug administration.neither the patent nor our claim construction,however,makes any reference to toxicity thresholds,whether promulgated by the fda or otherwise.accordingly,it was not error for the district court not to instruct the jury in accordance with kemin interpretation of the claim limitation.in light of our construction of the claim,the jury could reasonably have concluded that piveg products do not infringe,either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents,because they contain traces of toxic chemicals,even though the levels of those toxic chemicals may not be high enough to cause illness or death in humans.
kemin supplemental expert report 
kemin next argues that the magistrate judge erred by granting piveg motion to strike a supplemental expert report proffered by kemin.the district court upheld the magistrate judge decision on that motion,with minimal comment.in kemin view,the magistrate judge decision rested on erroneous grounds and prejudiced kemin because it prevented kemin from asserting infringement of process claim of the patent.we agree with kemin that it was an abuse of discretion to strike the supplemental expert report,and we agree that for that reason the issue of infringement of claim of the patent must be remanded to the district court.
in granting piveg motion to strike,the magistrate judge admonished kemin for the late timing of the additional claim raised by the supplemental expert report.the magistrate judge was referring to the fact that the report addressed infringement of process claim,a claim that the magistrate judge apparently believed was being raised in the supplemental expert report for the first time in the litigation.thus,the magistrate judge treated kemin supplemental expert report as,in effect,a request by kemin to amend its original complaint with an allegation that piveg infringed claim of the patent.however,the supplemental expert report was not such a request,either in fact or in effect.
in its original complaint,kemin broadly alleged that piveg was infringing the and patents,including without limitation claim of both patents.that language in the complaint was sufficiently broad to encompass a charge of infringement of all the claims of the two patents.piveg has not pointed to anything in the record suggesting that kemin narrowed the scope of its complaint at any time prior to the december,supplemental expert report.to the contrary,it appears that kemin diligently pursued discovery to ascertain whether piveg process implicated claim and kept the court and piveg on notice that claim might be asserted at trial.for example,in response to an interrogatory asking which claims kemin was alleging were infringed,kemin listed claims,and of the patent and claim of the patent,but it noted that piveg has yet to produce its process for producing lutein crystal products so plaintiffs reserve the right to seasonably update this response as the discovery may reveal that other patent claims are also infringed.also,in markman briefing kemin noted that preliminary analysis of piveg products revealed the presence of residual propylene glycol,suggesting that piveg process for producing purified lutein infringes process claim of the patent.however,kemin noted 
to date discovery regarding piveg actual process has been unreliable at best and is the subject of a motion to compel by kemin.thus,it is possible that piveg may use a mixture,as the solvent in its process,thereby infringing the method of claim of the patent.accordingly,as discovery is ongoing,kemin reserves the right to assert claim of the patent when piveg process is known.there are no additional claim construction issues that arises sic with respect to claim of the patent which are not already addressed by the briefing on the claims already specifically asserted.
as those passages suggest,kemin had difficulty obtaining information about piveg process.pursuant to a corporate policy,piveg maintained no documentation of its process for purifying lutein.the only such documentary evidence piveg provided kemin was a document prepared at the request of piveg litigation counsel.as part of discovery,kemin was permitted to visit piveg manufacturing is located in july.when kemin visited the facility,however,various parts of piveg process were either not operating at all or were not operating under normal conditions.as a result,the district court ordered a second inspection,which occurred on november and.the site visits suggested some inconsistencies between piveg actual process and its process document.as kemin supplemental expert report explained,analysis of samples collected during the second visit the first piveg process might be covered by claim of the patent.the supplemental expert report was filed with the district court on december,one day before the deadline set by the magistrate judge.
we see nothing more kemin could have done to keep claim alive during the pretrial phase of the litigation.kemin repeatedly advised the court and piveg that once it obtained information about piveg process,that information might implicate claim.in the markman briefing,kemin took account of claim.and as soon as it obtained sufficient information about piveg process,kemin provided a detailed analysis of its claim infringement contentions.under these circumstances,we conclude that the magistrate judge should not have granted piveg motion to strike kemin supplemental expert report.
because the supplemental expert report was the even the basis for kemin claim infringement allegation,the effect of the magistrate decision was to preclude kemin from pursuing its allegation of infringement of claim.that outcome is potentially significant,because in order to avoid the effect of the patent injunction,piveg asserts that it has switched to a new process.yet according to kemin,even if that process falls outside the injunction,it still might infringe claim of the patent.thus,we vacate the judgment as it applies to claim of the patent,and we remand for the district court to consider kemin supplemental expert report and kemin related allegation that piveg infringes claim of the patent.
modifying the permanent injunction 
kemin also argues that we should modify the terms of the permanent injunction to cover all processes run by piveg at any time through the date of the jury verdict.in kemin view,such a modification is necessary to ensure that the injunction provides meaningful relief.we disagree.
on january,piveg notified kemin that it had modified its purified lutein process from what kemin had observed just months earlier during its second visit to piveg manufacturing facility.in response,kemin requested that the district court apply and thereby shift the burden of proof to piveg with respect to the claim of infringement of process claim of the patent.the district court granted kemin motion in august.in kemin view,the effect of section in this case should be to impose on piveg the burden of proving noninfringement with respect to every purified lutein process piveg used through the end of trial.
the problem with that argument is that the district court decision to apply was based in part on kemin showing of a substantial likelihood that the process piveg was using before november infringed claim of the patent.piveg claims that after november it switched to a process that does not use propylene glycol.because the process claimed in the patent requires propylene glycol,a process would not infringe the patent.kemin argues,however,that a process could infringe claim of the patent,since that claim does not require the use of propylene glycol.whether piveg modified process infringes claim of the patent is an open question for the district court to address on remand.
iv.piveg appeal on the amended counterclaims 
in a separate appeal,piveg argues that the district court erred by denying its motion for leave to amend its severed counterclaims.we agree with the district court that piveg amended counterclaims were futile,and we therefore affirm the district court denial of leave to amend.
following trial on the patent infringement issues,kemin moved to dismiss piveg counterclaims alleging unfair competition and antitrust violations.kemin argued that those counterclaims hinged on piveg claims of patent unenforceability and invalidity,and therefore that the district court judgment holding the patents enforceable and not invalid foreclosed the counterclaims.
in response,piveg moved to amend and supplement its counterclaims.piveg amended counterclaims were counterclaim iii,alleging unfair competition,and counterclaim iv,alleging antitrust violations based on fraudulent procurement of a patent.piveg new counterclaims were counterclaim v,alleging antitrust violations based on sham litigation counterclaim vi,alleging antitrust violations based on patent misuse and counterclaim vii,alleging
