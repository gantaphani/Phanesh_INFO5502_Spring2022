the government appeals from a final order of the district court awarding attorney fees in a civil forfeiture action.this case requires that we determine,as a matter of first impression,whether attorney fees incurred in the defense of a criminal action may be awarded in a related civil forfeiture action under the civil asset forfeiture reform act of cafra a,b,without regard for the stringent limitations on awards in criminal cases under the hyde amendment,act of,tit.vi,stat,reprinted in,historical and statutory notes hereinafter hyde amendment.
background 
in august,axion corporation axion secured a million contract with the united states army to supply parts for a black hawk helicopter.in june,the government filed a civil in rem forfeiture complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of alabama pursuant to a a against two of axion bank accounts and the parcel of real property where the company is located on the basis that axion had violated the terms of the contract,as well as several federal laws.there are three claimants to the defendant properties axion its president,alex nooredin latifi latifi and latifi wife,beth latifi collectively,the claimants.the government filed a motion before judge virginia emerson hopkins to stay the civil forfeiture proceeding pursuant to cafra a,g,which directs the district court to stay the civil forfeiture proceeding if the court determines that civil discovery will adversely affect the ability of the government to conduct a related criminal investigation or the prosecution of a related criminal case.judge hopkins granted the motion to stay the civil forfeiture action.
in march,the government filed an indictment against axion and latifi in the united states district court for the northern district of alabama.the criminal case was assigned to judge inge prytz johnson.a superseding indictment charged latifi and axion with two counts of exporting without the required license defense articles or defense services designated by the president for inclusion in the united states munitions list,in violation of the arms export control act,b,c counts and making a false representation concerning an aircraft part,in violation of a c count and making false statements,in violation of count.the indictment also included two criminal forfeiture counts counts and judge johnson held a bench trial that resulted in an acquittal on all counts.
after the criminal charges against latifi and axion were dismissed,the civil case was transferred to judge johnson.the government filed a motion to dismiss the civil forfeiture case with prejudice,which also contained a request for a certificate of reasonable cause under a.in their response,the claimants agreed that the case should be dismissed with prejudice and asserted that such a dismissal entitled them to attorney fees under cafra.the claimants also objected to the government request for a certificate of reasonable cause.the government then filed a motion for leave to withdraw its motion to dismiss with prejudice.judge johnson granted the motion to withdraw and set a hearing on the motion for a certificate of reasonable cause.the government filed a motion to dismiss without prejudice,stating that it no longer intended to pursue the civil forfeiture case.the claimants again asserted that the case should be dismissed with prejudice.the government then filed a notice with the court stating that the government was withdrawing its request for a certificate of reasonable cause.on april,the district court dismissed the case with prejudice and concluded that the claimants were entitled to recover reasonable attorneys fees and costs along with interest pursuant to the provisions of cafra,at.
on may,the district court opined that,pursuant to cafra,the claimants are entitled to recover both fees incurred in defending the civil forfeiture action and fees incurred in defending the criminal case and ordered the payment of such fees and interest.united states certain real,d.citing webb board of education of dyer county,tennessee,d,the district court found that the attorney fees incurred in the criminal case,a related proceeding,are recoverable in the civil forfeiture action because the work was useful and of a type ordinarily necessary to secure the final result obtained from the litigation.id.at quoting webb,at.at.the court first found that the criminal case work was useful,saying 
t he work done by the claimants attorneys in the criminal case was clearly useful as it directly resulted in the dismissal of the civil forfeiture case.in fact,the claimants were required to litigate the civil forfeiture case through the criminal case because of the stay imposed on the civil forfeiture case.if latifi and axion had been convicted in the criminal case,then the property would have been immediately subject to forfeiture.if the defendants were acquitted,as they were,then that result would not have had res judicata effect on this civil forfeiture case t he government had no intention of pursuing the civil forfeiture case after latifi and axion were acquitted.thus,the acquittal in the criminal case directly led to the dismissal of the civil forfeiture case.indeed,the only way for the claimants to obtain a dismissal of the civil forfeiture case was by obtaining an acquittal in the criminal case.
id.citations omitted.the court then concluded that t he work was of a type ordinarily necessary to secure the final result obtained from the litigation since the civil proceeding was stayed pursuant to cafra and the only way for the claimants to succeed was to gain an acquittal in the criminal trial.id.the court acknowledged that a warding the claimants fees for work done in the criminal case clearly allows the claimants to avoid the stricter requirements for recovering attorneys fees under the hyde amendment,which requires claimants recovering such fees in a criminal case to prove that the position of the united states was vexatious,frivolous,or in bad faith.hyde amendment.the district court added that if it were to find that fees incurred defending the criminal case were not recoverable under cafra,then the government would be allowed to avoid cafra,as it has tried to do in this case,by moving for a stay in the civil case and prosecuting the criminal case.d at.
the district court total award before was the district court attributed of this award to hours of work on the criminal case id.at.the ultimate award minus deductions was the government then perfected this appeal.
on appeal,the government urges,inter alia,that cafra plain language limits the award of attorney fees under a,b to those fees incurred for work done explicitly for the civil forfeiture proceeding the claimants counter,in accord with the district court,that the supreme court has decided in other contexts that statutes encompass the award of fees incurred outside of the litigation and that this precedent allows them to recover under cafra fees incurred in the defense of a related criminal case.
ii.standard of review 
the proper standard for an award of attorney fees is a question of law that we review de novo.dist.dir.for the citizenship immigration,cir quoting smalbein city of daytona beach,cir.
iii.discussion 
after thorough review of the record,we conclude that the contours of congress waiver of the united states government sovereign immunity in the cafra provision can be determined by looking to the plain language and structure of cafra.we hold that attorney fees incurred in the defense of a criminal action,even if related to a civil forfeiture action as in the present case,can not be awarded under cafra.this holding is supported by cafra legislative history,and we find the supreme court cases cited by the district court inapplicable in this context.
to determine whether attorney fees for work done in a criminal prosecution may be awarded in a related civil forfeiture action under cafra a,b,we turn first to the text of the statute to discern congressional intent.cafra provision provides in pertinent part 
i n any civil proceeding to forfeit property under any provision of federal law in which the claimant substantially prevails,the united states shall be liable for 
a reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred by the claimant and 
b interest,as set forth in section of this title.
our interpretation of the cafra provision is guided by principles of sovereign immunity,which bar the award of attorney fees against the united states absent explicit congressional authorization.see ruckelshaus sierra club,d see also ardestani dep t of justice,cir a court may not grant attorneys fees and costs against the united states in the absence of a congressional or constitutional waiver of sovereign immunity which grants it the authority to do so.internal quotation marks omitted.a waiver of the united states government sovereign immunity must be unequivocal,dep t of energy ohio,d,superseded by statute,federal facility compliance act of,stat,and the provision must be construed strictly in favor of the sovereign and not enlarged beyond what the language requires,ruckelshaus,at.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also ardestani,at stating that a statute that waives sovereign immunity in allowing attorney fees against the united states must be construed strictly.
on its face,the language of cafra provision appears to contemplate only the award of attorney fees incurred in the civil forfeiture action.see cafra a,b i n any civil proceeding to forfeit property.without an express waiver of the government sovereign immunity,we can not find that such a waiver exists.to justify its award of the fees incurred in defending axion and latifi criminal case,the district court characterized the civil forfeiture action as having been litigated through the criminal case because of the stay imposed on the civil forfeiture case.d at.the district court characterization states precisely why we can not find that the attorney fees incurred in defending the criminal case are recoverable in the civil forfeiture action under the auspices of cafra the fees were incurred in the defense of a criminal action,not a civil forfeiture action or proceeding in support of a civil forfeiture action.
our reading of the provision is supported by cafra structure.when congress fashioned cafra provision in,it simultaneously expanded the government ability to seek a stay of the civil forfeiture proceeding in light of an ongoing criminal investigation or the mechanism used by the government in this case.see cafra a.congress effectively gave the government the ability to choose which to pursue civil forfeiture action,a related criminal investigation,or the prosecution of a related criminal long as the district court determines that civil discovery will adversely affect the ability of the government to conduct a related criminal investigation or the prosecution of a related criminal case.see cafra a,g.
congress provided property claimants the protections it thought appropriate while retaining the usefulness of civil forfeitures in law enforcement activities.ramirez united states,noting congress intent that cafra leave the underlying forfeiture authority of federal agencies substantially unaffected.first,the act provides that in lieu of staying the civil forfeiture action,the district court can issue a protective order limiting discovery.cafra a,g.second,if the district court determines that a stay is necessary to protect the government related criminal investigation or case,g directs the court to enter any order necessary to preserve the value of the property or to protect the rights of lienholders or other persons with an interest in the property while the stay is in effect.the express terms of cafra provision do not go further and expressly allow the award of fees incurred in defense of a related criminal case in the civil forfeiture action if the claimants are acquitted of the criminal charges.we can not waive the government sovereign immunity and attempt to fashion such an additional protection where congress has not chosen to do so.see wright sec y for dep t of,cir c ourts ought not add to what the legislature has said is the law our function is to apply statutes,to carry out the expression of the legislative will that is embodied in them,not to improve statutes by altering them.harris garner,cir en banc we will not do to the statutory language what congress did not do with it,because the role of the judicial branch is to apply statutory language,not to rewrite it.see also ewing thomas,heye,cir,superseded by statute,act of july,title vii,a c,a,a,a,stat,an amendment to a statute is clearly a legislative,not a judicial function.we can not now do what congress may have wanted to accomplish but has left undone.
the language of the seizure and stay provisions in also demonstrates that congress was fully cognizant that work done in defense of a criminal case may be used to defend against a civil forfeiture.for example,in order to determine whether a criminal case or investigation is related to a civil forfeiture proceeding so as to warrant a stay,congress instructed the district court to consider the degree of similarity between the parties,witnesses,facts,and circumstances involved in the two proceedings.see g.in addition,one justification for granting a claimant request for a stay of the civil forfeiture action is that discovery in the civil case may uncover information useful in the criminal prosecution.see g.despite congress acknowledgment of the interconnectedness of civil forfeiture and criminal proceedings,congress waiver of sovereign immunity in the cafra provision does not expressly state that claimants in civil forfeiture proceedings can obtain in the civil proceeding those fees they incur as criminal defendants in a related criminal case.
the claimants urge that cafra would be rendered meaningless if the government could always evade liability by litigating in the criminal forum.br.of appellee.likewise,the district court said that if it were to find that fees incurred defending the criminal case were not recoverable under cafra,then the government would be allowed to avoid cafra.d at.these arguments ignore two important points.first,claimants in civil forfeiture actions do not always face criminal charges beth latifi is a prime example.second,by designing the civil forfeiture action stay provision as it did,congress expressly authorized the strategy,see br.of appellee,used by the government in this case.
viewing the statutory scheme in its entirety,we can not conclude that in addition to the protections expressly laid out in statute,congress implicitly provided that the fees incurred in defense of a related criminal case can be recouped in the civil case.as we have repeatedly said,it is not the courts place to fashion additional protections,and,in this instance,the sovereign immunity of the united states precludes us from doing so.
our holding also is consistent with the concerns expressed by congress in cafra legislative history.as explained by the district court,the stated purpose of cafra is to make federal civil forfeiture procedures fair to property owners and to give owners innocent of any wrongdoing the means to recover their property and make themselves whole after wrongful government seizures.d at quoting,at.the house of representatives committee on the judiciary expressed concern that many civil seizures are not challenged due to the costs involved in challenging them,at.similarly,the committee expressed concern with the arduous path one must journey in a civil forfeiture action against a presumption of guilt,often without the benefit of counsel,and perhaps without any money left after the seizure with which to fight the battle.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.we have not found anything in the legislative history,however,that indicates congress was troubled by the fact that civil forfeiture action claimants who are criminal defendants in related cases bear the costs of their criminal defenses under the traditional american rule as we note below,where congress had such concerns,it addressed them with the hyde amendment.in describing the ills of the former civil forfeiture action system,the house of representatives committee on the judiciar
