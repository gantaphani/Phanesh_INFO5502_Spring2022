manufactures and distributes numerous household products.since the late and early,rumors of links to satanism have circulated throughout the united states.a common version alleges that president admitted to worshiping satan on a television talk show and that a portion of profits goes to the church of satan.the rumor has circulated in the form of voicemail messages and printed fliers.
alleges that amway and its distributors started or spread the rumor in the and began spreading it again in the.rather than suing amway in the,worked with amway corporate headquarters to stop the rumor.in,however,the rumor resurfaced when randy haugen,an amway distributor,forwarded it to other amway distributors via an internal telephone messaging system.haugen served on the adac and was a very successful amway distributor with a network of distributors throughout utah,nevada,texas,mexico,and canada.
the rumor spread rapidly.some distributors printed fliers containing the rumor and circulated them to consumers.offered evidence that the number of satanism rumors increased substantially in the states in which the majority of haugen distributors live.
within days of learning that the rumor was false,haugen sent out a short retraction on the voice messaging system.shortly thereafter,an amway representative contacted haugen and delivered a copy of a truth kit,which explains that the rumor is false.using the kit,haugen sent out a second and more detailed retraction,but the rumor continued to spread for some time.
amway distributors make money both from selling amway products to the general public and from recruiting other distributors.newly recruited distributors become distributors who earn commissions for the upline distributors who recruited them.more senior and profitable distributors sell their products predominately to downline distributors rather than to consumers.there is high turnover among the more junior distributors.the most elite and profitable distributors rely on the sale of motivational tools rather than amway products to earn large profits.
alleged that this structure constitutes an illegal pyramid scheme and gave upline distributors a possible motive to repeat the rumor to the downline distributors because it might affect the ability to recruit distributors and sell amway products.the relationship of amway distribution network to,adac,and internet remains a bit murky,but unearthed evidence that the four entities have close ties.
in,filed a federal suit in utah,alleging that haugen,freedom associates,and freedom tools,circulated the satanism rumor later joined amway,randy walker,and walker international network as defendants.in,filed a second amended complaint alleging defamation,common law unfair competition,violations of the utah truth in advertising act,tortious interference,negligent supervision,and violations of the lanham act a,a,and vicarious liability.then filed a third amended complaint alleging that amway is an illegal pyramid and alleging fraud and product disparagement the district court dismissed that complaint in.later in,filed a fourth amended complaint to assert fraud and disparagement claims,which the utah court denied as untimely 
on the day after the dismissal in utah,sued haugen,amway,adac,internet,and other parties in texas federal court,alleging that the defendants had spread the satanism rumor,disparaged crest toothpaste,and harmed sales by luring people into amway illegal pyramid scheme as distributors.the complaint asserted various causes of action,including common law fraud,violations of the lanham act a,violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,c d,and violations of the texas business and commerce code.
the texas district court granted amway fed.civ.b motion dismissing the rico claim because had not alleged reliance on amway alleged predicate acts of mail and wire fraud.the court held that lacked standing to bring its a claim based on amway illegal pyramid scheme and that the statute of limitations had expired for the fraud claim.this dismissal eliminated internet as a party to the suit,because had asserted only the lanham act illegal pyramid scheme against internet.
the remaining claims and parties went to trial.at the close of case,amway moved for judgment as a matter of law.the court granted and dismissed the a claim against amway,walker,and haugen based on the res judicata effect of the utah final judgment.the texas court dismissed the a claim for disparagement against the remaining defendants because the first amendment requires,and the plaintiffs had failed to present,evidence of actual malice.the court also dismissed the texas business and commerce code claim and all remaining claims.appealed the decision on the merits.
the district court then issued three orders imposing sanctions on by shifting attorneys fees and costs.it granted sanctions to in the form of all attorneys fees expended after april the sanctions order,citing as its authority for shifting fees.the court granted a fees motion in favor of adac,citing its authority under and the adac sanctions order.the court granted internet motion for all attorney fees under and the internet sanctions order.brought the instant appeal to challenge the sanctions orders.
in procter gamble amway i,cert.denied,d,we affirmed the decision on the merits in part,reversed in part,and vacated.we reversed the rule b dismissal of the rico claims based on the predicate acts of mail and wire fraud in spreading the satanism rumor.we affirmed the dismissal of the rico claims based on the illegal pyramid scheme.id.at.we affirmed the summary judgment dismissing the lanham act illegal pyramid claims because lacked standing.id.at.we reversed the that the utah judgment has res judicata effect,because the tenth circuit had reversed and remanded on the lanham act claim.we refused to give the utah court decision on vicarious liability preclusive effect as to the lanham act claims.id.at.we reversed the on the lanham act disparagement claim,concluding that the first amendment does not require proof of actual malice.id.at.we reversed the dismissal of the product disparagement claims under the lanham act and texas business and commerce code.id.at.we upheld the dismissal of the common law fraud claims as barred by the statute of limitations.id.at.we upheld the dismissal of the alter ego,single business enterprise,and vicarious liability claims against and adac.
the only claims currently before the district court relate to spreading the satanism and crest toothpaste rumors.the district court still must decide whether amway and its distributors fraudulently spread the satanism rumor and violated rico,unlawfully disparaged products under the lanham act,or unlawfully disparaged products under texas business and commerce code.has never identified evidence that,adac,or internet spread the satanism or crest toothpaste rumor.in i,we affirmed the decision that and adac could not face alter ego,single business enterprise,or vicarious liability for the actions of amway or downline distributors.at.we may safely assume that none of the claims currently pending before the district court relates to,adac,or internet.
argues that the district court lacked jurisdiction to enter sanctions,because already had appealed the final decision on the merits.perfecting an appeal deprives the district court of jurisdiction to hear matters connected to the appeal.offshore logistics,mut.marine office,cir.unit a.
the district court,however,retains jurisdiction to resolve motions for sanctions and attorneys fees while a judgment on the merits is pending on appeal such motions are collateral to the merits,so the appeal does not divest the district court of jurisdiction argues that by attaching the label second amended final judgment to the order resolving sanctions and attorneys fees,the district court deprived itself of jurisdiction.does not cite any authority for the proposition that the label alone should have this effect.
the district court did not alter the terms of its judgment on the merits and only repeated its earlier conclusions.even if the court lacked jurisdiction to alter the judgment on the merits,it retained jurisdiction to resolve sanctions and fees issues we decline to vacate and remand to force the district court to add a different label to the same order.that court plainly had jurisdiction to enter its order.
according to,a district court may shift reasonable fees to any attorney who so multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously.the court can shift fees only to counsel,not to parties 
the district court must find that the sanctioned attorney multiplied the proceedings both unreasonably and vexatiously.fdic calhoun,cir.this requires evidence of bad faith,improper motive,or reckless disregard of the duty owed to the court.edwards motors,cir.section only authorizes shifting fees that are associated with the persistent prosecution of a meritless claim.browning kramer,cir citation omitted internal quotation omitted.the courts often use repeated filings despite warnings from the court,or other proof of excessive litigiousness,to support imposing sanctions.ass of gov t employees fed of fed.employees,cir.to prevent the courts from dampening the legitimate zeal of an attorney in representing her client,browning kramer,cir,we have interpreted as penal and construed it in favor of the sanctioned party,fdic conner,cir.

we have not articulated a very precise standard for determining when to award a prevailing defendant attorneys fees.in fuji photo film,shinohara shoji kabushiki kaisha,cir,we affirmed the refusal to grant fees based on a finding that the plaintiff had brought the action in good faith,but we did not address the role of the objective merits of the plaintiff suit in determining the existence of exceptional status.
on remand,the district court should consider the objective merits of the suit when determining whether acted in good faith.in the context of prevailing plaintiffs,we have considered the existence or nonexistence of reasonable legal defenses probative of good or bad faith the vast majority of circuits have developed a separate test for prevailing defendants under a and permit district courts to consider directly the objective merits of the suit fuji photo precludes us from doing so,but district courts nonetheless should consider the merits and substance of the civil action when examining the plaintiffs good or bad faith.we review the award of attorneys fees under the lanham act for abuse of discretion,and the court finding as to whether the case is exceptional for clear error.seatrax,sonbeck int l,cir citation omitted.
the sanctions orders in favor of,adac,and internet share two common,fatal flaws.first,the district court shifted fees and costs under to rather than to its counsel.second,the court failed to specify which statute authorized shifting which fees,to separate the vexatious conduct or exceptional features from its reasons for deciding the claims on the merits,or identify the link between the objectionable conduct or exceptional claims and the fee award size.standing alone,these errors justify vacating and remanding.to provide guidance on remand,however,we review the propriety of the individual sanctions orders.
the district court shifted fees from to only under.the sanctions order explains that vexatiously and unreasonably multiplied the proceedings by filing groundless claims,pursuing those claims through the discovery process,refusing to dismiss the defendant from the case,and in the end,failing to offer any evidence during its supporting its allegations.requested only the fees it had expended between the time it lost on the motion for summary judgment and the entry of.the district court,however,shifted total fees and costs of in favor of.
on summary judgment and at trial,presented evidence of the following links between amway and amway owners created amway share the same address and telephone number amway and both engage in the distribution of amway products amway pays its employees to provide administrative,accounting,and selling services for amway pays expenses amway and not compensates officers and directors members of amway founding families own both and amway and serve as their officers and directors does not hold formal officer or director meetings and amway delegated the express authority for to control downline distributors by enforcing amway rules of conduct,taking corrective actions,or terminating a distributorship.
when moved for summary judgment,the court considered the above evidence sufficient to create a fact question about participation in an illegal pyramid scheme,indirect liability for amway actions when spreading the rumor,and vicarious or respondeat superior liability for the actions of downline distributors.the court found that the close links between amway,and downline distributors justified including as a party at trial.despite these conclusions at summary judgment,the sanctions order labeled the legal claims groundless and declared that should have dismissed.
the court committed three errors in the sanctions order.first,it assessed the sanctions against the party.we must remand for the court to determine whether counsel should bear these costs 
second,the court failed to explain which claims pursued vexatiously and unreasonably.several of these claims had potential merit.does not contest its status as an upline distributor for amway.although we held in i that lacked standing to bring the lanham act illegal pyramid claim,we described the standing question as a close legal issue.i,at,describing two questions of first impression.should not be penalized for forcing to incur defense costs against a legal claim that rested on a solid factual basis and a close legal question.
in i,we refused to consider the alter ego,single business enterprise,and vicarious liability claims against because did not present a coherent argument on appeal.id.at.we noted that the alter ego and single business enterprise theories appeared implausible never offered proof of an inequitable result that would justify piercing the corporate veil or imposing alter ego or single business enterprise liability.we did not,however,address the merits of the vicarious liability question.at summary judgment,the district court found that created a fact question about vicarious liability for the actions of downline distributors.if,as asserts on appeal,failed to provide any factual basis for the claims at trial,the court should have explained that absence of support in its sanctions order.the record of the decisions on the merits can not,standing alone,support the sanctions award.
finally,the court did not provide an explanation for the amount of fees awarded.requested only fees from the denial of the motion for summary judgment forward,but the court should have provided an explanation for assessing even these limited fees.if failed to provide any support for its claims at summary judgment,the court could have granted motion for summary judgment but,instead,it refused motion for summary judgment and eventually imposed sanctions on for failing to dismiss voluntarily the claims against.
the court does not explain this duty to dismiss or its application to the case before it.does a plaintiff who provides summary judgment evidence of liability bear the burden of dismissing a defendant if it can not prove the claims at trial or,does the plaintiff have a right to present its weak evidence to a jury why did the district court impose much larger fees in favor of adac,using almost identical language the scant explanation raises many questions and can not justify imposing sanctions in such an unusual posture on remand,the court should reconsider its decision and should provide a more complete explanation for whatever decision it makes 
the adac sanctions order contains the same language justifying sanctions under,without any further explanation.the adac sanctions order,however,differs from the sanctions order in two important ways.first,the court also identified a as a vehicle for shifting fees and costs.second,the court shifted adac entire costs for defending the litigation,from start to finish,thus imposing in sanctions.
presented the following evidence to link amway and adac at summary judgment and trial the founders and current owners of amway created the adac adac membership consists solely of amway distributors amway participates in the selection of half the adac board members the adac board meets three times a year to consider ways to improve amway distributorships and makes recommendations to amway amway officers unilaterally approve the minutes of adac meetings amway officers routinely use adac letterhead to communicate with distributors amway documents and founders describe the relationship as a partnership adac establishes speaking guidelines and works in cooperation with amway to develop rules and regulations adac board serves as a tribunal for hearing grievances against distributors and makes recommendations to amway.adac makes only recommendations to amway,however,and lacks authority to discipline or sanction any distributor.
when adac moved for summary judgment,the district court found that had created a fact issue as to whether adac could face indirect liability under texas alter ego or single business enterprise theory.the court considered the above evidence sufficient to demonstrate a close link between amway and adac and to raise factual issues about indirect liability.despite the court earlier conclusions at summary judgment,the adac sanctions order reflects a belief that claims so lacked substance that should not have impleaded adac.
the court committed the same errors under that we identified in discussing the sanctions award.first,the court impermissibly used to sanction a party.second,the court did not identify which legal claims lacked all merit or explain its reasons for imposing sanctions independently from its reasons for deciding the merits.third,the court failed to justify the amount of the sanctions.it should have isolated specific unnecessary and dilatory proceedings it then could have shifted the costs associated with those proceedings.
moreover,the district court does not even begin to justify shifting all of adac defense costs while shifting only a portion of defense difference of over.the close relationship between amway and adac appears to have justified impleading adac,and the court did not explain at what point the pursuit of this litigation became vexatious and unreasonable.
the court also failed to make findings sufficient to justify sanctions under a.first,the court did not separate the fees shifted under from those shifted under a.second,the adac sanctions order does not restrict the fees shifted to those incurred in defense of a lanham act claim,and the court did not find that the lanham act and act claims were too intertwined to disentangle.third,the court provided only a cursory explanation for the reasons it believed that the case was exceptional or that acted in bad faith.
the internet sanctions order emphasizes that the district court had only lanham act illegal pyramid claim before it at summary judgment.the sanctions order then explains that the court disposed of that claim at summary judgment because lacked standing to bring the claim.the internet sanctions order concludes that for all the reasons,unreasonably and vexatiously multiplied the proceedings and acted in bad faith.the court shifted total costs and fees of based on these findings.
presented more tenuous evidence of amway connection with internet dexter yager three sons formed internet and purchased the assets of freedom distributing company,their father tool company internet provides business support materials to amway distributors and internet success depends on selling amway motivational materials.internet,however,is not a downline distributor,and it has customers outside the amway distribution network.
although presented the weakest factual case against internet at summary judgment,the internet sanctions order does not sufficiently justify shifting fees.in addition to repeating the mistakes made in the and adac orders,the court failed to find that the case against internet lacked factual support but,instead,relied on a recitation of its reasons for granting the motion for summary g failure to satisfy the prudential standing requirements of the lanham act.
belief that it might have standing under the lanham act,however,could well be considered reasonable for purposes of.certainly could have asserted the claim in good faith as defined by fuji photo and a.the question of standing under the lanham act to sue for an illegal pyramid scheme was difficult and novel.i,at.a party that predicates its legal claim on a controversial and unsettled legal theory should not face sanctions under either or a when the court ultimately rejects the claim 
the orders appealed from are vacated and remanded for further proceedings as appropriate.
in september,the utah district court granted defendants joint motion for summary judgment and dismissed the a claim,holding that the misrepresentation did not relate to a product within the meaning of the lanham act.in march,the utah court granted summary judgment to the defendants on the defamation per se,vicarious liability,and negligent supervision claims,then entered a final judgment dismissing all of claims.the tenth circuit reversed,haugen,cir,and remanded for further proceedings on the lanham act disparagement and utah state law disparagement claims.
