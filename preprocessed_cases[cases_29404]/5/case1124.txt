may a state department of corrections be held liable for prison officials failure to correct a hostile work environment that is the result of male prisoners sexual harassment of female guards we answer that question,yes.
the california department of corrections and rehabilitation cdcr and three pelican bay state prison pelican bay administrators appeal a judgment in favor of deanna freitag,a former correctional officer in the prison secure housing unit.freitag alleged that the cdcr and pelican bay were delinquent in addressing the sexually hostile environment created by prison in confronting the pervasive practice at pelican bay of inmate exhibitionist masturbation directed at female that she was retaliated against and ultimately terminated due to her repeated complaints regarding the problem.a jury agreed,finding that the cdcr maintained a hostile work environment and retaliated against freitag in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,and that the three administrators retaliated against her for engaging in constitutionally protected speech in violation of.we conclude that substantial evidence supports the jury verdict that the cdcr violated freitag rights under title vii,but we remand her first amendment claim to the district court for reconsideration in light of the supreme court decision in garcetti ceballos,d.as a result,we also remand the jury damages award to the same extent.we affirm the district court grant of injunctive relief,however.
in january,deanna freitag transferred to pelican bay state prison from chuckwalla valley state prison,where she had been a correctional officer for several years,in order to be closer to her family.pelican bay,a maximum security prison in crescent city,california,includes a secure housing unit shu which incarcerates many of the state most violent criminals.inmates in the shu are subjected to harsher and more restrictive conditions than exist at any other prison in the state system 
on september,freitag was working a relief shift in the shu control tower when she witnessed inmate x standing naked in the exercise yard masturbating.freitag opened a prison pod door and directed inmate x,over an intercom,to return to his cell,at which point he ripped a temperature gauge off the pod wall,screamed sexually derogatory obscenities,and threatened to kill her.freitag was instructed by her direct supervisor not to document the incident,but she nevertheless completed a disciplinary report,or form,charging inmate x with threatening a public official.freitag reported several additional incidents of inmate exhibitionist masturbation in late in documents called chronos,or forms,which are placed in inmates central files but ordinarily do not form the basis for disciplinary action.in one instance,freitag was working a meal shift in the shu when an inmate ejaculated onto a tray she was clearing.
in early january,freitag accepted a permanent position in the shu.shortly thereafter,on january,she was in the shu control tower when she witnessed inmate y openly masturbating in the prison yard.freitag demanded that inmate y stop,but he refused he continued to masturbate in view of the control tower for approximately thirty minutes until his yard shift ended.freitag documented the incident in a form.on february,inmate z exited the upper tier shower room and,while looking at freitag in the control tower,into which he had a direct view from the tier,masturbated while shouting her name and proclaiming that he was coming inside her.freitag completed a form detailing the incident and attempted to discipline inmate z with ten days of escort status,which was approved by a supervising captain.however,lieutenant david carmichael discarded the form and informed freitag that she could not place inmate z on escort status,explaining to her that she was the only officer who had a problem with inmate z,and that it only sex.
on march,inmate x again openly masturbated in the shu yard while freitag was on duty in the control tower.she submitted a form charging inmate x with indecent exposure,to which he pled guilty,but he was not assessed credit forfeiture as a result of the disciplinary proceeding because prison administrators delayed in processing the paperwork.also on march,freitag sent a memorandum to barry,carmichael supervisor,with a copy to robert ayers,the warden at pelican bay,complaining that her reports of inmate misbehavior were being denied or thrown away,thus causing her authority and discretion to be undermined.on march,she issued inmate x another form for indecent exposure.
on april,inmate x requested that freitag open the shower door to allow him to return to his cell.when she did so,he pushed his towel into the doorway and,standing naked,masturbated in front of her until she and another correctional officer escorted him back to his cell.freitag submitted a form charging inmate x with indecent exposure,but the violation was subsequently changed by a supervisor to willful delay of a peace officer,a offense.later that day,freitag sent a letter to teresa schwartz,the associate warden in charge of the shu,chronicling the conduct of inmates x and z,complaining that her supervisors were procrastinating in responding to the sexually abusive behavior,and recommending enforcement of the cdcr policy of referring repeat offenders to the district attorney office for prosecution.she also stated for the supervisors calloused exchange of me,and other female staff,as a sexual favor to gain inmate x cooperation,i should be recompensed for my injury.
on april,freitag wrote a letter to cal terhune,the cdcr director,in which she alleged that inmate x was causing a hostile worksite,that her s upervisors have delayed responding and been reluctant to respond,and that t here has been no support to prosecute inmate x for his sexual attacks and harassment.several days later,on april,freitag was called to a meeting with schwartz and.at the meeting,schwartz informed freitag that she was being relieved of her duty in the shu pending a psychiatric evaluation schwartz stated that the prison was taking the action in response to freitag incoherent memoranda regarding inmate harassment.schwartz also threatened to terminate her.freitag was permitted to return to the shu only after the evaluation deemed her fit for duty.
on july,the day after freitag returned to the shu,she witnessed inmate y masturbating in the yard.she submitted a form charging him with indecent exposure,but her supervisors declined her recommendation that he be disciplined with escort status.on july,freitag wrote another memorandum to ayers requesting that officers in the shu receive additional training on how to manage inmates with behavioral problems.she detailed an incident that occurred the day before in which inmate y refused to be handcuffed by two correctional officers,one of whom allegedly responded by slamming the cuff port door on the prisoner hands.
on july,pelican bay initiated an internal affairs ia investigation of freitag.the investigation was initiated by ayers and arose from purported factual inaccuracies in freitag memorandum regarding the july incident involving inmate on august,ayers initiated another ia investigation of freitag allegations that her supervisors were destroying her disciplinary reports.the request submitted by ayers alleged that freitag had made slanderous accusations against other staff.
on august,freitag filed a formal complaint with the california department of fair employment and housing dfeh.she alleged that she had been sexually harassed by pelican bay inmates,that she complained about the harassment to supervisors glen rodman,carmichael,schwartz,ayers,and terhune,that my employer did not take the proper steps to address my complaint,and that in retaliation for her complaints she was threatened by schwartz with termination and temporarily relieved of duty in the shu.augustine lopez,the prison equal employment opportunity coordinator,prepared the institution response,which concluded that freitag allegations were unsubstantiated.as part of his investigation,lopez interviewed ayers and several other pelican bay administrators,but he acknowledges that he later destroyed the notes from those interviews.
on august,freitag sent a letter to california state senator richard polanco in which she alleged that she and other female correctional officers were regularly subjected to sexually abusive behavior in the shu and that supervisors failed to respond adequately to her complaints regarding the inmate conduct.she also claimed that her disciplinary reports either were ignored completely or were not acted upon in sufficient time to permit the disciplining of inmates.she sent a second letter to polanco dated september,with a copy to terhune,in which she further described the mistreatment that she received from pelican bay inmates and staff.in october,polanco contacted the california office of the inspector general ig,a state agency that oversees the cdcr,and requested that it initiate an investigation of the allegations in freitag letters.the ig sent several investigators,including senior deputy inspector general richard ramsdell,to pelican bay from november to december,they interviewed dozens of prison inmates and employees,including freitag,reviewed the inmates central files,and contacted the del norte county district attorney office regarding the referral of indecent exposure complaints from the prison.freitag also exchanged letters with ramsdell during the investigation.
the ig published a report of its investigation on july.the findings were uniformly and pointedly damning the agency determined that inmates in the shu regularly subject female correctional officers to lewd exhibitionism and exhibitionist masturbation supervisors and top administrative staff at pelican bay have not responded appropriately to complaints about inmates directing exhibitionist masturbation toward female staff members and have made little effort to take advantage of the options available to control exhibitionist masturbation behavior the security housing unit is not effectively using the prison disciplinary process and available legal sanctions in handling exhibitionist masturbation cases pelican bay had stopped referring exhibitionist masturbation cases to the district attorney and warden ayers had taken no definitive actions to address exhibitionist masturbation directed at female correctional officers by male inmates.the ig also reported that lopez informed one state investigator that t he reason the inmates hit on the female correctional officers is that they a bunch of lesbians.
in addition to the two ia investigations of her initiated by ayers in july and august,freitag was targeted by at least two more investigations following her dfeh complaint and letters to polanco.on september,ayers requested an ia investigation regarding freitag purported improper use of state resources,such as copy machines and telephones,for the purpose of pursuing her complaints.on october,correctional captain paul dillard sent ayers a memorandum recommending that ia investigate allegedly false claims by freitag that a correctional officer contaminated an inmate food in may of that year.freitag was formally interviewed regarding the latter charge on november.
on january,while the ig investigation was being conducted,schwartz sent freitag a preliminary notice of adverse action stemming from the ia investigation into freitag report of the july,incident involving inmate ayers recommended that freitag be suspended for five days as a result of the investigation determination that she falsified facts in her written memorandum describing the incident.on february,while the agency investigation was still in progress,schwartz sent a second notice of adverse action,this time arising out of the prison finding that freitag made false accusations regarding her fellow officer contaminating the inmate food.as a result of the findings of the two ia investigations,freitag was terminated shortly before the office of the inspector general issued its report.freitag then initiated an administrative appeal of her termination before the california state personnel board.as far as the record before us reveals,the administrative appeal was still pending at the time the parties filed their briefs with this court.
freitag filed her initial complaint in the district court on june.she alleged that the cdcr is liable under title vii of the civil rights act of for sexual harassment pursuant to a hostile work environment theory the cdcr is liable under title vii for retaliation ayers,schwartz,carmichael,rodman,dillard,george neotti and lopez are liable under for violating various of her constitutional rights and all of the defendants are liable under for conspiring to violate her constitutional rights.freitag sought compensatory and punitive damages as well as injunctive relief.
on march,the district court granted in part and denied in part the defendants motion for summary judgment.it denied the motion with respect to the following claims the title vii hostile work environment claim against the cdcr,the title vii retaliation claim against the cdcr based upon adverse employment actions not including freitag termination,and the claim that the individual defendants retaliated against freitag in violation of her first amendment rights.a jury trial commenced in march.freitag and several of her fellow female correctional officers testified regarding the sexually abusive environment in the shu and the lack of an adequate institutional response.freitag expert on prison administration,william katsaris,testified that pelican bay was the only institution i have come across that has a serious problem with exhibitionist masturbation.he stated that prisons throughout the country have controlled the problem in part by installing finish to control booth windows so that officers can see out but inmates can not see in he further testified that pelican bay administrators could have taken,but failed to take,other corrective actions such as imposing serious disciplinary measures for sexual misconduct,restraining sexually abusive inmates or taking away their yard privileges,and working with the district attorney office to prosecute serious and repeat offenders.in addition,the ig report was admitted into evidence over the defendants objection,and ramsdell testified extensively regarding the agency investigation into freitag complaints and the prison failure to take the requisite corrective actions.
the jury returned a unanimous verdict on april.it found the cdcr liable under title vii for sexual harassment and retaliation,and ayers,schwartz,and lopez liable under for retaliation in violation of freitag first amendment rights.it awarded freitag in economic damages and in damages,and in punitive damages against each ayers,schwartz,and lopez.the verdict form did not require the jury to determine how much each defendant was liable for on each found the cdcr and ayers,schwartz,and lopez jointly and severally liable for the entire amount of compensatory damages.
on may,freitag moved to amend the judgment to include permanent injunctive relief.the district court granted her motion in part,finding that this court has the authority to fashion an injunction that benefits not only plaintiff,but all female correctional officers and other staff members at pelican bay who have been or may be harmed by cdc unlawful conduct.the court entered the following permanent injunction 
the california department of corrections its agents,officers,successors in office,employees and all persons acting in concert or participating with the department are permanently enjoined from engaging in any employment practices,or taking any other personnel action,for the purpose or with the effect of maintaining a sexually hostile work environment at pelican bay state prison,or otherwise discriminating against any pelican bay state prison employee on the basis of sex.the california department of corrections,its agents,officers,successors in office,employees and all persons acting in concert or participating with the department are further enjoined from engaging in any employment practices,or taking any other personnel action,for the purpose or with the effect of retaliating against any pelican bay state prison employee for complaining about,or otherwise opposing,practices made unlawful by title vii.
the district court denied freitag request that the court mandate specific measures to alleviate the problems she raised,opting instead to refer the matter to a special master with the authority to monitor compliance with the injunction and to develop a remedial plan.the court also awarded freitag attorneys fees.
the cdcr,ayers,schwartz,and lopez appealed,raising the following arguments the cdcr can not as a matter of law be liable under title vii for a hostile work environment created by inmates and,even if it could be liable,substantial evidence does not support the jury verdict of liability in this case substantial evidence does not support the jury verdict that the cdcr is liable for retaliation under title vii substantial evidence does not support the verdict against ayers,schwartz,and lopez the award of compensatory and punitive damages is not supported by substantial evidence and the district court abused its discretion in granting injunctive relief.
we review a district court conclusions of law de novo.see tritchler county of lake,cir.a jury verdict,including a damages award,must be upheld if supported by substantial evidence.see pavao pagay,cir.the district court grant of injunctive relief is reviewed for an abuse of discretion and for the application of correct legal principles.see fortyune american,cir.
hostile work environment 
we first address the cdcr contention that it can not,as a matter of law,be liable under title vii for maintaining a hostile work environment caused by inmate misconduct.the contention is unsupported by the entire weight of case authority in this circuit and others,and we are compelled to reject it.
in the ninth circuit,employers are liable for harassing conduct by where the employer either ratifies or acquiesces in the harassment by not taking immediate corrective actions when it knew or should have known of the conduct.folkerson circus circus,cir see also little windermere relocation,cir.in recognizing that employers may be liable for conduct,we,along with several other circuits,see,berry delta airlines,cir turnbull topeka state,cir crist focus homes,cir,have relied in part upon a regulation of the equal employment opportunity commission that provides that employers may be held liable for the acts of where the employer knows or should have known of the conduct and fails to take immediate and appropriate corrective action.e.this theory of liability is grounded not in the harassing act,inmate rather in the employer negligence and ratification of the harassment through its failure to take appropriate and reasonable responsive action.see galdamez potter,cir.
notwithstanding the clarity of our law on this point,the defendants request that we become the first court in the country to carve out an exception to title vii whereby prisons,due to their distinctive character and problems,and in particular their inherently hostile environment,are immune from lawsuits by correctional officers arising from sexual harassment by inmates.in support of this position,the defendants cite several cases in which federal courts have treated prisons differently in the context of civil rights claims.for example,in slayton ohio department of youth services,cir,in which a female correctional officer at a juvenile detention center alleged that the institution maintained a sexually hostile work environment caused in large part by inmate misconduct,the sixth circuit noted 
prisoners,by definition,have breached prevailing societal norms in fundamentally corrosive ways.by choosing to work in a prison,corrections personnel have acknowledged and accepted the probability they will face inappropriate and socially deviant behavior.
nevertheless,the slayton court upheld a jury verdict in favor of the plaintiff,ruling that,although allegations of inmate misconduct alone can not support a hostile work environment claim,this general rule against prison liability for inmate conduct does not apply when the institution fails to take appropriate steps to remedy or prevent illegal inmate behavior.id.
the defendants also cite the following language from powell morris,d,
the propensity of courts to decline imposing liability for prisoner acts is based on solid logical and practical foundations anyone who works at a prison must expect some interactions it is absurd to expect that a prison can actually stop all obscene comments and conduct from its who have been deemed unsuited to live in normal society.
however,the defendants neglect to cite the very next sentence of the powell opinion the most we can expect and require prisons to do is to implement and enforce policies reasonably calculated to minimize such harassment and protect the safety of its employees.id.the defendants also cited powell in the district court but there too failed to include the abovementioned sentence,an act the district judge characterized as illustrative of defendants tendency to mischaracterize the relevant case law.notably,although the defendants cite powell in support of their argument that title vii does not impose liability on a prison employer for a hostile work environment caused by inmates under a negligence theory of direct liability,they fail to refer to a passage in the opinion that is far more pertinent to the present case courts have repeatedly declined to impose sexual harassment liability upon correctional institutions for the sexually offensive conduct of inmates,as long as the defendant institution took proper preventative and remedial steps with regard to inmate behavior.id.emphasis added.
in short,the defendants cite no authority,and we have found none,holding that prisons are uniquely exempt from liability for sexual harassment under title vii,nor have they proffered any evidence that congress intended prison employers to be thus exempt.further,we see no persuasive argument,legal or otherwise,to support the novel position that the defendants take on this issue.nothing in the law suggests that prison officials may ignore sexually hostile conduct and refrain from taking corrective actions that would safeguard the rights of the victims,whether they be guards or inmates.as the district court found,even in an inherently dangerous working environment,the focus remains on whether the employer took reasonable measures to make the workplace as safe as possible.the cdcr is not,by simple virtue of its status as a correctional institution,immune under title vii from a legal obligation to take such measures and to protect its employees to the extent possible from inmate sexual abuse.
the next question is whether substantial evidence supports the jury finding that the cdcr is liable for maintaining a hostile work environment in this case.a plaintiff asserting a title vii claim under a hostile work environment theory must show the existence of a hostile work environment to which the plaintiff was subjected,and that the employer is liable for the harassment that caused the hostile environment to exist.see little,at citing faragher city of boca raton,d.to establish the existence of a hostile work environment,a plaintiff must prove that she was subjected to verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature,this conduct was unwelcome,and this conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment.id.internal quotations omitted.the third element requires us to consider the totality of the circumstances and whether the harassment was both objectively and subjectively abusive.id.with respect to the question of liability for harassment caused by a third party,the employer corrective measures must be reasonably calculated to end the harassment the reasonableness of the corrective action will depend on,inter alia,the employer ability to stop the harassment and the promptness of the response.see ellison brady,cir internal quotations omitted see also galdamez,at.
the jury found that freitag was subjected to a hostile work environment due to inmate sexual misconduct,and that the cdcr was liable because it failed to take prompt and effective remedial action reasonably calculated to address the misconduct.we conclude with little difficulty that substantial evidence supports each finding.with respect to the finding that freitag was subjected to a hostile employment environment first,there is sufficient evidence that freitag was repeatedly exposed to conduct of a sexual nature.the jury heard testimony and reviewed exhibits that established that freitag witnessed inmates masturbating in an exhibitionist manner,oftentimes while they directed verbal taunts and crude remarks at her.second,the defendants argument to the contrary notwithstanding,there was substantial evidence that freitag did not welcome the sexually abusive conduct merely by accepting a job in the shu.although it certainly would have been reasonable for freitag to anticipate substantial inmate misbehavior,given the severity of the crimes committed by those incarcerated at pelican bay,see slayton,at,she also had reason to expect that prison officials would seek in good faith to control the most extreme forms of sexual misconduct.in any event,contemplating some difficulties is a far cry from welcoming a constant barrage of sexual abuse that,according to the testimony at trial,was allowed to continue virtually unfettered for the duration of freitag employment at the prison.third,substantial evidence supports the jury finding that the exhibitionist masturbation was sufficiently severe or pervasive to constitute abuse.on this point,the defendants argue that,following freitag april,memorandum to schwartz,which they characterize as her first complaint to prison administrators,she witnessed only three incidents of inmate masturbation.even accepting the defendants argument that the cdcr did not know about such behavior until april,a single incident of severe abuse can constitute a hostile work environment.see little,at citing clark county sch.dist.breeden,d.more important,however,the defendants time line misrepresents the ignores freitag march,memorandum to and ayers in which she complained that her disciplinary reports on inmate sexual misconduct were being ignored.the defendants tally thus does not account for the march and april incidents in which freitag was exposed to exhibitionist masturbation.we find no basis to overturn the jury determination on this issue.
the jury second principal the cdcr failed to take prompt,corrective,and reasonable action to address the issue of inmate sexual also supported by substantial evidence.the jury heard testimony on this question from,among others,katsaris,who testified that pelican bay is the only institution he has encountered with such a pervasive problem of inmate sexual misconduct.he testified regarding the corrective measures that other prisons have undertaken but that pelican bay had to that point ignored,including installing film on control towers and cells and imposing serious disciplinary measures on repeat offenders.the jury also had before it the ig report which enumerated the agency findings that,among other things,the administrative staff at pelican bay had not responded appropriately to the concerns expressed by female officers about exhibitionist masturbation,and the institution had not taken adequate steps to correct the problem.the defendants own brief acknowledges that t he correctional staff controls inmates primarily by the inmate disciplinary process,physical restraints,revocation of privileges,and referral for criminal prosecution,all measures the evidence shows it failed to invoke sufficiently in this case accordingly,there was more than enough evidence to support the jury finding that the prison failed to respond adequately or reasonably to the sexual abuse directed at freitag and other female correctional officers.
for these reasons,we affirm the jury verdict that the cdcr may be,and is in this case,liable under title vii for maintaining a hostile work environment at pelican bay.
title vii retaliation 
the defendants urge that substantial evidence does not support the jury finding that the cdcr is liable under title vii for retaliating against freitag.a plaintiff may meet his burden of proof for a claim of retaliation under title vii by showing,by a preponderance of the evidence,involvement in protected activity opposing an unlawful employment practice,an adverse employment action,and a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse action.see texas dep t of community affairs burdine,d citing mcdonnell douglas green,d.with respect to the first element,opposition clause protection will be accorded whenever the opposition is based on a reasonable belief that the employer has engaged in an unlawful employment practice.moyo gomez,cir internal quotes omitted emphasis in original.
the defendants make two related arguments as to cdcr retaliation.first,they contend that freitag belief that she opposed an unlawful employment action was unreasonable because title vii proscribes neither harassment by prison inmates nor a prison failure to take adequate steps to address the harassment.that argument is foreclosed by our analysis in the previous section,which requires no repetition here.second,the defendants argue that a n employer can not engage in unlawful retaliation if it does not know the employee has opposed or is opposing a violation of title vii.to the extent that their contention is that they did not know freitag was opposing unlawful sexual harassment,it is belied by freitag april,memorandum to schwartz,which stated that she should be recompensed for the injury she suffered due to the inmate misconduct she described and the prison failure to respond her april,memorandum to terhune,which alleged that the prison was doing nothing to address the hostile worksite created by inmate exhibitionist masturbation and her filing of a formal complaint with dfeh in august specifically alleging retaliation and harassment based upon her sex.to the extent that the defendants argue that they did not understand that the facts freitag alleged regarding their failure to respond to the problems constituted a violation of title vii,their argument is also without merit.the dispositive question is not whether the administrators at pelican bay believed that their failure to correct the complained of conditions constituted a violation of title vii,but rather whether they were aware that freitag had opposed that failure and whether freitag belief that their conduct was unlawful was reasonable.see burdine,at.notwithstanding the defendants erroneous opinion of the law,they had the requisite knowledge regarding freitag complaints.as freitag points out in her brief,the inability of the defendants to grasp the mandate of title vii,particularly in light of the clear language of,did not give them carte blanche to retaliate against her just because she evidently understood the law better than they did.
because the defendants raise no meritorious challenge to the jury finding that the cdcr is liable under title vii for retaliating against freitag,we affirm the verdict on this claim 
first amendment retaliation 
the jury found that ayers,schwartz,and lopez retaliated against freitag in violation of her first amendment rights.on appeal,the defendants challenge the jury finding with respect to each element required to establish a first amendment claim against a public employer the employee engaged in constitutionally protected speech,the employer took adverse employment action against the employee,and the employee speech was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse action.see coszalter city of salem,cir.there can be no serious dispute that substantial evidence supports the jury findings that the second and third elements were met with respect to ayers and schwartz ayers initiated several ia investigations of freitag shortly after she contacted polanco,and schwartz requested at least one ia investigation in the months after freitag complaints of sexual harassment.both also approved her suspension and termination and there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could have inferred that freitag speech was a substantial or motivating factor in these adverse actions.see coszalter,at holding that a proximity in time of between three and eight months could support an inference of retaliation.however,because the supreme court recent decision in garcetti ceballos,d,modified prior first amendment jurisprudence with respect to the first protected remand freitag claim to the district court for reconsideration in light of that decision 
in ceballos,the supreme court considered whether an internal memorandum written by a deputy district attorney to his supervisors regarding what he believed to be misconduct in an investigation was protected speech under the first amendment.at.it concluded that,under connick myers,d,the issue is not only whether the speech in question addresses a matter of public concern,but also whether it is made as a citizen.see id.at citing connick,at.the court then determined that ceballos did not speak as a citizen when he wrote the memorandum and thus did not engage in constitutionally protected speech,holding 
the controlling factor in ceballos case is that his expressions were made pursuant to his duties as a calendar deputy.that fact that ceballos spoke as a prosecutor fulfilling his responsibility to advise his supervisor about how best to proceed with a pending ceballos case from those in which the first amendment provides protection against discipline.we hold that when public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties,the employees are not speaking as citizens for first amendment purposes,and the constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline.
id.at internal citations omitted.ceballos first amendment claim failed because,w hen he went to work and performed the tasks he was paid to perform,ceballos acted as a government employee as opposed to a citizen for purposes of the first amendment.id.at.
the court in ceballos relied in large part upon its ruling in pickering board of education,d.it considered the case a useful starting point in its first amendment analysis,and the speech at issue in pickering a material contrast to that in the case before it.at.in pickering,a school teacher wrote a letter to a local newspaper criticizing the school board allocation of financial resources and the district superintendent alleged attempt to prevent teachers from opposing a proposed school bond.at.the teacher was subsequently dismissed and he sued,claiming that the letter was protected by the first amendment.id.at.the supreme court agreed,ruling that the teacher did not,by accepting his job,relinquish the first amendment rights he would otherwise enjoy as a citizen to comment on matters of public interest.id.at.in addition,the court noted that teachers are 
the members of a community most likely to have informed and definite opinions as to how funds allotted to the operation of the schools should be spent.accordingly,it is essential that they be able to speak out freely on such questions without fear of retaliatory dismissal.
we are confronted with two issues whether the jury was instructed to consider only speech that,in light of ceballos,is protected under the first amendment,and whether,if the jury was permitted to consider speech that is not protected,the instruction was harmless.with respect to the first issue,the jury was instructed in pertinent part as follows 
examples of speech protected by the first amendment include 
a reporting sexually hostile inmate conduct to agents of the california department of corrections,either formally or informally 
b documenting pelican bay state prison responses or failures to respond to plaintiff reports of sexually hostile inmate conduct 
c informing cal terhune,director of the california department of corrections,of either the inmates sexually hostile conduct or of pelican bay state prison responses or failures to respond 
d informing state senator richard polanco either of sexually hostile conduct or of the pelican bay state prison responses or failures to respond 
e reporting either the sexually hostile conduct or pelican bay state prison responses or failures to respond to the office of the inspector general or 
f cooperation with the investigation conducted by the office of the inspector general.
the defendants proffer two arguments why,in view of ceballos,this instruction is erroneous and requires us to reverse the jury verdict with respect to the claim.first,they assert that freitag did not in any instance speak as a citizen for purposes of constitutional analysis.second,they contend that freitag speech did not address a matter of public concern.we disagree with respect to items d,e,and f freitag letters to senator polanco and her written and oral communications with the inspector of which is related to the sexual abuse that she and other female correctional officers suffered at pelican bay.we think it clear that these communications are protected under the first amendment.
with respect to the defendants first argument,pickering and ceballos require the conclusion that freitag acted as a citizen when she wrote letters to senator polanco and communicated with the inspector general regarding her complaints of sexual harassment.her right to complain both to an elected public official and to an independent state agency is guaranteed to any citizen in a democratic society regardless of his status as a public employee.see pickering,at.indeed,these particular communications undoubtedly bore similarities to letters submitted by numerous citizens every day.ceballos.at citing pickering.under ceballos,freitag does not lose her right to speak as a citizen simply because she initiated the communications while at work or because they concerned the subject matter of her employment.id.at.the critical inquiry is instead whether freitag engaged in the relevant speech pursuant to her official duties.at.with respect to her contact with senator polanco and the ig,the answer is no.it was certainly not part of her official tasks to complain to the senator or the ig about the state failure to perform its duties properly,and specifically its failure to take corrective action to eliminate sexual harassment in its workplace.rather,it was freitag responsibility as a citizen to expose such official malfeasance to broader scrutiny.accordingly,in these instances,for purposes of the first amendment she spoke as a citizen.
as to the de
