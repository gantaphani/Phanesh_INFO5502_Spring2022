in these three consolidated appeals,we review orders on motions brought to enforce indemnification and attorney fees provisions contained in a written settlement agreement that was entered into by the appellants and respondents.the motions were brought under code of civil procedure section 
defendants tara alane moran,the moran family trust,rem ltd,the international horse foundation formerly known as the foundation for thoroughbred sciences,and creekside development,collectively moran brought the section motions,in which they contended that plaintiffs caesar wackeen,torrance management company,and ronald moran cadillac,together with certain others barbara wackeen and norman adams collectively,wackeen,failed to perform their obligations under the settlement agreement,and such failures caused moran to incur attorney fees and other costs totaling more than to defend four lawsuits that involved matters addressed in the settlement agreement 
whatever the substantive merits of moran claims to recover such costs from wackeen under the terms of the settlement agreement,the record does not reflect a jurisdictional basis for moran reliance on section.the trial court had no subject matter jurisdiction over this case when it decided moran section motions.while it is true that section permits a court to retain jurisdiction for the purpose of facilitating enforcement of the terms of a settlement agreement entered into by the parties in an action,in this case there was no request made for such continuing jurisdiction.
the disposition of this appeal turns on this provision for retention of jurisdiction,which the legislature added to section in.we hold that the effect of that amendment is to provide courts with continuing jurisdiction over parties and their litigation,for the purpose of enforcing their settlement agreement,despite a suit having been dismissed after the execution of the agreement.we further hold that in order for a court to assert such continuing jurisdiction,the parties request for retention of jurisdiction must satisfy the same formalities that courts and the legislature have imposed generally on section motions and the settlement agreements such motions seek to enforce.like section motions themselves,requests for retention of jurisdiction must be made prior to a dismissal of the suit.moreover,like the settlement agreement itself,the request must be made orally before the court or in a signed writing,and it must be made by the parties,not by their attorneys,spouses or other such agents.if,after a suit has been dismissed,a party brings a section motion for a judgment on a settlement agreement but can not present to the court a request for retention of jurisdiction that meets all of these requirements,then enforcement of the agreement must be left to a separate lawsuit.
here,these formal requirements for retention of jurisdiction to consider a section motion were not met by the parties.therefore,moran is precluded from using this case to seek enforcement of its rights under the settlement agreement,and all of the trial court orders must be reversed.if moran is to gain such enforcement relief,it must be by means of a timely filed separate action.the dismissal of this suit by wackeen did not adversely affect the settlement agreement itself or moran right to have it enforced.viejo bancorp,wood,supra,d at.
background of the case 
the good faith settlement and dismissals 
wackeen filed this action in april.various were also filed.thereafter,certain of the parties entered into an agreement to settle their claims the settlement agreement.in september,the trial court approved a code of civil procedure section good faith settlement motion brought by moran and others.under the terms of the settlement agreement,moran would convey certain real property to torrance management company,in consideration for a promissory note in the amount of million in favor of the international horse foundation and rem,and a promissory note in the amount of in favor of creekside development.the notes were secured with deeds of trust on the property.
the settlement agreement contained a broadly worded attorney fees provision in the event any party is required to employ attorneys to enforce the provisions of this agreement,or any part of any judgment entered hereon,or to prosecute or defend any action arising out of or related to this agreement,the court arbitration panel shall award the prevailing party reasonable attorneys fees.
the settlement agreement also contained an indemnification provision,which the trial court construed to obligate wackeen,torrance management company,and the aforementioned norman adams who signed the settlement agreement on behalf of torrance management company,to indemnify moran and other defendants for claims brought against them as a result of actions undertaken by such indemnitors.
throughout,both before and after the settlement agreement was signed,requests for dismissal of various defendants and were filed.wackeen asserts,and moran does not dispute,that the effect of all of these requests was a dismissal of all defendants and,and thus of the lawsuit itself.this dismissal of the suit occurred prior to the filing of moran section motions,and as we explain below,such timing presents important jurisdictional issues.
moran initial motion for a judgment to enforce the attorney fees clause 
in july,moran filed a section motion in the instant suit,seeking a judgment enforcing the attorney fees and indemnification clauses of the settlement agreement.according to moran motion,wackeen failed to live up to several of its obligations under that agreement.this included failing to deliver a recorded first position deed of trust to moran and then having an attorney file a baseless interpleader action in state court,which was settled on the eve of trial by written stipulation failing to make payments to moran on the million promissory note failing to make payments on the promissory note for initiating an interpleader action in federal court respecting funds that wackeen failed to pay to rem,the international horse foundation or the internal revenue service and initiating a bankruptcy case that the trial court in the instant action found was filed to prevent moran from foreclosing on property after wackeen failed to make payments on a promissory note as required by the settlement agreement 
in its section motion,moran alleged that these three agreement suits the state interpleader suit,the federal interpleader suit,and the bankruptcy suit,collectively,the three new suits were filed to harass moran and delay moran ability to enforce its legal rights,and caused moran to expend nearly in attorney fees and costs to deal with them.moran asserted that,under the attorney fees and indemnification provisions in the settlement agreement,it was entitled to recover such expenses from wackeen.
on march,the court granted moran motion in part.while it rejected moran claim for relief under the indemnification clause,it found that the state court interpleader suit was litigated to enforce provisions of the settlement agreement,the two federal suits were disputes arising out of the settlement agreement,moran was the prevailing party in those three new suits,and therefore moran was entitled to attorney fees,from wackeen,under the attorney fees provision of the settlement agreement.however,the court ruled that the evidentiary presentation made by moran was insufficient to permit a determination of the reasonableness of the attorney fees claimed,and moran was directed to submit a detailed itemization of fees within days.
the march,order was appealed by wackeen.wackeen challenges the finding that moran is entitled to relief under the attorney fees clause of the settlement agreement.moran filed a from the order,challenging the finding that it is not entitled to relief under the indemnification clause.
as directed by the trial court,moran filed a supplemental evidentiary presentation to support its claim to attorney fees.however,in the trial court estimation,the presentation was still not sufficiently detailed,and on april,the court denied moran section motion.moran filed an appeal from this order as well.
moran second motion for attorney fees 
moran became involved in a fourth suit after the instant case settled.the plaintiffs in that suit were torrance management company,and ronald moran cadillac.named as defendants were moran with the exception of tara alane moran and william malis,as trustee of the moran family trust.the complaint alleged several causes of action.it was based on the settlement agreement,and the plaintiffs sought,among other forms of relief,a temporary restraining order prohibiting moran from foreclosing on property that was a subject of the agreement.the application for the restraining order was denied on july,the complaint was never served on moran,and the suit was dismissed without prejudice by both plaintiffs.
based on this fourth suit,moran filed another section motion for a judgment to enforce,against wackeen,the attorney fees and indemnification clauses in the settlement agreement.a hearing on this motion was held on september.because it determined moran was entitled to recover attorney fees from wackeen under the attorney fees provision,the court declined to address moran indemnification claim.the court rejected wackeen contention that moran was not the prevailing party in the fourth suit.the court said that moran prevailed in its opposition to the issuance of a temporary restraining order,and that moran was the prevailing party under section of the code of civil procedure because a voluntary dismissal was entered in moran favor.the court determined the attorney fees for opposing the restraining order were reasonably incurred by moran,and it found that although moran was never served with the complaint in the fourth suit,it was not unreasonable for moran counsel to engage in some prophylactic preparation of moran defense to the suit,in light of the highly litigious history of the disputes between the parties.thus,the court allowed attorney fees for preparation of a demurrer,motion to strike and because such papers would need to be served and filed within days of moran being served with the complaint.fees in the total amount of were awarded in the court december,order,plus costs of.thereafter,wackeen filed an appeal from that order 
issues in this appeal 
the parties in these appeals have raised questions about the breadth of the attorney fees provision in the settlement agreement,the applicability of the indemnification provision,and the jurisdiction of the trial court to hear and decide moran section motions for a judgment to enforce those provisions.as we noted at the beginning of this opinion,the latter issue is dispositive of the appeals,and requires us to reverse the trial court orders because we find the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear moran motions.
discussion 
standard of review 
interpretation of section,and its application to this case,are issues of law.issues of law are subject to a reviewing court independent analysis.mamika barca th,d williams saunders th,d.
the effect of dismissing a suit after a settlement 
when a court has jurisdiction over the parties and subject matter of a suit,its jurisdiction continues until a final judgment is entered.riley superior court cal d.when there is a voluntary dismissal of an entire action,the court jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter terminates.in re casa de valley view owner supra,d at.in contrast,a dismissal by only some of the plaintiffs means the court is not divested of subject matter jurisdiction and the suit continues.ibid.
in viejo bancorp,wood,supra,d.viejo bancorp,the court was presented with a situation in which the parties had entered into a settlement agreement to resolve four separate actions the old action,and following execution of the settlement agreement,the old action was dismissed by the plaintiffs in its entirety.later,one of the parties to the settlement agreement,a bank,filed a new action the new suit for breach of contract and damages,and alleged that another of the settling parties,wood,had breached the agreement.the bank then made a section motion in this new suit to have the settlement agreement enforced.the trial court granted bank various forms of relief,pursuant to the motion,and wood appealed.
the reviewing court held that according to the terms of section,which addresses settlement agreements made in pending litigation,a motion made under that section for a judgment to enforce the terms of a settlement agreement can not be made in a suit other than the suit in which the settlement agreement was made.viejo,supra,at.the court stated that b y its very terms,section is limited to settlements reached in pending litigation.at.noting that the old action had been dismissed in its entirety and therefore was no longer pending,the court stated section relief was unavailable to the bank at that point in time.ibid.even though the trial court was persuaded wood had breached the agreement,the court resolution of this factual issue did not permit it to enter judgment in the old action.in short,in the absence of a motion under code of civil procedure section to vacate the dismissal,the court was without subject matter jurisdiction of the old action.citations.ibid.the court distinguished the case from cases in which only a partial dismissal is filed.in such cases,the trial court is never ousted of subject matter jurisdiction,and thus it ha s the power to perform further acts in the old action.id.at.the court also noted that s ince subject matter jurisdiction can not be conferred by consent,waiver,or estoppel,the court can not retain jurisdiction it has lost.citations.ibid.the court recognized that while the dismissal of a case is sometimes required by a settlement agreement,the simple answer is that no one forced bank to agree to a settlement which provided for dismissal of the old action no matter how toothless the agreement may seem in retrospect,it is not the province of the trial court to rewrite it and put in the teeth the complaining side now thinks it should have had.citation.ibid.
the instant case is controlled by viejo bancorp,not by in re casa de valley view owner where only some of the plaintiffs had dismissed their suit.wackeen has presented copies of several requests for the dismissals of various parties.though accomplished in this piecemeal fashion,there had been a dismissal of this entire action.therefore,unless the parties presented the trial court with a proper request to retain jurisdiction for purposes of section motions,the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over this case when it decided moran motions.
the requirements for a proper request for retention of section jurisdiction are addressed in the next section of this opinion.we note that personal jurisdiction is not an issue in this appeal since moran submitted to jurisdiction of its person by bringing the section motions,and wackeen waived a lack of personal jurisdiction by addressing the motions on their substantive merits.in re casa de valley view owner supra,d at.
section effect on dismissals 
as noted in footnote,ante,the legislature amended section in and,among other things,added the second sentence,which states that i f requested by the parties to a stipulated settlement,the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.like witkin witkin,cal.procedure ed proceedings without trial,we view this addition to section as the legislature solution to the problem presented in viejo bancorp,where the trial court lost jurisdiction of a case,and hence the ability to enforce a settlement agreement,because the terms of the stipulated settlement required or contemplated that the case would be dismissed.settlement agreements often,if not generally,require dismissals to be filed so that the litigation comes to an end.we construe the second sentence of section to mean,and we so hold,that even though a settlement may call for a case to be dismissed,or the plaintiff may dismiss the suit of its own accord,the court may nevertheless retain jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the settlement,until such time as all of its terms hav
