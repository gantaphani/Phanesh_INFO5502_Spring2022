this case involves an insurance dispute that remained in the district court for nearly ten years and that included a prior interlocutory appeal to this court.frit industries is an alabama corporation that manufactures micronutrients for fertilizers.in,three product liability actions were filed against frit in north carolina state court,alleging that exposure to a certain herbicide in frit micronutrient mix caused the plaintiffs cancer.those lawsuits were removed to federal court,and frit was ultimately granted summary judgment in all cases,which the fourth circuit recently affirmed.marsh grace.cir unpublished.
the exposure periods of the north carolina plaintiffs to the alleged carcinogen in frit product ranged from to at least.over these years,frit had numerous insurance policies providing both primary and umbrella coverage.first state insurance company provided insurance from april,to april.employers insurance of wausau provided insurance from may,to may.agrichem insurance company,provided insurance from april,to june.insurance company,provided insurance from june,and continued to provide it at the commencement of this lawsuit.mutual service casualty insurance company provided insurance from april,to april.frit gave notice of the product liability lawsuits to all of these insurers and requested that they protect frit interests.after receiving notice of the lawsuits,wausau acknowledged its duty to provide coverage for and defend frit.insurco,agrichem and the offshore insurers initially contacted counsel to defend frit,but subsequently withdrew and denied that they had any duty to defend frit.first state and mutual service defended frit under a reservation of rights.
on march,mutual service brought this declaratory judgment action in the middle district of alabama against frit,insurco,agrichem,first state,and wausau,seeking a determination of each insurer duties under their respective policies in the product liability actions.frit filed against mutual service and against the offshore insurers.first state and wausau who were defending frit in the product liability lawsuits along with mutual service filed against the offshore insurers.
the parties filed numerous motions,but we will refer only to those relevant to this appeal.the offshore insurers made an initial motion to dismiss based on lack of personal jurisdiction,which the district court denied.both frit and the offshore insurers moved for summary judgment.in april,the district court granted frit motion and denied the offshore insurers motion,finding that under alabama law the offshore insurers had a duty to defend frit in the product liability lawsuits.however,the district court did not include in its order a ruling on mutual service initial claim for reimbursement of defense costs already incurred in the product liability actions.
mutual service and frit each moved in may,to alter or amend the judgment under federal rule of civil procedure e.mutual service sought pro rata reimbursement of the amount it had spent defending frit in the product liability actions and a declaration that all of the insurers would proportionally share in the ongoing costs of defending frit.to protect their right to enforce the district court judgment,both mutual service and frit sought a permanent injunction against litigation had initiated in the isle of man 
the district court did not rule on these motions until.it granted frit motion to extend and make permanent the relief by enjoining from seeking adjudication in the isle of man of the district court ability to rule or to seek a substantive ruling on the duty to defend issue.the district court also granted mutual service request for allocation of defense costs among the insurers,but directed the parties to provide additional information with respect to the amount owed to mutual service.frit requested attorneys fees under federal rule of civil procedure,which the district court denied.
the parties raise a number of issues on appeal.the offshore insurers appeal the district court denial of their motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction,the grant of summary judgment to frit,the issuance of the permanent injunction against the isle of man litigation,and the ruling that they waived their objection to mutual service request for attorneys fees.mutual service appeals the partial denial of its request for prejudgment interest.frit appeals the denial of its request for attorneys fees.we address each claim in turn.
the offshore insurers first argue that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over them.we review the denial of a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction de novo.communication network,cir.
an analysis of whether personal jurisdiction exists requires a inquiry.first,we determine whether the exercise of jurisdiction is appropriate under the forum state statute.sculptchair,century arts,cir.second,we examine whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction over the defendant would violate the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution,which requires that the defendant have minimum contacts with the forum state and that the exercise of jurisdiction over the defendant does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.id.quoting int l shoe washington.
alabama statute authorizes alabama courts to assert jurisdiction to the fullest extent constitutionally permissible.see.civ.a sieber campbell,so d.thus,as the offshore insurers concede,the sole contested issue in our personal jurisdiction analysis is whether alabama exercise of jurisdiction over the offshore insurers violates due process.
the offshore insurers argue that they have insufficient contacts with alabama to justify alabama assertion of personal jurisdiction over them.they rely on affidavits of the companies secretaries who assert that each is a foreign corporation with its principal place of business in the cayman islands or the isle of man,and that neither has conducted business in alabama.
the district court,however,relied upon the affidavit of carl schauble,executive of frit,to find jurisdiction over insurco,agrichem and.schauble listed each of the liability policies the offshore insurers issued to frit in alabama with the dates of coverage,and he asserted that frit had paid in aggregate over in insurance premiums to the offshore insurers from alabama 
sufficient minimum contacts exist to justify alabama exercise of jurisdiction.as we have previously noted,since the supreme court decision in mcgee international life ins,d,it has been the law that a company with insurance obligations in a state in which it has no other business has submitted to the jurisdiction of the state courts.olivier merritt dredging,cir see also investors guar.fund,compass bank,so d,holding bermuda insurer was subject to suit in alabama because it contracted to provide a service in this state and insured a risk located in this state at the time of contracting.
we next consider whether alabama exertion of jurisdiction over the offshore insurers comports with notions of fair play and substantial justice.we consider the burden on the defendant,alabama interest in adjudicating the dispute,and the plaintiff interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief.sec carrillo,cir.
though there may be some burden on the offshore insurers to defend the suit in alabama,any burden is slight and not sufficient to defeat jurisdiction in this case.each insurer freely agreed as part of its insurance arrangement to defend its insureds against litigation,including litigation that arose in the united states.moreover,despite their status as foreign insurers,modern methods of transportation and communication have lessened the burden of defending a suit in a foreign jurisdiction.see id.quoting sculptchair,at.
alabama has a strong interest in the litigation because the suit involves the failure of a foreign insurer to pay claims due under policies issued to an alabama corporation.see posner essex ins,cir florida has a strong interest in seeing this matter resolved in florida,as the dispute involves the alleged failure to pay claims under insurance policies issued by a foreign company to cover florida property owned by a florida resident.rossman state farm mut.auto.ins,cir.
finally,mutual service interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief is strong in this case,as alabama appears to be the only forum available which would allow mutual service to join all defendants in the same lawsuit.in light of the considerations above,we hold that alabama exercise of jurisdiction over,agrichem,and insurco does not violate due process 
the offshore insurers next contend that the district court erred in granting frit motion for summary judgment.the district court held that the offshore insurers had a duty to defend frit in the product liability actions.the insurers offer two arguments first,that the district court erred in applying the law of alabama rather than the law of the cayman islands and second,that the district court abused its discretion by not allowing them to withdraw certain admissions.we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party against whom summary judgment was granted.southpace,acquisition group,cir.
in their motion for summary judgment,insurco,agrichem and argued that frit had agreed to a provision mandating that its insurance agreement would be governed by the law of the cayman islands.though there was no such provision in the insurance contracts,the offshore insurers point to a clause in the shareholder agreement frit signed in order to obtain insurance coverage from agrichem.agrichem is an insurance cooperative,and as a member frit was required to accept the shareholder agreement.the clause states this shareholder agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the cayman islands.the offshore insurers argued to the district court that this clause also mandated that the insurance policy be interpreted under the laws of the cayman islands.however,the offshore insurers offered no authority from the cayman islands.absent authority,the district court held that even if the provision in the shareholder agreement applied,the court would assume that the law of the cayman islands was the same as that of alabama.the district court concluded that,under alabama law,the offshore insurers had a duty to defend frit in the product liability actions.the offshore insurers argue that because they gave proper notice of the potential applicability of cayman law under federal rule of civil procedure,the district court holding was error.federal rule of civil procedure requires a party intending to raise an issue of foreign law to give notice of such in their pleadings or by other reasonable notice.the offshore insurers stated their intention to rely on cayman island law at the pretrial conference,thereby giving sufficient notice.see dp aviation smiths indus.aerospace and def,cir notice of intent should generally be given by the pretrial conference and the issue should appear in the pretrial order.however,the offshore insurers never offered citations to substantive cayman law.instead,they filed a motion for summary judgment based on alabama law.
the district court is not required to conduct its own research into the content of foreign law if the party urging its application declines to do so.although the court is permitted to take judicial notice of authoritative statements of foreign law,nothing requires the court to conduct its own research into obscure sources.mcghee arabian am.oil,cir.
the restatement second of conflict of laws provides w here either no information,or else insufficient information,has been obtained about the foreign law,the forum will usually decide the case in accordance with its own local law except when to do so would not meet the needs of the case or would not be in the interests of justice.restatement second of conflict of laws,cmt.h,at see also cavic grand bahama dev,cir citing restatement with approval seguros tepeyac,compania mexicana de seguros generales bostrom,cir accord republican comm.taylor,the offshore insurers did not direct the district court or this court to a single rule of law for the cayman islands,either by case law or by statute.they can not credibly argue that a different result would follow if that jurisdiction law were followed.the district court did not err in applying the law of alabama in this case.
next,the offshore insurers argue that the district court erred in denying their motion to withdraw certain admissions.because the control of discovery is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court,dukes south carolina ins,cir,we review the district court denial of a motion to withdraw admissions for abuse of discretion,perez county,cir,cert.denied,d.
the offshore insurers collectively argued in their summary judgment motion that they had no duty to defend frit in the product liability actions because their policies insured frit for only one million dollars in the aggregate,and frit had reached this limit in a previous lawsuit.the district court rejected their argument because the only insurer to have paid on its policy was insurco,and frit had separate policies with each company.moreover,in response to frit request under federal rule of civil procedure,the offshore insurers had already admitted that their respective policies provided separate limits for each year of coverage and that the policy limits had not been exhausted.the district court held that these admissions conclusively established that a single insurer prior payment did not exhaust the limits on coverage for all of the policies.
the offshore insurers moved to withdraw their admissions,and the district court denied their motion.the court determined that the offshore insurers were trying to change their litigation position and that frit would be prejudiced by the withdrawal of the admissions.see.b.after careful review of the record,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion.
the offshore insurers next argue that the district court erred in holding that they had waived their right to challenge the reasonableness and necessity of the attorneys fees mutual service incurred in defending the product liability actions and awarding the full amount of fees requested to mutual service.we review an award of attorneys fees for an abuse of discretion.see coastal fuels,florida express shipping,cir.an abuse of discretion occurs if the judge fails to apply the proper legal standard or to follow proper procedures in making the determination or bases an award or a denial upon findings of fact that are clearly erroneous.id.citing united states gilbert,cir.
following the award of summary judgment to frit,mutual service filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment,requesting that the district court order the offshore insurers to reimburse the domestic insurers pro rata for the fees and expenses they had incurred in defending frit in the product liability actions.the district court granted the motion,and directed all insurers to submit a joint statement of the amount the offshore insurers owed the domestic insurers and whether more would be owed in the future.
the parties could not agree on a dollar amount or on a method of allocation,but they did consent to have a magistrate judge resolve the dispute.the magistrate judge ruled that the offshore insurers had waived any objection to the reasonableness and necessity of the attorneys fees,adopted mutual service allocation proposal,and entered judgment with respect to expenses for mutual service.
under alabama law,a ttorney fees incurred as a proximate result of a refusal to defend the suit are appropriate damages for breach of contract.green standard fire ins.of alabama,so d.mutual service is entitled to recover its attorneys fees only to the extent that they are necessarily incurred and reasonable in amount.highlands underwriters ins.elegante inns,so d.in ruling that the offshore insurers had waived their objection to the reasonableness or necessity of the incurred fees,the magistrate judge relied on alabama law that an insurer who specifically denies liability on one ground waives all other grounds or defenses it could have raised but did not.see,home indem.reed equip,so d.
however,not all defenses are capable of being waived under this doctrine.rather,the only defenses capable of waiver are those which arise out of an express condition contained in the insurance contract.first alabama bank of montgomery,first state ins,cir wood mut.of new york life ins,reed,so d at waiver can not be applied to enlarge coverage of policy 
because the requirement that attorneys fees resulting from a fellow insurer breach of contract be reasonable and necessary arises from alabama law and not out of an express condition in any of the insurance contracts at issue,the offshore insurers did not waive their defense by first raising it in response to mutual service motion to alter or amend the judgment.the district court abused its discretion in ruling the defense waived.
mutual service offers us an alternate ground on which we could affirm the offshore insurers failed to raise the reasonableness of attorneys fees as an issue in dispute in the pretrial order.considering the broad discretion the trial court has to construe its own pretrial memoranda and the deference we give to the trial court decision to allow or disallow amendments to pretrial orders,we are unwilling to hold as a matter of law that the offshore insurers waived their objection when the district court never ruled on the issue.see santiago lykes,cir instructing jury on theory not in pretrial order was within judge discretion hodges united states,cir.therefore,we remand to the district court for consideration of this issue 
next,the offshore insurers argue that the district court failed to follow principles of international abstention when it permanently enjoined litigation filed by in the isle of man.we review the district court order granting an injunction for abuse of discretion.simmons conger,cir.

several years later,after the district court entered judgment on the duty to defend issue,frit and mutual service moved the district court to make its injunction permanent,which the district court granted.the permanent injunction expanded the prior injunction in that it prohibited from attempting to obtain a conflicting ruling in the isle of man on the duty to defend issue.
the offshore insurers argue that the district court should not have granted the injunction because it was contrary to the international abstention doctrine enunciated by this court in turner entm t degeto film gmbh,cir.however,the offshore insurers never moved to dismiss or stay this suit on the basis of international abstention.the injunction that the offshore insurers oppose was requested in the context of a rule e motion to alter or amend the judgment the district court issued the injunction after it issued its opinion on the duty to defend issue abstention at this point would be illogical,because the district court had already issued a binding decision on the same issue was trying to litigate in the isle of man.
when the injunction is requested after a previous judgment on the merits,there is little interference with the rule favoring parallel proceedings in matters subject to concurrent jurisdiction.thus,a court may freely protect the integrity of its judgments by preventing their evasion through vexatious or oppressive relitigation.laker airways sabena,belgian world airlines,see also bethell peace,cir.the district court was in the best position to know the history of the case and assess the strategic conduct of in seeking to relitigate the duty to defend issue in the isle of man litigation.in this case,the only conceivable benefit that the foreign defendants would reap if the district court injunction were overturned would be the right to attack the pending united states action in a foreign court.laker airways,at.we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in issuing the permanent injunction.

the magistrate judge failure to award interest since october is inconsistent with the foregoing paragraph,as the allocation that has already been adopted did include prejudgment interest.
