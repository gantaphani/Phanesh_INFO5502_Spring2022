plaintiff thomas horning appeals a judgment awarding attorney fees and costs under civil code section to defendant harold shilberg as the prevailing party on horning claim for breach of contract to convey real property.horning contends the trial court was not authorized to modify its orally announced tentative decision.horning further contends he should have been awarded as damages a commission of resale profits of and to cover the tax consequences of shilberg breach.finally,horning asserts the court abused its discretion in denying him leave to reopen the evidence to prove a previously unclaimed item of damage and in awarding attorney fees to shilberg.we affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
on december,shilberg entered into a written agreement to sell horning a property at seacoast drive,imperial beach,california,for.in the standardized,preprinted california association of realtors form contract contract prepared by horning,shilberg agreed to pay horning,a licensed real estate broker representing himself,a commission,designated as compensation for services,of percent of the purchase price upon the close of escrow 
paragraph k of the contract provided that horning had days after acceptance to provide shilberg with a loan prequalification letter.the prequalification letter was due on december.the contract further provided if buyer fails to provide such letter within that time,seller may cancel this agreement in writing within days after the time to provide the letter expires.shilberg canceled the contract on january,based on horning failure to provide shilberg a prequalification letter within days after acceptance of the contract.
horning sued shilberg for specific performance or,in the alternative,damages for shilberg breach of the contract to sell the seacoast drive property to him.horning later recorded a lis pendens on the property.shilberg successfully moved to expunge the lis pendens.in february or march,shilberg sold the seacoast drive property to another party for.
in a bench trial,horning sought the following damages as the commission shilberg agreed to pay him in the contract as the difference between the sales price and the contract price of the seacoast drive property and as taxes he was required to pay when he was unable to complete a starker exchange due to shilberg breach 
before closing argument,counsel for horning requested permission to submit a legal brief on horning alleged starker exchange tax damages.horning counsel told the court that if he determined there was no law to support his position,he would advise the court of that fact.horning counsel later advised the court that he would not be submitting any brief on the starker exchange issue because in light of the applicable regulations and decisions,horning is unable to further advance that position.
the court announced its oral decision on october.the court found shilberg breached the contract by canceling it in an untimely fashion and horning suffered damages in the amount of for the lost commission promised in the contract.the court then directed horning to prepare the judgment.
before a proposed judgment was lodged with the court,shilberg filed a notice of hearing and notice of objections to any decision,order or judgment awarding horning a broker commission and attorney fees costs.shilberg then filed an ex parte application for an order that the court stay the signing of any judgment pending a noticed hearing on shilberg objections to the court oral findings.at the ex parte hearing,horning attorney advised the court that he also intended to file objections to the court proposed rulings.the court then set a hearing on the motions and ordered that judgment would not be entered until after that hearing.horning filed a motion objecting to any decision failing to award plaintiff his consequential damages.both parties filed motions for attorney fees and costs.
after hearing,the court ruled that its previous oral findings of october,were tentative and could be modified under california rules of court rule a,e and f,because no judgment had been entered.the court then found that although shilberg breached the contract,horning suffered no damages because a broker acting as a principal in a transaction is not entitled to recover a commission as a matter of law.because horning suffered no damages,the court found shilberg was the prevailing party and was entitled to attorney fees and costs.the court awarded shilberg in attorney fees and as costs.
horning then orally moved to reopen the trial to present evidence that he incurred expenses totaling for an inspection and preliminary title report for the seacoast drive property.the court found this request untimely and denied it.
shilberg was instructed to prepare the judgment.no statement of decision was requested by either party and judgment in favor of shilberg was signed and filed by the court on february.

discussion 
itrial court had authority to modify its october,oral decision 
horning contends the trial court was without authority to modify its judgment announced on october,because there was no valid procedural predicate on which to base the modification.specifically,horning contends the october,oral decision was not tentative by any definition and that shilberg objections to any judgment awarding him a broker commission was not a procedurally proper mechanism by which to challenge the court legal conclusions in its october,decision.we conclude the court orally announced october,decision was tentative and properly subject to change.
rule a provides that after the trial of a question of fact by the court lasting more than one day,the court shall announce its tentative decision by an oral statement,entered in the minutes,or by a written statement filed with the clerk.that is exactly what happened in this case.after the trial concluded,the court had the parties return to court so it could give its oral ruling.
rule a specifically states that the tentative decision shall not constitute a judgment and shall not be binding on the court.instead,a court may enter a wholly different judgment than that announced in its statement of intended decision.anaheim,wilkoski d,d.until entry of judgment,the court may vacate or change a verdict as it sees fit.code civ,phillips phillips cal d.as no judgment had been entered in this case before january,the court could properly change its october,tentative decision.anaheim,supra,d.in re marriage of hafferkamp th,d.
trial court properly refused to award horning damages for a lost commission 
horning contends the court erred by failing to award him consequential damages for shilberg breach of the contract.horning asserts that as a broker,he was entitled to recover damages of in the form of a lost commission as specified in the contract.alternatively,he asserts he was entitled to these damages as the difference between the purchase price and the price he agreed to pay after his commission was taken into account.
