factual and procedural background 
in november,defendants applied for and received approval from the association architectural committee to make certain improvements to the patio area of their property.subsequently,however,the association contended that defendants had made changes that exceeded the scope of the approval,and which would not have been approved had they been included in defendants november application.
on june,the association sent defendants a request for alternative dispute resolution pursuant to former section et,identifying the disputed improvements and proposing that the parties mediate the issue.defendants accepted the proposal,and a mediation was held on april.a memorandum of agreement in mediation dated april,was reached,signed by two representatives of the association,its counsel,and thomas hazelbaker but not lynn hazelbaker.the agreement called for defendants to make certain modifications to the patio,in accordance with a plan newly approved by the association specifically,to install three openings,each inches wide and inches high,in a side wall of the patio referred to as a television partition in the agreement,and to use a specific color and fabric for the exterior side of drapery.the agreement provided for the modifications to be completed within days from the date of the agreement.it also provided for a special assessment on defendants property to pay a portion of the association attorney fees incurred to that point,and included a prevailing party attorney fees clause with respect to any subsequent legal action pertaining to the enforcement of or arising out of the agreement.
the modifications described in the mediation agreement were not completed within days.the parties each blame the other for that circumstance.
on september,the association filed the present lawsuit,asserting two causes of action for specific performance of the mediation agreement,and for declaratory relief.subsequently,the parties reached agreement regarding modifications to the property,slightly different from those agreed to in mediation instead of three inch wide openings,two openings of inches,separated by a third opening inches wide,were installed in the wall,and a different fabric than the one specified in the mediation agreement was used for the drapery.the modifications were completed by defendants in september.the parties could not reach a complete settlement,however,because they continued to disagree about who should bear the costs of the litigation.
on october,the association filed a motion seeking attorney fees and costs pursuant to section,subdivision c.the motion sought in attorney fees,plus in costs.on october,the hearing of the matter,initially set for november,was continued to november,on the court own motion.defendants filed their opposition to the motion on november.
at the november,hearing on the motion,the trial court noted that defendants paperwork was not timely and the court did not consider it.the court further observed that the bills submitted by the association in support of its motion were heavily redacted,sometimes to the point where it could not tell what going on.the court declined to review unredacted bills in camera,and further remarked that if i ca tell what going on,i not awarding those fees.at the conclusion of the hearing,the court took the matter under submission.
on december,the trial court issued a minute order granting the association motion,but awarding less than the requested amount in attorney fees,plus in costs.the trial court denied the association motion with respect to fees incurred prior to the mediation,awarding in p ost mediation fees incurred by one law firm on behalf of the association starting days post mediation,and in litigation fees incurred by another law firm.with respect to the p ost mediation fees,the court commented as follows the court had great difficulty determining the nature of the billings because so much information was redacted from the billings.all doubts were resolved in favor of the homeowner.
judgment was entered in favor of the association on december,and on january,a notice of entry of judgment was filed.on january,defendants filed a motion for reconsideration of the trial court order regarding fees and costs.on february,after a hearing,the trial court denied the motion as untimely,further noting that the motion did not set forth any new facts,law,or a chance in circumstances.
ii.discussion 
a.the association lawsuit is an action to enforce the governing documents under the davis stirling act.
this case presents the question of whether the davis stirling act,and particularly the provision of section,subdivision c,applies to an action to enforce a settlement agreement arising out of a mediation conducted pursuant to the mandatory alternative dispute resolution requirements of the act.we conclude that it does apply in at least some circumstances,and more specifically that it applies on the facts of this case.
the davis stirling act,enacted in citation,consolidated the statutory law governing condominiums and other common interest developments.villa de las palmas homeowners terifaj cal th,d,villa de las palmas.the davis stirling act includes provisions addressing alternative dispute resolution adr,including the initiation of such nonjudicial procedures,the timeline for completing adr,and the relationship between adr and any subsequent litigation.grossman park fort washington th,d grossman.among other things,the legislation provides that a n association or a member may not file an enforcement action in the superior court unless the parties have endeavored to submit their dispute to alternative dispute resolution pursuant to this article,subd.a.
the act also includes the following mandatory attorney fees provision in an action to enforce the governing documents,the prevailing party shall be awarded reasonable attorney fees and costs,subd.c.this language has been interpreted to allow recovery of not only litigation costs,but also reasonable attorney fees and costs expended in adr pursuant to the davis stirling act.grossman,supra,th at,d interpreting former section,later renumbered as without substantive change.
in grossman,although the parties participated in a mediation prior to the litigation,there is no indication that the mediation produced any sort of agreement,and the complaint was explicitly framed as an action to enforce a specific provision of the cc rs at issue.grossman,supra,th at,d.in contrast,the mediation between the parties in this case did produce an agreement,and the complaint was framed as an action to enforce that agreement.grossman therefore does not directly address whether the association claim for attorney fees and costs is properly treated as falling within the scope of the davis stirling act.grossman in essence interprets the term action in section to encompass both the mandatory adr efforts and any subsequent litigation to enforce the governing documents.grossman,supra,at,d.but is a lawsuit to enforce an agreement that was reached during mediation or another form of adr an action to enforce the governing documents,in the meaning of section,where the mediation was initiated pursuant to the davis stirling act in our view,that question must be answered in the affirmative,at least in circumstances similar to those of this case,for the reasons discussed below.
we must construe the words of a statute in context and with reference to the entire scheme of law of which they are a part.state farm mutual automobile ins.garamendi cal th,d.the davis stirling act is intended,among other things,to encourage parties to resolve their disputes without resort to litigation,by effectively mandating adr.see,subd.a enforcement action in civil court may not be filed until parties have endeavored to submit their dispute to adr in determining amount of fee and cost award,court may consider whether a party refusal to participate in adr before commencement of the action was reasonable.narrowly construing the phrase action to enforce the governing documents to exclude actions to enforce agreements arising out of that mandatory adr process would discourage such resolutions,and encourage gamesmanship.for example,a party might agree to a settlement in mediation without any intention of fulfilling its settlement obligations,but simply to escape the provisions of the davis stirling act it is unlikely,therefore,that a narrow construction is preferable.
moreover,the gravamen of the association complaint is that defendants have not taken certain steps to bring their property into compliance with the applicable cc rs.the relief sought by the complaint is an order requiring defendants to take those steps,and a declaration of the parties respective rights and responsibilities.the circumstance that the steps to bring the property into compliance with cc rs were specified a mediation agreement does not change the underlying nature of the dispute between the parties,or the nature of the relief sought by the association.indeed,the parties agreement was the product of a mediation conducted explicitly pursuant to the adr requirements of the davis stirling act.we see nothing in the davis stirling act that suggests we should give more weight to the form of a complaint its framing as an action to enforce a mediation agreement than to the substance of the claims asserted and relief sought,in determining whether an action is one to enforce the governing documents in the meaning of section.
we hold,therefore,that the present case is an action to enforce the governing documents,in the meaning of section as such,the trial court properly considered the davis stirling act as the basis for any recovery,as the association requested in its motion for attorney fees and costs.parrott mooring townhomes,th,d because party sought recovery pursuant to statute,standards for contractual clauses inapplicable.
b.the trial court did not abuse its discretion by determining the association to be the prevailing party.
defendants contend the trial court erred by determining the association to be the prevailing party.we find no abuse of discretion.
the analysis of who is a prevailing party under the provisions of the act focuses on who prevailed on a practical level by achieving its main litigation objectives the limitations applicable to contractual clauses,codified at section,do not apply heather farms homeowners robinson th,d.we review the trial court determination for abuse of discretion.villa de las palmas,supra,cal th at,d.the appropriate test for abuse of discretion is whether the trial court exceeded the bounds of reason.when two or more inferences can reasonably be deduced from the facts,the reviewing court has no authority to substitute its decision for that of the trial court.goodman lozano cal th,d,goodman.
the trial court determination that the association prevailed on a practical level is not beyond the bounds of reason.the association wanted defendants to make alterations to their property to bring it in compliance with the applicable cc rs,specifically,by installing openings in the side wall of the patio,and altering the drapery on the patio.the association achieved that goal,with defendants completing the modifications to the patio in september.
defendants focus on the circumstance that the modifications that were ultimately made to the property differed in some details from those contemplated by the mediation agreement.this argument,however,frames the issue improperly.the action at issue in the section analysis includes not only the litigation in the trial court,but also the adr process.grossman,supra,th at,d.the objective of the association enforcement action,including the adr process,is reasonably characterized broadly,as seeking to force defendants to bring their property into compliance with the cc rs.it was successful in achieving that goal.
moreover,the differences between the terms of the mediation agreement and the actual modifications that defendants made,and which the association accepted,are reasonably viewed as de minimis.the openings installed in the patio wall were of different dimensions than were contemplated in the mediation agreement,but nevertheless openings were installed,to the satisfaction of the association different fabric was used,but nevertheless the exterior color of the drapery was brought into conformity with the rest of the development.and defendants concede indeed,insist that the changes between the terms of the mediation agreement and the final modifications to the property were motivated by physical necessity the dimensions of the existing wall and its supporting beams,the unavailability of the specified fabric for drapery.defendants can not point to any success in any aspect of the litigation itself prior to the motion for attorney fees at issue,the only significant events in the litigation were the filing of the complaint and the answer.the trial court therefore did not exceed the bounds of reason in determining the association achieved its main litigation objectives as a practical matter.
defendants argue that the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to consider their opposition papers and supporting evidence,and that consideration of that evidence undoubtedly would have mitigated in favor of defendants and necessarily a different ruling as to the prevailing party determination.this argument fails in several respects.first,a trial court has broad discretion to accept or reject papers.cal.rules of court,rule d.defendants made no attempt to seek leave to file their opposition late,and made no attempt to demonstrate good cause for having failed to adhere to the applicable deadline.the circumstance that they were,at the time,appearing in propria persona,does not establish good cause.see nelson gaunt d.when a litigant is appearing in propria persona,he is entitled to the same,but no greater,consideration than other litigants and attorneys citations.further,the in propria persona litigant is held to the same restrictive rules of procedure as an attorney citation.fn.omitted.the trial court acted well within its discretion when it declined to consider defendants opposition papers 
second,defendants are incorrect that consideration of their opposition would likely have made any difference in the trial court determination of the prevailing party.defendants sought to introduce evidence that the terms of the mediation agreement could not be precisely implemented,and evidence of the association delay and unwillingness to address ambiguities in the agreement.even accepting these points as true,however and they are disputed at least in part by the association,they would not likely have altered the trial court analysis of which party prevailed in the action.the fact remains,as discussed above,the association contended defendants had altered th
