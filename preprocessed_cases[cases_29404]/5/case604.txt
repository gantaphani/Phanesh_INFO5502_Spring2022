the instant appeal arises out of a prior employee retirement income security act erisa,et,action for disability ltd benefits between moon and unum provident corporation unum or defendant.this court resolved the underlying litigation in moon favor.see moon unum provident,cir moon i.
in moon i,moon appealed the district court denial of her motion for judgment on the administrative record and the district court judgment finding that unum final decision to terminate her ltd benefits was not arbitrary and capricious.a majority panel of this court disagreed,reversed the district court decision,and remanded the case for entry of judgment in favor of moon.the majority concluded that unum final decision upholding the termination of moon ltd benefits was arbitrary and capricious.the dissent in the case concluded,on narrow grounds,that,under the highly deferential arbitrary and capricious standard,the district court did not err in upholding the denial of benefits.the dissent did note,however,that w ere we to view the matter under a de novo standard,i might very well decide otherwise.id.at.

standard of review 
we review a district court denial of a request for attorney fees to a prevailing claimant under erisa for an abuse of discretion.see ford uniroyal pension plan,cir.an abuse of discretion occurs when the district court relies on clearly erroneous findings of fact,improperly applies the law,or employs an erroneous legal standard.barner pilkington north america,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.this circuit has defined an abuse of discretion as a definite and firm conviction that the trial court committed a clear error of judgment.eagles,american eagle,cir quoting arban west publ g,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also anderson procter gamble,cir this court reviews for abuse of discretion the district court denial of the plaintiff request for attorneys fees pursuant to g.
discussion 
in an action by a plan participant,the district court,in its discretion,may allow a reasonable attorney fee and costs of action to either party.g.the sixth circuit utilizes the following king test to assess whether a district court properly exercised its discretion in awarding fees the degree of the opposing party culpability or bad faith the opposing party ability to satisfy an award of attorney fees the deterrent effect of an award on other persons under similar circumstances whether the party requesting fees sought to confer a common benefit on all participants and beneficiaries of an erisa plan or resolve significant legal questions regarding erisa and the relative merits of the parties positions see first trust bryant,cir.no single factor is determinative,and thus,the district court must consider each factor before exercising its discretion.see schwartz gregori,cir.
these factors are not statutory and typically not dispositive.see first trust,at.rather,they are considerations representing a flexible approach.id.in this case,however,the district court relied entirely on this legal framework in reaching its conclusion that moon was not entitled to attorney fees.therefore,in reviewing the district court decision for an abuse of discretion,we must review his findings as to each of the five king factors.in king,this court adopted the ninth circuit standard that,an abuse of discretion exists only when the court has the definite and firm conviction that the district court made a clear error of judgment in its conclusion upon weighing relevant factors.at see also foltice guardsman products,cir.finally,in our circuit,there is no presumption that attorney fees will be awarded.see maurer joy technologies,cir citation omitted.
our review of the five king factors leads us to the conclusion that the district court abused its discretion in denying moon motion for attorney fees.
degree of opposing party culpability or bad faith 
in moon ii,the district court held that unum had not engaged in bad faith or culpable conduct and that unum did not possess an ill motive.see d at.we disagree.in a separate case,a panel of this court stated,
a n arbitrary and capricious denial of benefits does not necessarily indicate culpability or bad faith.however,in this case,defendant ignored overwhelming evidence of plaintiff disability,and,instead denied her claim based on a theory that lacked legitimate foundation.defendant then sought to defend this theory with reference to isolated snippets from the record.
heffernan unum life ins.of america,cir unpublished opinion.
in the instant case,the prior panel in moon i concluded that unum decision to repeatedly deny moon claims for disability benefits was arbitrary and capricious because they did not provide a reasoned explanation that supported their outcome.see moon i,at.for example,it is undisputed in the record that the physician on whose opinion unum wholly relied never examined moon,the physician arrived at his opinion not upon examination of moon,but rather upon what our discussion here shows was a selective review of administrative record.id.at.see also spangler lockheed martin energy,cir observing that a selective review of the administrative record is inappropriate.in addition,the physician,upon whom the plan administrator relied,was also an employee of unum this court took issue with this fact,stating,when a plan administrator explanation as to why they terminated a person benefits is based on the work of a doctor in its employ,we must view the explanation with some skepticism.id.at citing.hosp.of cleveland emerson,cir holding that a plan administrator conflict of interest is a factor to consider when reviewing for whether the administrator decision was arbitrary or capricious.
applying these facts to the question of whether the district court erred when it determined unum did not engage in culpable conduct,the answer is clear unum engaged in culpable conduct and this factor should be weighed in moon favor and against unum.not only did unum deny moon claims based solely on the opinion of a physician in its employ,but they also repeatedly denied her claims even though this physician ignored substantial evidence in the administrative record indicating she was disabled and the physician never examined moon.therefore,we must reject the district court conclusion that defendant pursued their position in good faith and did not engage in any misconduct during the investigation or proceedings before this court or on appeal.moon ii,d at.without question,unum wholesale adoption of the opinion of an interested physician,who based his findings on selective information in the administrative record and did not examine moon
