for the second time,we are asked to review the district court award of costs in this case.because certain portions of the award were unsupported by evidence or were beyond the scope of statutorily allowed costs,we vacate certain portions of the award and direct that the award be reduced from to.
after prevailing on the merits of the underlying patent infringement suit,nidek submitted its bill of costs for.summit challenged various components of that bill of costs.in response to that challenge,nidek agreed that of the claimed costs were improper and submitted a revised bill requesting.the district court,without explanation,awarded nidek.summit,nidek.june.summit appealed that award,and nidek.a panel of this court vacated the award and remanded for further proceedings,including a specification of findings.summit,nidek.on remand,the district court held an evidentiary hearing,which consisted entirely of direct and testimony by neil siegel,an attorney with the law firm of sughrue mion,pllc.siegel was lead trial counsel in the underlying suit,and he signed nidek bill of costs.at that hearing,nidek conceded that certain expenses claimed in its original bill of costs were either beyond the scope of,which lists the expenses that may be taxed as costs under federal rule of civil procedure d,or were not related to the present litigation.based on that concession,the district court reduced the award to,which was approximately more than the court original award in its order,the district court stated that it found siegel testimony to be most credible and fully supported by the documentary evidence.summit appealed,challenging certain portions of the award pertaining to the preparation of trial exhibits,photocopy expenses,and deposition transcript expenses.
in response to summit opening brief on appeal to this court,nidek again conceded error,this time admitting that of its photocopy expenses were for database development by an outside vendor,a cost that is clearly beyond the scope of section.in addition to database development being under section,the line item for that expense was apparently double counted in nidek original bill of costs.one of those line items was removed before this appeal,so the item is still once in the award presently before this court.at oral argument on appeal,nidek further conceded that at least one deposition transcript expense in the amount of was double counted in the district court second award.based on those errors,nidek ultimately conceded that it was entitled to no more than.
although a district court award of costs under federal rule of civil procedure d is reviewed for abuse of discretion,the court discretion is limited to awarding costs that are within the scope of.crawford fitting gibbons,d.section provides,in pertinent part,that the following costs may be taxed fees of the court reporter for all or any part of the stenographic transcript necessarily obtained for use in the case and fees for exemplification and copies of papers necessarily obtained for use in the case whether a particular expense may be recovered under section is an issue of statutory construction,subject to de novo review.see,kohus toys r us,whitfield scully,cir russian river watershed prot.comm.city of santa rosa,cir.our interpretation of section in this case is governed by first circuit law because this issue is one on which we defer to regional circuit law and because this case comes to us from a district court within the first circuit.see kohus,at.
summit first argues that the district court erred by awarding nidek for fees paid to fti consulting.fti assisted nidek counsel in preparing trial exhibits,including computer animations,videos,powerpoint presentations,and graphic illustrations nidek argues that first circuit law allows a district court to award costs related to preparing such trial exhibits if the court finds that the exhibits provided real assistance to the court.summit,on the other hand,contends that such exhibits are neither exemplification s nor copies of papers necessarily obtained for use in the case,and that the costs associated with preparing the exhibits are therefore not taxable as costs under rule d.we agree with summit.
in kohus toys r us,this court rejected the broad interpretation of the term exemplification that nidek offers here.the court looked instead to black law dictionary,which defines exemplification as a n official transcript of a public record,authenticated as a true copy for use as evidence.id.at quoting black law dictionary ed.under that definition,we held that a video animation is not an exemplification.
the issue in kohus was governed by sixth circuit law,and because the sixth circuit had never addressed the question whether video animations were within section,our holding was framed in terms of determin ing how that circuit would likely resolve the issue.id.at quotation marks and citation omitted.we held that the sixth circuit reasoning in swan carburetor chrysler,cir,supported a narrow interpretation of the statute with respect to trial exhibits,and so determined that the sixth circuit would likely follow the definition in black law dictionary and exclude video animations from the scope of section.
nidek argues that first circuit law envisions a broader definition of exemplification.in support of that contention,nidek primarily relies on emerson national cylinder gas,aff,cir.in considering whether to grant costs for preparing charts used as trial exhibits,the district court in emerson stated that t he test of whether a chart expense should be taxable as costs under section is the extent to which it was reasonable to go to furnish real assistance to the court.emerson.at.that statement,however,can not be viewed as representing the law of the first circuit.
first,when the emerson case was appealed,the party against whom the cost award had been entered did not challenge the propriety of allowing costs for trial exhibits.see emerson,at.the first circuit therefore did not address that question.second,emerson predated crawford fitting gibbons,d,in which the supreme court held that a district court discretion under section is limited to the kinds of costs permitted under the statute.that is,the court may exercise discretion as to the cost items listed under section,but may not award costs for items that are not listed in section.id.at.prior to crawford fitting,many courts interpreted rule d as a broad grant of discretion with respect to costs,an interpretation that stemmed from the practice formerly followed in equity,where courts possessed the power to award costs not expressly provided by statute.id.at.marshall,dissenting.indeed,one of the cases cited by the district court in emerson to support its expansive interpretation of section,withnell,expressly relied on that equity principle to hold that certain costs ought in justice to be taxable.in light of the inconsistency between the approach employed by the emerson court and the approach dictated by the supreme court in crawford fitting,we do not view emerson as representing the current law of the first circuit 
in fact,to the extent that the first circuit law is shaped by decisions of district courts within that circuit,we note that the only recent such case took a narrow view of section,holding that the cost of preparing enlargements for use as trial exhibits was beyond the scope of section.shared med.ashford presbyterian cmty.and in one of the few first circuit opinions addressing section,that court also took a narrow view of section,although not in the context of trial exhibits.see in re two appeals arising out of the san juan dupont plaza hotel fire,cir.in that case,the court rejected the contention that overhead expenses for centralized litigation services were taxable under section.in doing so,the court noted the stunted reach of rule d,and recognized that rule d can not be stretched beyond the parameters defined in section.id.at.
within that context,our task is to determine how the first circuit would likely decide the question presented in this case.with no first circuit case law directly addressing that question,it is instructive to look to the law of other circuits.several circuits follow the same narrow definition of exemplification that this court articulated in kohus and exclude from section the expense of preparing trial exhibits,especially video animations.see arcadian fertilizer,mpw indus,cir because the videotape exhibits and the computer animation are neither copies of paper nor exemplifications within the meaning of,taxing these costs was error.coats penrod drilling,cir reviewing a request for recovery of travel expenses and enlargements related to trial exhibits and holding that t hese expenses are not included in and therefore are not recoverable see also am.trim,oracle,d.the seventh circuit,by contrast,has adopted a broader definition of exemplification,taken from standard english language dictionaries see cefalu vill.of elk grove,cir interpreting exemplification to signif y the act of illustration by example,a connotation broad enough to include a wide variety of exhibits and demonstrative aids citation omitted see also schering amgen,holding that,in considering whether a video exhibit is taxable under section,t he standard the court will apply to direct its discretion is whether the video materially aided the judge understanding of the technological issues in the case.local rules in a few district courts even explicitly contemplate the award of costs associated with preparing trial exhibits,including videos and animations.see,local civ.c costs of maps,charts,and models,including computer generated models,are not taxable except by order of court.cal.civ.local d the cost of preparing charts,diagrams,videotapes and other visual aids to be used as exhibits is allowable if such exhibits are reasonably necessary to assist the jury or the court in understanding the issues at the trial.no district court in the first circuit,however,has adopted a local rule addressing these types of expenses.
this court in kohus noted that congress did not use the broad phrase demonstrative evidence in section.kohus,at.and even the seventh circuit has acknowledged that congress did not contemplate including costs such as those for computer animations under section.see cefalu,at given the costs associated with some of these presentations,this is an area that congress may wish to revisit and supply further guidance.in light of the first circuit recognition of the stunted reach of rule d,we are persuaded that the first circuit would adopt the narrow,legal definition of the term exemplification endorsed by the fifth circuit,the eleventh circuit,and this court applying sixth circuit law.
as moore federal practice notes,a video exhibit or a physical model may not qualify as an exemplification if it is essentially explanatory and argumentative,serving merely as an aid to the argument of counsel and the explanations of expert witnesses.james moore et,moore federal practice d ed.that is precisely the nature of the materials prepared by fti,as the evidence showed that expert witnesses used those materials simply to explain the case to the jury and the court in light of the nature of the materials at issue and our conclusion that the first circuit would adopt a narrow definition of exemplification for purposes of section,we hold that fti fees are not taxable as costs.
summit next argues that the district court erred in awarding nidek in photocopying costs.summit argues that nidek supporting documentation for those expenses was insufficient because various components of the award were based on unsupported estimates or failed to identify whether the documents were necessarily obtained for use in the case,as is required by section.with respect to certain components of the photocopy award,we agree.
under first circuit law,photocopy expenses are taxable only if the costs were reasonably necessary to the maintenance of the action.davila,cir.with respect to two categories of photocopy expenses sughrue internal copy expenses and all outside vendor copy expenses,nidek bill of costs was based on the actual number of pages that were photocopied for the litigation.in the case of vendor copy expenses,nidek submitted the vendors invoices.in those invoices,the vendors charged a variable rate,ranging from to cents,averaging approximately cents per page the rate nidek and summit agreed to before litigation.the total vendor copy expense accounted for every page copied by the vendors as part of this litigation.to account for the fact that some fraction of those copies either were not necessary to the maintenance of the action or were duplicative of other photocopy expenses,nidek reduced the total vendor invoice charge by percent,which resulted in a charge of for all outside vendor copying.we agree with nidek that,in complex patent litigation involving hundreds of thousands of documents and copies,parties can not be expected to track the identity of each photocopied page along with a record of its relevance to the litigation.thus,although a simple percent reduction is a somewhat crude method of accounting for copies,we believe the district court acted within its discretion in awarding the vendor costs based on that estimate,particularly in light of the supporting testimony from siegel,who explained that his testimony was based on his years of experience and his responsibility,as lead counsel,for the litigation in this case.however,we modify the award of outside vendor copy costs to account for the inclusion of for database development,an error that nidek conceded in its brief to this court.
with respect to sughrue internal copy expenses,nidek calculated the cost differently.as in the case of vendor copy expenses,nidek submitted invoices showing the total charges for sughrue internal copies.however,the invoice charges were calculated at a rate of cents per page.the total charges from those invoices were reduced by as in the case of outside vendor copy most of that reduction was to account for the fact that nidek and summit had agreed to a rate of cents per page.the resulting expense on the bill of costs is.
no explanation was provided for the use of a different methodology in the case of sughrue internal copies.in particular,there was no testimony or evidence suggesting that a higher percentage of sughrue internal copies was necessary than was true of the vendors copies.in the absence of any support for the methodology used to calculate the costs for sughrue internal copies,that portion of the award was improper.just as was done for vendor copy expenses,sughrue internal copy expenses should be adjusted to the rate of cents per page,and then reduced by percent to account for copies.that calculation results in an award of for sughrue internal copy costs.thus,we amend the component of the district court award corresponding to sughrue internal copy costs,reducing it by.
a third category of copy costs is in internal copy expenses incurred by the law firm of testa,hurwitz thibeault,llp,sughrue in this case.those submitted costs are unsupported by any evidence of record.testa did not specifically track photocopy expenses related to its work on this case.instead,testa billed nidek a seven percent overhead fee on top of all of its legal fees for the case.according to testa invoices and siegel testimony,that overhead fee included photocopies,telephone,postage,telecopy,local transportation,overtime,westlaw fees,and all other miscellaneous expenses.nidek submitted half of that total overhead disbursement as its cost for testa internal photocopies necessarily obtained for use in this case.
as the sole support for that estimate,siegel testified that 
i could not tell with precision what testa internal photocopy charges were but i knew how that figure was derived invoice by invoice.and i had a sense roughly as to what the approximate photocopy charges were among these disbursements my assumption was that photocopy expenses in these situations would be approximately about fifty percent of the seven percent overhead charge.it would vary from month to month because in some months there would be very little photocopying.and in other months there would be a lot.
although the district court found siegel credible,that testimony is insufficient on it
