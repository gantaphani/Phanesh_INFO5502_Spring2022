ufo chuting of hawaii,and,collectively ufo appeal the district court summary judgment in favor of defendants,the state of hawaii and the united states as intervenor collectively state.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm.we hold that ufo right to operate vessels under its federal maritime coasting licenses does not preempt hawaii law prohibiting parasailing off the coast of maui during limited portions of the year to protect mating humpback whales.because ufo does not qualify as a prevailing party,the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying ufo motion for attorney fees.
ufo operates a commercial parasailing business offering parasailing excursions to adventure seekers off the coast of maui and the big island of hawaii.parasailing is an activity in which an individual is transported or carried aloft by a parachute,sail,or other material attached to a towline which is towed by a vessel.the united states coast guard inspects and licenses ufo two ufo and the casey carry up to twelve passengers in the coastwise trade between mcgregor point and lipoa point on the western coast of maui.a portion of this area is located within the maui humpback whale protected waters.see.
between december and may of each year,when humpback whales are mating,bearing calves,and caring for their young,hawaii state law prohibits any person from operat ing a thrill craft,or engag ing in parasailing,water sledding,or commercial high speed boating,or operat ing a motor vessel towing a person engaged in water sledding or parasailing on the west and south shore of maui.i.together with hawaii revised statute c,state law,in effect,prohibits parasailing activity in all navigable waters surrounding maui between december and may of each year.
on july,the united states district court for the district of hawaii granted ufo motion for summary judgment on the basis that the federal marine mammal protection act mmpa preempted hawaii state law.see ufo chuting of,young,d the district court granted ufo motion for a permanent injunction barring enforcement of the parasailing provision on september.the state appealed.
subsequent to the district court published decision,president george bush signed into law the fiscal year omnibus appropriations bill,stat.omnibus bill.section of the omnibus bill provides 
n othwithstanding any other federal law related to the conservation and management of marine mammals,the state of hawaii may enforce any state law or regulation with respect to the operation in state waters of recreational and commercial vessels,for the purpose of conservation and management of humpback whales,to the extent that such law or regulation is no less restrictive than federal law.
a day later,the state filed a motion to stay the permanent injunction and asked the district court to indicate whether it would entertain a motion under federal rule of civil procedure b should we issue a remand order.on december,before the injunction went into effect,the district court indicated that it would grant a rule b motion because of the intervening change in the law.the district court also granted the state motion to stay the permanent injunction.we issued a limited remand on january,and the district court granted the state rule b motion on march.the district court then vacated its prior judgment and entered summary judgment in favor of the state.however,because the district court failed to address ufo commerce clause arguments,it granted ufo motion for reconsideration on may,and issued an amended order granting summary judgment in favor of the state,now rejecting ufo claim that the mmpa preempted state law.on july,the district court granted the state motion for summary judgment on all remaining issues,rejecting ufo last claim that its right to engage in coastwise trade under federal license preempts the parasailing restriction as well as other commerce clause claims.see ufo chuting of,young,d.
the district court then denied ufo motion for attorney fees,costs and expenses.the court reasoned that ufo was not the prevailing party because the permanent injunction never went into effect.consequently,ufo never received a direct benefit from the temporary relief granted by the court.ufo timely appeals both rulings.
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.flint dennison,cir.we view the facts in the light most favorable to ufo and draw all reasonable inferences in its favor.id.at.
ufo contends that its coast guard it to carry up to twelve passengers in coastwise hawaii ban on parasailing because the license grants ufo a federal right of maritime passage that actually conflicts with hawaii seasonal ban.see young,cir describing the three ways federal law may preempt state law,including when state law actually conflicts with federal law.an actual conflict occurs where it is impossible to comply with both state and federal requirements,or where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.id.at alteration in original quoting freightliner myrick,d.
n o state may completely exclude federally licensed commerce.lime avocado growers,paul,d young,at.however,a state may impose upon federal licensees reasonable,nondiscriminatory conservation and environmental protection measures otherwise within their police power.young,at quoting douglas seacoast,d see also huron portland cement detroit,d stating that so long as the federal law does not preempt state action,a state or local regulation requires no more than compliance with an orderly and reasonable scheme of community regulation emphasis added id.at.evenhanded local regulation to effectuate a legitimate local public interest is valid unless by federal action.
ufo argues that conflict preemption occurs where state law has the effect of precluding employment of a vessel for the single purpose for which it was designed,constructed and licensed.in other words,because its two vessels were designed for parasailing,ufo contends that hawaii can not ban parasailing on the navigable waters in which its federal license authorizes it to engage in coastwise trade.for support,ufo cites young,and waste management holdings,gilmore,cir.
in young,the state of hawaii banned all commercial vessels from the hanalei river or hanalei bay ocean waters at all times of the year.at discussing.the plaintiffs operated commercial tour boats and held a federal license from the coast guard authorizing them to engage in coastwise trade.id.the court agreed with the district court and concluded that the plaintiffs federal license to engage in coastwise trade preempted the hawaii rule.the plaintiffs coasting license authorized them to engage in coastwise trade,which includes the transportation of passengers.id.citing gibbons ogden,wheat.see also id.a coasting license entitles a vessel to employment in unrestricted coastwise trade.quoting a.therefore,because hawaii law completely exclude d the plaintiffs from conducting their tour boat business at all times,it effectively rendered it impossible for the plaintiffs to comply with both federal and state law in order to ply their trade.id.at thus,federal law preempted state law and,because there was an actual conflict,we declined to determine whether the state had properly exercised its concurrent power to alleviate user conflicts.id.
here,in contrast to young,the ban on parasailing is only in effect for five months of the year.the hawaii statute undoubtedly imposes a significant restriction on the ability of ufo to ply its trade,but the state has not completely excluded ufo from engaging in coastwise trade in the relevant waters as it did with the ban in young moreover,ufo has presented no evidence that it is wholly economically infeasible to operate its business with the ban,and has therefore not shown that it can not comply with both federal and state law in order to ply its trade.id.at.
nor can ufo show that the hawaii regulation is in actual conflict with the federal law because it stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.young,at.by enacting section of the omnibus bi
