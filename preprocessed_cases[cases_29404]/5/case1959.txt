introduction 
for nearly three quarters of a century,the cooper arms,a historic and beautiful apartment building in long beach,was a stock cooperative.the cooperative operated as a corporation.unit owners in the stock cooperative owned shares in the corporation.some residents owned more shares than others.when issues about the management and upkeep of the cooper arms arose,the stockholders would vote.and as with any corporation,the more shares a person owned,the greater her or his vote mattered.speaking hypothetically,if a stockholder owned percent of the shares,then that person vote counted for percent of the votes.
in,percent of members of the cooperative decided to convert the property to condominiums.in doing so,the shares in the cooperative were converted to votes per unit.some condominium unit owners could cast as few as votes.others could cast as many as votes.as when the building was a cooperative,the more shares a owner held,the greater the impact of his or her vote on condominium issues.however,just as the votes are too are the common area and other assessments.an owner with more votes pays a pro rata greater share of common area and other assessments.in other words,when a condominium owner has more votes,she or he assumes the expensive obligation to pay a greater pro rata contribution for common area and other assessments.the trial court ruled this methodology for distributing votes and imposing common area and other assessments was lawful and that is what this appeal is largely about.
plaintiff,john cebular,a condominium unit owner,appeals from a judgment entered in favor of defendant,cooper arms homeowners association,after a court trial based on the parties trial briefs and several exhibits.among other things,the trial court ruled that the declaration of covenants,conditions,and restrictions the declaration and bylaws did not violate the common interest development act et the act and our supreme court decision in nahrstedt lakeside village condominium association,cal th,d,even though members are not equally assessed for maintenance of common area facilities.in the published part of the opinion,we address the trial court rulings concerning assessments and voting rights and membership in the homeowners association.other issues will be resolved in the unpublished portion of the opinion.we affirm the trial court rulings as to the legality of the voting and assessment methodology.we reverse the attorney fee award.we remand for recalculation of the attorney fees.
ii.background 
a.the declaration 
the cooper arms is a building containing units.built in,the cooper arms was originally organized as a stock cooperative in which each unit owner bought shares of a corporation.the cooperative was created with the execution of a trust agreement,which assigned to each unit an inseparable fractional beneficial interest.the number of shares was established by the trust agreement and the owners paid a specified amount for the shares that they received at par value.the cooper arms was identified as a historical landmark in.documents offered by the parties,established that,in,the members were given instructions on voting to convert the building to condominium units.the vote to convert required percent of the owners but not percent of the shares.the voters were informed that regular and special assessments would be distributed in the same proportion as the percentage of shares held in trust for each beneficiary.
on august,the owner of the building,sharp homeowners association management,executed a declaration of covenants,conditions and restrictions and reservation of easements for the cooper arms condominiums in order to convert the cooperative apartment building into a condominium project.the declaration preamble provides in part,all of the limitations,restrictions,reservations,rights,easements,conditions and covenants herein shall run with and burden the property and shall be binding on and for the benefit of all the property and all persons having or acquiring any interest in the property,or any part thereof,and their successive owners and assigns.the declaration was recorded in the los angeles county recorder office on august.an amendment was recorded on december.
before proceeding to an analysis of the specifics of the governing documents,it is appropriate to summarize the key parts of the declaration and bylaws which directly discuss the assessment and voting methodology.exhibit d attached to the declaration and bylaws is entitled undivided interests in common area.the exhibit identifies each unit number and assigns it an interest.for example,unit is assigned interests.by contrast,unit is assigned interests.exhibit d states there are a total of undivided interests in the common area.pursuant to article,section of the declaration,all annual assessments shall be assessed among the owners and then condominiums in proportion to the undivided interests listed on exhibit exhibit e lists the votes each condominium owner is entitled to cast.exhibit e states the total number of votes is exact number of undivided interests identified in exhibit further,the number of votes assigned to each condominium is exactly same as the number of interests assigned to each condominium in exhibit by way of example,the owner of unit has interests in the common area.also,exhibit e provides that the owner of unit has votes.the assignment of an equal number of interests and votes for each owner is true for every unit in the cooper arms.

b.the pleadings 
on january,plaintiff filed the complaint alleging causes of action for contract breach first implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing breach second declaratory relief third negligence fourth fiduciary duty breach fifth injunctive relief sixth and unfair competition seventh.the trial court sustained demurrers to the second,fourth,and sixth causes of action without leave to amend.the trial court sustained a demurrer to the contract breach claim first with leave to amend.the trial court overruled demurrers to declaratory relief third,fiduciary duty breach fifth,and unfair competition seventh causes of action.we summarily denied a mandate petition filed by defendant brought on the ground all the claims were time barred.cooper arms homeowners association superior court,nonpub.order.
the first amended complaint,which is the operative pleading,alleges plaintiff purchased a condominium within the cooper arms in september.upon purchasing the condominium,plaintiff became bound by the august declaration as amended.plaintiff further alleges defendant members are assessed based on the number of assigned shares plaintiff is unaware of how the shares are calculated or assigned unit shares are assigned without reference to size or location of the unit some larger units have less shares the assessment method does not take into consideration that each member is entitled to equally share the common area located on the property the distribution of shares is thereby inequitable,arbitrary,and capricious and each member should be equally assigned maintenance obligations.further,plaintiff alleges he had periodically been a board member since approximately january.plaintiff alleges on information and belief the board had been advised by counsel that the method of allocating shares,voting,and assessing the members is unfair,inequitable,arbitrary,and capricious and does not conform to applicable laws.the first amended complaint contains causes action for contract breach first declaratory relief second fiduciary duty breach third and unfair competition fourth.the trial court sustained a demurrer without leave to amend as to the contract breach cause of action first.but the trial court overruled demurrers,which were brought in part on statute of limitations grounds,as to the remaining causes of action.defendant answered the first amended complaint.the trial court subsequently denied defendant summary judgment motion.

iii.discussion 
plaintiff.summary of issues discussed in the published portion of the opinion 
relying primarily upon nahrstedt lakeside village condominium association,supra,cal th at pages,d,plaintiff argues defendant is violating the act by utilizing a method of allocations of assessments to members based upon what he characterizes as a share scheme.plaintiff argues voting rights and assessments must be allocated equally.plaintiff further contends the voting and assessment allocation methodology violates business and professions code section as an unfair business practice.moreover,plaintiff contends the assessment and voting method violate corporation code section which applies to common interest developments.finally,plaintiff argues the unfair business practice claim was not time barred.
the act and nahrstedt 
as noted above,the declaration and bylaws which govern the building were recorded on august.the owners are bound by the declaration,nahrstedt lakeside village condominium,supra,cal th at,fn,d.the declaration was recorded after owners of the cooperative agreed to convert the building to a condominium.there are marked distinctions between a stock cooperative and a condominium.california coastal com.quanta investment d.sun terrace manor municipal court d.a stock cooperative is a corporation formed to hold title to real property.the shareholders are given a proprietary interest in occupying a portion of the real property,subd.m california coastal com.quanta investment,supra,d at.the right of occupancy is generally made by a transfer of stock granting the holder a proprietary lease.california coastal com.quanta investment,supra,d at.sun terrace manor municipal court,supra,d at.the shareholder in a stock cooperative is merely a lessee,which has a relationship with the stock cooperative and owner of the land.california coastal com.quanta investment,supra,d at.sun terrace manor municipal court,supra,d at.by contrast,section,subdivision f describes a condominium as follows,a condominium consists of an undivided interest in common in a portion of real property coupled with a separate interest in space called a unit see california coastal com.quanta investment,supra,d at.a condominium owner acquires a fee simple interest in real property.friendly village community silva hill constr.d,fn.see adler elphick d,fn.notwithstanding these distinctions,in,percent of the owners agreed to maintain the previous allocation method for maintenance and operation of the common areas once the condominium conversion was completed.their agreement was set forth in the governing documents the declaration and bylaws which were filed and recorded in.
plaintiff argues this assessment allocation is unlawful.the california legislature has chosen the deferential standard applicable to equitable servitudes as the standard for enforcing covenants,conditions,and restrictions in declarations governing a common interest development.nahrstedt lakeside village condominium,supra,cal th at,d,see villa de las palmas homeowners terifaj cal th,d.the standards for enforcement of condominium covenants,conditions,and restrictions are set forth in the act.et section,subdivision a provides the covenants and restrictions in the declaration shall be enforceable equitable servitudes,unless unreasonable,and shall inure to the benefit of and bind all owners of separate interests in the development.unless the declaration states otherwise,these servitudes may be enforced by any owner of a separate interest or by the association,or by both.our supreme court has interpreted section,subdivision a to mean that covenants,conditions,or restrictions are enforceable unless the party challenging it establishes the equitable servitude is unreasonable because it,is wholly arbitrary,violates a fundamental public policy,or imposes a burden on the use of affected land that far outweighs any benefit.nahrstedt lakeside village condominium,supra,cal th at,d,accord villa de las palmas homeowners terifaj,supra,cal th at,d.a homeowners association can neither rely on nor enforce covenants,conditions,and restrictions that violate statutory law or common law.if there a conflict between the law and a declaration of covenants,conditions,and restrictions,the statutory and common law prevail.frances village green owners cal d,fn,thaler household finance th,d moorpark homeowner vrt th,d.indeed,as noted,article xii,section of the declaration recognizes the predominance of statutory law in the event of a conflict by stating,notwithstanding the provisions contained in the restrictions,the association and owners should be aware that they may be provisions of various laws,including without limitation the common interest development act codified at sections et of the california civil code and the federal fair housing act codified at title united states code,sections et,which may supplement or override the restrictions.
plaintiff challenge to the declaration and bylaws must be resolved in part based on contract principles.nahrstedt lakeside village condominium,supra,cal th at,d,restrictive covenants are subject to contract interpretation hannula hacienda homes,cal d,same.further,the construction of the act is based on rules applicable to statutory construction.villa de las palmas homeowners terifaj,supra,cal th at,d,interpretation of the act see battram emerald bay community d.interpretation of assessment in light of proposition.to the extent the declaratory relief claim was decided on stipulated and undisputed evidence,our review of the matter is de novo.rancho santa fe th,d ironwood owners.ix solomon d.see also topanga victory partners,llp.toghia th,d.
neither the statutory nor regulatory language prohibits unequal allocation of interests 
neither the act nor the california code of regulations requires that equal assessments be imposed in every case.section provides unless the declaration otherwise provides,in a condominium project,or in a planned development in which the common areas are owned by the owners of the separate interests,the common areas are owned as tenants in common,in equal shares,one for each unit or lot.italics added.california code of regulations,title,section provides in part a regular assessments to defray expenses attributable to the ownership,operation and furnishing of common interests by the association shall ordinarily be levied against each owner according to the ratio of the number of subdivision interests owned by the owner assessed to the total number of interests subject to assessments.b in the case of a subdivision offering in which it is reasonable to anticipate that any owner will derive as much as more than any other owner in the value of common services supplied by the association,the assessment against each owner may be determined according to a formula or schedule under which the assessments against the various subdivision interests bear a relationship which is equitably proportionate to the value of the common services furnished to the respective interests.thus,both section and california code of regulations,title,section,subdivisions a and b contemplate that the declaration may provide for unequal ownership by condominium owners of common areas as tenants in common.as a result,neither section nor any regulation prohibit unequal assessments based upon greater voting power.
the voting and common area expense allocation is not unreasonable 
plaintiff argues the method for determining the allocation is wholly arbitrary because it is not based on criteria such as value,square footage,elevation,or ocean views.in other words,according to plaintiff,even if the allocation formula violates neither a statute nor a regulation,it is invalid because it is entirely arbitrary.first,as plaintiff concedes,a recorded land use restriction in a common interest development is presumptively reasonable and will not be set aside unless it is found to be arbitrary or violates fundamental public policy.nahrstedt lakeside village condominium,supra,cal th at,d,accord villa de las palmas homeowners terifaj,supra,cal th at,d.the purpose of the presumption of validity,requiring a challenger to demonstrate unreasonableness,is to promote stability and predictability in condominiums and other common interest developments.nahrstedt lakeside village condominium,supra,cal th at,d,see villa milano homeowners il davorge th,d.the declaration in this case,allocating unequal assessments based on the proportionate share of voting rights,is thus presumptively valid.
second,we agree with defendant that,to the extent the dissimilar assessments are tied to a proportionate allocation of voting rights in the common interest development,they are not wholly arbitrary.this is because the evidence indisputably established that the methodology for common area assessments is directly tied to voting rights.the members voting rights range from to votes.the greater the number of votes,the proportionately larger the assessment imposed on the owner.the assessments are levied based on the number of votes listed in exhibit e to the bylaws for each unit.this method was originally adopted in under the document entitled,declaration of trust of the california national bank of long beach.when the building was converted to condominiums in,percent of the cooperative shareowners agreed to adopt this method.at the time of the conversion from a cooperative apartment building to condominiums,the members chose to have a proportional assessment based on the disparate allocation of voting rights in the homeowners association.this unequal assessment translates to a greater right to control,manage,and maintain the property.bus,subd.d,tit,a.the choice to pay more based on an increased voting power is neither unreasonable nor wholly arbitrary as a matter of law.
there is no merit to the contentions pressed in the reply brief and at oral argument that the greater voting power is a matter of little consequence.plaintiff has presented no concrete evidence to support this contention.no doubt,it is conceivable greater voting power linked to higher assessments in a homeowners association could,under some circumstances,be an entirely illusionary benefit.but plaintiff speculative analysis is just presented no evidence in the trial court to support the conclusion that greater voting power is not a material benefit to a condominium owner.the voting rights provided to unit owners under the declaration and bylaws are substantial.they include the power to change the pro rata method for collecting assessments if percent of the owners approve amend the declaration with the consent of or percent of the members depending on the nature of the change termination of the declaration with the consent of percent of the voting power calling special meetings if percent of the voting power approves electing and removing directors permitting the borrowing of money if percent of the voting power approves demanding a statement of association affairs upon the request of percent of the voting membership selling property of the homeowner association with the consent of a majority of the voting power extending the term of employment of the management agent with the approval of majority of the voting power limiting discussion at regular and special board meetings setting compensation of employees and amending the bylaws with the approval of a majority of the voting power.these are substantial rights and plaintiff contention to the contrary has no merit.
third,the assessment method is not unreasonable merely because plaintiff disagrees with its wisdom.our supreme court has explained,w hen enforcing equitable servitudes,courts are generally disinclined to question the wisdom of restrictions.nahrstedt lakeside village condominium,supra,cal th at,d.further,in nahrstedt,the supreme court has explained under the law of equitable servitudes,courts may enforce a promise about the use of land even though the person who made the promise has transferred the land to another.see marra aetna construction cal d.the underlying idea is that a landowner promise to refrain from particular conduct pertaining to land creates in the beneficiary of that promise an equitable interest in the land of the promisor,property,com.a,pomeroy,equity jurisprudence ed,quoted in hunt jones cal,a grantee or purchaser with notice that premises are bound by a covenant will be restrained from violating it.nahrstedt lakeside village condominium,supra,cal th at,d.
fourth,there is no merit to plaintiff claim that enforcing the declaration would violate public policy.in nahrstedt,our supreme court explained the public policy factor as follows e quitable servitudes permit courts to enforce promises restricting land use when there is no privity of contract between the party seeking to enforce the promise and the party resisting enforcement.like any promise given in exchange for consideration,an agreement to refrain from a particular use of land is subject to contract principles,under which courts try to effectuate the legitimate desires of the covenanting parties.hannula hacienda homes,supra,cal d at pp.when landowners express the intention to limit land use,that intention should be carried out.id.at,epstein,notice and freedom of contract in the law of servitudes,we may not understand why property owners want certain obligations to run with the land,but as it is their land some very strong reason should be advanced before courts should override those obligations.original italics.thus,when enforcing equitable servitudes,courts are generally disinclined to question the wisdom of restrictions.citations.this rule does not apply,however,when the restriction does not comport with public policy.citation.equity will not enforce any restrictive covenant that violates public policy.citations.nahrstedt lakeside village condominium,supra,cal th at,d,see also rest d property,servitudes,com.j,absent extraordinary circumstances,if a servitude serves some purpose that the purchasers might rationally have agreed to,and its meaning should have been apparent to the purchasers,a court should not invalidate it simply because the court believes that most people would not have agreed to it,or that it produces little benefit.in nahrstedt,our supreme court cited as examples of restrictions that violate public restrictive covenant in deeds as invalidated in shelley kraemer.and unlawful discrimination based on sex,race,color religion,ancestry,national origin,or disability as set forth in section,subdivision b nahrstedt lakeside village condominium,supra,cal th at,d.
here,plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that enforcement of the declaration in this case violates any fundamental policy that inures to the public at large.indeed,the contrary may be true because of the potential disruption to the expectations of the other unit owners in the building.at least percent of the prior cooperative owners voted to maintain the continuity of the voting and assessment method for the building which is a historic landmark.the current owners then purchased their units with the same understanding of control and payment of higher assessment dues for the added voting power.california law recognizes that purchasers expectations in place when they made their investments warrant protection.lamden la jolla shores clubdominium homeowners cal th,d,giving deference to a development originating cc r protects the general expectations of condominium owners that restrictions in place at the time they purchase their units will be enforceable rancho santa fe,supra,th at,d such deference to the originating covenants,conditions and restrictions protects the general expectations of condominium owners that restrictions in place at the time they purchase their units will be enforceable.
finally,plaintiff claims he lacked notice of the method of allocating votes and the duty to pay greater assessments.but,the undisputed evidence established that the assessment method was contained in the declaration and bylaws.plaintiff does not contend that the documents were not properly executed or recorded.plaintiff lack of notice contention appears to be the basis of a public policy challenge to enforcement of the equitable servitudes at issue.lamden lajolla shores clubdominium homeowners,supra,cal th at,d,nahrstedt lakeside village condominium,supra,cal th at,d.plaintiff,had constructive notice of the assessment method based on voting rights when he purchased his property in.citizens for covenant compliance anderson cal th,d,villa milano homeowners il davorge,supra,th at,d thaler household finance,supra,th at,d.plaintiff claimed,but factually unsubstantiated,lack of notice contention is not a basis for finding the assessment and voting methodology violates fundamental public policy.no violation of the act or the rule set forth by the supreme court in nahrstedt has occurred.
the assessment and voting rights methodology does not violate the additional statutes plaintiff cites 
plaintiff makes a number of separate additional arguments concerning alleged violations of the act,none of which have merit.our prior analysis is dispositive of the following arguments.first,plaintiff contends that the method violates section which prohibits excessive assessments of fees.in a similar contention,plaintiff asserts defendant violated article iv,section of the declaration which provides it may not assess its members more than necessary for the purpose for which it was levied.he argues that the unequal assessment arbitrarily and unreasonably assesses some members for higher maintenance for the common areas even though the members share equally in the benefits of the common areas.second,plaintiff asserts section is violated because the assessment and voting rights unfairly and unreasonably restrict the marketability of his condominium.third,plaintiff asserts the voting and assessment methodology violates section because it is unreasonable and arbitrary.however,the methodology chosen by the owners wishing to pay more in assessments in exchange for greater voter power is neither unlawful nor unreasonable a matter of law,as we have explained.
corporations code section and membership 
defendant articles of incorporation state that it is organized under the nonprofit mutual benefit corporation law,this part shall be known and may be cited as the nonprofit mutual benefit corporation law see ostayan nordhoff townhomes homeowners,th,d.plaintiff argues the voting and assessment allocation methodology violates corporations code section.plaintiff asserts,corporations code section states that no person may hold more than one membership unless the person owns more that one unit.plaintiff further contends that each member must have the same rights and privileges and relies upon the holding in erickson gospel foundation cal d.we respectfully disagree with both lines of analysis.
corporations code section,which is part of the nonprofit mutual benefit corporation law,states in part,no person may hold more than one membership,and no fractional memberships may be held and then lists a series of exemptions none of which are directly relevant here membership in a nonprofit mutual benefit corporation is defined in corporations code section plaintiff argues that the voting and assessment allocation methodology unlawfully creates several different who must pay greater assessments than others.however,members rights are those specified in the corporation articles and bylaws,a membership refers to the rights a member has pursuant to a corporation articles,bylaws and this division.further,corporations code section explicitly provides that corporate articles and bylaws may grant different privileges and conditions of membership.corporations code section states,a corporation may issue memberships having different rights,privileges,preferences,restrictions or conditions,as authorized by its articles or bylaws.corporations code section states,except as provided in or authorized by the articles or bylaws,all memberships shall have the same rights,privileges,preferences,restrictions and conditions.as can be noted,the corporations code expressly allows the articles and bylaws to create different rights and conditions of membership.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.corporations.
in this case,the articles create one type of membership.article ii,section of the articles of incorporation states the association shall have one class of voting membership.members are all owners.members are entitled to the number of votes listed in exhibit e assigned to each condominium owned by such member which is subject to assessment.assessments are imposed in the same percentage as voting rights by article iv,section.by its very terms,the articles create only one class of member as mandated by corporations code section proceed as permitted by corporations code sections and to identify the rights and conditions of membership.there has been no violation of corporations code section.
finally,there is nothing in erickson gospel foundation,supra,cal d at page,which warrants a different result.erickson involves the application of corporate security laws in existence more than century ago applicable to nonprofit corporations.in any event,in erickson,the bylaws provided greater voting rights if a member gave to the corporation.the supreme court expressly upheld the unequal voting right methodology.ibid.our analysis,based on a different factual scenario and albeit similar laws,reaches the same ultimate outcome.the erickson opinion does not support plaintiff position.

the judgment is affirmed except as to the attorney fee award.the order awarding attorney fees is reversed and remanded for a determination of attorney fees under civil code sections,subdivision a and,subdivision c.defendant,cooper arms homeowners association,is awarded its costs and attorney fees on appeal from plaintiff,john cebular.
