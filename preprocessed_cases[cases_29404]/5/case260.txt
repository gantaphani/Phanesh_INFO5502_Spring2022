plaintiff khaled kassim appeals from two judgments in his favor,one for damages,one for attorney fees,which plaintiff contends were insufficient.kassim brought this suit under against the city of schenectady city and its corporation counsel,michael brockbank collectively defendants,alleging that defendants violated his due process rights under the fourteenth amendment by evicting him from a property where he operated a convenience store,without prior notice or opportunity to be heard.
the united states district court for the northern district of new york david hurd,granted kassim motion for partial summary judgment as to defendants liability and ordered a jury trial to determine damages.kassim city of schenectady,d.on the trial of damages,the jury awarded compensatory damages of and denied punitive damages.on appeal,kassim contests principally a court ruling limiting the scope of damages and an evidentiary ruling that limited the use of some of his evidence.in addition,kassim contends that,in awarding him attorney fees under as the prevailing party,the court applied incorrect law,and thus abused its discretion,in awarding a fee substantially below the lodestar amount determined by reference to attorney hours and hourly fee.
as for the award of damages,we reject kassim contentions.as for the reduction of the attorney fee award,we vacate the award and remand because we can not tell from the explanations given by the district court whether the court ruling was consistent with governing law.
background 
kassim operated a convenience store,called victory market,in rented space at craig street in schenectady,new york.kassim,d at.kassim lease was not recorded.id.because the owner of the property was delinquent in paying in taxes,the city instituted foreclosure proceedings.id.at.although defendant brockbank,the city corporation counsel,was aware of the victory market,notice of the foreclosure proceeding was sent only to the owner no notice was given to kassim.id.at.a default judgment of foreclosure was entered on april,awarding the city possession of craig street.id.
on april,city officials including defendant brockbank,a city carpenter,and police officers arrived at the victory market with a notice to vacate.id.this was the first and only notice plaintiff received to vacate the premises.id.at.kassim left the premises that day with cash,lottery tickets,and cigarettes,and was told that he had thirty days to remove the remainder of his property.id.
kassim complaint,filed february,sought compensatory and punitive damages.the district court granted kassim motion for partial summary judgment of liability.id.at.the court ruled as a matter of law on virtually undisputed material facts that kassim procedural due process rights were violated because he was entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to being evicted.the court ordered a jury trial to determine the amount of kassim damages.id.
defendants moved prior to trial to limit kassim damages.the court granted the motion,ruling that damages would be limited to lost or damaged property,a period of lost profits on the theory that,had kassim received thirty days notice before being required to close down his business,that would have been constitutionally adequate,and punitive damages.kassim had not sought damages for emotional distress.during the trial,kassim attempted to introduce an english translation of notebooks written in arabic,which were kept in kassim store and contained daily entries from february to april,the day of eviction,showing receipts and expenditures.defendants objected to the introduction of the exhibit.the court admitted the books,but only for the limited purpose of showing that this was a going business at the time and it was in operation.the notations of receipts and expenditures were thus excluded for the purpose of showing lost profits.
the jury awarded in compensatory damages for lost profits,but awarded nothing for loss damage to property and denied punitive damages.the court denied plaintiff motion to set aside the jury verdict.
plaintiff then moved,pursuant to,for attorney fees in the amount of,based on a claimed total of hours of attorney time.the court found in a memorandum decision and order dated october,that when the narrow issue and final result are taken into consideration,the hours claimed are entirely excessive,redundant,and unnecessary emphasis added.the court found that ninety attorney hours would have been appropriate,resulting in a fee of,which the court awarded.
kassim now appeals from the award of both damages and attorney fees.
discussion 
the amount of damages 
kassim appeal from the judgment awarding only in compensatory damages is clearly without merit and easily answered.
motion in limine 
kassim contends that the court limine ruling,limiting any compensatory award to loss of property and thirty days of lost profits,and implicitly denying damages for lack of a hearing,was error.we disagree.
kassim appears not to dispute that thirty days notice would have met the requirements of due process.accordingly,we need not rule on the adequacy of thirty days notice.kassim principal argument is rather that he is entitled to recover the entire value of his business,because prior to the eviction he had no opportunity to be heard.while defendants do not dispute the district court conclusion that the denial of a opportunity to be heard was a violation of his due process rights,kassim has made no showing of any loss or practical harm he suffered as a result of that deprivation.beyond vague,conclusory assertions,he has identified neither facts nor arguments he could have advanced in a hearing that might have obviated his eviction or reduced his losses.kassim furthermore does not dispute that he failed to pursue remedies that were available to him to contest his eviction.having shown no harm or loss attributable to the failure to give him a hearing,he has shown no reason why the court restriction on compensatory damages deprived him of any entitlement.see carey piphus,d discussing the need to demonstrate actual injury to justify damages exceeding a nominal award patterson city of utica,cir noting that a plaintiff may be entitled to collect compensatory damages,if he can prove that he suffered actual injury as a result of the denial of due process mccann coughlin,cir it is well established that to collect compensatory damages in an action brought pursuant to,a plaintiff must prove more than a mere violation of his constitutional rights.he must also demonstrate that the constitutional deprivation caused him some actual injury.
exclusion of business records 
kassim contends the district court committed prejudicial error in refusing to receive an english translation of notes made by plaintiff in arabic to show the daily receipts and expenditures of the store for the purpose of demonstrating lost profits.we find no error in the court ruling,although we do not agree with the reasons given for it by the district court.
the reasons given by the court for the exclusion were not entirely clear.an explanation for the exclusion was based on the document seeming inconsistency with kassim recent tax returns,which apparently showed lower profits than the notebooks.the court stated 
you ca have it both ways.he ca be claiming to this jury that he making a net profit of hundreds of dollars each day and then claiming income tax returns in which he either takes a loss or makes a minimal profit of a hundred dollars for the whole year.
in refusing to allow the notes to be presented to the jury,the court seemed to be saying one of two things i as between a party two inconsistent statements,the court may decide which was more reliable and allow only that one to be presented to the jury,or ii where a taxpayer declares low earnings on his tax return in order to get the benefit of low taxes,the taxpayer is estopped from inconsistently claiming higher earnings in a separate civil proceeding against a private party in which a claim of higher earnings would be advantageous.we think neither explanation would justify the court ruling.
where a party has made a prior statement inconsistent with the one the party seeks to advance at trial,a question of credibility arises,which is for the jury,not the judge,to assess.see,see also united states hale,d united states strother,cir.nor is there a rule of estoppel,based on fealty to the united states treasury,that one who has claimed low earnings on tax returns in order to secure a low tax burden is estopped from inconsistently claiming higher earnings in a civil proceeding against a private party.the credibility of plaintiff evidence of his business profits,in light of its inconsistency with his tax return,was for the jury to assess.
nonetheless,the exhibit offered by plaintiff was properly excluded.the exhibit was purportedly a translation from arabic prepared by marcia parker.parker,however,admitted in her testimony she neither speaks nor reads arabic and that her translation consisted of what plaintiff told her to write.parker did not testify that she had accurately translated the notes.nor did kassim testify that he had done so.there was no foundation to establish that the exhibit was a competent translation of the arabic notes.the exhibit and testimony failed to satisfy the requirement of federal rules of evidence,and a.defendants objection to the exhibit was properly sustained.
attorney fees 
while recognizing that kassim was the prevailing party,and thus presumptively entitled to reasonable attorney fees under,the district court declined to award the full requested fee of,premised on hours of attorney time.instead,the court allowed an aggregate of ninety hours,as between plaintiff two attorneys,resulting in a fee of.the court opinion explaining the reduction seems strongly to imply that,regardless of the result achieved in the litigation,the time claimed by kassim two attorneys was excessive and unreasonable.the court added,however,that when the narrow issue and final result are taken into consideration,the hours claimed are entirely excessive,redundant,and unnecessary emphasis added.the court reference to the final result suggests either of two rather different meanings.the court might have meant that the dispute concerned only and that a fee of for such a small matter was disproportionate and excessive.alternatively,the court might have meant that,while considerably larger amounts were at stake in the dispute,plaintiff low degree of success in winning only made it inappropriate to award such a high attorney fee.we can not tell from the court explanation which was its reason or to what extent it affected the award.plaintiff claims it was error to reduce the fee based on the final result of the litigation.
disproportion 
one sentence in the court opinion seems to suggest that the court considered the fee application disproportionate to the financial value of this case.in reviewing plaintiff application for attorney fees,the court stated,in apparent astonishment this results in a total legal fee application of for a case in which plaintiff received a verdict of.if the district court reduced the fee based on the perceived disproportionality of such a large fee in a matter involving only,this was error for at least two reasons.first,in litigating a matter,an attorney is in part reacting to forces beyond the attorney control,particularly the conduct of opposing counsel and of the court.if the attorney is compelled to defend against frivolous motions and to make motions to compel compliance with routine discovery demands,or to respond to unreasonable demands of the court for briefing or for wasteful,court appearances,the hours required to litigate even a simple matter can expand enormously.it is therefore difficult to generalize about the appropriate size of the fee in relation to the amount in controversy.second,was enacted in part to secure legal representation for plaintiffs whose constitutional injury was too small,in terms of expected monetary recovery,to create an incentive for attorneys to take the case under conventional fee arrangements.see city of riverside rivera,d plurality opinion id.at.powell,concurring in judgment.
reasoning that a rule calling for proportionality between the fee and the monetary amount involved in the litigation would effectively prevent plaintiffs from obtaining counsel in cases where deprivation of a constitutional right caused injury of low monetary value,we have repeatedly rejected the notion that a fee may be reduced merely because the fee would be disproportionate to the financial interest at stake in the litigation.see quaratino tiffany,cir quaratino ii rejecting a billing judgment rule that would limit the awardable fee to one rationally related to the recovery that could be expected ex ante cowan prudential ins.of,cir difilippo morizio,cir see also lunday city of albany,cir per curiam riese,cir grant bethlehem steel,cir.if the district court reduced the fee in the belief that the claimed hours were simply disproportionate in a case involving a injury,without regard to the reasonableness of the attorney expenditure of time in responding to the particular circumstances,this was error.
lack of success 
it is also possible that the court reduced the attorney fee award because of its perception that plaintiff achieved a low degree of success in securing the objectives of the litigation.because this question has been the subject of uncertainty in our decisions,we review the law as it has developed on the question,considering first the most relevant decisions of the supreme court.
the supreme court has consistently stressed the importance of the degree of the plaintiff success in the litigation as a factor affecting the size of the fee to be awarded.in hensley eckerhart,d,the plaintiffs,who brought a variety of factually and legally distinct claims,achieved considerable success on some of their claims but lost on others.the district court awarded an attorney fee of the full lodestar amount,refusing to eliminate hours devoted to the pursuit of unsuccessful claims.id.at.the supreme court vacated the award and took the opportunity to clarify the proper relationship of the results obtained to an award of attorney fees.id.at.
reviewing the large variety of factors relevant to an award of attorney fees,the court concluded that the most critical factor is the degree of success obtained.id.at.the court elaborated on this observation,both in the context of a suit involving a number of distinctly different claims for relief that are based on different facts and legal theories,id.at,and cases which present only a single claim or which involve a common core of facts or will be based on related legal theories,id.at.in either type of case,the court explained,the degree of success obtained is the most critical factor.id.at.see also id.at.in the first type of case involving different claims,
counsel work on one claim will be unrelated to his work on another claim.accordingly,work on an unsuccessful claim can not be deemed to have been expended in pursuit of the ultimate result achieved.the congressional intent to limit awards to prevailing parties requires that these unrelated claims be treated as if they had been raised in separate lawsuits,and therefore no fee may be awarded for services on the unsuccessful claim.
id.at.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
in the more unitary involving a common core of facts or related legal is more 
difficult to divide the hours expended on a basis.such a lawsuit can not be viewed as a series of discrete claims.instead the district court should focus on the significance of the overall relief obtained by the plaintiff in relation to the hours reasonably expended on the litigation.
where a plaintiff has obtained excellent results,his attorney should recover a fully compensatory fee encompass ing all hours reasonably expended t he fee award should not be reduced simply because the plaintiff failed to prevail on every contention raised in the lawsuit 
if,on the other hand,a plaintiff has achieved only partial or limited success,the product of hours reasonably expended on the litigation as a whole times a reasonable hourly rate may be an excessive amount.
id.at.the court stressed 
t he extent of a plaintiff success is
