in this case petitioner emma murray,the claimant in a workers compensation case,challenges the constitutionality of the statute governing attorney fees in such cases,section,florida statutes.in murray mariners usa,so d,dca,the first district court of appeal expressly held that the statute as significantly amended in is constitutional.the district court rejected each of petitioner challenges and found that the formula of subsection governs the award of reasonable attorney fees under subsection.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.
we need not address the constitutional issues raised in this case.see state giorgetti,so d,we are also obligated to construe statutes in a manner that avoids a holding that a statute may be unconstitutional.we hold,based upon the plain language of the statute,that when a claimant is entitled to recover attorney fees from a carrier or employer as provided by section a,b,c,or d,the claimant is entitled to recover a reasonable attorney fee.see.stat.section,does not define reasonable attorney fee,and an ambiguity results when subsection and subsection are read together.accordingly,we have determined that reasonable attorney fees for claimants,when not otherwise defined in the workers compensation statute,are to be determined using the factors of rule b of the rules regulating the florida bar.see lee eng g constr.fellows,so d,applying canon of the canons of professional ethics,the predecessor to rule b.
i.the prior proceedings 
petitioner,a certified nursing assistant,suffered an injury while assisting a coworker in lifting a patient.she was diagnosed with a uterine prolapse and underwent a hysterectomy.she filed a petition for workers compensation benefits including temporary total disability,temporary partial disability,medical care,costs,and attorney fees.respondents in this case,mariner health and ace usa,the employer and its insurance carrier,responded by denying that any benefits were owed.at the hearing before the judge of compensation claims jcc,respondents contended that no injury arose out of or in the course of employment the claim was fraudulent under section,florida statutes,because petitioner provided an incomplete medical history the major contributing cause of claimant prolapsed uterus was from her experience giving birth and no costs,fees,or interest were owed.after hearing all of the evidence and arguments,the jcc found petitioner testimony to be credible and the testimony of the independent medical examiner most convincing.murray mariners health,ojcc case.div.of admin.hearings compensation order filed may,at.accordingly,the jcc found that petitioner claims were compensable and awarded her in benefits.
when petitioner prevailed at the hearing,the next issue to be addressed by the jcc was attorney fees.section,florida statutes,governs attorney fees in workers compensation cases.subsections and,the provisions at issue here,provide as follows 
a fee,gratuity,or other consideration may not be paid for a claimant in connection with any proceedings arising under this chapter,unless approved as reasonable by the judge of compensation claims or court having jurisdiction over such proceedings.any attorney fee approved by a judge of compensation claims for benefits secured on behalf of a claimant must equal to percent of the first of the amount of the benefits secured,percent of the next of the amount of the benefits secured,percent of the remaining amount of the benefits secured to be provided during the first years after the date the claim is filed,and percent of the benefits secured after years.the judge of compensation claims shall not approve a compensation order,a joint stipulation for settlement,a stipulation or agreement between a claimant and his or her attorney,or any other agreement related to benefits under this chapter that provides for an attorney fee in excess of the amount permitted by this section.the judge of compensation claims is not required to approve any retainer agreement between the claimant and his or her attorney.the retainer agreement as to fees and costs may not be for compensation in excess of the amount allowed under this section.
if any party should prevail in any proceedings before a judge of compensation claims or court,there shall be taxed against the nonprevailing party the reasonable costs of such proceedings,not to include attorney fees.a claimant shall be responsible for the payment of her or his own attorney fees,except that a claimant shall be entitled to recover a reasonable attorney fee from a carrier or employer 
a against whom she or he successfully asserts a petition for medical benefits only,if the claimant has not filed or is not entitled to file at such time a claim for disability,permanent impairment,or death benefits,arising out of the same accident 
b in any case in which the employer or carrier files a response to petition denying benefits with the office of the judges of compensation claims and the injured person has employed an attorney in the successful prosecution of the petition 
c in a proceeding in which a carrier or employer denies that an accident occurred for which compensation benefits are payable,and the claimant prevails on the issue of compensability or 
d in cases where the claimant successfully prevails in proceedings filed under or.
regardless of the date benefits were initially requested,attorney fees shall not attach under this subsection until days after the date the carrier or employer,if,receives the petition.
stat.by the plain language of subsection,when,as in this case,a claimant hires an attorney and prevails after an employer and its insurance carrier deny benefits,the claimant is entitled to recover a reasonable attorney fee from the.
the parties here agreed that petitioner was so entitled,but they disputed how to calculate the attorney fee award.at a subsequent hearing,petitioner argued that the jcc should determine the fee award after considering various factors that we articulated in lee engineering,factors which were previously listed in subsection of the statute.see lee eng g,so d at.the respondents asserted,however,that the attorney fee amount had to be calculated in accordance with subsection,which provides a formula based on percentages of the monetary amount of the benefits awarded to the claimant 
at the hearing on the fee award,attorneys who practice in the subject area and represent both claimants and employers and carriers testified to the customary hourly rate paid to attorneys in such cases and to the complexity of the issues in this case and of workers compensation law.evidence was presented showing that the usual rate of pay for attorney fees in such cases was an hour.however,if the attorney fees were determined on the basis of the formula set out in the statute subsection,petitioner would be entitled to an attorney fee award of an hour for her attorney,who worked approximately eighty hours on the case.the witnesses at the hearing testified that this amount was manifestly unfair and placed claimants at a disadvantage.claimants would be unable to represent themselves against an because of the complexity of the law and the issues involved,and many would be unable to obtain counsel when an wrongly denied benefits if there was no prospect for the attorney to be reasonably compensated.evidence showed that respondents in this case paid their attorney hours at an hour in the unsuccessful effort to resist paying benefits.
after hearing the testimony and arguments,the jcc found that petitioner counsel expended eighty hours of reasonable and necessary time on the case but determined that the fee award of subsection was governed by the statutory formula of subsection.thus,the jcc awarded petitioner attorney fees of,which the respondents were required to pay.noting that this equated to an hourly rate of because of the low monetary value of the benefits won,the jcc commented 
given that this was a very complex case,with difficult issues,very contingent,required a highly skilled practitioner and that petitioner attorney enjoys an outstanding reputation as a highly skilled and experienced workers compensation practitioner,an attorney fee of per hour would on its face hardly appear to be reasonable.it would appear to be manifestly unfair.

next,the jcc addressed petitioner request that the jcc nevertheless consider what the fee award would be if he applied the reasonableness factors of lee engineering that formerly appeared in the statutory formula.among other findings,the jcc found that based on the novelty and difficulty of the issues,the skill required of the attorney to prevail was of the greatest magnitude the customary charge in the geographic region was an hour and the contingency of the compensation was high and militated in favor of an upward fee adjustment.compensation order at.the jcc concluded that under these factors,a reasonable fee would be,based on an hour for eighty hours.id.at.
on appeal,the first district affirmed the jcc order awarding the fee,relying on its own prior cases addressing constitutional challenges to the statute 
the claimant,emma murray,appeals the judge of compensation claims jcc order awarding an attorney fee in strict accordance with the guideline formula set forth in section,florida statutes.the appellant constitutional challenges to this statute,as significantly amended in,were considered and rejected in our recent decisions in lundy four seasons ocean grand palm beach,so d dca and campbell aramark,so d dca.accordingly,we are constrained to affirm the jcc award of a reasonable attorney fee based on the statutory guideline formula.see wood.rock,so d dca,granting motion for certification,so d dca.

ii.analysis 
petitioner urges that the jcc and the district court erred as a matter of law in determining that the amount of the reasonable attorney fees award paid by the respondents for the petitioner attorney under subsection was determined solely under the statutory formula in subsection.alternatively,petitioner contends that if the formula of subsection does limit the fee award of subsection,then the statute violates her constitutional rights of equal protection,due process,and access to the courts,and also violates the constitutional separation of powers.in the case below,the district court affirmed the jcc order by relying on several prior decisions that addressed these issues,including wood florida rock industries,so d dca,review denied,so d.murray,so d at examining only subsection of the revised statute in wood,the district court concluded that the legislature had defined a reasonable attorney fee as the amount determined under the percentage formula of subsection and held that the statute prohibited the jcc from approving an amount exceeding that percentage figure.see wood,so d at.
statutory interpretation is a question of law subject to de novo review.see daniels.dep t of health,so d,state burris,so d.below,we analyze the issue presented under this standard,keeping in mind that w herever possible,statutes should be construed in such a manner so as to avoid an unconstitutional result.state jefferson,so d.
plain language and ambiguity 
an examination of the plain language of subsections and reveals that when the formula requirement of subsection is read together with the reasonable attorney fee authorization of subsection,a statutory ambiguity is created.subsection provides that any fee paid for a claimant must be approved as reasonable by the jcc any attorney fee approved by the jcc must equal the statutory formula,which is based on a percentage amount of the dollar value of the compensation benefits obtained by the claimant and the jcc can not approve an attorney fee exceeding the amount permitted by this section.stat.
no reference is made in subsection to subsection nor does subsection refer to subsection.rather,subsection authorizes reasonable attorney fees without any mention of the formula.it is obvious,as demonstrated by the present case,that applying the formula in all cases will not result in the determination of reasonable attorney fees in all cases.in some circumstances,applying the formula will result in inadequate fees,and in some circumstances,applying the formula will result in excessive fees to address this ambiguity,we begin by reviewing the relevant history of the attorney fee statute.
statutory history of the attorney fee award 
we have noted that t he workmen compensation act was originally passed as administrative legislation to be simple,expeditious,and inexpensive so that the injured employee,his family,or society generally,would be relieved of the economic stress resulting from injuries,and place the burden on the industry which caused the injury.lee eng g,so d at.the theory underlying the act was that a claimant did not need an attorney and could alone navigate the procedures to obtain the benefits to which he or she was entitled under the law.id.thus,originally,when a claimant hired an attorney,the claimant attorney fee was the obligation of the claimant.the legislature,however,was concerned that the bulk of the compensation benefit go to the claimant,not his attorney.accordingly,to protect a claimant compensation award,the legislature,from the original adoption of the act,gave the jcc or relevant administrative body,however denominated at the time,approval oversight of the amount a claimant paid to his attorney.see ch,laws of.
in,the legislature revised the statutory scheme and mandated that in some instances,the should pay for the claimant to have an attorney.see ch,laws of.the legislature amended the statute to provide in pertinent part as follows 
if the employer or carrier shall file notice of controversy provided in section of this act,or shall decline to pay a claim on or before the day after they have notice of same,or shall otherwise resist unsuccessfully the payment of compensation,and the injured person shall have employed an attorney at law in the successful prosecution of his claim,there shall,in addition to the award for compensation,be awarded a reasonable attorney fee,to be approved by the commission which may be paid direct to the attorney for the claimant in a lump sum.
id.emphasis added.as the first district noted regarding a subsequent version of this provision,the legislative determination that a fee is payable by the in the circumstances enumerated in this subsection reflects a public policy decision that claimants are entitled to and are in need of counsel under those conditions.pilon okeelanta,so d,dca see lockett smith,so d.under the provision,a prevailing claimant compensation award was not reduced at all because the claimant hired counsel,and the employer and carrier were discouraged from delaying timely payment of benefits owed.
thereafter,we determined the ethical rule governing attorney fees was a safe guide in fixing the amount of fees awarded the claimant under the statute.silica sand parker,so d,citing canon of the rules of ethics governing attorneys,now codified as rule of the rules regulating the florida bar fees and costs for legal services.subsequently,in lee engineering,we directly addressed the method for determining this reasonable attorney fee award under the statute.we rejected strict application of a contingent percentage of the benefit award,finding such to be inappropriate for this area of the law,and remanded for determination of a reasonable attorney fee by applying the factors in our rule.lee eng g,so d at.
the legislature later amended section and incorporated these factors as follows 
if the employer or carrier shall file notice of controversy as provided in,or shall decline to pay a claim on or before the day after they have notice of same,or shall otherwise resist unsuccessfully the payment of compensation,and the claimant injured person shall have employed an attorney at law in the successful prosecution of the claim,there shall,in addition to the award for compensation,be awarded a reasonable attorney fee of percent of the first of the amount of the benefits secured,percent of the next of the amount of the benefits secured,and percent of the remaining amount of the benefits secured,to be approved by the judge of industrial cla
