relevant factual and procedural history 
in,carter entered into a lease agreement with ree whitford regarding a guesthouse in north hollywood.the guesthouse contained two rooms with a kitchen area,and was detached from a house on the same property.the guesthouse had been constructed without building permits,and was not registered under the rso.from to,carter paid whitford per month in rent.

discussion 
cohen contends that the trial court erred in permitting carter to assert a claim under the rso for excessive rental payments,and awarding attorney fees to carter under a provision of the rso.
claim for excess rent payments 
cohen contends that carter claim for excess rent payments under the rso failed as a matter of law because carter rental agreement was unlawful and the guesthouse fell outside the rso.he maintains that carter was entitled to recover her rental payments only to the extent they exceeded the reasonable rental value of the guesthouse.for the reasons explained below,we reject his contentions.
we begin by examining the rso and other pertinent provisions of the los angeles municipal code.in,the los angeles city council enacted the rso in an effort to regulate rent increases due to a housing shortage.klarfeld berg cal d.the legislative purposes of the rso are declared in section there is a shortage of decent,safe and sanitary housing in the city of los angeles resulting in a critically low vacancy factor.therefore,it is necessary and reasonable to regulate rents so as to safeguard tenants from excessive rent increases,while at the same time providing landlords with just and reasonable returns from their rental units.
the rso established measures to regulate rents and created the rent adjustment commission to enforce them.central to the rso is a provision governing permissible rent adjustments.absent special circumstances,the rso permits a landlord to impose a maximum adjusted rent during a given by a baseline maximum rent for a preceding period and an allowable adjustment,which is ordinarily a percentage of the baseline maximum rent.regarding such adjustments,section a states it shall be unlawful for any landlord to demand,accept or retain more than the maximum adjusted rent permitted pursuant to this chapter or regulation or orders adopted pursuant to this chapter.section a further obliges landlords to register rental units,and provides that after april,no landlord shall demand or accept rent for a rental unit without first serving a copy of a valid registration or annual registration renewal statement on the tenant of that rental unit.
the rso also established remedies for its violation.pertinent here is section a,which states any person who demands,accepts or retains any payment of rent in excess of the maximum rent or maximum adjusted rent in violation of the provisions of this chapter shall be liable in a civil action to the person from whom such payment is demanded,accepted or retained for damages of three times the amount by which the payment or payments demanded,accepted or retained exceed the maximum rent or maximum adjusted rent which could be lawfully demanded,accepted or retained together with reasonable attorneys fees and costs as determined by the court.
also relevant to our inquiry are provisions of the los angeles municipal code not located within the rso that regulate the occupancy of any structure.generally,section prohibits the use of any structure or building in the absence of all permits and licenses required by all laws and ordinances.section e further provides that no building erected or structurally altered shall be occupied or used until a certificate of occupancy shall have been issued.a certificate of occupancy is issued only when a structure is completed in conformity with the los angeles municipal code.pope state bd.of equalization d.
underlying proceedings 
prior to trial,cohen contended that carter rental agreement was unlawful because the guesthouse had been constructed without the requisite building permits,and that the rso was inapplicable to an illegal property.he maintained that carter could seek nothing more than restitution,which limited her recovery to her rent payments in excess of the reasonable rental value.in ruling on the parties motions in limine,the trial court concluded that despite the unlawful rental agreement,carter was entitled to assert her claim to recover rent paid in excess of the rso limit the trial court further found that for purposes of determining the maximum adjusted rent,carter baseline maximum rent was per month,that is,the rent she had paid whitford before cohen took over the property.
at trial,the jury heard testimony from carter and cohen.carter testified as follows she was unaware that the guesthouse was not registered under the rso until,when cohen bought the property and proposed to increase her monthly rent from to.in response to the proposal,carter contacted the los angeles housing department,and discovered that the guesthouse was not registered under the rso.carter agreed to the rent increase and signed a new lease agreement with cohen.in,while talking to whitford,carter learned that the guesthouse had been constructed without building permits and was,according to whitford,not permitted,not legal.in or around september,when cohen proposed to increase carter monthly rent to upon renewing her lease,carter filed an complaint with the los angeles housing department.she decided not to pursue the complaint due to fear of retaliation,and agreed to the rent increase.a year later,after cohen sought to increase her monthly rent to,she notified him of her intention to vacate the guesthouse.
cohen testified that when he bought the property in,he knew that the guesthouse had been built without permits and that it did not comply with the building code.according to cohen,whitford told him the guesthouse had been built at a time before codes and was grandfathered in for purposes of the building code.cohen did nothing to make the guesthouse legal,and decided to continue renting it to carter.during carter tenancy,he never tried to register the guesthouse under the rso because he was unaware of any obligation to do so.in november,the los angeles department of building services ordered him to halt the occupation of the guesthouse because it lacked a certificate of occupancy.
susan gosden,an employee working in the rental stabilization division of the los angeles housing department,testified regarding the rent increases permitted under the rso from to.according to gosden,the guesthouse had never been registered under the rso.she also opined that the city of los angeles would not have allowed a landlord to register the guesthouse because it had been built without the requisite permits.
following the presentation of evidence,the jury was directed to determine the amount by which carter rent payments exceeded the rso limits.the jury found this amount to be.
the key issue before us is whether the trial court erred in concluding that cohen was subject to the rso prohibition against the collection of excessive rent.at the outset,we note the narrow scope of our inquiry.although the trial court made several rulings adverse to carter regarding her rso claims,she never noticed an appeal and does not challenge those rulings on appeal.we therefore do not address the rulings,including the determinations that carter could not recover her rent payments in their entirety and that she was not entitled to trebled damages as a penalty.our inquiry is limited to whether carter was entitled to recover her excess rent payments,even though the guesthouse lacked a certificate of occupancy and was not registered under the rso.
to the extent our examination requires us to interpret the rso and other provisions of the los angeles municipal code,we follow established principles.generally,local ordinances are construed in light of the canons of statutory construction.city of san diego rider th.w e begin with the fundamental rule that a court should ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.in determining such intent,the court turns first to the words themselves for the answer.we are required to give effect to statutes according to the usual,ordinary import of the language employed in framing them.moreover,the various parts of a statutory enactment must be harmonized by considering the particular clause or section in the context of the statutory framework as a whole.citation.rodriguez solis th.
under these principles,the rso,by its plain language,authorized carter recovery of her excess rent payments.as noted above see pt,ante,section a states that i t shall be unlawful for any landlord to demand,accept or retain more than the maximum adjusted rent permitted under the rso in addition,section a bars a landlord from demand ing or accept ing rent for a rental unit in the absence of a valid registration or annual registration renewal statement.under the rso,the term rental unit includes a ll dwelling units,as specified in section,unless the unit falls within an enumerated exception.in turn,section states that a dwelling unit is a group of two or more rooms,one of which is a kitchen,designed for occupancy by one family for living and sleeping purposes.here,the evidence at trial established that the unregistered guesthouse was a dwelling unit,so defined moreover,cohen has not identified any express exception to the rso definition of rental unit that encompasses the guesthouse,and we do not discern any such exception under these circumstances,cohen was prohibited from obtaining rent in excess of the rso limit.accordingly,cohen improperly demand ed payment of rent in excess of the maximum rent or maximum adjusted rent,within the meaning of the penalty provision of the rso a.
cohen contends that the trial court erred in permitting carter to recover her excess rent payments,as this had the effect of enforcing an unlawful rental agreement.he argues that the rental agreement was void and unenforceable because the guesthouse had been built without permits,lacked a certificate of occupancy,and was unregistered under the rso.for the reasons discussed below,these facts did not preclude carter recovery under the rso.
rental agreements involving units that were constructed without building permits or lack a certificate of occupancy are ordinarily regarded as unlawful and void.espinoza calva th,salazar maradeaga th supp,salazar.this is because t he object of a contract must be lawful citation,it must not be in conflict either with express statutes or public policy accordingly,i f the contract has a single object,and that object is unlawful whether in whole or in part,the entire contract is void.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.contracts.
generally,the courts will not enforce an illegal bargain or lend their assistance to a party who seeks compensation for an illegal act.lewis queen ball sons cal d,lewis queen.our supreme court has explained the reason for this refusal is not that the courts are unaware of possible injustice between the parties,and that the defendant may be left in possession of some benefit he should in good conscience turn over to the plaintiff,but that this consideration is outweighed by the importance of deterring illegal conduct.knowing that they will receive no help from the courts and must trust completely to each other good faith,the parties are less likely to enter an illegal arrangement in the first place.citations.ibid.
nonetheless,the rule barring the enforcement of unlawful contracts is not absolute.because the rationale for the rule is founded on deterrence,the supreme court has made clear that courts should not blindly extend the rule to every case where illegality appears somewhere in the transaction.the fundamental purpose of the rule must always be kept in mind,and the realities of the situation must be considered.where,by applying the rule,the public can not be protected because the transaction has been completed,where no serious moral turpitude is involved,where the defendant is the one guilty of the greatest moral fault,and where to apply the rule will be to permit the defendant to be unjustly enriched at the expense of the plaintiff,the rule should not be applied,cal d,quoting norwood judd d.
one type of situation in which the rule is inapplicable is described in lewis queen w hen the legislature enacts a statute forbidding certain conduct for the purpose of protecting one class of persons from the activities of another,a member of the protected class may maintain an action notwithstanding the fact that he has shared in the illegal transaction.the protective purpose of the legislation is realized by allowing the plaintiff to maintain his action against a defendant within the class primarily to be deterred.in this situation it is said that the plaintiff is not in pari delicto.citations,at,italics omitted.courts have thus permitted parties to obtain benefits under a law enacted for their protection,despite their participation in transactions that contravened the law page bakersfield uniform.d,defense of unclean hands can not be used to defeat claim under unfair competition law bus,et.similarly,courts have permitted parties to enforce contracts that contravene statutes enacted for the parties benefit yuba cypress housing partners,area developers th,home purchaser was entitled to enforce attorney fee provision of sales agreement void under statute intended to protect home buyers.
in our view,the principles enunciated by our supreme court in and lewis queen encompass carter claim for excess rent payments under the rso.as noted above see pt,ante,the rso was enacted to safeguard tenants from excessive rent increases.although rental agreements regarding units lacking a certificate of occupancy are unlawful,their enforcement by tenants is subject to the principles that we have explained.see espinoza calva,supra,th at.here,carter sought n
