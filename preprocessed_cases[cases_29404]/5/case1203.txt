once more we must address an issue arising out of the protracted litigation between microsoft corporation and its freelance workers,this time to decide whether the district court abused its discretion in the amount of attorneys fees it awarded to class counsel.
factual and procedural background 
beginning in,microsoft supplemented its workforce with workers known as freelancers,who agreed in writing that they would not be eligible for microsoft employee benefits,including the employee stock purchase plan espp and the savings plus plan spp.in,eight former freelancers brought this action challenging microsoft refusal to provide them with benefits under these plans.the district court certified a class and dismissed the action.after a panel of this court reversed the dismissal of both the espp and spp claims the full court voted to rehear the case en banc.the en banc court also reversed the district court dismissal of the espp claim,but held that plaintiffs had not exhausted their administrative remedies for the spp claim,and remanded that claim to the plan administrator for adjudication in the first instance.vizcaino microsoft,cir.on remand,the district court substantially narrowed the class.vizcaino microsoft,employee benefits cas.bna,wl.this court then granted mandamus,held the class to include persons who had worked for microsoft after,and identified factors to be applied in determining individual eligibility.vizcaino united states dist.for the dist.of,cir.settlement negotiations followed,and after two years the parties submitted a proposed settlement of all claims to the district court.the agreement required microsoft to deposit into a settlement fund,to be distributed to the class members after payment of incentive awards,costs,and fees.microsoft also changed its staffing and worker classification practices,resulting in the hiring of over class members as employees entitled to participate in employee benefit plans and programs.
after receiving written submissions and hearing argument,the district court approved the settlement on extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law.it then received class counsel application for an award of attorneys fees of of the cash settlement fund.two members of the class objected.after considering the submissions of counsel and the objectors,and hearing argument on the fee award,the court entered an order approving class counsel fee request.vizcaino microsoft,d.before us now is the objectors appeal from that order.we review for abuse of discretion.class plaintiffs jaffe schlesinger,cir.
discussion 
objectors challenge the district court order on three grounds first,and principally,that in awarding a fee of of the settlement fund,it ignored the rule second,that in applying a lodestar,it used an improper methodology and third,that in denying objectors fee request without explanation,it abused its discretion.we address each contention in turn.
i.the district court percentage calculation 
the district court found that the settlement fund was the product of the successful claim for benefits under microsoft espp because washington law governed the claim,it also governs the award of fees.mangold.pub.utils.comm n,cir.under washington law,the approach is used in calculating fees in common fund cases.bowles dep t of ret,holding that in a common fund case,the size of the recovery constitutes a suitable measure of the attorneys performance.the district court followed the washington practice of looking to federal law for guidance in this area,and we will do the same.see id.under ninth circuit law,the district court has discretion in common fund cases to choose either the or the lodestar method.in re.pub.power supply.sec,cir wppss.objectors do not challenge the district court choice of the percentage method,only its application.
the district court based its percentage award on bowles,which states that i n common fund cases,the benchmark award is percent of the recovery obtained,with as the usual range.bowles,at.ninth circuit cases echo this approach.paul,johnson,alston hunt graulty,cir.objectors contend that the award is nevertheless excessive,arguing that the court erred in failing to take into account that this is a megafund case to which it should have applied what objectors call the rule.they rely principally on wppss,in which the district court chose the lodestar rather than the percentage method in awarding fees from a million settlement fund.the district court observed that in many cases awards fall outside the typical range and the percentage of an award generally decreases as the amount of the fund increases.wppss,at.we did not adopt this observation as a principle governing fee awards.rather,we merely noted that in cases of that magnitude,fund size is one relevant circumstance to which courts must refer,stating 
we agree with the district court that there is no necessary correlation between any particular percentage and a reasonable fee.with a fund this large,picking a percentage without reference to all the circumstances of the case,including the size of the fund,would be like picking a number out of the air because a court must consider the fund size in light of the circumstances of the particular case,we agree with the district court that the percent benchmark is of little assistance in a case such as this.
id.we concluded that the district court had acted within its discretion in considering the size of the fund in adopting the lodestar method.
the benchmark rate,although a starting point for analysis,may be inappropriate in some cases.selection of the benchmark or any other rate must be supported by findings that take into account all of the circumstances of the case.as we said in wppss,in passing on fee applications,courts can not rationally apply any particular percent,percent or any other the abstract,without reference to all the circumstances of the case.id.at see also camden i condominium ass n,dunkle,cir noting with approval that district courts are increasingly supporting their percentage awards with particular findings showing factors considered.quoting herbert newberg,attorney fee awards ed.objectors argument that the district court erred in not fixing a lower percentage,such as one between and,flies in the face of this reasoning.the question is not whether the district court should have applied some other percentage,but whether in arriving at its percentage it considered all the circumstances of the case and reached a reasonable percentage.we now turn to the court examination of those circumstances.
first,the court found that counsel achieved exceptional results for the class.vizcaino,d at.the court found that counsel pursued this case in the absence of supporting precedents,in the face of agreements signed by the class members forsaking fact that led four judges of this court to dissent from the panel and en banc against microsoft vigorous opposition throughout the litigation.exceptional results are a relevant circumstance.see torrisi tucson power,cir considering counsel expert handling of the case six mexican workers.citrus growers,cir noting plaintiffs substantial success in re prudential ins.sales practices,cir observing that results achieved were nothing short of remarkable quoting in re prudential ins.sales practices.
second,the court found the case to have been extremely risky for class counsel for the reasons just stated.twice plaintiffs lost in the district on the merits,once on the class twice counsel succeeded in reviving their case on appeal risk is a relevant circumstance.see in re pac.enter.sec,cir holding fees justified because of the complexity of the issues and the risks bebchick.metro.area transit comm n,considering counsel repeated successes in overturning adverse determinations calculating lodestar wppss,at finding district court failure to apply multiplier to lodestar calculation was abuse of discretion where case was fraught with risk and recovery was far from certain.
third,the court found that counsel performance generated benefits beyond the cash settlement fund.during the litigation,microsoft agreed to hire roughly class members as regular employees and to change
