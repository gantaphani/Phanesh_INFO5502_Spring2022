simplot company,simplot phosphates,llc,and simplot pipeline,llc collectively simplot sued chevron pipeline company,chevron chemical company,and chevron,collectively chevron for failure to defend and indemnify simplot pursuant to two sales agreements.chevron denied its liability and asserted counterclaims.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of simplot,determining chevron breached its duty to defend.as damages,the court awarded simplot the attorneys fees and costs it had incurred in defending the underlying litigation.chevron appeals from the district court judgment.we affirm in part and reverse in part.
the relevant background begins over twenty years ago in the western united states.chevron owned and operated a phosphate mine in utah.it also owned a phosphate fertilizer processing plant in wyoming.to transport the phosphate ore from utah to wyoming,chevron constructed a mile pipeline between the two locations.ashley creek phosphate company owned undeveloped phosphate leases adjacent to chevron utah mine.ashley creek sought access to chevron pipeline,claiming chevron was a common carrier and its pipeline was an essential facility for developing a phosphate mining operation.
the initiation of the ashley creek litigation 
in may,chevron published a tariff for its pipeline.ashley creek sued chevron,alleging the pipeline tariff was so high that it violated antitrust laws by excluding ashley creek from the market.the district court referred the question of the tariff reasonableness to the surface transportation board stb and stayed the remainder of the case while the action was pending before the stb,chevron began negotiations to sell its entire phosphate operation,including the pipeline,to simplot.
negotiations and the sale 
simplot knew it might be subject to suit by ashley creek if it purchased chevron pipeline,and it entered negotiations with chevron over who would be responsible for the defense of the pending ashley creek litigation.chevron informed simplot,i t is our preference to sell the business as is and reflect the risk of possible liabilities in the closing price.if this should be unacceptable,chevron might be willing to accept liabilities on a cost sharing basis for a limited time.at.simplot that it would take control of the ashley creek litigation at chevron expense.the parties met and tentatively agreed that chevron w ould retain responsibility over the litigation but w ould consult with simplot regarding any settlement.id.at capitalization omitted.
simplot circulated a draft sale agreement following the negotiations.the draft provided that simplot would assume control over the defense of the ashley creek litigation,but that chevron would be responsible for attorneys fees,costs,and damages resulting from the litigation.chevron did not accept simplot draft,stating that the principal issue continues to be the liability provisions.id.at.
simplot circulated revised drafts.the drafts stated that chevron would retain control over the defense of the ashley creek litigation,advise simplot of the status of the proceedings,consult with simplot concerning defense strategy,settle the litigation only with simplot permission,and pay all resulting penalties,damages,and costs.id.at.simplot would assume only the responsibility and cost of prospective compliance with the tariff when set in the stb case.id.at.simplot circulated three additional drafts.none of the drafts materially altered these revised terms.simplot and chevron closed the sale in.
two final agreements were central to this sale the phosphate slurry pipeline asset sale agreement pipeline agreement and the phosphate fertilizer business asset sale agreement plant agreement.the agreements contain virtually identical pertinent terms,discussed more fully infra,which include indemnification provisions and an integration clause.the agreements provide,as of the closing date,that simplot would assume i liabilities relating to its purchase that arose after the closing date and ii liabilities specifically set forth in particular provisions.chevron retained responsibility for its defense in the pending ashley creek litigation and any concomitant damages and costs.the agreements also provide that chevron would,inter alia,indemnify and defend simplot for liabilities i arising from the operation of the pipeline before the closing date or ii arising from a breach of any representation,warranty,or covenant.in exchange,simplot agreed to indemnify and to defend chevron for liabilities i arising from the operation of the pipeline after the closing date or ii arising from a breach of any representation,warranty,or covenant.
the ashley creek litigation post closing 
upon acquiring the pipeline,simplot adopted the same tariff previously published by chevron.in response,ashley creek filed an stb complaint against simplot alleging various antitrust claims.simplot retained chevron stb lawyer for representation before the stb,and it paid for this initial defense.
the stb eventually consolidated ashley creek cases against simplot and chevron.simplot notified chevron of its contractual duty to pay the expenses of the ashley creek litigation,proposing that chevron reimburse it for all costs incurred to date in the stb proceedings and agree to assume all costs incurred in the future.at.simplot reasoned that this proposal conformed with the pipeline agreement b ecause all of the ashley creek proceedings revolve around the question of chevron compliance or noncompliance with federal law.id.chevron rejected simplot proposal,claiming it should not pay for additional costs,if any,related solely to simplot obtaining stb approval for its tariff or allegations by ashley creek directed at simplot.id.at.
ashley creek also sued simplot in district court.the court consolidated ashley creek cases against simplot and chevron.simplot asked chevron to pay for its attorneys fees,costs,losses,and liabilities incurred in connection with the district court case.as in the stb case,chevron refused.simplot and chevron agreed to toll any claims against each other until the completion of the ashley creek litigation.simplot and chevron ultimately prevailed against ashley creek.
the road to ashley creek defeat began in when the stb issued its decision outlining the framework and methodology for calculating a reasonable tariff.although the stb did not determine reasonableness,it did suggest the aggregate tariffs charged were likely unreasonable.the stb implied solution was adoption of a tariff well below simplot operating costs to offset the higher tariffs charged during chevron period of ownership.simplot did not publish a new,significantly reduced tariff until.when it did so,its goal was to defeat ashley creek claims by lowering the tariff to remove any argument that the tariff wa s preventing ashley creek from mining phosphate rock.at.
thereafter,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of simplot and chevron in the ashley creek litigation.the court held that simplot current and prior tariffs were not unreasonable or exclusionary even if chevron higher tariffs were included in the analysis,the total tariff collections over the relevant time frame were not unreasonable because of simplot new,below market rates.ashley creek appealed,and we affirmed based on a lack of antitrust standing.see ashley creek phosphate chevron usa,cir.
the current action 
in july,simplot sued chevron for the attorneys fees and costs it incurred in the ashley creek litigation,as well as prejudgment interest.simplot claimed chevron had a duty to defend and to indemnify it under the agreements and demanded a jury trial.chevron filed counterclaims,asserting simplot had a contractual obligation to pay part of chevron attorneys fees and costs.
the district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of simplot with respect to its claims against chevron.after reviewing chevron proffered extrinsic evidence,the court determined the relevant contractual language was unambiguous.it analogized the agreements to insurance contracts and held chevron had breached its contractual duty to defend simplot in the ashley creek litigation.it reasoned chevron had a duty to defend simplot because ashley creek allegations i related to or arose out of acts occurring before the closing and ii raised the question of whether chevron tariffs constituted a breach of warranty.the court held,however,that chevron had no indemnification duty because ashley creek did not obtain a judgment against simplot.
the district court applied the same rationale in granting partial summary judgment in favor of simplot on chevron counterclaims.just as chevron had no duty to indemnify simplot,simplot had no duty to indemnify chevron in the absence of an adverse judgment.the court also concluded simplot had no contractual duty to ensure the reasonableness of its tariff,and chevron could not use the covenant of good faith and fair dealing to create such an obligation to which simplot did not agree.
regarding the remaining issue of damages,the district court denied chevron request for a jury trial on the amount of attorneys fees and costs to be awarded simplot for its defense of the ashley creek litigation.the court held that simplot was entitled to the benefit of its contractual bargain,and that its in requested fees and costs was not inequitable or unreasonable.
the court concluded that simplot was justified in hiring different counsel for each of the separate corporate entities affiliated with simplot.it awarded simplot its requested fees and costs,plus prejudgment interest,and entered a judgment of against chevron.this appeal followed.
chevron asks us to revisit three specific issues central to the district court decision.first,chevron argues that simplot must bear its own litigation expenses under the plain language of the agreements.in the alternative,chevron claims that the agreements are ambiguous and that their interpretation raises a question of fact for a jury.second,chevron contends it can recoup some of its litigation expenses from simplot pursuant to an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.third,chevron asserts it has a seventh amendment right to a jury trial to ascertain the amount of simplot damages from any breach of the duty to defend.we address each issue in turn.
we review a district court summary judgment decision de novo,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.archuleta stores,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.kelley city of albuquerque,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also.c.while the movant has the burden of showing no genuine issue of material fact exists,the party opposing summary judgment must present evidence from which a jury might return a verdict in his favor.anderson liberty lobby,d.
the first issue before us is whether chevron has a duty under the agreements to pay simplot the attorneys fees and costs it incurred in defending against the ashley creek litigation.we must determine whether the agreements are ambiguous,and,if not,whether chevron is liable to simplot under the unambiguous terms.in this diversity case,we turn to utah law to interpret the agreements for the sake of brevity,we recite only the pipeline agreement terms.
integration 
before delving into the ambiguity inquiry,utah law requires us to decide whether the agreements are integrated.daines vincent,utah.the parol evidence rule generally precludes the admission of evidence of contemporaneous conversations,representations,or statements offered for the purpose of varying or adding to the terms of an integrated contract.hall process instruments control,utah,overruled on other grounds by tangren family trust tangren,utah.the rule does not apply,however,in the case of contractual ambiguity.see id.
here,the agreements integration clauses states 
entire agreement.this agreement,including the schedules and other writings referred to herein or delivered pursuant hereto,constitutes the entire agreement between chevron and simplot with respect to the subject matter hereof,and supersedes all prior oral or written agreements,commitments or understandings with respect thereto no amendment or waiver of the terms of this agreement shall be binding on the parties unless in writing and signed by authorized representatives of both parties hereto the headings used in this agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not be used to define the meaning of any provision.
at accord.at.the integration clause is clear that the agreements constitute the final and complete expression of the parties bargain tangren,at emphasis in original.
a contract qualifies as ambiguous if it lends itself to more than one reasonable interpretation because of uncertain meanings of terms,missing terms,or other facial deficiencies.webbank am.annuity serv,utah internal quotation marks omitted.a court first must decide whether a contract contains a facial ambiguity arising from the contractual language.daines,at.the court may consider any relevant and credible evidence of contrary interpretations in making this legal determination.id.if the court concludes that the interpretations contended for are reasonably supported by the language of the contract,id.internal quotation marks omitted,the contract is ambiguous on its face,see id.only then does the question of ambiguity become factual,requiring the court to admit parol evidence of the parties intentions in order to clarify the ambiguity.see id.
here,four sections of the agreements are relevant.sections through of each agreement deal with the parties assumption of specific obligations 
assumption of liabilities.effective as of the closing date,simplot shall assume only those liabilities and obligations relating and attributable to the ownership or operation of the assets or the pipeline system which arise out of events or acts occurring after the closing date,and the assumed obligations specifically assumed by simplot pursuant to section below 
assumed obligations.subject to the provisions of this section,simplot shall assume the following obligations as of the closing date the assumed obligations 
litigation.chevron will retain responsibility for and control over the defense of its involvement in the litigation,ashley creek phosphate chevron pipe line,et,stb docket stb case and ashley creek phosphate chevron,utah,filed june,and chevron shall be responsible and liable for all penalties,damages,and costs granted in such litigation or resulting from settling such cases.simplot shall assume the responsibility and cost of prospective compliance with the tariff when set in the stb case and any mandatory prospective compliance orders granted in either case.chevron shall,in handling such litigation,keep simplot fully informed on the status of the cases and,sic consult with simplot concerning defense strategy,and allow simplot to make recommendations.chevron shall make decisions concerning the litigation and pursue the litigation vigorously and in due consideration of the economic viability of the mine and the fertilizer plant as if chevron was still the owner of the pipeline system,and its affiliates were still owners of the mine and fertilizer plant.chevron will not settle either case without the written permission of simplot,which shall not unreasonably be withheld 
at accord.at.section concerns chevron general indemnification obligations 
indemnification by chevron.chevron shall indemnify,defend and hold simplot harmless from and against all claims,suits,damages,losses,expenses,costs,obligations,liabilities,recoveries and deficiencies,including interest,penalties and attorneys fees,that it shall incur or suffer,which arise or result from a any and all liabilities and obligations attributed to the operation or ownership of the assets or the pipeline system prior to the closing date,which liabilities or obligations are not assumed by simplot under the terms of this agreement b the breach of,or failure of chevron to perform any representation,warranty,covenant or agreement given or made by chevron herein,or in any writing furnished or to be furnished by chevron under this agreement c any suit,action,arbitration,or legal,administrative,governmental or other proceeding that relates to the ownership or use of the assets or the pipeline system prior to the closing 
at accord.at.
chevron argues that the agreements may be interpreted in more than one reasonable way and are therefore ambiguous.one reasonable interpretation,chevron contends,is that section exclusively covers all potential claims by ashley creek,and under that section simplot assumed responsibility for such claims subject only to the exceptions listed in section.thus,section states that simplot assumed the following obligations as of closing subject to,inter alia,section.chevron points out that section speaks only to chevron not simplot obligations.because section is silent about simplot duties,chevron asserts,simplot must have assumed all responsibility for the ashley creek litigation under section.in sum,chevron argues that the structure of section shows simplot assumed total responsibility for any ashley creek claims left unmentioned by section.
chevron further contends that the general indemnification provision in section does not limit simplot assumption of responsibility.it argues that,to the extent section can be read broadly to apply to the ashley creek litigation,it can not be reconciled with simplot specific assumption of responsibility in section.according to chevron,w hen general and specific provisions of a contract can not be reconciled,the specific provisions prevail.aplt.br.at.chevron claims the extrinsic the prior drafts of the agreements,the parties negotiations,chevron understanding of the agreements,and simplot its reading of the agreements.
we have reviewed all of the relevant,extrinsic evidence,but it is the language of the contract s alone that ultimately controls our decision.deep creek ranch,llc utah state armory,utah.notwithstanding extrinsic evidence,we can not read an ambiguity into the agreements where none exists.see daines,at t here can be no ambiguity where evidence is offered in an attempt to obscure otherwise plain contractual terms.for the reasons set forth below,we agree with the district court that the agreements are unambiguous and can not be reasonably understood in more than one way.deep creek ranch,at.we therefore interpret them as a matter of law.see cent.invests.parkwest,utah if the language within the four corners of the contract is unambiguous,the parties intentions are determined from the plain meaning of the contractual language,and the contract may be interpreted as a matter of law.
chevron structural argument twists the plain language of the agreements under section,simplot assumed only those liabilities and obligations relating to the ownership or operation of the pipeline system which ar o se out of events occurring after the closing date,and the assumed obligations specifically assumed by simplot pursuant to section.at emphasis added accord.at.section distinction between liabilities and assumed obligations indicates simplot assumed some obligations in section that did not arise after closing.section then outlines the parties responsibilities.chevron agreed to retain responsibility for and control over the defense of its involvement in the ashley creek litigation,to be liable for all penalties,damages,and costs granted in or resulting from such litigation,to fully inform simplot about the status of the ashley creek cases,to consult with simplot concerning defense strategy,to pursue the ashley creek litigation vigorously as if chevron were still the owner,and to settle the litigation only with simplot permission.simplot,by contrast,assumed only the responsibility and cost of prospective compliance with the tariff when set in the stb case and any mandatory prospective compliance orders granted in either case.at accord.at.section does not even mention potential claims that ashley creek might bring against simplot.moreover,if simplot assumed total responsibility for the ashley creek litigation under section,there would have been no need to specify simplot duty to set a conforming tariff under section.that duty would have been automatically assumed under section umbrella.in sum,nothing in the body of section supports chevron structural argument it is the result of a forced or strained construction and fails to show ambiguity.saleh farmers ins,utah.
thus,we are left with section,in which chevron assumed a duty to defend simplot against any and all unassumed liabilities attributed to the pipeline operations or any suit that relates to ownership or use prior to closing.at emphasis added accord.at.this language does not exclude potential claims by ashley creek and is not inconsistent with section when read in a straightforward fashion.section charges simplot with a duty to set its tariff in compliance with mandatory orders in ashley creek suit against chevron,and section charges chevron with a duty to defend simplot against any litigation arising from pipeline operations.the agreements contain no ambiguity they simply fail to address explicitly simplot potential involvement in the ashley creek litigation.
the only remaining question is whether ashley creek sued simplot because of or in relation to chevron pipeline operations.we hold that it did.while simplot initial tariff may have at least partially triggered ashley creek antitrust claims,simplot could not have avoided being joined in the ashley creek litigation no matter what tariff it adopted.ashley creek claimed from the beginning that the owner of the pipeline had monopoly power,and that antitrust law required the owner to sell access at competitive rates.once simplot joined the litigation,ashley creek sought an order requiring simplot to sell to ashley creek the permanent excess capacity of the pipeline on the same terms and conditions under which simplot acquired the facility.at.because access to this essential facility was at the heart of ashley creek suit against chevron,and chevron ostensibly unreasonable tariffs triggered this suit,ashley creek claims against simplot necessarily ar o se from and were related to ashley creek claims against chevron.whoever owned the pipeline would be a target for ashley creek claims.we therefore conclude that chevron had a duty to defend simplot under the plain language of section the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of simplot on this breach of contract claim.
the second issue before us is whether simplot breached any implied duty of good faith and fair dealing owed to chevron under the agreements.an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing inheres in every contract b oth parties impliedly promise not to intentionally do anything to injure the other party right to receive the benefits of the contract.eggett wasatch energy,utah citations omitted.a violation of the implied covenant gives rise to a claim for breach of contract.id.whether a violation has occurred is generally a factual issue,but should be decided as a matter of law when reasonable minds could not differ in concluding that the alleged breaching party did not wrongfully exercise its discretionary power or contractual authority for a reason beyond the risks that the other party assumed or for a reason inconsistent with the other party justified expectations.oman davis sch,utah.to determine the legal duty a contractual party has under this covenant,a court will assess whether a party actions are consistent with the agreed common purpose and the justified expectations of the other party as manifested in the course of dealings,contractual language,and conduct of the parties.oakwood vill.llc albertsons,utah alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.
the scope of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing turns on the extent to which the contracting parties have defined their expectations and imposed limitations on contract terms.smith grand canyon expeditions,utah.four general principles limit the scope of the covenant.oakwood,at.first,the covenant can not be understood to establish new,independent rights or duties to which the parties did not agree ex ante.id.second,the covenant can not result in rights and duties inconsistent with express contractual terms.id.third,the covenant can not force a contractual party to exercise a contractual right to its own detriment for the purpose of benefitting another party to the contract.id.internal quotation marks omitted.finally,the covenant can not be used to achieve an outcome inconsistent with the written terms of the contract.id.
chevron argues simplot breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing when it failed to lower its tariff immediately after the stb issued its decision.section of the agreement provides that simplot shall assume the responsibility and cost of prospective compliance with the tariff when set in the stb case and any mandatory prospective compliance orders granted in either the stb or district court case.at emphasis added accord.at.chevron contends the stb decision qualifies as a mandatory prospective compliance order,giving simplot discretion to lower its tariff within a certain time frame.chevron asserts that because simplot discretion was cabined by the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,simplot had to move quickly to lower its tariff to avoid harming chevron.aplt.br.at.according to chevron,simplot delay in publishing a new tariff harmed chevron because chevron could not obtain summary judgment against ashley creek until simplot set a new,significantly reduced tariff.chevron contends simplot must indemnify it for its attorneys fees and costs incurred in the ashley creek litigation from the time chevron should have been able to move for summary judgment until simplot lowered its tariff in compliance with the stb decision.
our review of the agreements and the record persuades us the district court did not err in granting summary judgment against chevron on its counterclaim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.reasonable minds would agree that simplot did not wrongfully exercise its discretionary power or contractual authority.oman,at.the stb decision did not trigger simplot compliance duty because the stb decision was not mandatory.the stb did not order simplot to do anything.it did not even determine the reasonableness of the tariffs it simply outlined the framework and methodology for calculating a reasonable tariff,which the district court later applied.therefore,the propriety of simplot exercise of discretion in adopting a new tariff is irrelevant.if simplot had no contractual duty to fulfill,chevron can not claim breach of a covenant inherent in that duty.oakwood,at noting the established principle that a tenant cessation of operation can not be in bad faith if there is no express or implied covenant providing for continued operation.
moreover,even if the stb decision had triggered simplot contractual duty to comply with any mandatory prospective compliance orders,the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing still would not have required simplot to pursue every benefit imaginable to chevron.the covenant required simplot only to refrain from actions that w ould intentionally destroy or injure the other party right to receive the fruits of the contract.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.chevron has offered absolutely no evidence that simplot intentionally delayed publishing a new tariff for the purpose of destroying or injuring chevron.chevron bad faith claim simply lacks common sense.chevron and simplot shared the same interest regarding summary judgment against ashley creek.if simplot had intentionally and needlessly delayed publishing a new tariff,such a maneuver would have precluded well as obtaining judgment.
in addition,we are not persuaded the agreements gave chevron a justified expectation that simplot would immediately reduce its tariff in response to a agency decision.in fact,chevron own actions illustrate justified expectations contrary to those it now claims.chevron never notified simplot of a duty to immediately lower its tariff.even when simplot,on its own accord,reduced its tariff market,chevron did not immediately move for summary judgment.chevron continued discovery and did not file its motion until after simplot had fully briefed and argued the summary judgment issues.
we see no need to address the parties remaining arguments.the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of simplot on chevron counterclaim.
the third issue before us,one of first impression in this circuit,is whether chevron has a seventh amendment right to a jury trial to determine the amount of costs and attorneys fees simplot incurred in defending itself in the ashley creek litigation,as damages for chevron breach of contract.the district court held that the amount of attorneys fee is an issue for the court rather than for a jury.this is a question of law we review de novo.mile high indus.cohen,cir.federal law determines the right to a jury trial in federal court,even in cases in which jurisdiction rests upon diversity of citizenship.simler conner,d per curiam.
the right to a jury trial as declared by the seventh amendment is preserved inviolate.see.a.the seventh amendment protects this right i n suits at common law,where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars.const.amend.xii.the supreme court has held that the phrase suits at common law refers to suits in which legal rights are to be ascertained and determined,in contradistinction to those where equitable rights alone are recognized,and equitable remedies are administered.teamsters,local terry,d emphasis and alterations in original.the nature of the issues presented and the remedies sought determines whether an action qualifies as legal.id.at.the general rule is that monetary relief is legal.city of monterey del monte dunes at monterey,d.an ordinary breach of contract claim is no different.see terry,at.marshall,concurring noting that a breach of contract claim is a legal issue ross bernhard,d concluding stockholders in derivative action were entitled to a jury trial where the complaint included allegations of ordinary breach of contract and gross negligence and sought damages simler,at.holding declaratory judgment action by client wherein client challenged the enforceability of a contingent fee retainer agreement was in its basic character a suit to determine and adjudicate the amount of fees owing to a lawyer by a client under a contingent fee retainer contract,a traditionally legal action dairy queen,wood,d as an action on a debt allegedly due under a contract,it would be difficult to conceive of an action of a more traditionally legal character.
the supreme court has not specifically addressed a case where previously incurred attorneys fees are sought as the measure of compensatory damages in a breach of contract suit.unlike cases in which attorneys fees are allowable to the prevailing party,here simplot attorneys fees and costs are themselves part of the merits of their contact claim.see am.specialty ins.correctional med.servs,cir in jurisdictional decision,holding that attorneys fees and costs awarded as compensatory damages to insured are inseparable from merits of insured breach of contract claim distinguishing statutory prevailing party attorneys fees,which are collateral to the merits.simplot does not seek the fees as an element of costs awarded to the prevailing party,budinich becton dickinson,d,which raises legal issues collateral to and separate from the decision on the merits.id.quotation marks and citations omitted.rather,simplot seeks the fees as the measure of damages resulting from chevron breach,as an element of damages under a contract.moore,moore federal practice a ed noting such fees may present jury triable issues.
rule of the federal rules of civil procedure recognizes this distinction.see.d a a claim for attorney fees and related nontaxable expenses must be made by motion unless the substantive law requires those fees to be proved at trial as an element of damages.emphasis added.the advisory committee note to the amendments of rule d explains further 
this new paragraph establishes a procedure for presenting claims for attorneys fees,whether or not denominated as costs.it applies also to requests for reimbursement of expenses,not taxable as costs,when recoverable under governing law incident to the award of fees.west virginia.hosp.casey,d,holding,prior to the civil rights act of,that expert witness fees were not recoverable under.as noted in subparagraph a,it does not,however,apply to fees recoverable as an element of damages,as when sought under the terms of a contract such damages typically are to be claimed in a pleading and may involve issues to be resolved by a jury.
this action is,at bottom,a legal action for compensatory damages resulting from a breach of contract.that the measure of damages happens to be attorneys fees does not in and of itself change the nature of simplot claim.
while simplot argues to the contrary,other circuits decisions addressing contractual attorneys fees are distinguishable and do not support its contention.in mcguire russell miller,cir,the owner of a merged company sued to rescind the merger.the defendants counterclaimed,alleging,inter alia,that plaintiff had misrepresented the value of its stock and was also liable for breach of contract.id.the jury awarded damages to defendants for fraud and for breach of contract,and determined,in response to a special verdict form,that the plaintiff owed the defendants attorneys fees under a contractual provision providing indemnification for a ll costs including costs of defense and reasonable attorney fees arising out of any claim made with respect to the merger agreement.id.at.the jury did not compute the amount of fees,however,and the defendants presented no evidence of attorneys fees at trial.id.the district court refused to award the fees.id.the parties appealed,disputing whether the district court or the jury should have decided the amount and reasonableness of any fee award.id.at.
the second circuit concluded that the district court should have ascertained the amount of fees due the prevailing party.id.at.w hen a contract provides for an award of attorneys fees,the jury is to decide at trial whether a party may recover such fees.id.at.once the jury determines liability,the judge is to determine a reasonable amount of fees.id.the court reasoned that a contrary rule would be impractical and inefficient.see id.at.t he jury would have to keep a running total of fees as they accrued through summations and then predict future fees from proceedings and motions.id.
the mcguire concurrence carefully limited the court holding by noting the nature of the parties action.the case did not involve the availability of a jury trial for fees where a claimant seeks contractual indemnification for fees incurred in a separate litigation against a third party.id.at jacobs,concurring emphasis added.in that instance,the concurrence pointed out,supreme court precedent might require a jury trial for such a attorneys fees claim.id.
the fifth and seventh circuits have agreed that the the generally determine the amount of attorneys fees in cases where a contract provides for fees to the prevailing party.the fifth circuit held the seventh amendment does not guarantee a jury trial to determine the amount of reasonable attorneys fees,as no common law right exists to recover attorneys fees awarded pursuant to a contract.resolution trust marshall,cir.applying a different rationale,the seventh circuit concluded t he issue of attorneys fees including amount i s an issue to be resolved after the trial on the basis of the judgment entered at the trial,just as in cases in which statutory rather than contractual entitlements to attorneys fees are involved.eastern trading refco,cir citations omitted.yet each of these cases,like mcguire,share one significant distinguishing factor none involves a breach of contract attorneys fees already incurred in a separate,underlying action against a third party.
this case is like an insurance case where the insurer has breached its duty to defend a lawsuit against the insured by a third party and the insured sues the insurer for payment of the costs of its defense,particularly attorneys fees.see,kush,american states ins,cir issue of reasonable attorneys fees as damages for failure to defend sent to the jury.in sum,we hold that chevron has a seventh amendment right to a jury trial on the amount of attorneys fees due simplot as damages for chevron breach of its duty to defend simplot in the ashley creek litigation.
nevertheless,it was not per se error for the district court to deny a jury trial on the requested attorneys fees and costs.chevron concedes that the district court effectively granted summary judgment on the amount of damages.reply at.the law is that summary judgment does not violate the seventh amendment.see fidelity deposit united states.the district court could grant summary judgment sua sponte on any and all aspects of simplot claim,including damages,if there were no genuine issues of material fact,see.d,and chevron had notice of its duty to proffer all evidence,see jones salt lake county,cir.in this case,utah law guides our review of the substantive dimension of simplot damages claim.simler,at.
chevron contends the district court should not have granted summary judgment because simplot did not establish that its damages were reasonable.chevron notes that it identified numerous instances of unreasonable billing practices,thereby generating genuine disputes of fact that only a jury could resolve.aplt.br.at.these alleged unreasonable billing practices include i duplicative,unnecessary,or vague charges by the three law firms representing the simplot entities and ii in attorneys fees allegedly unrelated to the defense of the ashley creek litigation.chevron contends damages must be reasonable because otherwise an indemnitor could be potentially liable for a limitless amount of attorneys fees and costs.according to chevron,utah law reads an implied requirement of reasonableness into every indemnity agreement notwithstanding the contractual terms.
simplot,by contrast,argues that a dispute about the reasonableness of its damages does not constitute a genuine issue of material fact.it points out that the agreements do not require the breaching party to pay only reasonable fees,but rather require reimbursement of all costs and expenses that simplot deem ed appropriate in defending against ashley creek claims.aple.br.at simplot argues it did not have a burden to show that its fees were reasonable it only had to show that they were incurred in the ashley creek litigation.even if simplot did have such a burden,it adds,chevron did not challenge the billing rates,provide expert testimony that the requested fees were unreasonable,or provide expert testimony that the charges of each law firm were duplicative.finally,regarding chevron specific challenge to in fees,simplot notes it produced uncontested declarations of counsel stating that of these fees related to discovery in the ashley creek litigation.the remaining,simplot contends,is attributable to outside counsel preparation of audit response letters and litigation budgets.
we conclude the district court decision suffers from a fatal flaw that requires us to reverse the court did not apply the correct standard in granting summary judgment.relying on united states ex rel,western states mechanical contractors,cir,the court summarily held i it had a duty to enforce the parties benefit of their contractual attorneys fees bargain,ii it would reduce the fee award only if simplot request was inequitable or unreasonable,and iii it was not responsible for independently calculating a reasonable fee award,vol.at emphasis added.the district court erred in determining that it was not obligated to assess the reasonableness of simplot attorneys fees request.
