this is an appeal from the district court judgment awarding timothy gagnon backpay,liquidated damages,and attorney fees and costs under the fair labor standards act flsa,against united technisource,uti and ais tech services,ais.
gagnon is a skilled craftsman with many years experience in prepping and painting the exterior and interior of aircrafts.when gagnon began working for uti,he executed a contract in which uti agreed to pay gagnon per hour for straight time and per hour for overtime although the record indicates differing hourly wage rates for aircraft painters in the area and at the time in which gagnon was working none are remotely close to the per hour that the contracts established as gagnon straight time wage.in addition to his straight time wage,uti also agreed to pay gagnon for every hour he worked each week up to forty hours per week or a maximum of.the contract referred to this additional hourly pay as per diem.
about a year after he began working for,gagnon received a memo that notified him of a raise in all pay.the memo noted that w e are pleased to announce that our client wing aviation has authorized a per hour raise in all pay starting this pay check.to effectuate the raise,however,gagnon was not given an increase in his straight time pay rate of per hour.rather,he received a raise in his hourly per diem for all hours worked under forty each week and a increase in his overtime rate.the record does not indicate that this increase in hourly per diem was based on any reasonably approximated increase in gagnon expenses.
eventually,gagnon filed suit against and wing aviation claiming violations of the americans with disabilities act ada,the family and medical leave act fmla,and the flsa.all three defendants answered and filed a counterclaim alleging breach of contract and fraud against gagnon.contended that gagnon breached the employment contract and committed fraud by failing to notify when he moved from a city miles from the wing aviation facility to one only nine miles away,and by continuing to receive per diem pay after the move.
defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims.the district court granted summary judgment to defendants on the ada and fmla claims and found in gagnon favor on the flsa overtime claim.the district court held that the per diem allowance is to be included in gagnon regular rate of pay,and ordered defendants to recalculate gagnon rate of pay,determine the credit that is due based on his relocation,and submit same to gagnon and the court for review.the district court did not address counterclaim.
in response to the court order,defendants filed a calculation that excluded the per diem allowance improperly received during and after october when gagnon moved closer to wing aviation facility,and that included a request that the district court order gagnon to pay for the per diem improperly received during and after october.gagnon filed numerous responsive pleadings as well as his own motion for entry of judgment and for liquidated damages that sought back overtime pay of.gagnon also moved for attorney fees and costs.
the district court denied motion and request,finding them to be contrary to the court memorandum opinion and rulings from the bench.after considering the motions and all competent evidence offered by the parties,the district court entered judgment awarding gagnon back pay of and,finding violations willful,liquidated damages of.over objections,the district court also awarded gagnon in attorney fees and in costs.this appeal followed.

argue that their payment scheme does not violate the flsa because the flsa only requires employers to pay overtime at a rate of time and a half,and paid gagnon overtime at a rate more than three times his base pay.also argue that gagnon per diem reasonably approximated his reimbursable expenses and should therefore be excluded from the determination of gagnon regular rate for the purposes of overtime pay.according to,i t can not be argued that the per diem was a ploy to avoid paying gagnon overtime compensation.we disagree.
the flsa requires that employees who work more than forty hours in a work week must be paid one and times their regular rate of pay.a.the flsa broadly defines regular rate as the hourly rate actually paid the employee for all remuneration for employment.e see also walling helmerich payne.the regular rate by its very nature must reflect all payments which the parties have agreed shall be received regularly during the workweek,exclusive of overtime payments.bay ridge operating aaron.the regular rate becomes a mathematical computation once the parties have decided on the amount of wages and the mode of payment,which is unaffected by any designation to the contrary in the wage contract.id.the regular rate is not an arbitrary labelit is an actual fact.id.
here,have tried to avoid paying gagnon a higher regular rate by artificially designating a portion of gagnon wages as straight time and a portion as per diem.although per diem can be excluded from an employee regular rate,e see also b,the regular rate of pay can not be left to a declaration by the parties as to what is to be treated as the regular rate for an employee it must be drawn from what happens under the employment contract.citing bay ridge operating,at.the department of labor has recognized that when,as here,the amount of per diem varies with the amount of hours worked,the per diem payments are part of the regular rate in their entirety 
furthermore,we are suspicious of claims that gagnon employment contracts were not a scheme to avoid paying overtime.it is difficult to believe that a skilled craftsman would accept a wage so close to the minimum wage when the prevailing wage for similarly skilled craftsmen was approximately three times the minimum wage.we are similarly troubled by the fact that the combined straight time and per diem hourly rates approximately match the prevailing wage for aircraft painters.further,it is suspect that a raise in all pay was effectuated by increasing the hourly per diem rate rather than the straight time rate.finally,we can conceive of no reason why a legitimate per diem would vary by the hour and be capped at the mark which corresponds to the point at which regular wages stop and the overtime rate applies.
we find this case analogous to other cases in which employers have sought to artificially lower an employee regular rate by mischaracterizing a portion of it as a bonus or where employees were paid low straight rates for the first hour or two set around minimum which they earned one and one half times the straight rate,and were consequently paid no premium for their actual overtime work.see walling hardwood,see also.
we hold that gagnon hourly per diem allowances of and were part of his hourly remuneration for employment and must be considered in his regular rate for the purpose of determining overtime pay due under the flsa.helmerich payne,at.accordingly,we affirm the district court determination that violated the flsa by not including gagnon per diem in their calculation of his regular rate.
having concluded that the hourly per diem is part of gagnon base pay,we turn to contract and fraud counterclaims.argue that gagnon breached the employment agreements by not reporting that he moved closer to the work site and by continuing to receive per diem when he lived less than ten miles from the work site.the district court did not address counterclaims.although our conclusion that the hourly per diem wages must be included in base pay would seem to eviscerate these claims,our precedent suggests that such claims should not be addre
