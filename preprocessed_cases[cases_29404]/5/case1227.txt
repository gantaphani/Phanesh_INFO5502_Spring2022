background 
when hunt filed for bankruptcy,he scheduled in credit card debt owed to first card.first card sought to have that debt declared nondischargeable under a a,alleging that hunt had obtained the funds fraudulently,never intending to repay them.hunt was represented pro bono in the a a proceeding by mcgeorge school of law community legal services mcgeorge 
first card alleged that hunt laundered a cash advance on his first card credit card through his wells fargo credit card allegedly used the cash advance to pay down the balance on the wells fargo card and then immediately took roughly the same amount in cash advances on the wells fargo card.hunt claimed that he merely used the first card cash advance to transfer debt from his wells fargo account to his first card account.first card claimed,however,that the wells fargo interest rate was lower than the first card interest rate on cash advances,which would make hunt theory implausible.
at trial,the bankruptcy court quashed first card subpoena of hunt because of defective card had failed to include the witness fee and mileage required by federal rule of civil procedure b which is made applicable to adversary proceedings by bankruptcy rule.first card next sought to have a transcript of hunt deposition testimony admitted into evidence,but the court excluded it because first card had failed to provide hunt with a copy of the transcript at least ten court days before trial,as required by local rule and by the court pretrial order.first card then moved for a continuance,but the motion was denied.
first card succeeded in having some exhibits admitted into evidence,and then it rested.the exhibits showed that hunt had used his first card cash advance to pay the balance on his wells fargo account,but they showed nothing regarding what hunt did with the wells fargo account thereafter or regarding hunt intent to repay first card.after first card rested,hunt moved for judgment on partial findings,and the motion was granted.first card did not appeal.
hunt subsequently moved for attorney fees under d,which provides that in a nondischargeability proceeding regarding a consumer debt,a bankruptcy court shall grant judgment in favor of the debtor for the costs of,and a reasonable attorney fee for,the proceeding if the court finds that the position of the creditor was not substantially justified,unless special circumstances would make the award unjust.d.first card opposed the motion on various grounds,but it was nonetheless granted in the full amount requested.
on appeal,the bap reduced the amount by because of concededly erroneous information that had been submitted to the bankruptcy court.this timely appeal followed.first card contends that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in awarding attorney fees to hunt and,in any event,that such fees were excessive 
ii.standard of review 
decisions of the bap are reviewed de novo.anastas american sav.bank in re anastas,cir.this court thus reviews the decision of the bankruptcy court under the same standard applied by the bap.id.
there is no ninth circuit case law regarding the standard of review for an award of attorney fees pursuant to d,but the bap has held that such awards are reviewed for abuse of discretion.first card carolan in re carolan.we adopt that holding for the following reasons the supreme court has held that an award of attorney fees pursuant to the equal access to justice act eaja,d,is reviewed for abuse of discretion,pierce underwood,d d contains the same substantially justified language as the eaja and was modeled on it,see,at reporting on,the forerunner of d and the supreme court reasoning in pierce applies with equal force here,see pierce,at.the amount of a fee award is reviewed for abuse of discretion.law offices of nicholas franke tiffany in re lewis,cir.
iii.discussion 
first card contends that hunt waived his right to attorney fees.
first,first card argues that under bankruptcy rule b,a request for attorney fees in any bankruptcy proceeding must be made in the pleadings.see.b a request for an award of attorney fees shall be pleaded as a claim in a complaint,complaint,answer,or reply as may be appropriate.similarly,first card argues that federal rule of civil procedure g which is made applicable to adversary proceedings by bankruptcy rule requires that claims for items of special damage be specifically stated.because hunt answer did not include a request for attorney fees,first card argues that hunt waived his right to fees.
bankruptcy courts are split on the issue of whether a debtor must request fees in the pleadings,for fees to be awardable under d.compare thorp credit,smith in re smith,holding that no request in the pleadings is required,with montgomery ward blackburn in re blackburn,holding that a request is required.
we need not resolve that issue in this case,however,because first card argument fails on independent grounds.hunt requested attorney fees in his pretrial conference statement,and that request was incorporated by reference in the bankruptcy court pretrial order.a pretrial order has the effect of amending the pleadings,cir holding that the affirmative defense of mitigation of damages had not been waived despite its having been omitted from the pleadings,because it was included in the pretrial order.moreover,a pretrial order will be liberally construed to permit consideration of any issues that are embraced within its language.acorn city of phoenix,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.because hunt request for attorney fees was incorporated by reference in the pretrial order,which had the effect of amending the pleadings,hunt did not waive his right to fees by omitting the request from his answer,even assuming that a pleaded request for fees were required.the waiver argument therefore fails.
first card second argument is that hunt right to fees was waived by certain statements of his counsel at hunt deposition.this argument is without merit.hunt counsel merely stated that the pleadings that were then before the court did not address attorney fees,and he added that he did not anticipate filing an amended pleading.such statements do not even amount to a waiver of the right to move to amend a pleading,let alone a waiver of any right that might be exercised through such an amendment.moreover,the remarks of first card counsel indicated that he recognized that there had been no waiver.he explicitly acknowledged the possibility that hunt would change his mind.thus,the record does not support the contention that there was a waiver of fees at the deposition.
third,first card argues that hunt can not be awarded attorney fees because he did not request them or submit any supporting evidence until after the conclusion of the trial.the argument lacks merit.as we explained above,hunt request for attorney fees was included in the pretrial order.first card cites no authority to support the proposition that a debtor requesting fees under d can not move for fees and submit supporting evidence after trial in any case,bankruptcy courts and the bap have permitted debtors to request fees and to introduce relevant evidence after judgment is granted in their favor.see,first chicago fcc bank willett in re willett,awarding fees that were requested and proved after dismissal of the creditor complaint american sav.bank harvey in re harvey,affirming an award of fees that were requested after the court had granted judgment against the creditor.this approach makes conserves judicial resources by freeing a debtor from any obligation to submit evidence of attorney fees
