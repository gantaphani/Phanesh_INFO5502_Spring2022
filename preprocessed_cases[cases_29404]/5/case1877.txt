a texas attorney appearing pro hac vice for plaintiffs in a class action sent a communication to prospective class members which contained at least one misrepresentation.the trial court issued an order to show cause why the attorney pro hac vice status should not be revoked.after a hearing,the trial court declined to revoke the attorney pro hac vice status,and instead ordered the attorney to reimburse the defendant for substantial attorney fees,as a condition of retaining his pro hac vice status.the trial court also formally reprimanded the texas attorney.the attorney appeals.we conclude the trial court lacked authority to impose attorney fees as a sanction and also lacked authority to issue the formal reprimand.we therefore reverse the trial court order however,we also conclude that the trial court has the authority to revoke an attorney pro hac vice status in certain circumstances,and therefore remand for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
the challenged order arises in the context of a class action against farmers new world life insurance company and farmers group,collectively farmers.the action alleges farmers committed unfair business practices in connection with farmers universal life and flexible premium universal life insurance policies.specifically,the action alleges that the insurance policies were set up so that farmers would collect premiums from policyholders that were insufficient to keep the policies in in either an untimely lapse of the policies or a substantial increase in premiums.the initial complaint was filed on november.the named plaintiff,pauline fairbanks,was not only a farmers insured,but also a farmers agent.at the time the complaint was filed,fairbanks was represented by attorney scott marks,who is a california attorney.
at the same time,attorney david sheller,who is admitted to practice in texas was pursuing a similar class action against farmers in texas.on february,attorney sheller filed an application to appear pro hac vice as lead counsel on behalf of fairbanks in the instant action the application was granted.
from as early as november,the trial court suggested that fairbanks might not be an ideal class representative for the insureds,as she had also been a farmers agent.in june,attorney sheller,but not attorney marks,sent a written communication to some farmers policyholders,seeking additional class representatives.the letter was in the form of a flyer boldly captioned,attention farmers insurance group policy holders the flyer began,a potential class action lawsuit has been filed against farmers in the state court of los angeles county.we are concerned farmers may have given you misleading information about this lawsuit.our intention is to help policyholders and give them accurate information.the flyer went on to state,if you have purchased such a policy,we may be able to help you.we are looking for other people who have purchased such farmers policies.if you have,you may be accepted as a class representative.if accepted,you are paid for your time in an amount set by the judge.emphasis in original.
upon learning of this flyer,farmers filed an ex parte motion for a temporary restraining order preventing plaintiffs counsel from sending further communications to potential members of the class,or,in the alternative,to prevent any such communications without prior court approval.farmers motion was based not only on the june flyer,but also on two other communications which allegedly contained factual misrepresentations about the insurance policies at issue a september letter and a telephone survey of farmers policyholders attorney sheller had commissioned farmers supported its motion with an expert declaration to the effect that both the september letter and the june flyer violated the california rules of professional conduct.as to the statement in the june flyer indicating that farmers may have given policyholders misleading information about this lawsuit,farmers submitted a declaration that it had never made a general mailing to its policyholders,much less a misleading one 
a hearing on farmers ex parte motion was held on july.attorney sheller was present.at the hearing,the trial court expressed concern that there seems to be some hucksterism going on here by plaintiffs.while the trial court believed that the september,letter did not comply with the rules of professional conduct the court was most concerned by the june flyer.specifically,the court found the statement,if accepted,you are paid for your time in an amount set by the judge to be both inappropriate and simply untrue.not only are class representatives not always entitled to recover,they may in fact be liable for court costs if the defendant prevails.attorney sheller responded,as far as the issue of whether or not the class rep resentative is going to be paid or not,our contract specifically states that if we lose,they can be liable for costs of court.and without divulging any attorney communications,it is my standard practice to tell people that they can lose.the court responded that attorney sheller just admitted a bait and switch to me,in that attorney sheller initially represented to prospective class members that they would be paid for their time,but when the class members signed attorney sheller agreement,they were then told that they could be responsible for costs in the event of a loss.the court believed the misrepresentation to be intentional.attorney sheller stated that he had no intention to mislead,and added,i think now it will be changed.it wo happen again.the trial court restrained plaintiffs counsel from any further communications with potential class members without court.finding the june flyer particularly violative of the ethical rules,the trial court,on its own motion,set an order to show cause why attorney sheller pro hac vice status should not be revoked.
there followed substantial discovery and briefing farmers submitted a supplemental declaration from its expert,confirming her opinion that the june flyer constituted an ethics violation.farmers also submitted the declaration of a texas ethics expert,who concluded the flyer violated texas rules as well.
in response to the order to show cause,plaintiff argued that the flyer was accurate with one minor exception.plaintiff stated her counsel now realized the statement indicating class representatives would be paid for their time was oversimplified and incorrect.according to plaintiff response,attorney sheller concedes that this was in error and that he is responsible for this mistake,and he wishes to correct it immediately by a further letter to the potential class,upon the c ourt approval.plaintiff explained that the mistake arose because several lay people looked at the notice in an effort to make it simpler and easier to understand for the average person.attorney sheller was involved with the review and should have looked at it again and given it more thought before it went out the door to people.however,in the usual press of time and because he did not give extra thought to a letter before it was sent out,attorney sheller made a human mistake.as to the representation in the flyer that farmers may have given misleading information about the lawsuit,plaintiff stated,this sentence was placed in the letter because attorney sheller has twelve years of experience in life insurance sales fraud cases.it has been attorney sheller experience that when people learn of an alleged problem with their policy,by whatever means,most of the time they contact their agent or the home office.many times when they call their agent or the home office,they are given inaccurate or misleading information that there is not really a problem at all.attorney sheller has experienced this in this case with policy holders who received the notice in question.this happens so frequently in these cases that it is attorney sheller opinion that this is a general business practice in the life insurance industry.
a draft corrective notice and apology was attached,which repeated the bulk of the text of the flyer,including the sentence,if accepted,you are paid for your time in an amount set by the judge.however,the next paragraph,written in bold type,states,the sentence if accepted,you are paid for your time in an amount set by the judge is inaccurate.the court finds that sentence is an ethical violation by plaintiff counsel,david sheller.in actuality,you might not be paid at all and could be personally liable for court costs,if the plaintiff loses.the draft corrective notice did not restate attorney sheller concern that farmers may have given you misleading information about this lawsuit,nor did it retract that statement as ethically improper or otherwise inaccurate.
attorney sheller submitted the declaration of his own ethics expert opining that there is nothing materially misleading about the original flyer.as to the assertion in the flyer that class representatives would be paid for their time,attorney sheller expert noted that attorney sheller conceded that he neglected to specifically state that the judge might not award any amount.the expert concluded this was,at worst a de minimus omission as it can not be misleading or in any way improper not to have told a client what is obvious to every plaintiff,if you are not the prevailing party,you wo recover a monetary settlement.the expert then made the fairly remarkable assertion that attorney sheller also has pointed out that he contractually obligated himself to bear any costs that might be imposed against the class representative,so that there simply was never an issue regarding the class representative potential exposure to monetary costs.in fact,attorney sheller had not pointed this out at all.the only evidence before the court on this issue was attorney sheller representation at the july,hearing,that his contract specifically states that if we lose,they can be liable for costs of court.
a hearing was held on the order to show cause on december.the trial court noted that its main concern was the representation in the flyer that class representatives would be paid for their time i f accepted,while,in fact,class representatives could receive nothing and,according to attorney sheller retainer agreement,actually be responsible for costs.attorney sheller argued that there was no ethical violation in the flyer,because there is no requirement that an attorney advertisement include a statement that if the client loses,there will be no recovery farmers argued that the error was not one of mere omission,but an affirmative statement that class representatives would be paid for their time.
later in the hearing,attorney marks argued,for the first time,that there had been no bait and switch because attorney sheller had,in fact,obligated himself to pay all costs in the event of a loss.attorney marks gave the court a document,which was unauthenticated and had not been previously disclosed to farmers.the document was a letter,purportedly written in july,from attorney sheller to fairbanks,reading simply,in the unlikely event,we lose the case and there are costs that are incurred to you,i will pay them completely.when it was pointed out that this letter was in complete opposition to what had been represented at the july hearing,attorney marks responded that attorney sheller had been upset at the july hearing,and that while he had told the court what his retainer provided,he should have informed the court that he had promised to indemnify fairbanks for costs,and would do the same with future class representatives the court then questioned whether it was ethical for an attorney to agree to indemnify his client for costs that might be imposed against the client the ethics experts for both parties were in attendance and,predictably,had opposing views on the issue.
the trial court indicated its intention to sanction attorney sheller in some manner,and asked the parties for input on any possible lesser sanction to the revocation of attorney sheller pro hac vice status.attorney sheller expert had suggested,in her declaration,that a reprimand would be the maximum penalty to be appropriately imposed in this matter.attorney sheller argued that the prohibition on further contact with the class without court approval would be sufficient.farmers,which had incurred over in fees on this issue,argued that,if attorney sheller pro hac vice status was not revoked,he should at least be ordered to compensate farmers for its attorney fees.
the trial court allowed one final round of briefing.attorney sheller admitted that the flyer was not well written and apologized for his mistakes in drafting it.the court then questioned whether it was ethical for an attorney to agree to indemnify his client for costs that might be imposed against the client the ethics experts for both parties were in attendance and had opposing views on the issue attorney sheller argued that,when he had written that if accepted,class representatives would be paid for their time in an amount set by the judge,he simply meant that an impartial judicial officer would decide how much justice,if any,an injured person will receive.he argued that his flyer caused no harm,and that any complaints about the flyer were stylistic in nature.attorney sheller argued that he is passionate advocate,who must be zealous in order to survive as a sole practitioner opposing a firm.he suggested that d iscipline should only be administered when it is demonstrated that the attorney is representing his own interests as opposed to the clients interests.as such,he argued that issuing a new flyer remedying the first flyer would be an appropriate remedy.at no point did attorney sheller ever suggest that the trial court lacked the authority to revoke his pro hac vice status,issue a reprimand,or sanction him monetarily 
on february,the trial court issued its order discharging the order to show cause.the court stated that the june flyer reads like a crass commercial as opposed to a professional advertisement.the court concluded that the flyer contained at least one statement that was not true,specifically,the representation that class representatives would be paid for their time.the court also found unethical attorney sheller july,misrepresentation in open court that his retainer agreement specifically states that plaintiffs can be liable for costs in the event the case is lost,given that attorney sheller had,in actuality,agreed to reimburse fairbanks for any costs incurred in this action.the court did not accept attorney sheller claim of overzealousness as an excuse,and specifically concluded that,with respect to the june flyer,attorney sheller had been more concerned with attracting additional clients than with representing fairbanks interests.while the trial court believed that attorney sheller conduct would justify the revocation of his pro hac vice status,the court in its discretion declined to do so instead,the court imposed on attorney sheller the responsibility to pay of farmers attorney fees,as a condition of retaining his pro hac vice status additionally,the trial court formally reprimanded attorney sheller for his conduct.attorney sheller filed a timely notice of appeal 
issues on appeal 
we first address whether attorney sheller can raise any challenge to the court legal authority to order him to pay attorney fees to farmers,and formally reprimand him,in light of attorney sheller failure to raise these arguments before the trial court.exercising our discretion to reach these purely legal issues,we conclude that no authority existed for the trial court order,and that it therefore must be reversed.we also consider whether a trial court has the inherent authority to revoke an attorney pro hac vice status.we conclude that such authority exists,allowing a trial court to revoke an attorney pro hac vice status in,at the least,any circumstance in which it could disqualify a california attorney from a particular case.we therefore remand for the trial court to determine whether to exercise its discretion to revoke attorney sheller pro hac vice status.
discussion 
scope of the appeal 
on appeal,attorney sheller challenges the trial court authority to order him to pay farmers attorney fees,to formally reprimand him,the order was not revoke his pro hac vice status.farmers responds that these contentions are forfeited,as attorney sheller never challenged the trial court authority to make any such orders.the application of the forfeiture rule is not automatic appellate courts have discretion to excuse such forfeiture.in re cal th,d.parties have been permitted to raise new issues on appeal where the issue is purely a question of law on undisputed facts.frink prod cal d.this is an appropriate case for the exercise of such discretion.we are here concerned with the purely legal issue of the scope of a trial court authority to sanction a foreign attorney appearing pro hac vice.it would be a miscarriage of justice to allow a sanction imposed without legal authority to remain in effect simply because the attorney failed to challenge it.
farmers also contends that the order formally reprimanding attorney sheller is not an appealable order.indeed,it appears that the order is not.see code civ.we exercise our discretion,however,to treat the notice of appeal as a petition for writ of mandate,and address the issue.
inherent power of the trial courts 
in order to properly discuss the issues raised by this appeal,we must first address the inherent powers of a trial court.all courts possess inherent supervisory or administrative powers to enable them to carry out their duties.bauguess paine cal d.code of civil procedure section reflects these powers,but is not their source.that section provides,in pertinent part,that each court has the power t o control in furtherance of justice,the conduct of its ministerial officers,and of all other persons in any manner connected with a judicial proceeding before it,in every matter pertaining thereto.code civ,subd.a.
prior to the enactment of the state bar act,attorney discipline was administered by the courts under their inherent judicial power.witkin,cal.procedure ed.attorneys.as originally enacted,the state bar act did not attempt to curtail or limit the previously existing judicial power to impose discipline.see bus,fmr.nothing in the state bar act shall be construed as limiting or altering the powers of the courts of this state to disbar or discipline members of the bar.however,in,the state bar act was amended to exclude superior courts and appellate courts from exercising such jurisdiction,leaving the supreme court as the sole judicial entity with jurisdiction over attorney discipline.bus,jacobs state bar cal d.thus,in california,the inherent judicial power of the superior court does not extend to attorney disciplinary actions.that power is exclusively held by the supreme court and the state bar,acting as its administrative arm.jacobs state bar,supra,cal d at.
trial courts in california are not,however,powerless to sanction attorneys for improper conduct or to control the proceedings before them to prevent injustice.thus,trial courts may conduct contempt proceedings,dismiss sham actions,admonish counsel in open court,strike sham pleadings,and report misconduct to the state bar.witkin,cal.procedure ed.attorneys.in an appropriate case,the trial court may exercise its inherent power to control the conduct of its ministerial officers to disqualify an attorney in an action before it.in re complex asbestos litigation d.issues of disqualification often arise when an attorney has a conflict of interest,such as when the attorney has been exposed to confidential information of a former client who is in an adverse position in current litigation.id.at.roush seagate technology,llc th,d.a motion to disqualify counsel brings the client right to the attorney of his or her choice into conflict with the need to maintain ethical standards of professional responsibility.knight ferguson th,d.disqualification motions implicate several important interests,among them are the clients right to counsel of their choice,the attorney interest in representing a client,the financial burden of replacing a disqualified attorney,and tactical abuse that may underlie the motion.citation.the paramount concern in determining whether counsel should be disqualified is the preservation of public trust in the scrupulous administration of justice and the integrity of the bar.citations.it must be remembered,however,that disqualification is a drastic course of action that should not be taken simply out of hypersensitivity to ethical nuances or the appearance of impropriety.roush seagate technology,llc,supra,th at,d.the purpose of disqualification is not to punish a transgression of professional ethics.citation.disqualification is only justified where the misconduct will have a continuing effect on judicial proceedings.baugh garl th,d.
the question has arisen as to whether the inherent power of a trial court includes the power to sanction attorneys for bad faith conduct by requiring the payment of attorney fees.the united states supreme court has held that the inherent power of federal district courts encompasses this power.chambers nasco,d.in chambers,the united states supreme court began with the premise that a federal court has the inherent power to control admission to its bar and to discipline attorneys who appear before it.id.at.a court inherent powers must be exercised with restraint and discretion,and a primary aspect of that discretion is the ability to fashion an appropriate sanction for conduct which abuses the judicial process.id.at.the supreme court reasoned that,since a district court contains the inherent power to dismiss an action within its discretion,the lesser sanction of the imposition of attorney fees is also within its inherent power.id.at.
the california supreme court has reached the opposite result.bauguess paine,supra,cal d at.the california supreme court concluded that i t would be both unnecessary and unwise to permit trial courts to use fee awards as sanctions apart from those situations authorized by statute.ibid.the california supreme court acknowledged that a trial court has the power of contempt to sanction disruptive or disrespectful attorneys,and that procedural safeguards have been enacted to govern contempt proceedings.without such procedural safeguards in place,serious due process problems would result were trial courts to use their inherent power,in lieu of the contempt power,to punish misconduct by awarding attorney fees to an opposing party or counsel.id.at.concluding that the use of the courts inherent power to punish misconduct by awarding attorney fees may imperil the independence of the bar and thereby undermine the adversary system,the california supreme court concluded that the power to impose such sanctions must be created by the legislature with appropriate safeguards id.at.the reasoning of bauguess has been extended to any sanction occasioned by attorney conduct.yarnell associates superior court d.concerned with monetary sanctions.

revocation of pro hac vice status 
no case in california has yet addressed whether a trial court has the authority to revoke an attorney pro hac vice status.numerous other courts,however,have considered the issue,and determined that trial courts possess that authority.see attorneys revocation of state court pro hac vice admission.the parties have not cited to,and independent research has not disclosed,an opinion from any jurisdiction concluding that trial courts lacked the authority to revoke an attorney pro hac vice status.
however,the legal basis for the authority to revoke an attorney pro hac vice status has varied.some jurisdictions expressly include the authority to revoke pro hac vice status in their statutes or rules allowing pro hac vice appearances.see.rules of civ,rule the court may revoke a pro hac vice admission sua sponte or upon the motion of a party,if it determines,after a hearing or other meaningful opportunity to respond,the continued admission pro hac vice to be inappropriate or inadvisable.permission granted to appear pro hac vice may be summarily revoked by the general court of justice or any agency on its own motion and in its discretion.rules,rule permission to the nonresident lawyer to appear pro hac vice may be withdrawn by the judge granting it if the lawyer by his or her conduct manifests incompetency to represent a client in a wisconsin court or by his or her unwillingness to abide by the rules of professional conduct for attorneys and the rules of decorum of the court.federal courts have concluded the authority to revoke an attorney pro hac vice status is included within the inherent power of a federal court to control admission to its bar and to discipline attorneys who appear before it.lasar ford motor company cir,in re complaint of pmd enterprises d.finally,some courts have found the power to revoke an attorney pro hac vice status within a trial court inherent power to regulate practice before it and protect the integrity of its proceedings.see,walls city of toledo ohio app d,bank of hawaii kunimoto.
moreover,jurisdictions differ on the conduct of the pro hac vice attorney that will be sufficient to justify revocation of pro hac vice status.in some jurisdictions,the trial court may revoke an attorney pro hac vice status for any conduct which adversely impacts the administration of justice,state industries,jernigan,supra,so d at this is a broad standard that would permit revocation of pro hac vice status for conduct that would be permissible by a local attorney williams connolly,llp people for the ethical treatment of animals,conduct justifying sanctions under statute is a sufficient basis to revoke pro hac vice status under this standard.in some jurisdictions,violation of an established disciplinary standard justifies revocation of pro hac vice status,in re complaint of pmd enterprises,supra,d at.other jurisdictions require bad faith of the pro hac vice attorney before such status can be revoked.baldwin hardware franksu enterprise,trial court order prohibited counsel from appearing pro hac vice before it in the future.still other jurisdictions grant trial courts a very broad discretion,which permits revocation of pro hac vice status for reasons which do not amount to misconduct,brown wood,not an abuse of discretion to revoke an attorney pro hac vice status for concerns that the pro hac vice attorney extensive practice would adversely affect the trial court ability to move its docket along.in ohio,the courts have not yet determined the outer limits of the trial courts authority to revoke pro hac vice status,but have concluded that,at the least,conduct which would support disqualification of a local attorney is sufficient to justify revocation of a pro hac vice attorney status.royal indemnity penney ohio.in washington,pro hac vice status can be revoked for conduct that constitutes contempt,adversely affects the conduct of the litigation,or violates the code of professional responsibility hallmann sturm ruger,supra,at.
in this admittedly state of the law,we now consider whether california trial courts have the authority to revoke an attorney pro hac vice status.we consider the three legal bases that have been found by other jurisdictions to support such authority express provision in statute or rule implied in court authority to control admission to its bar and discipline attorneys who appear before it and implied in court inherent power to regulate practice before it and protect the integrity of its proceedings.california has no express provision granting trial courts the right to revoke an attorney pro hac vice status.unlike federal courts,california trial courts do not possess the power to control admission to the bar and discipline attorneys.but california trial courts do possess the inherent power to regulate practice before them and protect the integrity of their proceedings.in determining whether this power encompasses the authority to revoke an attorney pro hac vice status,we look at the language of the governing court rule.an attorney appearing pro hac vice is subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state with respect to the law of this state governing the conduct of attorneys to the same extent as a member of the state bar of california.cal.rules of court,rule f.given that a california trial court inherent power includes the authority to disqualify a california attorney,and that revocation of an attorney pro hac vice status is,in effect,a disqualification of the attorney we conclude that a california trial court inherent powers include the authority to revoke an attorney pro hac vice status when that attorney has engaged in conduct that would be sufficient to disqualify a california attorney.while it may be that a california trial court has the authority to revoke an attorney pro hac vice status under other circumstances as well,we need not reach the issue of the precise limits of a trial court authority in this appeal.
the trial court order 
in this case,the trial court ordered attorney sheller to pay farmers attorney fees.the order had no statutory basis,and the trial court could not have imposed a similar order on a california attorney.similarly,the trial court formally reprimanded attorney sheller.again,this is not a sanction that the trial court would have had jurisdiction to impose on a california attorney.farmers suggests that,even though these sanctions could not have been imposed on a california attorney,the sanctions can be upheld in this case as lesser sanctions to the permissible sanction of revocation of attorney sheller pro hac vice status.the conclusion does not follow.indeed,it has already been established that although a trial court has the inherent power to disqualify a california attorney,it does not have the power to impose the apparently lesser sanctions of attorney fees and a formal reprimand.there is simply no reason to conclude that,even though
