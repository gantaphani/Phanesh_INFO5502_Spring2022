the trial court granted defendant irene intelligator special motion to strike code civ.proc.the complaint of plaintiff husband and awarded intelligator attorney fees and costs.it also denied husband motion for reconsideration of the attorney fee and costs award,due to lack of jurisdiction.husband appeals from both rulings.
when intelligator,an attorney representing husband wife in certain postmarital dissolution proceedings,filed a copy of husband credit report in support of a motion,intelligator was clearly involved in petitioning activity within the meaning of code of civil procedure section.this is so even though she admits to having violated california rules of court,rule when she failed to redact personal identifiers before filing the credit report.having demonstrated that the activity that formed the basis of husband causes of action was protected petitioning activity,the burden shifted to husband to demonstrate a probability of success on his claims.he failed to meet this burden.in addition,he failed to show either that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding the attorney fees and costs or that it erred in denying his motion for reconsideration.we affirm.
intelligator represented wife in marital dissolution proceedings.judgment of dissolution was entered and the court retained jurisdiction to address postdissolution matters including debts.
some time after the judgment of dissolution was entered,wife went to purchase a car.however,her auto loan was denied when the lender discovered that wife had an adverse credit report.the credit report disclosed significant outstanding medical bills of which wife,a russian immigrant,had been unaware.she obtained a credit report on husband and learned that the medical bills were not reflected on his credit report,only on hers.wife took both credit reports to intelligator,seeking her help in making husband pay the bills.
intelligator sent demand letters regarding the unpaid medical bills to husband attorney.since payment was not forthcoming,intelligator ultimately filed,in the marital dissolution proceedings,a motion to require husband to pay the outstanding medical bills.intelligator attached to the motion copies of the credit reports of both husband and wife.intelligator concedes that the unredacted credit report of husband disclosed certain personal identifiers.however,husband himself had already made at least one of those personal identifiers public through the prior filing of various documents.
husband filed a complaint against intelligator,asserting causes of action for violation of civil code section and for invasion of privacy,based on intelligator filing of his unredacted credit report in the marital dissolution proceedings.he contended that the disclosure of personal identifiers violated california rules of court,rule.
intelligator filed both a code of civil procedure section special motion to strike and a demurrer.the court granted the special motion to strike,making the demurrer moot.in addition,the court awarded intelligator in attorney fees and costs.
husband filed a motion for reconsideration,to challenge the award of attorney fees and costs.the court denied the motion.on appeal,husband challenges the ruling on the special motion to strike,the ensuing judgment including the award of attorney fees and costs,and the ruling on the motion for reconsideration 
discussion 
code of civil procedure section 
section provides for a special motion to strike a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue,subd.b.the legislature enacted the statute to protect defendants,including corporate defendants,from interference with the valid exercise of their constitutional rights,particularly the right of freedom of speech and the right to petition the government for the redress of grievances.citation.citation.turner vista pointe ridge homeowners th.
in analyzing a section motion,the court engages in a process.first,the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity.citation.the moving defendant meets this burden by showing the act underlying the plaintiff cause of action comes within section,subdivision b.citation.if the defendant meets this initial burden,the burden then shifts and the plaintiff must show a probability of prevailing on the claim.citation.the plaintiff must demonstrate the complaint is both legally sufficient and is supported by a prima facie showing of facts sufficient to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is given credit.citation.we review de novo whether section protects the subject speech and whether the plaintiff demonstrated a probability he would prevail on his cause of action.citation.citation.turner vista pointe ridge homeowners,supra,th at.
a defendant can meet his or her burden of showing that the challenged cause of action arises from protected activity by demonstrating the acts underlying the plaintiff cause of action fit within one of the categories of section,subdivision e.citation.section,subdivision e defines an act in furtherance of the defendant right of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue to include any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative,executive,or judicial proceeding,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive,or judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest or any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.citation.turner vista pointe ridge homeowners,supra,th 
application of statute 
introduction 
husband claims that intelligator can not meet her initial burden to show,under the first prong of the test,that the challenged causes of action arise from protected activity.he therefore contends that the second prong of the test,that is,whether he can show a probability of prevailing on his claims,is irrelevant.consequently,he does not specifically argue that he could meet the burden to show a probability of prevailing,were we to hold that the burden had shifted to him.at the same time,husband responds to intelligator argument that he can not demonstrate a probability of prevailing on his claims because her action was protected by the civil code section,subdivision b litigation privilege.he argues that the privilege does not protect her.we disagree with husband analysis,as we shall show.
first prong protected activity 
with respect to the first prong of the test,concerning protected activity,intelligator filing of the credit report in connection with a postdissolution motion falls squarely within the language of code of civil procedure section,subdivision e and.under the plain language of section,subdivision e and,as well as the case law interpreting those provisions,all communicative acts performed by attorneys as part of their representation of a client in a judicial proceeding or other petitioning context are per se protected as petitioning activity by the statute.citations.cabral martins th,cabral.
husband nonetheless argues that even when an attorney files documents in a pending proceeding,the act of doing so is not necessarily protected activity.he contends that,in a case such as this,where the attorney violates a rule of court and discloses private information that it was not necessary to disclose,the attorney action exceeds the boundaries of protected activity.we shall see.
as our supreme court has stated,where a defendant brings a motion to strike under section based on a claim that the plaintiff action arises from activity by the defendant in furtherance of the defendant exercise of protected speech or petition rights,but either the defendant concedes,or the evidence conclusively establishes,that the assertedly protected speech or petition activity was illegal as a matter of law,the defendant is precluded from using the statute to strike the plaintiff action.flatley mauro cal th,flatley.the question here is whether intelligator concession that she violated california rules of court,rule in filing an unredacted credit report bars her from obtaining an order under section striking husband complaint.
intelligator cites several cases in support of her argument that flatley,supra,cal th is no impediment to her motion.first,she cites birkner lam th birkner.in that case,the court addressed whether a landlord engaged in protected activity,within the meaning of code of civil procedure section,when he served his tenants with a notice to terminate tenancy and refused to rescind the same.id.at.it held that the service of the notice to terminate,being a prerequisite to the bringing of an unlawful detainer action,constituted an activity in furtherance of the protected right to petition.id.at.the court rejected the tenants argument that the landlord activity was not a protected activity because of the allegation that the activity violated a rent ordinance.id.at.
the birkner court stated nor is there any merit to plaintiffs suggestion that the exclusion from coverage for indisputably illegal conduct,recognized in flatley,supra,cal th at page,applies here.c onduct that would otherwise come within the scope of the statute does not lose its coverage simply because it is alleged to have been unlawful or unethical.citations.an exception to the use of section applies only if a defendant concedes,or the evidence conclusively establishes,that the assertedly protected speech or petition activity was illegal as a matter of law.citation.the exception does not apply here.the trial court found,and we concur,that the evidence does not conclusively establish that the defendant conduct of serving and refusing to rescind the termination notice was illegal.birkner,supra,th at.
intelligator emphasizes that,according to birkner,supra,th,the flatley exclusion from coverage applies only when the conduct at issue was illegal as a matter of law.this argument does not help her,however,inasmuch as she admits,in her opening brief,to filing the unredacted credit report at issue in violation of california rules of court,rule.
intelligator also cites rusheen cohen cal th rusheen.in rusheen,an attorney filed a complaint on behalf of the plaintiff.the attorney filed allegedly perjured declarations of service in order to obtain a default judgment against the defendant.the trial court denied the defendant motion to vacate the default judgment,but the appellate court reversed the judgment.on remand,the defendant filed a for abuse of process against the plaintiff attorney.the trial court granted the attorney special motion to strike.id.at.the supreme court held that this was proper.id.at.
according to intelligator,the alleged acts of the attorney in rusheen,supra,cal th clearly violated the rules governing litigation practice,and the case must stand for the proposition that the violation of those particular rules did not constitute the type of illegal conduct that would cause the flatley exclusion to apply.it is tempting to infer that proposition from the case,but a case is not authority for a proposition that was not considered by the court.flatley,supra,cal th at.the court in rusheen,supra,cal th did not specifically address whether the filing of perjured declarations was the type of illegal conduct that would trigger the flatley exclusion,or whether,as a general rule,one particular type of illegal conduct triggers the flatley exclusion while another does not.true,the rusheen court recited the code of civil procedure section test,and impliedly found that the first prong had been met.rusheen,supra,cal th at.but,where the application of the test is concerned,the rusheen court focused its attention only on whether the second prong of the test had been satisfied.id.at.the court held that it had.id.at.
here,neither party has cited a case directly addressing our issue,that is,whether a violation of california rules of court,rule constitutes the sort of illegal conduct that would trigger the flatley exclusion,and preclude the attorney from meeting his or her burden to demonstrate protected activity,within the meaning of the first prong of the code of civil procedure section test.however,intelligator cites a recent case,cabral,supra,th,which provides insight on the issue.
in cabral,supra,th,a woman filed suit against her,his siblings,and several attorneys,in connection with a purported scheme to avoid child support payments.id.at.the various attorneys,respectively,had prepared a revised will for the mother that diverted what would have been his share of the estate to his sister,probated the mother revised will,and represented the and his siblings in certain fraudulent transfer actions.
id.at.the attorneys,in the underlying child support evasion litigation,filed special motions to strike the complaint against them and the trial court granted the motions.id.at.the appellate court affirmed.id.at.
with respect to the first prong of the code of civil procedure section test,the cabral court quickly concluded that the attorneys acts of lodging the will and pursuing probate proceedings,and defending the siblings in the various litigation matters,constituted protected petitioning activity under section,subdivision e and.cabral,supra,th at.the argued to the contrary,contending that the actions of the attorneys were illegal,because they violated certain child support evasion statutes.id.at.
the cabral court acknowledged the flatley exclusion to the first prong of the code of civil procedure section test.cabral,supra,th at 
however,it emphasized the narrowness of the exclusion.the cabral court observed that the supreme court in flatley,supra,cal th concluded that communications which constituted criminal extortion as a matter of law and,as such,were unprotected by constitutional guarantees of free speech or petition,were not protected by the statute.citation.the supreme court made clear,however,that its holding was limited to the specific and extreme circumstances of this case,in which the assertedly protected communications,as a matter of law,fell outside the ambit of protected speech.citation.cabral,supra,th at.the cabral court also noted another prominent case in which the illegality exclusion was applied paul for council hanyecz th paul,disapproved on other grounds in equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th.cabral,supra,th at.in paul,the activity of which plaintiff complain ed defendants campaign money not a valid activity undertaken by defendants in furtherance of their constitutional right of free speech.paul,supra,th at.consequently,the trial court erred in granting the defendants special motion to strike.id.at.the cabral court,in evaluating paul,supra,th,emphasized that the money laundering activities were admittedly illegal.cabral,supra,th at.
in concluding that the flatley illegality exclusion did not block the abilities of the attorneys in the case before it to meet their burdens to show protected activity,the cabral court noted that the attorneys actions in the course of the probate proceedings and the litigation defense were neither inherently criminal nor otherwise outside the scope of normal,routine legal services.cabral,supra,th at.it further stated that e ven if the attorneys actions had the effect of defeating or forestalling the ability to execute her judgment for child support,thereby according to the violating the child support evasion statutes,this is not the kind of illegality involved in flatley mauro,supra,cal th,and paul for council hanyecz,supra,th.cabral,supra,th at 
fn.omitted.
we find the reasoning of the cabral court persuasive.in the case before us,intelligator filed a postdissolution motion seeking redress on a number of points,including the payment of outstanding medical bills.as a part of normal,routine legal services,intelligator attached the credit reports of the parties,in support of the motion.unfortunately,she failed to redact certain personal identifiers,as required by california rules of court,rule.however,this is not the type of criminal activity addressed in either flatley,supra,cal th or paul,supra,th.
furthermore,a litigant who finds that opposing counsel has filed an unredacted credit report does,as the trial court in the matter before us pointed out,have means of redress other than commencing a separate lawsuit.california rules of court,rule permits a litigant to seek sanctions against an attorney who fails to comply with the rules.here,husband could have sought sanctions against intelligator in the ongoing postdissolution proceedings,where the court familiar with the matter was in the best position to address it.a separate lawsuit was completely unnecessary.furthermore,if an attorney were subject to a separate action each time he or she committed a rule violation in the representation of his or her client,the effect would be to chill the hearty pursuit of a protected right to petition.
we conclude that the flatley exclusion does not apply,and that intelligator met her burden to show the challenged causes of action arose from protected activity.this being the case,the burden shifted to husband to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on his claims.
second prong probability of success 
the trial court held that husband could not demonstrate a probability of success on his claims because they were barred by the litigation privilege of civil code section,subdivision b.on appeal,husband argues that the privilege is no bar to his claims.we disagree.
as stated in flatley,supra,cal th,civil code section,subdivision b states in relevant part a privileged publication or broadcast is one made b in any legislative proceeding,judicial proceeding,in any other official proceeding authorized by law,or in the initiation or course of any other proceeding authorized by law and reviewable pursuant to chapter commencing with section of title of part of the code of civil procedure flatley,supra,cal th at,fn.the principal purpose of civil code section,subdivision b is to afford litigants and witnesses citation the utmost freedom of access to the courts without fear of being harassed subsequently by derivate tort actions.citation.additionally,the privilege promotes effective judicial proceedings by encouraging open channels of communication and the presentation of evidence without the external threat of liability ibid,and by encouraging attorneys to zealously protect their clients interests.citation.finally,in immunizing participants from liability for torts arising from communications made during judicial proceedings,the law places upon litigants the burden of exposing during trial the bias of witnesses and the falsity of evidence,thereby enhancing the finality of judgments and avoiding an unending roundelay of litigation,an evil far worse than an occasional unfair result.citation.to accomplish these objectives,the privilege is an absolute privilege,and it bars all tort causes of action except a claim of malicious prosecution.citation.flatley,supra,cal th at.the flatley court observed that the litigation privilege has bearing upon the second prong of the code of civil procedure section test.flatley,supra,cal th at.
we turn to rusheen,supra,cal th for guidance in the application of the litigation privilege in the context of the second prong.in rusheen,as we have discussed,an attorney filed allegedly perjured declarations of service in order to obtain a default judgment against the defendant.in addressing the second prong of the test,the court held that the attorney alleged act fell within the litigation privilege.id.at 
it observed that the salutary policy reasons for an absolute litigation privilege supersede individual litigants interest in recovering damages for injurious publications made during the course of judicial proceedings.citation.id.at 
in addition,the rusheen court noted that the denial of the abuse of process claim was mitigated by the fact that there were alternative remedies,such as moving to set aside the default judgment,moving to recall and quash the writ of execution,and seeking a writ of supersedeas to block enforcement efforts.rusheen,supra,cal th at.in conclusion,the court in rusheen held that there was no reasonable probability of success on the abuse of process claim,because the allegedly wrongful conduct was privileged.therefore,the second prong of the code of civil procedure section test was met and the special motion to strike was properly granted.id.at.
in the case before us,as in rusheen,supra,cal th,husband had alternative remedies,as we have mentioned.one was seeking sanctions,to compensate him for any monetary loss arising out of the improper disclosure.another was to have his credit report sealed,so that the information would not remain available to public view it was unnecessary,and contrary to the principles of the litigation privilege,for husband to file a separate action to seek redress.
despite the foregoing authorities,husband contends that the civil code section,subdivision b litigation privilege must yield to the more specific rules of court,rule,having to do with the protection of financial information of litigants.in support of his position,he cites komarova national credit acceptance,th komarova.
in komarova,supra,th,the defendant obtained an arbitration award against a debtor with a name similar to the plaintiff.id.at.the defendant mistakenly pursued the plaintiff for collection of the debt,and employed what the plaintiff characterized as unfair debt collection practices,in violation of the rosenthal fair debt collection practices act,et the rosenthal act.komarova,supra,th at.ultimately,the plaintiff filed an action against the defendant for,among other things,violations of the rosenthal act.id.at.
the defendant in komarova,supra,th argued that conduct violating the rosenthal act was shielded by the litigation privilege of civil code section,subdivision b.komarova,supra,th at.in addressing this argument,the komarova court observed the privilege bars tort claims other than for malicious prosecution citation,and has been interpreted to preclude constitutional and statutory causes of action citations.on the other hand,the privilege has been held not to prevent certain criminal and state bar prosecutions citations.id.at 
the komarova court concluded exceptions to the litigation privilege have been recognized under statutes that are more specific than the privilege,and would be significantly or wholly inoperable if the privilege applied.citation.komarova,supra,th at.in determining whether the litigation privilege was more specific than the rosenthal act,the komarova court observed that the litigation privilege was implicated in all judicial proceedings whereas the rosenthal act was implicated in only the small subset of those proceedings that involve d collection of consumer debts.komarova,supra,th at.in addition,the court answered in the affirmative the question whether the rosenthal act would be significantly inoperable if the litigation privilege applied.the court noted that the rosenthal act could be circumvented with ease if the litigation privilege applied,because a payee would be immunized by simply filing suit on the debt.id.at.
in the case before us,unlike the case in komarova,supra,th,the application of the litigation privilege is coextensive with the application of california rules of court,rule.that is to say,both the litigation privilege and the rule are generally implicated in all state court proceedings.furthermore,to hold that the litigation privilege bars a separate tort action against an attorney for violation of rule would not be to eviscerate that rule.as we have already observed,when an attorney violates rule,the affected party need only file a motion for sanctions or other redress in the pending proceedings.in addition,the party may report the attorney to the state bar.in sum,komarova,supra,th does not compel the conclusion that the litigation privilege is inapplicable here,in connection w
