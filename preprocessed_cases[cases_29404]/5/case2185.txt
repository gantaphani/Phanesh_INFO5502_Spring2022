tenants leased a residence.the lease had an attorney fees and costs provision.the landlord failed to provide a habitable dwelling.a fire resulted,destroying the tenants personal property.at the time,the tenants were behind in their rent.this lawsuit ensued,and the tenants recovered damages for the loss of their property,and the landlord recovered the back rent.
the issue before us is whether the tenants can recover attorney fees and expert witness fees and other litigation costs under civil code section,notwithstanding their being in breach of the lease.we conclude that they can recover attorney fees because the implied covenant of habitability contained in the lease is independent of the covenant to pay rent.but they are not entitled to expert witness fees and other litigation costs because the reciprocity provisions of civil code section do not permit a contractually broadened definition of costs.
background 
in a prior appeal,we affirmed the judgment for the tenants on their claim against the landlord for breach of the implied warranty of habitability.fairchild park,nonpub.opn.
in the present appeals,the tenants challenge the trial court posttrial denial of their motion for attorney fees.in turn,the landlord disputes the trial court posttrial award of expert witness fees and other litigation expenses to the tenants.
the pertinent facts,taken from our earlier opinion,are as follows.tenants phillip and veronica fairchild and their children were living in a rental home owned by landlord young park.tenants,who were behind in their rent by about one year,were planning to move.before they could do so,a fire broke out in the garage and spread throughout the house during the early morning hours of april.tenants,who were sleeping,managed to escape but lost their personal belongings.fairchild park,supra.
the tenants brought this suit for breach of contract,breach of the implied warranty of habitability,negligence,and fraud.the landlord for back rent.on the landlord demurrer and motion to strike,the trial court dismissed the tenants fraud claim and barred all tort relief on the claim for breach of the warranty of habitability.
the case was tried to the court.the trial court found for the tenants on the complaint,stating even though the rent was not paid,it was a breach of the implied warranty of quiet use and enjoyment of the property to keep the electrical system in a state of proven disrepair.the covenants to pay rent by the tenant and maintain reasonably safe premises by the landlord are independent and not dependent covenants.failure to pay rent was an unlawful detainer and the landlord had a speedy remedy at law to compel the tenants to pay rent or vacate the premises.he was never excused from keeping the property in an average reasonable state of repair.italics added.the court awarded to the tenants for their loss of personal property in the fire 
with respect to the landlord,the trial court found that the tenants were liable for in back rent,which it awarded to the landlord.
in the judgment,the trial court recited that tenants are the prevailing parties and under the rental agreement and civil code section entitled to reasonable attorney fees.but later,when the tenants moved for attorney fees,the court denied the motion,stating the court finds that tenants attorney had a contingent fee agreement with his client and should recover his fees as per the contract and not from the landlord.the court awarded the tenants costs in the amount of,which consisted of in expert witness fees and other litigation expenses such as photocopying,telephone calls,postage,and mileage.
discussion 
we begin by addressing the tenants contention that the trial court should have awarded them attorney fees.we then discuss whether the trial court erred in awarding litigation expenses,including expert witness fees,to the tenants.
the tenants appeal 
the tenants contend that they are entitled to attorney fees under civil code section based on an attorney fees provision in the written lease,notwithstanding that they breached the lease by nonpayment of rent.the lease provides that the tenants shall pay landlord all costs and expenses,including attorney fees in a reasonable sum,in any action brought by landlord to recover any rent due and unpaid hereunder,or for the breach of any of the covenants contained in this lease 
while the lease does not state that the tenants could recover attorney fees if they were the prevailing parties,civil code section,subdivision a provides that i n any action on a contract,where the contract specifically provides that attorney fees and costs,which are incurred to enforce that contract,shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party,then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract,whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or not,shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees in addition to other costs.subdivision b of that section provides in pertinent part that the party prevailing on the contract shall be the party who recovered a greater relief in the action on the contract.on appeal,the landlord does not challenge the trial court determination that the tenants were the prevailing parties under the rental agreement.
the trial court initially stated that the tenants were entitled to reasonable attorney fees under the lease pursuant to civil code section.subsequently,the court had a change of heart,concluding that the contingent fee agreement between the tenants and their attorney foreclosed such an award.the trial court was wrong in this regard and the landlord does not contend otherwise.
under a lease agreement permit ting recovery of reasonable attorney fees in an action between the parties,an interpretation which bars recovery to parties who have contingent fee agreements would create a great deal of inequity because although a party with a contingent fee agreement would be exposed to the risk of paying fees incurred by an opponent,he would have no opportunity to recover any portion of the fees he would in fact be required to pay if he were successful.such disparity of treatment is to be avoided in interpreting and applying attorney fees provisions.citation.gonzales personal storage,th,d.
the landlord contends that the tenants are not entitled to attorney fees under the lease because they prevailed on a tort claim,not a contract claim.arguably,the scope of the attorney fee provision in the lease does not encompass tort claims.see exxess electronixx heger realty th,d.but we conclude that the tenants are entitled to attorney fees on a contract theory.
there is a common law implied warranty of habitability in residential leases in california green superior court cal d,green.in the present case,the tenants did assert a contractual cause of action breach of the implied warranty of habitability.allstate ins.loo th,d.an action by a tenant alleging a breach of the warranty of habitability is an action on the contract that authorizes the recovery of fees pursuant to an attorney fee provision in the rental agreement.miller starr,cal.real estate supp.
further,w hether an action is based on contract or tort depends upon the nature of the right sued upon,not the form of the pleading or relief demanded.if based on breach of promise it is contractual if based on breach of a noncontractual duty it is tortious if unclear the action will be considered based on contract rather than tort.in the final analysis we look to the pleading to determine the nature of plaintiff claim.arthur sachs,city of oceanside d,citations omitted accord,voth wasco public util.dist.d.
here,the tenants recovery was not based on a duty independent of the lease.the trial court expressly awarded damages based on the landlord breach of the warranty of warranty that is implied in every lease.see green,supra,cal d at.in addition,after the trial court ruled on the landlord demurrer and motion to strike,the tenants were no longer seeking,or entitled to,tort relief on the habitability claim.we therefore see no basis for concluding that the landlord liability was premised on a duty not arising out of the lease.
we acknowledge that a landlord has a statutory obligation under civil code section to keep residential property in a condition fit for human occupation,and repair all subsequent dilapidations thereof.but in green,supra,cal d,the supreme court made clear that civil code section does not affect a tenant right to pursue a claim for violation of the warranty of habitability.in the words of the court,we conclude that civil code section et do not preclude the development of new common law principles in this area,and we now hold that a warranty of habitability is implied by law in residential leases in california.green,supra,cal d at,italics added.and,as stated,the trial court in this case did not rely on section,but instead based liability solely on the implied warranty of quiet use and enjoyment.
and,even assuming that the habitability claim was based on more than one,statutory,or tenants would still be entitled to attorney fees on the contract theory.as one court of appeal has explained in a similar situation 
t he same act may be both a breach of contract and a tort.even where there is a contractual relationship between parties,a cause of action in tort may sometimes arise out of the negligent manner in which the contractual duty is performed conversely,where a contract gives rise to a duty of care,negligence in the performance of the duty may give rise to a cause of action for breach of contract when such a hybrid cause of action arises,the plaintiff may pursue both legal theories of recovery until an occasion for an election of remedies arises 
here,the allegations of the complaint,while compacted in a single count,are adequate to tender both the tort and contract claims for relief 
defendants central argument concerning the pleading is that,because it alleges that they were negligent,it must present only a legal theory in tort.this argument is fundamentally flawed 
the allegation of negligence is not an election of a tort remedy.an election does not occur by the assertion of an inconsistent allegation,but by the acceptance of an actual benefit from an alternative theory which would render unfair the continued pursuit of the alternative defendants have not identified any such benefit 
defendants make no argument which identifies a benefit received by the plaintiff peculiar to the tort remedy that warrants estoppel to pursue the contract remedy of attorney fees.from all that appears the damages that the plaintiff received would be the same whether the theory were contract or tort.the plaintiff did not pursue nor,consequently,did the jury award,damages for personal injuries,a characteristic tort remedy 
the question is whether plaintiff may pursue a breach of contract theory of remedy when defendants have negligently failed to adequately perform a contractual undertaking.such an action is one to enforce the provisions of the contract w e hold that when the prevailing plaintiff in such an action has not elected a distinctive remedy in tort,such an action may be,and here is,on a contract within the meaning of civil code section.perry robertson d.perry,italics in original.
as noted by one leading authority,in perry,the plaintiff complaint was based on both negligence and negligent performance of the contract,and both theories went to the jury.since the measure of damages was the same under both theories,the plaintiff was not required to make an election of remedies,and after the jury verdict she was allowed to elect the contract theory in order to recover attorney fees.miller starr,cal.real estate ed,fn,italics added see,fn.discussing perry.as in perry,the tenants in this case could elect,after the finding of liability,to go forward on a contract theory to recover attorney fees.
nor does the tenants type of recovery matter.the landlord asserts that,because the tenants were awarded the market value of the lost property,they necessarily prevailed on a tort claim.we disagree.where the measure of damages turns on the value of property,whether liability sounds in tort or breach of contract,the normal standard is market value.glendale fed.sav.loan marina view heights dev.d,italics added,citing bagdasarian gragnon cal d.
the landlord also contends that,since the covenant of habitability is imposed by law,it must sound in tort.not so.just as the covenant of habitability is implied in a lease,the covenant of good faith and fair dealing is implied in all contracts,including a lease.see,locke warner,th,d sachs exxon,th,d.yet,with the exception of bad faith insurance cases,a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing permits a recovery solely in contract.see cates construction,talbot partners cal th,d.
next,the landlord argues that the tenants did not recover on a contract cause of action because they were in breach of the lease by being in arrears in rent.we reject that argument on the ground that the implied covenant of habitability contained in the lease is independent of the covenant to pay rent.
as our supreme court has stated a covenant to repair on the part of the lessor and a covenant to pay rent on the part of a lessee are usually considered as independent covenants,and unless the covenant to repair is expressly or impliedly made a condition precedent to the covenant to pay rent,the breach of the former does not justify the refusal on the part of the lessee to perform the latter.arnold krigbaum cal,overruled on another point in green,supra,cal d at.and as the high court later clarified c ovenants in leases are independent or dependent according to the nature of the obligations,their relation to each other,the intention of the parties as shown by the provisions of the governing lease,and the factual situation of each particular case.horton converse cal d.here,the landlord does not contend that the implied covenant of habitability was expressly or impliedly made a condition precedent to the covenant to pay rent.
we conclude that the landlord obligation to provide a habitable residence to the tenants is independent of the tenants obligation to pay rent.in green,supra,cal d,the supreme court in the middle property law principle that a landlord had no duty to place leased premises in a habitable condition and no duty to repair based on the ancient doctrine of caveat emptor,or let the buyer beware.the court discussed modern urbanization,the change in the contemporary housing market,modern legal decisions discarding the caveat emptor approach in order to protect consumers,and the widespread enactment of comprehensive housing codes throughout the nation.green,supra,cal d at.
the court stated in most significant respects,the modern urban tenant is in the same position as any other normal consumer of goods.citation.green,supra,cal d at.based on contemporary social conditions and modern legal values,green recognized an implied warranty of habitability in residential leases in california.
applying the rationale of green to this case,we conclude that the nature of a landlord obligation to provide habitable premises to its tenants is such that the tenants right to enforce this duty should not be forfeited by an arrearage in rent.a landlord has a speedy remedy via unlawful detainer proceedings to deal with a tenant who is behind in rent.t he covenant to pay rent usually is regarded as independent.in other words,the tenant failure to pay rent does not justify the landlord failure to perform his covenants,such as his covenant to repair.miller starr,cal.real estate ed,fn.omitted.
the landlord appeal 
the landlord contends that the trial court improperly awarded expert witness fees and other litigation expenses in the amount of.we agree.
the tenants described the on their memorandum of costs as o ther costs pursuant to contract.these include not only expert witness fees but also expenditures for photocopying,telephone calls,postage,and not otherwise be allowable under code of civil procedure section.indeed,section explicitly precludes their recovery.code civ,subd.b.
nevertheless,the tenants claim that they are entitled to these costs under the contract pursuant to the attorney fee clause in the lease.that clause states that the tenants shall pay landlord all costs and expenses in any action brought for the breach of any of the covenants contained in th e lease thus,the tenants contend that the reciprocity provisions of civil code section entitle them,as the prevailing parties,to an award of all costs and expenses.
the tenants argue that,because the lease uses the broad language,all costs and expenses,they are entitled to expert witness fees and other litigation expenditures.the same language appears frequently in notes,deeds of trust and standard leases.here the lease is captioned standard lease and is a fill in the blanks form.
we need not reach the question of whether the parties intended the words all costs and expenses to include items disallowed under section of the code of civil procedure.assuming that the parties so intended,the question is whether the scope of the term costs as used in civil code section can be enlarged by contract beyond the costs allowable under code of civil procedure section.we conclude that it can not.
as we observed in exxess electronixx heger realty,supra,th,d,the definition of prevailing party in civil code section is mandatory and can not be altered or avoided by contract.id.at,d,citing santisas goodin cal th,d,santisas.contractual provisions that conflict with the prevailing party definition under section are void.exxess electronixx heger realty,supra,th at,d,citing santisas,supra,cal th at,d.
as the supreme court explained in santisas t he legislative history of section generally reflects a legislative intent to establish uniform treatment of fee recoveries in actions on contracts containing attorney fee provisions and to eliminate distinctions based on whether recovery was authorized by statute or by contract.a holding that in contract actions there is still a separate contractual right to recover fees that is not governed by section would be contrary to this legislative intent.cal th at,d.
just as santisas precludes litigants from adopting a definition of prevailing party that differs from civil code section,we conclude,for the same reasons,that litigants can not expand the definition of costs in section to include items not permitted under section of the code of civil procedure.it follows that the trial court award of for expert witnesses and other litigation expenses should be stricken 
in arguing that they are entitled to expert witness fees,the tenants urge us to follow bussey affleck d.bussey.in that case,the court concluded w here a contract provides for payment of costs and attorney fees,the court may allow disbursements of counsel as attorney fees under section,subdivision a,if they represent expenses ordinarily billed to a client,including expert witness fees,and are not included in the overhead component of counsel hourly rate.an agreement for attorney fees and costs would be less than effectual if it could not cover the actual costs of litigation,including disbursements of counsel,and a contrary conclusion would mean that the party prevailing on the contract could never be made whole.bussey,supra,d at.
in contrast,the landlord in this case relies on ripley pappadopoulos th,d,which disagreed with bussey and held that a general contract provision for recovery of attorney fees and costs must be construed in light of code of civil procedure section and does not include expert witness fees.id.at pp.at,d ripley.as the court explained in ripley 
in bussey the court attempted to avoid the statutory prohibition against the inclusion of expert witness fees in a cost award by equating expert witness fees and other nonallowable costs of litigation with attorney fees and by concluding that such costs may be included in an award of contractual attorney fees.we can not adhere to that approach.in the absence of some specific provision of law otherwise,attorney fees and the expenses of litigation,whether termed costs,disbursements,outlays,or something else,are mutually exclusive,that is,attorney fees do not include such costs and costs do not include attorney fees in view of the clear distinction that has always been drawn between attorney fees and the expenses of litigation,we can not disregard the legislature express prohibition against the inclusion of expert witness fees in a cost award by equating such expenses with attorney fees.ripley,supra,th at,d.
in davis,cal th,d,in connection with a contractual provision for shifting costs of litigation,the supreme court noted the conflict between bussey and ripley and then stated our present analysis,which involves statutory construction,may not be dispositive in a matter involving the effect of a contractual agreement for shifting litigation costs,which turns on the intentions of the contracting parties.davis,supra,at,fn,d.
bussey is not on point because the trial court here did not award expert witness fees or other litigation expenses under the guise of attorney fees,which was the case in bussey.rather,the trial court in this case did not award attorney fees at all.
and,bussey is a decision of the first district court of appeal,division four.in robert cloud associates,mikesell th,d,decided by division five of the first district,the court stated appellant now urges this court to reject bussey and to follow ripley.his position is sound.for all the reasons stated in ripley,the bussey decision should not be followed.instead,in light of the legislature express prohibition against inclusion of expert witness fees within a cost award code civ,subd.b,we shall modify the judgment to delete the expert witness fees robert cloud associates,supra,th at,d.
we,too,find ripley to be persuasive and therefore decline to follow bussey.
disposition 
the order denying plaintiffs motion for attorney fees is reversed,and,on remand,the trial court shall award reasonable attorney fees to plaintiff.the order denying defendant motion to strike in costs is reversed.the parties are to bear their own costs on appeal.
i concur in part and dissent in part.i agree with the reversal of the order denying defendant motion to strike in costs.i disagree,however,with the reversal of the order denying plaintiffs motion for attorney fees.in my view,the breaching tenants who,without justification,had withheld rent for a year,may not enforce a contractual attorney fee clause against a landlord whose breach of the implied warranty of habitability caused the tenants to suffer property damage in an electrical fire.the landlord breach did not,in this specific case,extinguish the tenants duty to pay the back rent accrued during the year before the fire 
the majority cite an unlawful detainer case,green superior court,supra,cal d at,for the proposition that there is a common law implied warranty of habitability in residential leases in california in general,i agree that a residential tenant who defeats an unlawful detainer action by asserting the landlord breach of the implied covenant of habitability may,in addition to remaining in possession of the premises,recover attorney fees under the lease agreement,provided the landlord breach has canceled the obligation to pay rent.a landlord breach of a warranty of habitability directly relates to whether any rent is due and owing by the tenant hence such breach may be determinative of whether the landlord or tenant is entitled to possession of the premises upon nonpayment of rent.accordingly,the tenant may properly raise the issue of warranty of habitability in an unlawful detainer action.green superior court,supra,cal d at.if the tenant can prove such a breach by the landlord,he may demonstrate that his nonpayment of rent was justified and that no rent is in fact due and owing to the landlord.green superior court,supra,cal d at.
the degree to which the landlord breach of the implied warranty of habitability provides a defense to an unlawful detainer action depends entirely upon the extent of the damages caused by the landlord breach.if the landlord breach of warranty is total,such that the tenant owes no rent whatsoever,the court should,of course,enter judgment for the tenant in the unlawful detainer action.green superior court,supra,cal d at.on the other hand,if the trial court finds that the landlord has not breache
