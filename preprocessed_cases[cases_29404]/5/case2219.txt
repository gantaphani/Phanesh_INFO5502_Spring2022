the texas medical liability act requires that a health care liability claimant serve expert reports on each defendant physician or provider within days after filing suit.civ.prac.a.we have characterized this requirement as a threshold over which a claimant must proceed to continue a health care liability lawsuit.murphy russell,per curiam.if no report is timely served,the trial court must,on motion,dismiss the claim and award reasonable attorney fees and costs to the affected physician or provider 
no expert report was served in this case,and the trial court accordingly dismissed it.the court,however,did not award attorney fees.the court of appeals affirmed,concluding the trial court had not abused its discretion in failing to award attorney fees because the record contained no evidence of the reasonable fees incurred by the physician in defense of the claim.we conclude,however,that there is some evidence of reasonable attorney fees and some evidence that the physician incurred attorney fees.we further conclude that section b mandates an award of attorney fees and costs,when expert reports are not served timely,and accordingly reverse the court of appeals judgment and remand to the trial court for further proceedings.
ofelia marroquin died from a pulmonary embolism following surgery.her daughter,maria gomez,individually and as representative of her mother estate,sued the hospital and the treating physician,samuel garcia.gomez asserted that her mother had a history of blood clots and that garcia had not taken proper precautions to guard against the embolism that caused her death.specifically,she argues that the standard of care required the doctor to install a blood filter as a preventive measure.
medical records obtained from garcia failed to indicate that he had placed such a filter in her mother chest cavity during surgery.after filing suit,however,gomez obtained additional medical records from the hospital,which revealed that a filter had in fact been placed in her mother chest cavity apparently during some earlier procedure.this new information apparently caused gomez not to serve expert reports.
after the deadline for serving these reports,garcia moved to dismiss gomez claim.gomez did not oppose the dismissal,although she did contest garcia right to attorney fees,arguing that garcia had in a sense brought the suit on himself by failing to produce the medical records confirming the existence of the blood filter.after a hearing,the trial court granted the physician motion in part,dismissing the health care liability claim with prejudice,while denying him attorney fees garcia appeals complaining that he is entitled to an award of attorney fees.
garcia evidence on attorney fees came from his counsel,who testified as follows 
my name is ronald hole.i an attorney practicing in hidalgo county,doing.i have done it since.for a usual and customary case like this these fees for handling it up to the point of dismissal,the reasonable and necessary attorney fees for handling that is dollars.
if the case is appealed to the court of appeals,the reasonable fee for handling the matter at the court of appeals would be dollars.if a petition for review is filed at the supreme court,an additional fee of dollars would be reasonable for handling the matter of the petition for review and our brief or briefs on the merit.petition granted by the supreme court then adds an additional dollars.that would be a reasonable fee for handling the matter at that stage.
in affirming the trial court judgment,the court of appeals concluded that this testimony was conclusory and therefore no evidence of the reasonable attorney fees incurred by garcia.at.the court further concluded that the attorney testimony was insufficient because it failed to establish that the physician actually incurred attorney fees,which the court described as an essential statutory element.id.
an attorney testimony about the reasonableness of his or her own fees is not like other expert witness testimony.although rooted in the attorney experience and expertise,it also consists of the attorney personal knowledge about the underlying work and its particular value to the client.the testimony is similar to that of a property owner whose personal knowledge qualifies him to give an opinion about his own property value.see,state cent.expressway sign,gulf states utils.low.the attorney testimony is not objectionable as merely conclusory because the opposing party,or that party attorney,likewise has some knowledge of the time and effort involved and if the matter is truly in dispute,may effectively question the attorney regarding the reasonableness of his fee.
in this case,garcia attorney testified briefly about his experience in medical malpractice litigation.he then estimated to be a reasonable and necessary fee for representation through dismissal in a case like this one.finally,he testified about his fees in the event of an appeal and that such fees were also reasonable.gomez did not the witness or present any additional evidence on the issue of attorney fees.nor did she question the reasonableness of the amount of any of these fees.while the attorney testimony lacked specifics,it was not,under these circumstances,merely conclusory.it was some evidence of what a reasonable attorney fee might be in this case.
garcia argues,however,that the attorney testimony was not only some evidence of his reasonable attorney fees,but also conclusive evidence on the issue.generally,the determination of reasonable attorney fees is a question of fact and the testimony of an interested witness,such as a party to the suit,though not contradicted,does no more than raise a fact issue to be determined by the jury.smith patrick tam trust,quoting ragsdale progressive voters league.garcia argument,however,relies on an exception to this general rule,that is,where the testimony of an interested witness is not contradicted by any other witness,or attendant circumstances,and the same is clear,direct and positive,and free from contradiction,inaccuracies,and circumstances tending to cast suspicion thereon,it is taken as true,as a matter of law.ragsdale,at quoting cochran wool growers cent.storage.because gomez had the means and opportunity to contest the attorney testimony on what a reasonable attorney fee would be in this case,but failed to do so,garcia concludes that reasonableness was established as a matter of law.
while we agree that garcia attorney testimony is some evidence of a reasonable fee,it is not conclusive.the statute here provides that the trial court is to award reasonable attorney fees and costs of court incurred by the physician or health care provider when the claimant fails to serve an expert report within days of filing suit.civ.prac.b emphasis added.under the statute,the fees awarded must be both reasonable and incurred.id.b.a reasonable fee is one that is not excessive or extreme,but rather moderate or fair a fee is incurred when one becomes liable for it 
both the adjective reasonable and the verb incurred act to limit the amount of attorney fees the trial court may award.ideally,they will be the same,such as when the physician has agreed to pay reasonable fees and costs.but a physician may negotiate a fee that is either more or less than a reasonable fee and thus incur,or become liable for,a greater or lesser amount.the statute,however,limits the award to the lesser of the two,that is,the fee to be awarded is the lesser of a reasonable fee or the fee actually incurred.testimony about reasonable fees then is not necessarily evidence about the fees incurred.
although there is no evidence of the amount of the fees incurred by garcia,the court of appeals goes further to conclude there is no evidence that garcia actually incurred attorney fees at all.the record reflects,however,that services were performed on the doctor behalf.the attorney filed an answer,a plea in abatement,a motion to dismiss,and a notice of appeal.the attorney also appeared,argued,and gave testimony regarding the motion to dismiss.while there is no evidence about what garcia or perhaps his insurance carrier agreed to pay for these services,it blinks reality to assume that the attorney was a volunteer or that garcia did not incur attorney fees for this work.as we recently held in another case involving this statute,a defendant incurs attorney fees when he is personally liable in the first instance for both defense costs and any potential judgment.aviles aguirre,per curiam.
section b requires the award of the reasonable attorney fees incurred by a physician who is not served with a timely expert report.because there is some evidence in this case that attorney fees were both incurred and reasonable,the trial court should have awarded attorney fees to garcia.the court of appeals therefore erred in affirming that part of the trial court judgment.
gomez argues,however,that garcia should nevertheless be denied attorney fees because he failed to produce the appropriate medical records in a timely manner.pertinent to this argument is section d of the texas medical liability act,which provides that all parties are entitled to obtain complete and unaltered copies of the patient medical records from any other party within days from the date of a written request for such records.civ.prac.d.this provision is part of the section requiring notice of a health care liability claim.id.its purpose is to encourage negotiations and settlement and thereby reduce litigation costs.see de checa diagnostic ctr,interpreting similar provision in statute predecessor.gomez contends garcia waived his right to recover his attorney fees because he was slow to produce medical records and ultimately failed to produce the critical records which indicated that the blood filter was indeed in place during her mother surgery.gomez argument assumes that garcia withheld relevant medical records,but the record in this case does not support that assumption.
gomez pleadings asserted that garcia was negligent in not prevent ing the formation of a pulmonary embolism by appropriate means,but the pleadings did not expressly mention the critical blood filter.even assuming the physician understood the filter significance to gomez case,it is not apparent why he would have concealed this exculpatory information.instead,garcia maintains that he produced all relevant medical records in his possession.moreover,the hospital ultimately produced the records confirming the filter existence as part of its medical records.nothing in the record suggests that garcia records also contained this information or that he withheld the information.gomez fails to explain why she did not seek or obtain these records from the hospital during the notice period or why it was garcia responsibility to obtain them for her.although we can imagine a case in which discovery sanctions might offset an award of fees and costs under section b,this is not such a case because the trial court has made no finding of discovery abuse.
section b of the texas medical liability act requires the award of reasonable attorney fees incurred by a physician in defense of a health care liability claim when expert reports are not timely served.because there was some evidence of these fees,the trial court erred in failing to make an award,and the court of appeals erred in affirming that part of the trial court judgment.accordingly we reverse the court of appeals judgment,in part,and remand the physician attorney fees claim to the trial court for further proceedings.the remainder of the court of appeals judgment is affirmed.
in a health care liability case,a plaintiff must serve an expert report on a defendant physician within days of filing suit.see.civ.prac.a.if a claimant fails to serve a report,the physician may move to dismiss the claim and recover attorney fees.specifically,the statute provides 
if an expert report has not been served the court,on the motion of the affected physician or health care provider,shall enter an order that 
awards to the affected physician or health care provider reasonable attorney fees and costs of court incurred by the physician or health care provider and 
dismisses the claim with respect to the physician or health care provider,with prejudice to the refiling of the claim.
civ.prac.b emphasis added.notably,the statute requires the trial court to award fees that are both reasonable and incurred.id.today,however,the court concludes that section b mandates a fee award even though the defendant introduced no evidence of fees incurred.for this reason,i respectfully dissent.
the court has previously stated,and emphasizes again today,that if a timely and sufficient expert report is not served,a trial court must dismiss the case and award fees on motion by the affected physician or health care provider.see at s ection b mandates an award of attorney fees and costs,when expert reports are not served timely see also hernandez ebrom,if a timely and sufficient report is not served,the trial court must award the provider its attorney fees and costs and dismiss the case with prejudice.bocquet herring,statutes providing that a party may recover,shall be awarded,or is entitled to attorney fees are not discretionary.but even a mandatory fee award must have evidentiary support.bocquet,at.
section b requires proof of reasonable fees and evidence of the fees incurred.see.civ.prac.b see also at under the statute,the fees awarded must be both reasonable and incurred.here,the only evidence concerning fees came from garcia attorney,who stated the following 
my name is ronald hole.i an attorney practicing in hidalgo county,doing.i have done it since.for a usual and customary case like this these fees for handling it up to the point of dismissal,the reasonable and necessary attorneys fees for handling that is dollars.if the case is appealed,reasonable fees up to this point is.if the case is appealed to the court of appeals,a reasonable fee for handling the matter at the court of appeals would be dollars.if a petion sic for review is filed at the supreme court,an additional fee of dollars would be reasonable for handling the matter of the petition for review and our brief or briefs on the merit.petition granted by the supreme court then adds an additional dollars.that would be a reasonable fee for handling the matter at that stage.
i am surprised that the court ignores the gap in hole testimony nowhere does he state an amount of fees actually charged.there is no mention of the amount of time he spent on this case or even his hourly rate see brockie webb,pet.denied generally,the nature and extent of the attorney services are expressed by the number of hours and the hourly rate.the trial court was presented,instead,with a statement that is a reasonable and necessary fee for a usual and customary case like this.in no other area of the law would we credit such a statement as evidence,whether an objection is made or not.
testimony that a fee is reasonable,without saying it was ever charged,is useless.what if garcia incurred only in fees,even though a typical case like this would involve would the trial court have the discretion to award see daughters of charity health servs.of waco linnstaedter,indicating that the court favored a theory of jurisprudence that avoided a windfall to the injured party.this is why the statute requires evidence that attorney fees were both reasonable and incurred.
the court holds that there is some evidence in this case that attorney fees were both incurred and reasonable.at.the court gives two reasons for that conclusion.first,the record reflects that garcia had an attorney and that he filed pleadings on garcia behalf.no one disputes that garcia was represented the question is the amount of fees he incurred.his lawyer did not answer that question.we should not give garcia a second chance to satisfy his burden of proof.
next,the court relies on our recent decision in aviles aguirre,per curiam however,such reliance is misplaced.in aviles,we addressed whether a defendant physician incurred fees under section b,even though an insurance carrier paid the physician fees.aviles,at.we said that the statute did not require as proof that fees were incurred that the physician personally paid the fees.id.the physician incurred fees when he first became liable
