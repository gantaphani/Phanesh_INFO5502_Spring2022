we are called upon to consider,for a second time,defendant larry garcia use of horphag research ltd horphag trademark pycnogenol.in a previous appeal,we affirmed the district court grant of judgment as a matter of law on horphag trademark infringement claims.see horphag research pellegrini,cir.we vacated the district court order on horphag trademark dilution claim and asked the district court to reconsider its decision in light of the supreme court opinion in moseley v secret catalogue,d.on remand,the district court granted horphag motion for summary judgment on its trademark dilution claim and reinstated its original attorneys fees award.defendant larry garcia,appealing in pro per,again challenges the district court grant of summary judgment on horphag trademark dilution claim and the corresponding attorneys fees award.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm the district court.
factual and procedural background 
the facts of this case are largely the same as those upon which we based our previous opinion,and we recount them only in brief detail here.in,jack masquelier,a french professor of pharmacology,discovered a chemical antioxidant substance made from the bark of a french maritime pine tree.the substance supposedly assists in nutritional distribution and proper circulation.around,masquelier brought the product to market under the name pycnogenol.masquelier received the trademark in france for the mark pycnogenol in.
around,horphag began selling the pine bark extract outside of france under contractual relationship with masquelier.thereafter,things between horphag and masquelier went sour,and the two parties dissolved their relationship.in,horphag was granted the united states trademark for the mark pycnogenol since then,horphag has made extensive efforts to control the quality of pycnogenol and has invested heavily in research and marketing its product.pycnogenol is now one of the fifteen most sold herbal supplements in the united states.horphag has not authorized any other entity to use its mark.
garcia was once a licensed dealer for horphag and sold horphag products through his internet site.in february,garcia stopped distributing products manufactured by horphag and began selling products manufactured by masquelier.one of the products garcia sells is masquelier original opcs,a supplement derived from grape pits that competes with horphag supplement.garcia claims that he stopped distributing for horphag after he discovered that masquelier product,rather than horphag product,was the true pycnogenol.
horphag contends that garcia used the mark pycnogenol as a bait and switch to induce customers to purchase his product,masquelier original opc.garcia used the term pycnogenol as a metatag to lure customers to his website.once at the website,consumers could find information designed to educate prospective users about the debate over the rightful ownership of the pycnogenol patent and trademark.other parts of garcia website,however,were more problematic.
in several places,garcia used the term pycnogenol as a generic term,referring to both horphag product and masquelier product as pycnogenol.garcia attributes the results of research conducted on horphag pycnogenol to masquelier product.for example,garcia website describes masquelier opc as a patented peak performance nutrient among the best new weapons to maintain overall good health for longer and longer periods of time.on the safety factor section of garcia website,garcia states pycnogenol studies carried out at the pasteur institute in lyon,france,have shown it to be nontoxic to humans pycnogenol should be viewed as a completely safe nutrient.both of these statements are direct quotes from steven lamm and gerald secor couzens book,younger at last,which makes explicit that the health and safety benefits to which it is referring attach to horphag product.indeed,lamm and couzens warn consumers not to purchase pycnogenol imitators not manufactured by horphag.
garcia website also contains quotations from scientific literature discussing horphag pycnogenol that were altered to make them appear as though the quotes were discussing masquelier product.for instance,garcia altered a quotation taken from richard passwater book,pycnogenol the super protector nutrient.on garcia website,the quotation reads masquelier original opc has not only withstood the test of time since it was extensively tested before it was made available as a food supplement.but passwater book actually reads pycnogenol has not only withstood the test of time,it was extensively tested before it was made available as a food supplement.pycnogenol the super protector nutrient.passwater book makes clear that it intended to refer to horphag product,a fact garcia website does not acknowledge.
based on these and other alleged misuses of the pycnogenol trademark by garcia,horphag argues that garcia has lessened the capacity of pycnogenol to uniquely identify and distinguish its product,thereby diluting horphag trademark.garcia,in turn,argues that horphag suit is merely an attempt to stifle the debate on the true origins of pycnogenol.
on june,horphag sued garcia alleging trademark infringement,false designation of origin,and trademark dilution under federal law,as well as trademark dilution and unfair competition under california law.on july,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of garcia on horphag claim of false designation of origin.the district court also denied horphag request for a preliminary injunction.a jury trial was held on the remaining claims from july through.
after both sides rested their cases on july,but before the case was submitted to the jury,the district court granted horphag motion for judgment as a matter of law under federal rule of civil procedure b on both its trademark dilution claim and infringement claim.the district court held that garcia infringed and unlawfully diluted horphag trademark pycnogenol and awarded attorneys fees to horphag in its judgment on august.garcia appealed the judgment as a matter of law and the award of attorneys fees.
on july,this court issued an amended opinion affirming the district court summary judgment in favor of horphag on its trademark infringement claim.see horphag research,at.we vacated the judgment on horphag trademark dilution and remanded it for reconsideration of the claim in light of moseley v secret catalogue,d,which altered the showing of dilution required for an claim.see id.at.we also directed the lower court to reconsider the portion of the attorneys fees analysis that related to the dilution claim.see id.at.
on november,horphag filed a motion for summary judgment with respect to its dilution claim horphag argued that evidence already admitted at trial conclusively proved that garcia actually diluted its trademark.on january,the district court granted horphag motion for summary judgment.it concluded that none of garcia purported material questions of fact were relevant and that horphag was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.the court also reinstated the award of attorneys fees.garcia appealed 
ii.standard of review 
a grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo.see buono norton,cir.in reviewing an order granting summary judgment,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor.see hernandez hughes missile,cir.we must determine whether there are genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.see olsen idaho state bd.of,cir.the moving party bears the initial burden to demonstrate the absence of any genuine issue of material fact.see,pac.contractors ass n,cir.once the moving party meets its initial burden,however,the burden shifts to the party to set forth,by affidavit or as otherwise provided in rule,specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.id.citing.e emphasis omitted.in reviewing an order granting summary judgment,this court may not weigh the evidence or pass on the credibility of witnesses but is instead limited to determining whether there is any genuine issue for trial.see mot
