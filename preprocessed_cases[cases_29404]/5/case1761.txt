introduction 
code of civil procedure section section provides that if a plaintiff does not accept a defendant pretrial settlement offer and then fails to obtain a more favorable judgment at trial,the defendant may recover its costs incurred after the settlement offer.here,staar surgical company staar made two separate pretrial offers to settle one star claims against it,but withdrew the second settlement offer before its statutory expiration.one star did not accept either offer,and ultimately recovered less at trial than either of staar pretrial offers.the present appeal thus presents the following issue if a defendant makes two separate pretrial settlement offers but withdraws the second offer,against which offer,if either,is the ultimate judgment measured for purposes of section provisions 
we conclude,contrary to the trial court,that where a defendant withdraws a second section settlement offer,the plaintiff recovery must be measured against the defendant first settlement offer for section purposes.thus,we reverse the judgment with directions to the trial court to calculate the postoffer costs to which staar is entitled.
procedural history 
i.the pleadings 
staar manufactures and sells medical products and devices.one star is a regional representative for medical equipment and supply companies,and it formerly represented staar.
on november,one star filed a complaint against staar for breach of contract,intentional interference with contractual relations,intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,misappropriation of trade secrets,and unfair competition.the complaint alleged that staar improperly withheld one star commissions and solicited one star employees and independent contractors.staar filed a for breach of contract against one star and james greiling,one star principal,on april.
the trial court dismissed several of one star claims prior to trial.thus,at trial one star pursued only two claims breach of written contract for wrongfully deducting consulting fees from one star commissions from august to december,and common counts for services performed from january,to the date of trial.staar pursued its for breach of written contract.
ii.staar section offers to compromise 
on september,staar made a statutory offer to compromise pursuant to section.staar offered to allow judgment to be taken against staar and in favor of one star in the amount of sixty five thousand dollars.one star did not accept the offer,and it lapsed by operation of law days later,subd.b.
staar made a second offer to compromise captioned code of civil procedure section second offer to compromise on december.staar offered to allow judgment to be taken against staar and in favor of one star in the amount of sixty five thousand dollars,including the legal applicable rate of interest,commencing from october.while that offer was pending,staar made a third offer to compromise captioned code of civil procedure section offer to compromise by complainant on on december,offering to allow judgment to be taken against and an award entered in favor of on the in the amount of sixty five thousand dollars,including the legal applicable rate of interest,commencing from october.
one star did not accept either the second or third offer to compromise.on december,staar withdrew its second offer.
the case was tried to the court.the court found that staar was authorized to subtract consulting fees from one star commissions,and thus it denied one star claim for breach of written contract.however,it found that one star was entitled to recover some unpaid commissions,and it awarded one star on its common counts.as to staar,the court found that staar had failed to establish breach of contract or damages.
iv.the motions for attorney fees and costs 
staar moved for prevailing party attorney fees and costs pursuant to civil code section and,in the alternative,for postsettlement offer costs pursuant to section.one star opposed the motion,urging that staar did not prevail on the contract causes of action within the meaning of civil code section staar section offers were irrelevant because the first offer was extinguished by the withdrawn and therefore ineffectual second offer and the fees staar sought were patently excessive.one star and greiling also filed their own motion for attorney fees and costs,urging that they were the prevailing parties because they achieved greater relief.
the court granted one star and greiling motion for fees and costs and denied staar.it found as follows one star was the prevailing party in the action and thus was entitled to its costs under code of civil procedure section.as between staar and one star,neither one star nor staar prevailed on its contract claims,and thus neither was entitled to attorney fees under civil code section.as between staar and greiling,greiling had prevailed on staar breach of contract claim,and thus greiling was entitled to recover his attorney fees pursuant to civil code section.staar was not entitled to recover any of its costs pursuant to section.with regard to the section issue,the court explained a second offer extinguishes a prior offer even if the subsequent offer is invalid.once a second offer is made,the prior offer is extinguished.palmer schindler elevator th,d.a later offer under extinguishes any earlier offers,regardless of the validity of the offer.staar argues that palmer is not applicable because,in this case,the first offer had expired before the second offer was made.wilson stores,th,d effectively undercuts staar argument.in wilson the court found that a second offer extinguished a first offer that had expired over a year before the second offer was made.in this case,there was a third offer made in which staar agreed to accept from one star to compromise the complaint.thus,one star obtained a better result at trial,and is therefore entitled to all of its costs.
the court entered judgment on october,as follows judgment shall be entered in favor of one star,and against staar,in the total amount of which includes costs in the amount of plus interest from and after the date of entry of judgment at the legal rate of per annum,pursuant to code of civil procedure section a.this relief is awarded under one star cause of action for unjust enrichment in the complaint the court ruled in favor of staar,and against one star,on one star causes of action for breach of written contract and accounting in the complaint judgment shall be entered in favor of one star and greiling,and against staar,on staar sole cause of action for breach of written contract in the one star shall recover its costs pursuant to code of civil procedure sections a and in the amount of as a prevailing party because one star received the greater relief and a net monetary award as between one star and staar however,one star is not entitled to attorneys fees as an item of costs greiling shall recover his costs pursuant to code of civil procedure sections a and and civil code section in the amount of including attorneys fees in the amount of as an item of costs plus interest from and after the date of entry of judgment at the legal rate of per annum,pursuant to code of civil procedure section a and staar is not entitled to recover its attorneys fees and costs pursuant to either a civil code section and code of civil procedure sections,or b code of civil procedure section.
staar filed a notice of appeal from the judgment on november.
discussion 
although staar appealed from the judgment generally,it asserts error only as to the trial court denial of its request for attorney fees and costs incurred after one star rejected its first section offer.specifically,staar contends that the trial court erred in denying its request for attorney fees and costs because its first section offer which it characterizes as the completed offer exceeded one star recovery at trial the instant appeal thus presents the following issue whether the trial court properly found that staar second offer to compromise extinguished the first offer,or whether staar is correct that its first offer to compromise remained relevant for section purposes after staar withdrew its second offer.staar contention presents an issue of statutory interpretation that we review de novo.steinfeld proctologic medical group,th,d.
section provides that not less than days prior to trial,any party may serve an offer in writing upon any other party to the action to allow judgment to be taken or an award to be entered in accordance with the terms and conditions stated,subd.b.if the offer is accepted,the court shall enter judgment accordingly,subd.b.if the offer is not accepted prior to trial or within days after it is made,whichever occurs first,it shall be deemed withdrawn,subd.b.
if a plaintiff does not accept defendant offer and fails to obtain a more favorable judgment,plaintiff shall not recover his or her postoffer costs and shall pay the defendant costs from the time of the offer,subd.c.in that case,defendant recoverable costs shall be deducted from any damages awarded in favor of the plaintiff,subd.e.
the very essence of section is its encouragement of settlement.scott blount,supra,cal th,d,mangano verity,th,d.thus,to encourage both the making and the acceptance of reasonable settlement offers,a losing defendant whose settlement offer exceeds the judgment is treated for purposes of postoffer costs as if it were the prevailing party.scott blount,supra,cal th at,d.in construing section,we follow the fundamental rule of statutory construction that the court should ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citations.citations.wilson stores,supra,th,d.
b ecause section involves the process of settlement and compromise and,since this process is a contractual one,it is appropriate for contract law principles to govern the offer and acceptance process under section.citations.wilson stores,supra,th at,d.however,general contract principles should be invoked in applying section only where such principles neither conflict with the statute nor defeat its purpose,which purpose is the encouragement of pretrial settlements.ibid.
ii.revocability of section settlement offers 
section is completely silent as to the revocability or irrevocability of offers made pursuant to that section.cobb,superior court cal d.nonetheless,our supreme court has held that section offers are fully revocable prior to acceptance.ibid.the court explained it is a principle of contract law that an offer may be revoked by the offeror any time prior to acceptance.citations.in light of this firmly established principle of contract law,it is clear that if the legislature intended to make section offers irrevocable,it would have expressly and unequivocally said so.fn.omitted.it did not.id.at.further,the court said,interpreting section to permit revocation of offers prior to acceptance is consistent with the policy of encouraging settlements.a party is more likely to make an offer pursuant to section if that party knows that the offer may be revised if circumstances change or new evidence develops.conversely,a party who knows that he or she is strictly bound to the terms of the first offer made may be reluctant to make such an offer for fear of being locked into a position which becomes unfavorable upon the discovery of additional information.if a party is more likely to make a revocable offer,and less likely to make an irrevocable one,then more offers will be made if revocation is permitted.the more offers that are made,the more likely the chance for settlement.thus,it is apparent that the general contract law principle that offers are revocable until accepted serves rather than defeats the statutory purpose of encouraging settlements.id.at.
the court noted that its determination that section offers are revocable also promotes the public policy of compensating injured parties.it explained this policy would be frustrated if section offers were irrevocable.as previously noted,newly discovered evidence may indicate that a certain defendant is more or less culpable than originally thought.it might also indicate that a plaintiff is more seriously injured than appeared from the initial evidence.under such circumstances,an offer made prior to the discovery of the additional evidence might no longer be adequate to fairly compensate a plaintiff.if the offer is irrevocable,an injured would be bound to an offer which will not compensate him or her fairly.however,if the offer may be revoked,the offeror can either propose a new offer in light of the newly discovered evidence or proceed to trial and present all the evidence in an attempt to be compensated fairly by the trier of fact decision.thus,the public policy of compensating an injured party is best served if section offers are revocable.cobb,superior court,supra,cal d at,see also brown labow th,d once a code of civil procedure section statutory settlement offer is made,it is subject to revocation.
although a section offer may be revoked before it is accepted,if it is revoked prior to the expiration of the statutory period,it no longer functions as an offer for purposes of the cost benefits of section.marina glencoe,neue sentimental film ag th,d see also cobb superior court,supra,cal d at,fn,it should be apparent that an offer that is revoked prior to acceptance no longer functions as an offer for purposes of the cost benefit provisions.marcey romero th,d we agree with the cobb court observation that an offer revoked before the expiration of the period statutorily specified by section forfeits its status as an offer under the remaining provisions of section.peterson john crane,th,fn,d the second section offer extinguished the first.according to one court t he statute appears to contemplate the offeree has a statutorily prescribed window of opportunity within which to weigh the consequences and make an election however,when the offeror unilaterally revokes the offer,the offeror deprives the offeree of the principal benefit and protection afforded to the offeree by the statute,the legislatively prescribed period to weigh the risks and select between the two options.under these circumstances,an offeror should not be entitled to reap the full benefits afforded by the statute after diminishing the benefits afforded to the offeree by the statute.marcey romero,supra,th at,d.
iii.multiple section settlement offers 
no case has considered the question presented by the present appeal the effect of a withdrawn section settlement offer on earlier offers.however,two cases cited by the trial stores,supra,th,d,and palmer schindler elevator,supra,th,d whether,in circumstances different from those presented by the instant case,a subsequent section offer to settle supersedes a prior one.
in wilson stores,supra,th,d,the court held that in most circumstances,a second section offer supersedes a first offer for purposes of the provisions of the statute.there,the plaintiff served an initial offer to compromise for a year later,she made a second offer,for.id.at,d.the defendant rejected both offers,and a jury awarded the plaintiff.ibid.the plaintiff then sought prejudgment interest pursuant to section and civil code section from the date of the first settlement offer,urging that,consistent with the statutory purposes of section,the first offer should control.the court disagreed.it concluded that the interpretation urged by the plaintiff would not necessarily encourage pretrial settlement the factual situation before us is a good example.a plaintiff might be encouraged to maintain a higher settlement demand on the eve of trial and refuse to settle a case that should otherwise be settled if the plaintiff finds comfort in the knowledge that,even if the plaintiff receives an award less than his or her last demand,the plaintiff might still enjoy the cost reimbursement benefits of section so long as the award exceeded a lower demand made by the plaintiff sometime during the course of the litigation.the reverse might be true of the defendant.rolling the dice then becomes somewhat less risky and we note that lawsuits are not often settled by reducing the risk of trial.id.at,d.
further,the court said,there is some dissembling in plaintiff argument that we are reluctant to endorse.on the eve of trial she was unwilling to save the p
