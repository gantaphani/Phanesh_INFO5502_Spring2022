this appeal from the bankruptcy appellate panel bap presents challenges to sanctions imposed by the northern district of california,san francisco division,of the bankruptcy court on appellants arlo hale smith and daniel miller.the were largely sustained by the based on appellants misconduct in improperly invoking the processes of the bankruptcy court to block the progress of a state court civil action in which smith was counsel for the defendants,one of whom was miller.the obstructionist techniques employed by smith and miller involved a series of bankruptcy filings and concurrent removal petitions from the state court to the bankruptcy court on behalf of certain of the removal delaying trial in the state court until the granting of a remand petition.
on appeal,smith and miller challenge the procedures followed by the bankruptcy court in imposing sanctions.they do not take serious issue with the bankruptcy court findings of misconduct.
facts and proceedings in the bankruptcy court 
the opinion of the bap describes the preposterous misconduct of smith and miller and the proceedings in the bankruptcy court in meticulous detail.rather than undertaking to restate that carefully crafted narrative,we simply refer the reader to it.miller cardinale in re deville,cir.bap.we find it accurate in all respects.
in response to the bankruptcy filings and attempts to remove the cardinale suit from state court,the san francisco bankruptcy court sua sponte issued two orders to show cause one to smith in the deville and daggett bankruptcies,and a second to smith and miller in the miller bankruptcy.
after a hearing on the oscs,the bankruptcy court concluded that 
smith orchestrated the serial bankruptcy filings and removals of the action by the defendants one by one,and those actions were spread out so as to maximize the delay,cost and harassment to plaintiff.
smith removals in the deville and daggett bankruptcies,his participation in miller second removal in the daggett bankruptcy,his intentional misstatements on miller bankruptcy petition,and his orchestration of serial bankruptcy filings and removals by the defendants were all part of a scheme to cause unnecessary delay,harass plaintiff and needlessly increase plaintiff litigation costs.
mem.decision,at.
turning to miller behavior,the bankruptcy court found that miller was significantly more than an innocent actor in the bankruptcy filing and the efforts to remove the cardinale suit.id.at.the court reviewed miller attempt to remove cardinale suit to daggett bankruptcy case and indicated that his actions were taken without any legitimate purpose beyond stalling the litigation.id.at.the court ruled that,while smith was the driving force,miller was a knowing participant in a larger scheme of serial bankruptcies and removals by the defendants,one by one,all designed to cause unnecessary delay,needlessly increase plaintiff litigation costs,and harass plaintiff.id.
the bankruptcy court discussion of sanctions contemplated that an award to cardinale of additional attorney fees incurred by cardinale in consequence of the misconduct would be an appropriate initial step.id.at.the court took as its point of departure the declaration by thomas eastridge,cardinale attorney,accompanying cardinale july,revised second remand motion,which reported that cardinale had to that date been required by the misconduct to expend an additional in attorney fees.id.at.the court reduced that figure to.id.at.but the court reasoned that limiting the sanctions to an award of the expenses actually incurred by cardinale would not be a sufficient deterrent 
i f awarding attorneys fees were the only sanction it would likely cost smith client sic substantially less than defending themselves at trial.therefore,absent a greater sanction there is a danger that smith tactics would appear to be a means to delay or avoid trial.
id.at.thus,the court december,memorandum decision provided as follows 
t his court will award a total of hours,at per hour,for a subtotal of in attorneys fees against smith.this court will award additional sanctions against smith equal to of that amount,or,for a total of.miller will be jointly and severally liable with smith for all of the base amount of attorneys fees and another of that amount,for a total of.
pursuant to the bankruptcy court instructions,thomas eastridge,on cardinale behalf,filed a supplemental declaration for expenses incurred subsequent to his july,declaration.the supplemental declaration reported in additional fees and in costs.supp,at.the court,in an april,supplemental memorandum decision,accepted eastridge costs figure,but scaled the fees back to 
smith and miller shall be liable for the entire base amount of plaintiff additional fees and costs,for a of,plus the joint and several sanctions of for a total award of against smith and miller,jointly and severally.
in addition,as against smith only,the court will award an additional amount by applying a multiplier of to plaintiff additional fees,for an additional of,plus the sanctions of against smith only,for a total of 
taken together,the bankruptcy court memorandum decisions of december,and april,brought about the following results 
thus smith aggregate liability came to the sum of and,and of that sum miller was jointly liable for.all of the sums awarded were to be paid to cardinale.of the aggregate figure of,represented what the bankruptcy court calculated was proper compensation to cardinale for her reasonable attorney fees and costs for the first compensatory award,plus for the supplementary compensatory award,and the balance of constituted what the bankruptcy court deemed a proper deterrent sanction.
in its april,supplemental memorandum decision,the bankruptcy court cited three sources of authority for the sanctions imposed first,federal rule of bankruptcy procedure second,the court inherent authority and,third,id.at.the court found that smith and miller acted with subjective bad faith.id.at.the sanction,the court stated,was not punitive,but was instead intended to compensate plaintiff and to deter smith and miller from continuing their pattern of misconduct.id.at.smith and miller then appealed to the bap.
the bankruptcy appellate panel decision 
the bap first addressed the question of whether the bankruptcy court award to cardinale was a proper exercise of the court authority under bankruptcy rule.rule b imposes on attorneys,and also on unrepresented parties,the obligation to insure that all submissions to a bankruptcy court are truthful and for proper litigation purposes.of particular pertinence to the case at bar is rule b 
b representations to the court.by presenting to the court whether by signing,filing,submitting,or later advocating a petition,pleading,written motion,or other paper,an attorney or unrepresented party is certifying that to the best of the person knowledge,information,and belief,formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances,
it is not being presented for any improper purpose,such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation 
rule c invests a bankruptcy court with authority to impose sanctions on persons who violate rule b 
c sanctions.if,after notice and a reasonable opportunity to respond,the court determines that subdivision b has been violated,the court may,subject to the conditions stated below,impose an appropriate sanction upon the attorneys,law firms,or parties that have violated subdivision b or are responsible for the violation.
how initiated.
a by motion.a motion for sanctions under this rule shall be made separately from other motions or requests and shall describe the specific conduct alleged to violate subdivision b 
b on court initiative.on its own initiative,the court may enter an order describing the specific conduct that appears to violate subdivision b and directing an attorney,law firm,or party to show cause why it has not violated subdivision b with respect thereto.
nature of sanction limitations.a sanction imposed for violation of this rule shall be limited to what is sufficient to deter repetition of such conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated.subject to the limitations in subparagraphs a and b,the sanction may consist of,or include,directives of a nonmonetary nature,an order to pay a penalty into court,or,if imposed on motion and warranted for effective deterrence,an order directing payment to the movant of some or all of the reasonable attorneys fees and other expenses incurred as a direct result of the violation.
the bap found that the bankruptcy court order making an award to cardinale was not in conformity with rule c.as the text of the rule makes clear,an award to an adverse party of reasonable attorneys fees and other expenses can only be made pursuant to a motion by that party.the bankruptcy court had treated,as the requisite motion,the initial declaration of eastridge on july,reciting the expenditure by his client cardinale of reduced by the bankruptcy court to in attorney fees in consequence of the asserted misconduct.but the bap concluded that the eastridge declaration did not constitute a motion within the meaning of the rule.accordingly,the bap ruled that,since the bankruptcy court had ordered that the award be paid to cardinale,rule was not adequate support for the award.
the bap then turned its attention to the bankruptcy court invocation of its inherent power as an alternate authority for the compensatory award of attorney fees and costs.deville,at.in addressing the proper exercise of inherent power,the bap considered the supreme court discussion of inherent power in chambers nasco,d.in chambers the court explor ed the scope of the inherent power of a federal court to sanction a litigant for conduct.id.at.the chambers court observed that 
a court may assess attorney fees when a party has acted in bad faith,vexatiously,wantonly,or for oppressive reasons.alyeska pipeline serv.wilderness soc y,d quoting rich united states ex rel.industrial lumber,d.see also hall cole,d newman piggie park enterprises,d per curiam.in this regard,if a court finds that fraud has been practiced upon it,or that the very temple of justice has been defiled,it may assess attorney fees against the responsible party,universal oil products root refining,as it may when a party shows bad faith by delaying or disrupting the litigation or by hampering enforcement of a court order,hutto finney,d.the imposition of sanctions in this instance transcends a court equitable power concerning relations between the parties and reaches a court inherent power to police itself,thus serving the dual purpose of vindicating judicial authority without resort to the more drastic sanctions available for contempt of court and making the prevailing party whole for expenses caused by his opponent obstinacy.ibid.
id.at.footnote omitted.
the chambers court was at pains to point out that the fact that certain statutes and rules of procedure authorize the imposition of sanctions does not foreclose a court invocation of its inherent sanctioning authority when that appears to be the better instrument 
there is nothing in the other sanctioning mechanisms or prior cases interpreting them that warrants a conclusion that a federal court may not,as a matter of law,resort to its inherent power to impose attorney fees as a sanction for conduct.this is plainly the case where the conduct at issue is not covered by one of the other sanctioning provisions.but neither is a federal court forbidden to sanction conduct by means of the inherent power simply because that conduct could also be sanctioned under the statute or the rules.a court must,of course,exercise caution in invoking its inherent power,and it must comply with the mandates of due process,both in determining that the requisite bad faith exists and in assessing fees,see roadway express,piper,d.furthermore,when there is conduct in the course of litigation that could be adequately sanctioned under the rules,the court ordinarily should rely on the rules rather than the inherent power.but if in the informed discretion of the court,neither the statute nor the rules are up to the task,the court may safely rely on its inherent power.
based on chambers,the bap came to the following conclusions with respect to the bankruptcy court invocation of its inherent power as support for the sanctions imposed 
first the bap found that the situation confronting the bankruptcy court was not one in which statutes or rules sufficed to support the compensatory portion of the,the reimbursing cardinale for attorney fees and costs 
this is a situation in which neither a statute nor the rules of procedure are up to the task.federal rule of bankruptcy procedure does not suffice because the victim did not make the requisite motion following compliance with the mandatory safe harbor and because the court may not shift attorneys fees and costs on its own motion.fed.c.
likewise,does not suffice because the ninth circuit does not regard a bankruptcy court as a court of the united states.perroton gray in re perroton,cir determan sandoval in re sandoval,cir.bap.
c allows a court discretion to grant attorneys fees and costs for an improper removal.the sanction is applicable to bankruptcy removals,but must be tied to specific removals,by virtue of the language incurred as a result of the removal.c billington winograde in re hotel lassen.on the present record this provision,while applicable,may be of limited utility in order for c to be utilized here,the bankruptcy court would need to make further findings that apply the statutory standard of incurred as a result of the removal and tie each dollar of the compensatory award to a removal,applying a analysis.such an exercise is simply unnecessary in light of the court inherent power to assess compensatory sanctions.
deville,at.
second having concluded that the bankruptcy court could properly invoke its inherent power as a basis for imposing a compensatory sanction,the bap then determined that the bankruptcy court exercise of its inherent power comported with the requirements of due process 
here,the oscs described how appellants conspired in unreasonably multiplying the proceedings,both in state court and bankruptcy court,by filing serial bankruptcy petitions and removal papers in violation of prior court orders.they also specifically addressed lack of good faith and appellants manipulation of the bankruptcy system to frustrate the state court trial.appellants were also given the opportunity to respond in writing,and to appear and testify at a hearing.
this notice satisfied due process,and placed appellants on notice that the court inherent authority was implicated.such notice enabled appellants to prepare to defend against the assertion of conspiracy to abuse the judicial and bankruptcy process.
third the bap concluded that the portion of the sanction that went beyond reimbursing cardinale for her,the deterrent aspect of the not be sustained as an exercise of the bankruptcy court inherent power.it is apparent from chambers,said the bap,that inherent authority will not suffice to support such a penalty in this instance.the award in chambers was purely compensatory.the context of the chambers rationale is that inherent power is not a manifestation of contempt power and may be determined without resort to contempt proceedings so long as the sanctions are compensatory.at.
having determined that the bankruptcy court invocation of inherent power could only sustain the compensatory portion of its sanctioning award,the bap then turned again to rule to determine whether the rule provided proper support for the deterrent portion of the award.the bap observed that a bankruptcy court is expressly authorized by rule to impose a penalty that is limited to what is sufficient to deter repetition of such conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated.fed.c.nor must such rule c penalty be awarded through contempt proceedings.id.at.further,the bap concluded that the additional sanction was not excessive,when viewed in relation to the costs to cardinale and to the court for needless litigation,and,i n addition,the sanction was appropriate to deter appellants scheme to circumvent court orders,deprive the proper division of the bankruptcy court of its jurisdiction,and abuse the bankruptcy process,all for the wrongful purpose of impeding a state court action and harassing a plaintiff.id.thus,the bap stated,the penalty was authorized and was appropriate in amount.but for one blemish,the penalty would be eligible to be affirmed.the blemish is that the rule c penalty must be paid into court.here the penalty was ordered paid to cardinale and thus can not stand as a rule c penalty.id.accordingly the bap reversed the additional penalty and remand ed this portion of the sanction award in order that the bankruptcy court may decide if it will order this penalty to be paid into the court.id.
in sum,the bap affirmed the bankruptcy court compensatory sanction reimbursing cardinale for reasonable attorney fees and costs totaling,ruling that the compensatory sanction was a proper exercise of the bankruptcy court inherent authority,and complied with due process requirements.id.but the bap set aside the penalty because it was improperly awarded to cardinale rather than to the court,remanding this aspect of the award for further consideration by the bankruptcy court.smith and miller then appealed.this court has jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions,judgments,orders and decrees of the bap.d.
standard of review 
this court independently reviews the bankruptcy court rulings on appeal from the bap.see havelock taxel in re pace,cir.because we are in as good a position as the bap to review bankruptcy court rulings,we independently examine the bankruptcy court decision,reviewing the bankruptcy court interpretation of the bankruptcy code de novo and its factual findings for clear error.united states hatton in re hatton,cir.this court reviews an award of sanctions for an abuse of discretion.see caldwell unified capital in re rainbow magazine,cir reviewing sanctions imposed under and the bankruptcy court inherent power to sanction.
discussion 
on appeal,smith and miller raise three contentions,which we will address seriatim.first,smith and miller argue that they were not afforded sufficient notice,comporting with due process,of either the particular sources of sanctioning authority relied on by the bankruptcy court,or the particular conduct they allegedly engaged in that was charged as sanctionable.second,appellants contend that the existence of statutory provisions supporting sanctions limited the bankruptcy court authority to impose sanctions via its inherent power.finally,appellants assert that they should have been afforded the protections which attach in contempt proceedings,given the bankruptcy court imposition of a penalty geared to purposes of deterrence rather than compensation.
due process 
smith and miller argue that the bankruptcy court failed to afford them notice of the particular sources of sanctioning authority,as required by due process.they point out that the bankruptcy court cited rule as the ground for imposing sanctions in its oscs,but later referred to its inherent power in its supplemental memorandum decision.smith and miller also argue that the bankruptcy court did not sufficiently inform them of what alleged conduct was charged as warranting sanctions.in advancing each of these arguments,smith and miller contend that they were denied due process of law.
ordinarily a court proposing to impose sanctions notifies the person charged both of the particular alleged misconduct and of the particular disciplinary authority under which the court is planning to proceed.a court failure to give notice of an intent to exercise inherent power may,therefore,invalidate the sanctions imposed.see nuwesra merrill lynch,fenner smith,cir.but the requirement is not an absolute one.in fellheimer,eichen braverman charter technologies,cir,the third circuit addressed a situation in which the bankruptcy court had sanctioned a law firm,invoking rule of the federal rules of civil procedure and bankruptcy rule as the authority for its action.on appeal,the district court concluded that neither of the two rules,as then written,authorized sanctions not only of the lawyer who signed an offending pleading but of the lawyer firm as well.however,the district court sustained the sanction as a proper exercise of the bankruptcy court inherent power.the third circuit affirmed,explaining its ruling in language that warrants extended quotation 
the key to fe b due process claim is the distinction between rule sanctions and inherent power these sanctions were identical in all respects,particularized notice as to one sanction would arguably suffice to fully inform fe b as to the pendency of the other sanction.rule sanctions and inherent power sanctions do,of course,differ markedly in at least one aspect pertinent to this case invocation of a federal court inherent power to sanction requires a finding of bad faith.chambers,at.landon hunt,cir.the imposition of rule sanctions,on the other hand,requires only a showing of objectively unreasonable conduct,lony du pont de nemours,cir.
we have previously held that prior to sanctioning an attorney,a court must provide the party to be sanctioned with notice of and some opportunity to respond to the charges in order to satisfy the requirements of due process.jones pittsburgh,cir citations omitted.moreover,we have stated that we think particularized notice is required to comport with due process.id.citation omitted.fe b has raised a fairly significant argument here as the bankruptcy court never indicated that it was acting under its inherent sanction power in this case.indeed,neither the motion for sanctions nor the bankruptcy court ever mentioned any ground for sanctions other than rule and bankruptcy rule.as discussed above,it was the district court that first justified the bankruptcy court conduct on the ground of the inherent power to sanction.nonetheless,we agree with the district court reasoning and we likewise find that justifying the bankruptcy court conduct on that ground does not violate fe b right to due process on the record of this case.
o ur holding is a narrow one,compelled by our finding that fe b was provided with sufficient,advance notice of exactly which conduct was alleged to be sanctionable and,furthermore,that fe b was aware that it stood accused of having acted in bad faith.
agreeing with the approach taken by the third circuit in fellheimer,we think that whether the bankruptcy court inherent power can support the attorney fees and costs portion of the sanction imposed on smith and miller depends on whether smith and miller were,like the fellheimer law firm,provided with sufficient,advance notice of exactly which conduct was alleged to be sanctionable and,furthermore were aware that they stood accused of having acted in bad faith.
to answer that question we turn again to the bankruptcy court oscs of july,and august.
the first osc focused on smith conduct.the bankruptcy court stated its belief that smith was engaging in a pattern of manipulation of the bankruptcy system in order to frustrate prosecution of the state court action initiated by plaintiff.the court also stated 
t here does not appear to be a good faith purpose for the removal since deville filing resulted in an automatic stay under a that protected him.why would a protected need to remove an action to the bankruptcy court when the plaintiff would be required to file a proof of claim here where is the jurisdiction of this court over the action against defendants smith apparently wishes to use deville chapter case to protect the other defendants he represents in this case by frustrating the repeated efforts of the contra cost a superior court to bring this matter to trial.
the second osc,which discussed the conduct of both smith and miller,described their ongoing relationship and stated 
from the foregoing history of complicity the court infers and is prepared to find that miller was well aware of the following judge jellen prior remand of the state court action from the oakland division this court july instructions to smith that he should not file any further removal petitions without prior court approval daggett dismissal from the state court action and the fact that the court has under submission sanctio
