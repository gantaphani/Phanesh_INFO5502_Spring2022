the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc seeks reversal of the district court entry of judgment as a matter of law in favor of pvnf,llc chuck daggett motors cdm on its claims of sex discrimination and retaliation under title vii of the civil rights act of,et,as well as the district court award of attorney fees to cdm.we take jurisdiction under and affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for a new trial.
background 
marla segovia was hired in as a salesperson at motors,a car dealership.when she was hired,she received a form entitled no harassment indicating that motors prohibited slurs,jokes and other verbal,graphic,or physical conduct relating to an individual sex and instructed those who felt they were being harassed to make your feelings known to your supervisor immediately.the policy provided that any matter brought to the attention of a supervisor would be thoroughly investigated,and where appropriate,disciplinary action would be taken.motors sold the dealership in to alva carter and chuck daggett.carter owned percent of the company daggett owned the remaining percent.they operated the dealership under the name chuck daggett motors cdm and daggett served as the general manager.the no harassment policy continued in full force and effect after the change in ownership.
in january,daggett promoted segovia from salesperson to finance manager.the following year,in june,he promoted her to new car sales manager,a position she held until she resigned in october of that year.at that time,roger ennis was the used car sales manager.each sales manager had supervisory authority over employees in their respective departments.segovia could hire and fire new car salespeople and ennis could hire and fire used car salespeople.each manager could also issue disciplinary notices to any subordinate employee,regardless of which department that employee worked in.
both managers pay was.segovia earned commission based on the sale of new cars ennis earned commission based on the sale of used cars.when a prospective customer had a,the managers had conflicting incentives in assessing the value of the segovia had an incentive to value the at a high price to entice the customer to buy a new car,and ennis had an incentive to value the at a low price because he could then sell the at a greater profit.this dichotomy created tension between segovia and ennis.segovia routinely made more money in commissions than ennis.indeed,in her role as new car sales manager,she was the highest paid employee at chuck daggett motors,aside from daggett himself.
evidence at trial established that carter made numerous remarks to segovia and to other female employees for example,mandi wood,who worked for cdm as a cashier,testified that when she sought a promotion from carter he responded that as a woman she should sit behind the computer and that would be more fitting for her and that as a woman,she should sit and count money.another employee,michelle reid,testified that carter commented that he could pay farmhands to work in the office for less than he paid the women.and carter told reid,who was pregnant at the time,that w omen take too much time off of work for medical reasons.they belong at home barefoot and pregnant.another time,after reid rubbed her belly,carter said,what are our customers going to think with you standing there rubbing your belly reid complained about the latter comment to joanne richmond,the office manager and systems administrator at cdm,but nothing was done because people fear ed for their job s.richmond testified that she heard carter mention that women did not belong in the workplace because of their childcare issues she also testified that carter told her he wanted to know when female applicants had children because of the child care issues.
from june to september,carter subjected segovia to similar remarks.soon after she was promoted to new car sales manager,she hired a woman salesperson for the department.carter reprimanded her,saying,i do want a whole bunch of damn women working here.men do like to work with women.men like to dicker with men.and,women bring their emotional baggage and problems to the dealership.she complained to daggett about carter comments and told him that she was thinking of reporting his behavior to the eeoc.daggett advised her to start documenting things but then said,w e never had this conversation,which segovia understood to mean that daggett would not support her in reporting carter.following this conversation,segovia continued to be subjected to remarks by carter.
during a sales managers meeting,where segovia was the only woman,carter told her that he was going to buy her a book on women in management and later explained to her that t he difference between men and women is that the women have to take more of a bitch approach.another time carter commented to segovia and two other women that mexican women nipples turn after they had babies,which segovia found offensive because her daughter is.finally,when segovia husband came into the dealership to buy a car,carter told him that he was getting a good deal because he was sleeping with segovia.
segovia was also subjected to arguably remarks by other cdm employees.in april,during an argument with a male salesperson,he reacted wildly,stood up and cleared his desk of papers and called her a bitch.he threw a plate against the wall,and then left the dealership,quitting.segovia felt threatened and scared she complained about the episode to ennis the salesperson supervisor and to daggett.rather than discipline the salesperson,ennis went to see him at the request of daggett in an effort to get him to return to the dealership because he sold a lot of cars.the salesperson returned to work the following day.he was not disciplined.
on another occasion,segovia required a used car salesperson to split the commission on a loan with a new car salesperson because both salespeople played roles in brokering the deal.when the used car salesperson learned of the split commission,he came into segovia office and violently called her a bitch.in response,segovia exercised her managerial authority and explained that because of his behavior he would not be receiving any of the commission.daggett or ennis it is unclear who overrode segovia decision,however,and awarded the entire commission to the used car salesperson.segovia testified that she was unaware of any time a male manager decision was overridden by another manager.
in september,carter summoned segovia into a conversation he was having with ennis about the wholesaling of a particular.during the conversation,ennis commented that he was tired.segovia sarcastically suggested that he go take a nap.in response,ennis flipped her off and said fuck you,bitch.segovia responded by saying i done with this conversation,and tried to walk away,but carter stopped her and said,i f you want to keep your job,you will get your butt back here and finish this conversation.she briefly returned,but then left again.she did not lose her job.
later that day segovia accessed daggett work account without his permission while doing so,she noticed that ennis had forwarded an conversation to daggett that included a discussion between ennis and jim smith,one of segovia subordinates in the sales group.in the exchange ennis had asked smith why he could not leave work to go buy beer.ennis questioned smith,marla segovia got you by the balls smith responded 
i would let that bitch hold my balls if she was the last known woman on earth.if she had balls they would be hanging lower that sic that nasty fucking skirt she is wearing.at least she wore panties today.and i know that for a fact and i was looking just walking in the front door i got to thinking about that today,every costomer sic that walked in this place today saw her nasty crotch.got ta go fucking now.
ellipsis in original.segovia then composed an to daggett acknowledging that she saw the from ennis and indicated she was offended by the exchange.segovia did not go to work the next day.when she next spoke with daggett,he said that he verbally reprimanded both ennis and smith.smith wrote segovia an stating that he was told that he had to apologize to her but that he did not understand why she ca take a joke.several days later segovia tried to complain to carter about the.he indicated that he already knew about it and that she should not let it interfere with her work you need to go back to work.that ca stop production.
approximately one month later,on october,daggett delivered to segovia an envelope containing an employee warning notice and a new pay plan.the warning advised her that she had been late to work too often.it also reported that the salespeople under her supervision had registered complaints about her unavailability,even when she was at the dealership,because she was often out of her office or conducting personal matters.no other sales managers had ever been for tardiness despite evidence that other managers were often late to work.furthermore,in the three years prior to segovia warning,no other sales managers had been for conducting personal business at work despite evidence that many of them did the warning also indicated her work was unsatisfactory,although daggett testified that when she was there,she did fine as the new car sales manager.
the new pay plan required segovia and ennis to start sharing sixty percent of their combined commissions.more specifically,sixty percent of the gross obtained from sales would be committed to a pool of funds similarly,sixty percent of the gross obtained from sales would be committed to the pool.ennis and segovia would each receive four percent of the pool,as well as four percent of the remaining forty percent of sales gross not committed to the pool.prior to the new plan,segovia and ennis did not share commissions on the combined sales of new and used cars.segovia understood the new arrangement to be a pay cut for her and a pay raise for ennis because she routinely made more money than ennis and she would now be sharing her commissions with him.daggett testified that the new pay plan was put into effect because cdm learned that it was paying its salespeople fifteen to twenty percent over the market rate and the pay plan was an effort to reduce the managers salaries,and the pooling of funds was intended to eliminate the conflict between segovia and ennis over values.the new car sales manager who ultimately replaced segovia was subject to the new pay plan.
finding the warning and the new pay plan unacceptable,segovia threw the documents on daggett desk and told him that she felt they were trying to drive her out of the dealership.she resigned as new car sales manager that day because she felt she could not be in that target position anymore.out of concern for her family financial stability,however,she later inquired as to whether there was another position she could take at the dealership.the dealership did not offer her an alternative position.
segovia filed a charge of discrimination with the eeoc on may.the eeoc filed suit against cdm on her behalf,see f,alleging retaliation and discrimination on the basis of sex under title vii of the civil rights act of,et.the eeoc also filed suit on behalf of richmond,alleging similar claims.following discovery,the eeoc voluntarily dismissed the sexual harassment claims respecting richmond.cdm then moved for summary judgment on the eeoc remaining claims.the district court granted the motion with respect to the remaining claims brought on behalf of richmond but denied the motion with respect to the claims brought on behalf of segovia.
the eeoc proceeded to trial on allegations that segovia was subject to a hostile work environment on the basis of sex,that she was subjected to other adverse employment actions on the basis of sex,and that she was constructively discharged and retaliated against for engaging in protected activity.following the eeoc presentation of evidence,the district court entered judgment as a matter of law in favor of cdm on all claims.it then awarded cdm attorney fees,concluding that the eeoc case was frivolous.this appeal followed.

discrimination on the basis of sex 
the eeoc appeals from the district court entry of judgment as a matter of law for cdm on three theories of disparate treatment under title vii segovia was subjected to a hostile work environment on the basis of sex cdm issued the employee warning notice and implemented the new pay plan as a result of discrimination on the basis of sex and cdm discriminatory conduct toward segovia amounted to constructive discharge.we conclude that the eeoc has presented a jury question with respect to whether segovia was subjected to a sexually hostile work environment.we also conclude that based on the eeoc evidence at trial,no reasonable jury could conclude that segovia was reprimanded,placed on a new pay plan,or constructively discharged on the basis of her sex.
hostile work environment 
pursuant to title vii of the civil rights act of,it is an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any individual with respect to her compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual sex.a.if a plaintiff proves that discrimination based on sex has created a hostile or abusive work environment,she has established a violation of title vii.meritor sav.bank,fsb vinson,d.to constitute actionable sexual harassment,a plaintiff must show that the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult,that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim employment and create an abusive working environment,herrera lufkin,cir quotation omitted,and that the victim was targeted because of her gender,chavez new mexico,cir emphasis removed.although a few isolated incidents of gender animus does not establish a pervasively hostile work environment,see herrera,at,the pervasiveness of the hostility is quintessentially a question of fact and thus particularly unsuited for resolution on a motion for judgment as a matter of law,see yellow tech,cir quotation omitted noting that summary judgment should seldom be used in employment discrimination cases.
we conclude that,based on the conduct described above,a reasonable jury could find that segovia was subjected to a severe or pervasively hostile work environment because of her sex.cdm characterizes many of the epithets as either stray remarks or innocuous such that no reasonable jury could conclude they created a hostile work environment.for example,it suggests that while carter comment about a woman nipples is odd,it is not severe or humiliating.it also maintains that a reasonable person would not find carter comments about women in management and his comment about segovia intimate relationship with her husband humiliating.
in addition,although cdm admits that the concerning segovia was vulgar and offensive,it reasons that it is far from clear that the comments resulted from gender bias and accuses the eeoc of sensational izing it.cdm also contends that the,even assuming it is,is not evidence of discrimination or harassment because segovia was never intended to see it.with this last proposition,we heartily disagree.such a statement is akin to asserting that a person who overhears her coworkers using sexually derogatory terms to describe her can not be subjected to a hostile work environment merely because the coworkers did not intend her to hear them.this is not the law of this circuit.we have never held,nor would we,that to be subjected to a hostile work environment the discriminatory conduct must be both directed at the victim and intended to be received by the victim.harsco renner,cir including as part of the totality of the circumstances in a hostile work environment claim the fact that the plaintiff overheard making sexually derogatory remarks about her herrera,at including employer reference to victim as fucking mexican outside victim presence,but relayed to him by a third party,as part of the hostile work environment calculus.thus,the fact that segovia was not the intended recipient of the is of no consequence in our review of the totality of the circumstances.
cdm also maintains with respect to the repeated use of the word bitch to describe segovia that it was used to vilify overbearing and seemingly unfair behavior by segovia and was not intended in a sexual context.it also notes that even segovia admitted to using the word on occasion in a context.but we have characterized the word as a sexual epithet that courts have described as intensely degrading,winsor hinckley dodge,cir quotation omitted,and if it reasonably could be inferred that seemingly conduct was actually related to gender or arose out of a context in which admittedly sex and conduct occurred,then it is for the fact finder to decide whether such an inference should be drawn,at see also winsor,at it is beyond dispute that evidence that a woman was subjected to a steady stream of vulgar and offensive epithets because of her gender would be sufficient to establish a claim under title vii quotation omitted.here,carter frequently made indisputably remarks,and tolerated the use of the word bitch to describe segovia.under these circumstances,we think a jury should decide whether these comments were made because of gender animus.
with respect to the pervasiveness of the conduct,the bulk of it occurred during a relatively short period of four month period beginning with segovia promotion to new car sales manager.the majority owner of the dealership repeatedly subjected her and others to comments about a woman appropriate role in the workplace her used sexual epithets to describe her on one such occasion she felt physically threatened when a coworker threw a plate against a wall and she intercepted a vulgar describing her genitalia that was written by one of her subordinates,addressed to another manager,and forwarded on to her supervisor.moreover,her supervisor knew about all this conduct and either chose to ignore it altogether or respond in only the most minimal of ways,forcing a apology.see harsco,at an employer will not be liable under title vii if the employer was not on actual or constructive notice of the alleged harassment.actual knowledge is usually demonstrable where the plaintiff has reported harassment to employees.internal citation omitted.
by parsing out the various instances of harassment and characterizing them as,or not pervasive,cdm seeks to eschew the proper totality of the circumstances test,which is the touchstone of our analysis of hostile work environment claims.see harsco,at penry fed.home loan bank of topeka,cir observing that the very term environment indicates that allegedly discriminatory incidents should not be examined in isolation and the in a sexual harassment case should not examine each alleged incident of harassment in a vacuum because w hat may appear to be a legitimate justification for a single incident of alleged harassment may look pretextual when viewed in the context of several other related incidents.quotation omitted.the facts,when taken together and in the light most favorable to the eeoc,could reasonably support a finding that the work environment was charged with and sexual animus.see harsco,at factors to consider in evaluating whether the environment is hostile or abusive include the frequency of the conduct its severity whether it is physically threatening or humiliating,or a mere offensive utterance and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee work performance.it may be that a jury would agree with cdm that segovia was not subjected to a severe or pervasively hostile environment based on her sex,but that is not for this court to decide.
disparate treatment 
under the framework established in mcdonnell douglas green,d,the plaintiff bears the initial burden to establish a prima facie case of sex discrimination,which varies depending on the type of adverse action the employee alleges was discriminatory.see plotke white,cir t he articulation of a plaintiff prima facie case may well vary,depending on the context of the claim and the nature of the adverse employment action alleged.in this context,a prima facie case of discrimination must consist of evidence that the victim belongs to a protected class the victim suffered an adverse employment action and the challenged action took place under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination.sorbo united parcel,cir.once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of discrimination,the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action.mickelson new york life ins,cir.if the employer does so,the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the employer proffered reasons are pretextual.id 
the employee warning notice 
the eeoc contends that segovia was disciplined more harshly than others because of her sex.notably,cdm concedes that the warning notice it issued to segovia was an adverse employment action despite this circuit rule that a written warning is an adverse employment action only if it effects a significant change in the plaintiff employment status,haynes level commc,llc,cir emphasis added,by,for example,affect ing the likelihood that the plaintiff will be terminated,undermin ing the plaintiff current position,or affect ing the plaintiff future employment opportunities,medina income support,cir.although none of these factors appear to be present here,because cdm concedes this issue,we will not address it.
the eeoc has established a prima facie case,then,if it can show that cdm issued segovia a warning notice under circumstances that give rise to an inference of discrimination one method by which a plaintiff can meet this burden,and the method by which the eeoc proceeds,is to show that the employer treated similarly situated employees more favorably.sorbo,at.
individuals are considered when they deal with the same supervisor,are subjected to the same standards governing performance evaluation and discipline,and have engaged in conduct of comparable seriousness.mcgowan city of eufala,cir.the eeoc contends that ennis is similarly situated and that he was never written up for any of his workplace infractions,including frequent tardiness,calling segovia a bitch,and drinking beer behind the dealership with other employees during business hours.but the eeoc has failed to establish that segovia and ennis engaged in conduct of comparable seriousness and were disciplined in a way that gives rise to an inference of discrimination.the tenor of the warning notice segovia received was that her conduct rendered her unavailable to help her sales personnel complete deals.in other words,segovia was disciplined for concerns.she was chronically late to work she often made personal calls on her cell phone during work hours and she often could not be found in her office when her staff needed her.as a result,another employee was required to for her,causing that employee to fall behind in his own work.
the conduct for which segovia argues ennis should have been punished,with the exception of his tardiness,is not.although there was evidence that ennis was often late to work,there is no evidence that his tardiness prevented him or others from completing their duties.furthermore,with respect to evidence that ennis drank beer behind the dealership during business hours,the uncontradicted testimony was that it was an occasional event that only took place late in the evening,right before closing.again,there is nothing to suggest that such conduct interfered with his or other employees duties.ennis conduct was not sufficiently similar to segovia to permit an inference of discrimination on the basis of their disparate treatment.see mcgowan,at e ven employees who are similarly situated must have been disciplined for conduct of comparable seriousness in order for their disparate treatment to be relevant.quoting kendrick penske transp,cir.
even if we were to conclude,however,that the eeoc met its burden to establish a prima facie case of discrimination,it has failed to introduce evidence that demonstrates cdm proffered reason for issuing the written.segovia unavailability in the workplace,which was causing problems for her pretextual.the eeoc has not provided evidence of such weaknesses,implausibilities,inconsistencies,incoherencies or contradictions in cdm proffered reason that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find it unworthy of credence.green new mexico,cir quotation omitted upholding summary judgment on title vii claim where plaintiff failed to provide evidence supporting claims of pretext.
the eeoc suggests that evidence that ennis and other employees were not written up for conduct such as using the word bitch,sending derogatory,leaving work to take children from school to daycare,etcetera,rebuts any legitimate,business reason cdm may proffer for the difference in treatment.first,as noted above,ennis is not similarly situated to segovia under this circuit precedent.see sorbo,at noting that evidence that a similarly situated employee was treated differently may aid the plaintiff in satisfying its burden to establish a prima facie case of discrimination,or,in other circumstances,may raise an inference of pretext in the third stage of the mcdonnell douglas method of proof.furthermore,there is substantial evidence in the record that segovia also engaged in the same type of misconduct and was not.for example,she was not disciplined for using profanity in the workplace although she sometimes did so.she was not disciplined for logging onto daggett computer and using his without his permission.nor was she disciplined when she slid magazines to a salesperson under the bathroom door,in front of customers,telling him to h urry up.
finally,despite segovia testimony that she felt the warning was unfair and that the basis for the warning was not accurate,she does not deny the particulars of the allegations contained in the employee warning notice.she admitted that she was often late to work.she admitted that she made personal calls during work hours but insisted that they were not excessive.this testimony was rebutted by her cell phone records,however,which revealed that she logged nearly minutes of talk time during the relevant period.she also admitted that she was glued to her chair in her office but testified that she was not was just elsewhere at the dealership,checking on inventory,for example.she was unable to dispute that her staff frequently complained to daggett about her conduct,although she testified that only one of them ever complained to her about it.
again,although there was evidence that other employees were sometimes late to work,there is no evidence that their conduct prevented them or others from completing their duties.similarly,though segovia testified that one manager left the dealership almost everyday to take his children from school to daycare,he was only gone from approximately to,and nothing suggests that he was needed by his coworkers during that period or that his coworkers did not know how to locate him.finally,with respect to evidence that various employees drank beer behind the dealership during business hours,the uncontradicted testimony was that it was an occasional event that only took place late in the evening,right before closing.again,there is nothing to suggest that such conduct interfered with the employees duties.as such,the eeoc fails to establish a genuine issue of fact as to pretext on this basis.
the new pay plan 
the eeoc next contends that the new pay plan was an adverse employment action that cdm implemented because of segovia sex.again,cdm concedes that segovia suffered an adverse employment action in that her salary was reduced.it contends,however,that the eeoc failed to establish that a similarly situated male did not also have his salary reduced.it maintains that ennis was treated exactly the same as is,he was also placed on the new pay plan.
the eeoc presented no evidence as to the actual effect the new pay plan would have on ennis and segovia salaries.because segovia routinely made more than ennis before the pooling of commissions,it would appear that after implementation of the plan pooling arrangement segovia would earn less than before,while ennis would have a corresponding increase in salary.if this were the case we would likely conclude that the eeoc satisfied the third prong of the prima facie case.but the new pay plan also contains a bonus structure under which each manager is rewarded based on the absolute number of cars each sells.in this regard,segovia compensation is more favorable than ennis she would receive bonuses after the sale of,and new cars while ennis bonuses would not kick in until after the sale of,and used cars.the eeoc points to no evidence related to this bonus structure,including whether it differed from the prior pay plan.in other words,there is no evidence that ennis would be making more money than he did before or that his salary was reduced by less than segovia other than pure conjecture and while the eeoc is entitled to all reasonable inferences in its favor,these inferences must be more than speculation and conjecture.sunward dun bradstreet,cir.
furthermore,the uncontradicted evidence revealed that cdm was a company in financial trouble and the new pay plan was an effort to reduce the managers salaries to correspond to the market rate.finally,a male replaced segovia as the new car sales manager when she resigned and he was subject to the new pay plan,which further undermines the eeoc contention that the pay plan was intentionally sexually discriminatory.
retaliation 
title vii makes it unlawful to retaliate against an employee for opposing practices made unlawful by the statute.a.a prima facie case of retaliation requires a plaintiff to show that she engaged in protected opposition to discrimination,that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially is,that the action might dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination,burlington santa fe ry.white,d quotation omitted and that a causal connection exists between the protected activity and the materially adverse action.see argo blue cross blue shield of,cir.as noted,cdm concedes that the disciplinary notice and the new pay plan were both materially adverse employment actions it maintains,however,that segovia never engaged in any protected conduct nor is there a causal link between any such conduct and the challenged actions.we disagree.
first,segovia unquestionably engaged in protected activity when she complained to daggett about carter comment that he did not want her to hire women salespeople.she told daggett she was thinking of reporting carter behavior to the eeoc.cdm makes much of the fact that although she threatened to do so,segovia did not actually file a formal charge of discrimination with the eeoc until after she resigned.but the prohibition against retaliation protects conduct short of filing a formal prohibits discrimination against an individual simply for oppos ing any practice made an unlawful employment practice by title vii.see a.we have noted that p rotected opposition can range from filing formal charges to voicing informal complaints to superiors.see hertz luzenac america,cir.segovia complaint falls comfortably within this standard.
segovia also complained to daggett about the vulgar he received from ennis,which also amounts to protected activity.altho
