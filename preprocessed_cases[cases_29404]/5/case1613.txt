background 
the history of this dispute is set forth in detail in our opinion in karton.in very brief summary in,dougherty retained karton to represent him in a marital dissolution action.the retainer agreement contained the following attorney fees provision in the event legal services are commenced in connection with the enforcement of this agreement or the collection of the fees the costs,whether in the form of a demand,a court action,or an arbitration proceeding,the prevailing party to the extent permitted by law shall be entitled to legal fees for services,as well as court arbitration costs.karton,supra,th at.
in,karton filed suit against dougherty,seeking to recover in unpaid fees and costs,plus interest.on august,the trial court entered a default judgment against dougherty for a total of,including accrued prejudgment interest,attorney fees,and costs.karton,supra,th at.
by october,karton had collected approximately in partial satisfaction of the judgment.karton,supra,th at.thereafter,karton pursued further collection efforts against dougherty in california,pennsylvania,and tennessee,and dougherty resisted those efforts.in addition,karton twice returned to the superior court to request awards of the attorney fees incurred in enforcing the judgment.both times,karton failed to give dougherty notice that it was seeking such relief,and both times the requests were granted in their entirety.the second such award,entered in february,increased the principal amount of the judgment to more than million.id.at.after learning of the order granting the february fee award,dougherty filed a motion for relief from that order and then,after the motion was denied,appealed from the denial of his motion.
in a published opinion filed on february,we reversed.we concluded that the trial court had abused its discretion by denying dougherty motion for relief from the order granting the february fee award,because dougherty was entitled to notice of karton application for that award.karton,supra,th at see generally id.at.we further concluded that the original default judgment was void on the face of the record because it awarded relief that exceeded the demand in karton first amended complaint id.at.we accordingly directed the trial court to enter an order vacating and setting aside,nunc pro tunc,the default judgment entered on august.id.at.we also noted that dougherty had argued that the default itself,and not merely the default judgment,is void because dougherty timely requested arbitration before the default was entered.id.at,fn.we expressed no opinion on that issue,because it involves factual issues that the trial court has never determined and that we can not resolve as a matter of law on this appeal.ibid.
on remand,dougherty moved to vacate the default.on august,the trial court granted the motion on the ground that dougherty had timely requested arbitration.the matter proceeded to arbitration under business and professions code section before the los angeles county bar association.
the arbitration panel mailed notice of its award on june.the panel determined that,as of the time of the arbitration,dougherty had already paid karton an amount far in excess of the amounts owed for legal services plus interest on the amounts billed.the panel declined,however,to award a refund to dougherty.the panel stated that dougherty had paid the arbitration fee of,which should be allocated equally to both parties,so the arbitration award directed karton to pay dougherty.the arbitration award did not provide for any other relief to either party.
dougherty petitioned to confirm the arbitration award,and karton petitioned to vacate it and requested trial de novo.the trial court denied dougherty petition and granted karton,so the parties proceeded to litigate the matter.karton fourth amended complaint alleges claims for breach of contract,indebtedness assumpsit,account stated,open book account,quantum meruit,tort of another,and declaratory relief.in his answer,dougherty alleged,among other things,that he had already fully repaid his debt to karton.dougherty did not file a cross complaint.
karton claims were tried to the court on february.in its statement of decision,the court found,based on the calculations of karton accounting expert,that by march,karton,as a result of payments by dougherty and garnishments,had collected funds sufficient to cover all principal and interest payments due on karton invoices under the retainer agreement.the court therefore concluded that dougherty debt to karton for the fees billed under the retainer agreement and interest on overdue amounts has been extinguished.thus,dougherty contractual debt to karton was repaid in full,including interest,nearly one year before we filed our opinion in karton in february.karton does not challenge that factual finding.
the court also found that karton evidence showed that as of july,karton had collected in excess of the amounts owed by dougherty under the retainer agreement.the court further observed,however,that because dougherty did not file a cross complaint,he is not entitled to a money judgment for any overpayment of amounts owed to karton but rather is entitled to a credit in the amount of the excess funds collected,which dougherty may apply to any other obligation he owes to karton.
although the court concluded that dougherty contractual debt to karton was fully repaid with interest nearly four years before trial and that karton was therefore not entitled to damages or any other remedy on the breach of contract claim,the court statement of decision states that karton has established its breach of contract claim.underlining omitted.the court appears to have reasoned that because karton had to sue dougherty to recover fees owed,karton should be able to recover attorney fees incurred in this litigation,pursuant to the attorney fees provision of the retainer agreement.the court statement of decision expressly contemplates an award of attorney fees to karton on that basis.
the statement of decision analyzes and rejects karton remaining claims for damages.on the declaratory relief cause of action,the court awarded relief to the effect that dougherty is entitled to a credit for the that karton collected in excess of the amount dougherty owed.
the court entered judgment on august.the judgment states that b efore trial,as a result of payments by defendant and garnishments,plaintiff mitigated its damages for defendant breach but collected in excess of the amount owed by defendant for services rendered under the agreement.plaintiff incurred legal fees and expenses for services commenced by it to enforce the agreement,and plaintiff may seek by way of motion to have such fees,as the court may find to have been reasonably and necessarily incurred by it,included in this judgment.the judgment also awards costs,which may be found to include attorney fees,to karton,in an amount to be determined later.finally,the judgment states that dougherty is not entitled to a money judgment but is entitled to a credit for the excess funds collected by karton,which dougherty may apply to any other debt he owes karton.
dougherty timely appealed from the judgment,and karton timely cross appealed.
karton filed a memorandum of costs seeking plus attorney fees in an amount to be determined later,and dougherty filed a motion to tax costs.the parties then filed to be determined the prevailing party and for awards of attorney fees.dougherty motion sought an attorney fees award of,but his reply acknowledged certain errors identified in karton opposition and reduced dougherty request to.karton sought an attorney fees award of.
the court denied dougherty motion and granted karton,awarding in attorney fees and in other costs.the court awarded all fees karton sought except for certain fees allegedly incurred in proceedings in tennessee,which the court denied without prejudice to plaintiff right to apply for them in tennessee.
dougherty timely appealed from the orders awarding karton attorney fees and costs 
discussion 
dougherty argues on numerous grounds that he,rather than karton,is the prevailing party and should have been awarded attorney fees and costs.we agree.because it is well established that the prevailing party for purposes of a contractual attorney fees award under civil code section section is not necessarily the prevailing party for purposes of a costs award under code of civil procedure section section,we analyze the attorney fees and costs issues separately.see zintel holdings,llc mclean th.
attorney fees 
on the attorney fees issue,the controlling statute is section,and the controlling case is hsu abbara cal th hsu.when a contract contains a provision granting either party the right to recover attorney fees in the event of litigation on the contract,section gives the party prevailing on the contract a right to recover attorney fees.hsu,supra,cal th at,quoting.subject to certain exceptions identified in the statute,the party prevailing on the contract shall be the party who recovered a greater relief in the action on the contract,subd.b.in addition,w here the defendant alleges in his or her answer that he or she tendered to the plaintiff the full amount to which he or she was entitled,and thereupon deposits in court for the plaintiff,the amount so tendered,and the allegation is found to be true,then the defendant is deemed to be a party prevailing on the contract within the meaning of section.ibid.
dougherty is the party prevailing on the contract within the meaning of section.karton is the plaintiff and recovered no relief in the action on the contract,subd.b.he therefore can not have recovered greater relief than dougherty in the action on the contract.dougherty did not file a,so his failure to obtain a money judgment or other affirmative relief from the court does not weigh against his claim to be the party prevailing on the contract.
in addition,subdivision b of section compels the conclusion that dougherty is the prevailing party.under subdivision b of section,if a defendant alleges tender of the full amount of the contractual debt,deposits the tendered amount with the court,and proves the allegation to be true,proves that the amount tendered and deposited was the full contractual debt,then the defendant is the prevailing party as a matter of law.dougherty claim to be the prevailing party is even stronger.he alleged not merely that he had tendered the full amount of the contractual debt but that karton had actually collected the entire debt including interest,leaving nothing for dougherty to deposit with the court.the court and the arbitrators before it found that allegation to be true,and on appeal karton does not challenge that finding.accordingly,although subdivision b of section does not precisely fit the facts of this case which involve actual collection of the contractual debt rather than tender and deposit,the logic of the statute requires that dougherty be deemed the prevailing party.
the supreme court analysis in hsu likewise dictates that dougherty is the prevailing party.the court held that when the trial court renders a simple,unqualified decision in favor of the defendant on the only contract claim in the action,the defendant,who is unquestionably the sole victor,is the party prevailing on the contract as a matter of law and therefore entitled to reasonable attorney fees under section.hsu,supra,cal th at.
the hsu holding applies straightforwardly here.the trial court rendered a simple,unqualified decision in favor of dougherty on the only contract claim in the action the court expressly determined that dougherty owed karton nothing on the contract because dougherty had fully paid his contractual debt to karton with interest nearly four years before trial.dougherty is therefore the sole victor,is the prevailing party on the contract as a matter of law,and is entitled to reasonable attorney fees under section.
karton arguments to the contrary are not persuasive.first,karton argues that it is the prevailing party on the basis of the following sentence from hsu i n deciding whether there is a party prevailing on the contract,the trial court is to compare the relief awarded on the contract claim or claims with the parties demands on those same claims and their litigation objectives as disclosed by the pleadings,trial briefs,opening statements,and similar sources.hsu,supra,cal th at.karton focuses on the phrase litigation objectives and argues that it succeeded in its litigation objectives because it obtained full repayment of dougherty contractual debt.
we disagree.the quoted sentence requires the trial court to compare the relief awarded on the contract claim or claims with the parties demands on those claims and their litigation objectives.the trial court awarded karton no relief on its contract claim,so it can not be the prevailing party on the contract.
second,karton argues that granite rock freeman.granite rock was decided under a comparable statutory scheme and is on point.again,we disagree.the statutory scheme in granite rock is not comparable,and the analysis in granite rock directly conflicts with the express terms of section.
granite rock was decided under a statute providing for attorney fee awards in actions to enforce surety bonds on public works contracts.granite rock,supra.at.in granite rock,after the plaintiff filed suit but before the defendant answered,the defendant paid the plaintiff all of the principal,interest,and costs due but did not pay for the plaintiff attorney fees.id.at.the defendant then alleged those facts in the answer.ibid.following a bench trial at which the defendant allegation apparently was found true,the trial court nonetheless determined that the plaintiff was the prevailing party and was therefore entitled to attorney fees.ibid.the court of appeal affirmed,reasoning that because the plaintiff recovered every element it sued for and had to fight for each element,the plaintiff was the prevailing party within the meaning of those words as used in the statute to the same extent and degree that it would have been if the principal sum had not been paid before answer filed but had been withheld and had been included as a part of the judgment itself.ibid.
section which karton concedes is the controlling statute with respect to attorney fees in this case provides to the contrary.as we have already noted,if a defendant alleges in the answer that the defendant has tendered to the plaintiff the full amount due under
