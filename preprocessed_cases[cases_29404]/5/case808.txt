siouxland is a medical clinic in sioux falls,south dakota,specializing in oral and maxillofacial surgery.in late december,siouxland hired richelle dooley to work as a receptionist and scheduler.dooley began working at siouxland on january.the next day,when asking how to complete her health benefit forms,dooley informed her supervisor,shelley hofer,that she was pregnant.hofer congratulated dooley and asked when the baby was due and how long of a maternity leave she planned to take.dooley answered that her baby was due in july and that she was unsure how long she intended to be on leave but thought possibly six to eight weeks.dooley asked whether the maternity leave would be a problem,and hofer responded that it would not,because siouxland could hire a temp to come in and cover you during that time.
hofer then informed one of siouxland partners,bernard balaban,as well as the managing partner,harvey lee akerson,about dooley pregnancy,and akerson decided that dooley must be terminated.according to kathy fjellestad,siouxland business manager,akerson stated in a meeting about dooley,the young lady we just hired is going to have a baby this summer,she is going to be available to work.it does make any sense to begin training her when she wo be able to work the summer w e are going to have to let her go.balaban said at this meeting that we ca or we should terminate dooley,and fjellestad informed akerson that siouxland could not terminate dooley because of her pregnancy.
later that second day of work at and hofer informed dooley that akerson had decided to let her go.when dooley asked why,fjellestad explained,your baby is going to be due during our busy season,and said that they never would have hired dooley if they had known she was pregnant.dooley asked why siouxland could not hire a temporary worker,as hofer had previously stated,and fjellestad said that was not an option during the busy season.dooley offered to take only one week of maternity leave,but fjellestad said that would not be fair to dooley or her baby.dooley then packed up her belongings and left the office.siouxland twice attempted to replace dooley,but the individuals who were hired worked only a few days before either they quit or siouxland terminated them.siouxland did not hire a successful replacement until july.
on march,angie gacke contacted siouxland about applying for an advertised position in central sterilization and recovery.the advertisement stated,training in medical technology,dental assisting or surgical technology desirable.gacke spoke with sherena kost,who was listed as the contact person in the advertisement and who serves as the supervisor of siouxland surgical staff.gacke asked whether her education and experience made her minimally qualified for the job.gacke had been trained to be,and was then working as,a cardiac ultrasound technician.kost told her that she could qualify for the position,requested that gacke send a copy of her resumé by,and scheduled an interview for the next day.
kost and two other siouxland employees,one of whom was jennifer devries,interviewed gacke the next day.during the interview,they discussed gacke background and qualifications,the job responsibilities,and siouxland wages and benefits.at some point near the end of the interview or immediately after it,gacke told kost,i do know if this is a problem or not,but i do want to let you know i am four months pregnant.according to gacke,kost responded,yes,it a problem.you are just going to end up causing more work for everybody else than you will be helping them.kost also explained that gacke august due date was in the middle of our busy season,and we do grant any vacation or anything to anybody during the busy season.devries recalled kost responding to gacke mention of her pregnancy by stating that because of her pregnancy occurring at the time it was going to be occurring,that it would be best if she just continue her pregnancy,have the baby,have her maternity leave,and then we would talk.kost wrote on a copy of gacke resumé that gacke was over qualified for job,that she needed insurance,and that she was months pregnant later on the day of the interview,kost called gacke and left her a message informing her that she had not been hired for the open position.kost was aware throughout this process that discriminating on the basis of pregnancy was illegal.
on december,the eeoc brought this action alleging that siouxland terminated dooley and refused to hire gacke because they were pregnant,in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of.see k,a.shortly thereafter,dooley and gacke successfully moved to intervene in the case,and siouxland moved for severance or for separate trials on dooley and gacke claims.the district court denied siouxland motion,and the case was eventually tried to a jury in april.throughout the trial,siouxland contended that it had fired dooley because she would not be available during its busy season,and that it would have done the same thing if she had been unavailable for a reason other than pregnancy.siouxland likewise argued that gacke was not hired because kost discovered during the interview that gacke was not qualified for the job.at the close of the plaintiffs case,the district court denied the eeoc request to instruct the jury on punitive damages,and instead granted siouxland judgment as a matter of law on the claim of such damages.the jury ultimately found that siouxland discriminated against dooley and gacke,and awarded back pay of to dooley and to gacke.
following the district court entry of judgment against siouxland,the eeoc filed a motion for equitable relief,requesting additional back pay,prejudgment interest,and a permanent injunction.gacke and dooley also each moved for attorney fees.the court denied the eeoc request for injunctive relief and back pay,but granted the request for prejudgment interest and awarded gacke and dooley in attorney fees.
the eeoc now appeals,arguing that the district court should have submitted the claim for punitive damages to the jury and granted its request for injunctive relief.siouxland the district court award of attorney fees,and conditionally the district court denial of its severance motion.
the eeoc argues first that the district court erred in refusing to submit its claim for punitive damages to the jury and granting siouxland judgment as a matter of law on that claim.at the close of the plaintiffs case,the district court concluded that it has not been shown that there was a perceived risk that the actions of siouxland would violate federal law to be liable on punitive damages.so punitive damages are not going to be submitted to the jury.we review the district court decision de novo.see chalfant titan,cir mcdonough city of quincy,cir.judgment as a matter of law is appropriate only if the opposing party has been fully heard on an issue and a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue.a.
under title vii,punitive damages are available if a plaintiff shows that the employer engaged in intentional discrimination with malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of the victim of discrimination.b.in kolstad american dental ass n,d,the supreme court explained that malice or reckless indifference pertain to the employer knowledge that it may be acting in violation of federal law,not its awareness that it is engaging in discrimination.id.at.thus,in order to be liable for punitive damages,an employer must at least discriminate in the face of a perceived risk that its actions will violate federal law.id.at.a plaintiff does not need to show that the employer engaged in conduct with some independent,egregious quality.id.at.if a plaintiff shows that an employee of the company acted with the requisite malice or reckless indifference,the plaintiff must then show that the employee mental state can be imputed to the employer.id.at.the malice or reckless indifference of employees serving in a managerial capacity and acting within the scope of their employment may be imputed to the employer.id.at.an employer may avoid liability for punitive damages,however,if it shows that the employees actions are contrary to the employer efforts to comply with title vii.id.at.internal quotation omitted see dominic devilbiss air power,cir.
here,the evidence presented by the eeoc at trial was sufficient for a jury to find that siouxland acted in the face of a perceived risk that it was violating dooley and gacke title vii rights.with respect to dooley,the eeoc presented evidence that akerson,who ordered dooley termination,knew that pregnancy discrimination was illegal.the eeoc also showed that akerson was warned by fjellestad that siouxland could not fire dooley because she was pregnant,and by balaban that siouxland could not or should not terminate dooley employment.this evidence was sufficient for a jury to infer that akerson acted knowing that his conduct may be violating federal law.as the managing partner of siouxland with authority over employment decisions,akerman was indisputably a managerial employee acting within the scope of his employment,and any malice or reckless indifference on his part could thus be imputed to siouxland.
the evidence with respect to gacke also was sufficient to submit the question of punitive damages to the jury.kost,who made the decision that gacke would not be considered further for the open position,testified that she knew that discrimination on the basis of pregnancy was illegal.from this evidence,a reasonable jury could infer that kost knew that she may be violating federal law by considering pregnancy as a factor in rejecting gacke application for employment.as the supervisor of siouxland surgical authority to conduct the initial interviews for prospective surgical staff,to reject applicants who are not right for the job,and to recommend applicants to be was employed in a capacity with sufficient managerial responsibility for her action to be imputed to siouxland.
siouxland contends that the actions of akerson and kost do not constitute malice or reckless indifference because neither thought that they were engaging in pregnancy discrimination.see kolstad,at.noting that punitive damages would be inappropriate when the employer discriminates with the distinct belief that its discrimination is lawful.according to siouxland,akerson terminated dooley because she would be unavailable when needed during siouxland busy season,and kost screened out gacke because she was unqualified for the job.
siouxland offers one reasonable interpretation of the evidence presented at trial,but the jury evidently did not accept it.if the jury believed that akerman terminated dooley solely because of her unavailability,then it should not have found siouxland liable for pregnancy discrimination against dooley.see rhett carnegie ctr.assocs.in re carnegie ctr.assocs,cir troupe may dep t stores,cir.likewise,if the jury believed kost that gacke was rejected exclusively because she was unqualified,then it should not have found siouxland liable to gacke.having found that pregnancy was a motivating factor in each case,and presented with evidence that akerman and kost knew that pregnancy discrimination was illegal,a reasonable jury also could find that their discrimination was recklessly indifferent to the federally protected rights of dooley and gacke.
siouxland asserts that a contrary conclusion is dictated by our prior cases.yet siouxland points to no case in which we held that punitive damages were inappropriate as a matter of law where,as here,evidence was presented to the jury that a managerial employee engaged in discrimination while knowing that federal law prohibited such discrimination.in many of the cases cited by siouxland,this court did not address whether the plaintiff had presented evidence that the decisionmaker had knowledge of federal discrimination law when discriminating.see allen tobacco superstore,cir ollie titan tire,cir webner titan,cir.siouxland relies heavily on canny bottling group,cir.there,we vacated an award of punitive damages under the americans with disabilities act ada because the employer actions failing reasonably to accommodate the plaintiff,while sufficient for liability,did not rise to malice or reckless indifference.id.at.but in canny,there was no evidence that the employer was aware that it may have been violating the ada.on the contrary,the employer thought its actions were required by other federal regulations.see id.
finally,citing christensen titan distribution,cir,and chalfant titan distribution,at,siouxland suggests that inconsistent explanations for the adverse employment action by the employer are a prerequisite to liability for punitive damages.while we did note the employer inconsistent explanations in christensen and chalfant as added support for a jury finding that the employer knew it might be acting in violation of federal law,we never held that such evidence is required to prove malice or reckless indifference.and in both cases,we also relied on evidence that the employer was familiar with the relevant federal discrimination law.see christensen,at chalfant,at.
we therefore conclude that the district court erred in granting siouxland judgment as a matter of law on dooley and gacke claims.we remand for a new trial solely on the issue of punitive damages.see madison ibp,cir eeoc heartway,cir.
siouxland filed a conditional,arguing that if the district court erred by refusing to submit punitive damages to the jury,then we should hold that the district court also erred in denying siouxland motion for severance or for separate trials on dooley and gacke claims.see.b,b.siouxland argument is premature,however,because the district court prior ruling was rendered in the context of a motion for separate trials on both liability and damages.the district court had no occasion to consider whether a trial on the issue of punitive damages alone should be convened jointly or separately.we therefore leave this issue for the district court to decide in the first instance on remand.
the eeoc next contends that the district court abused its discretion in denying the eeoc request for injunctive relief.in its complaint,the eeoc sought a permanent injunction barring siouxland from discriminating on the basis of sex or pregnancy.on april,following the jury verdict,the district court entered judgment against siouxland but did not address the injunction requested in the eeoc complaint.on may,the eeoc filed a motion for equitable relief,which asked the district court to permanently enjoin siouxland from discriminating on the basis of pregnancy or retaliating against any employee who complains of unlawful discrimination.in addition,the eeoc sought to require siouxland to conduct employee training on title vii,to revise its employment discrimination policies,and to post various notices about federal employment discrimination law and the outcome of this case.it also proposed requiring siouxland to notify the eeoc of employment decisions covered by,to comply with the recordkeeping requirements of that regulation,and to make such records available for inspection b
