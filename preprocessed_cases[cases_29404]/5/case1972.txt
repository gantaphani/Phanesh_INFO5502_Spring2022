alicia farber appeals from judgments that dismissed her complaint and against bay view homeowners association association for lack of standing to sue,and from a order awarding the association attorney fees.farber argues she does have standing and,even if not,the association was not entitled to fees.we disagree and affirm.
in late,farber sold a condominium in bay view terrace,costa mesa,to david stiffler.the condominium project is subject to a declaration of covenants,conditions,and restrictions cc r.the association,whose members are the unit owners,is responsible for enforcing the cc r and maintaining the structures within the condominium project.
after stiffler moved into his unit,he discovered the roof leaked extensively and he was facing a assessment by the association to make repairs.stiffler thought farber had failed to disclose the leaks and should bear this expense.farber took the position that it was the association duty to maintain the roof.she made demand on the association to accept responsibility for the roof,and on stiffler to agree to look only to the latter for recourse.both refused and the instant action followed.
the complaint names as defendants stiffler and the association,and it recites the facts set out above.there is a single cause of action for declaratory relief.it alleges a n actual controversy now exists between plaintiff and defendants concerning their respective rights and duties pursuant to the declaration cc r and duties allegedly owed to defendant stiffler by either plaintiff association farber alleges she did not conceal any material facts from stiffler,and it is the association duty to fix stiffler roof.the relief requested is a judicial determination of farber rights and duties stiffler and the association.as to the association,she specifically asks for a declaration that i f defendant stiffler is having any problems with the roof it is the duty and obligation of the defendant association to alleviate same and not the duty obligation of this plaintiff 
the association demurred to the complaint on the ground that it failed to state a cause of action.the gist of its argument was that there was no actual controversy between farber and the association,since she was not a member and it had no duty to her.at oral argument,the association added a new lacked standing to enforce the cc r because she was not an owner of a condominium unit.in support,it proffered statutory authority and case law not included in the demurrer.the trial court overruled the demurrer,explaining the standing argument had not been fairly raised and it would violate due process to decide on that basis without giving farber an opportunity to brief the issue.
prior to this ruling,farber had filed a against the association.it incorporated the complaint by reference and set out three causes of indemnity,comparative indemnity,and declaratory relief.the two indemnity claims alleged the association is primarily responsible for any damages stiffler might recover,and it should indemnify farber for any judgment.the declaratory relief claim requested a determination of farber rights and duties against the association and a declaration she is entitled to be indemnified for any judgment obtained by stiffler.
the association demurred to the.it argued the indemnity claims failed to state a cause of action under a statute that provides the comparative fault of an association managing a condominium can not be raised in a or separate action for contribution or implied indemnity,but only as a defense.the association argued the declaratory relief claim also failed to state a cause of action,because it sought to enforce the cc r and farber did not have standing to bring such an action.the trial court sustained the demurrer,without leave to amend,as to all causes of action.
following this success,the association moved for judgment on the pleadings of farber original complaint.it contended farber lacked standing to enforce the cc r,and the ruling sustaining the demurrer to the was res judicata on the issue.the trial court rejected the res judicata argument,but it agreed farber lacked standing to sue.judgment was entered for the association on the complaint,and a subsequent judgment denominated an order dismissed the against the association.on the association motion,it was awarded in attorney fees and in costs as the prevailing party in an action to enforce the governing documents of the condominium project,subd.c.
farber argues she has standing because neither the complaint nor the was an action to enforce the cc r.rather,she says,both sought to establish the association obligations to stiffler.we do not buy it.the obligations farber sought to enforce were obligations owed by the association to stiffler under the cc r.
civil code section,subdivision a provides that covenants and restrictions in a condominium declaration are enforceable as equitable servitudes if certain conditions are met.it then continues as follows unless the declaration states otherwise,these servitudes may be enforced by any owner of a separate interest or by the association,or both.the term separate interest means,in a condominium project,an individual unit,subd.l.the common law rule is the same.one who no longer owns land in a development subject to reciprocal restrictions can not enforce them,absent showing the original covenanting parties intended to allow enforcement by one who is not a landowner.development,smith d.see kent koch d,developer who sold all lots in subdivision can not enforce restrictions that would benefit project on adjacent land.
the essence of farber claim is that the cc r require the association to fix stiffler roof.we can not regard that as anything but an attempt to enforce the cc r.the language of the complaint and leave no doubt in the matter.the complaint alleges a controversy between plaintiff and defendants concerning their respective rights and duties pursuant to the declaration the cc r,and it seeks a declaration of farber rights against the association and stiffler.the requests indemnity,and a declaratory judgment,on the theory the association had the primary duty to repair the roof under the cc r.since farber attempted to enforce the cc r when she no longer owned a unit in condominium,the complaint and were properly dismissed for lack of standing.
farber argument she was only seeking to enforce stiffler rights strains even our credulity.to begin with,that is not what the pleadings say.the complaint unambiguously requests a declaration of farber rights against the association.the is not as direct,but its import is the same,since farber claims the association has a duty to indemnify her because it is primarily liable for fixing stiffler roof.moreover,whether stiffler rights or her own,this is still an action by farber that seeks relief under the cc r,and she is not a person entitled to bring such a suit 
salawy ocean towers housing th,d does not help farber.there,unit owners in a cooperative apartment building sued the cooperative corporation for breach of a promise to reimburse them for costs incurred in temporarily relocating,while repairs were made following an earthquake.the cooperative corporation successfully demurred based on provisions in its bylaws.it then requested attorney fees under a statute that awards fees to the prevailing party in an action to enforce the governing documents,subd.c,which are those documents that govern the operation of a condominium,among others,subds.c,j.the court held fees were not recoverable because the action was based on a breach of promise,not the governing documents.id.at,d.here,the essence of farber claim is that the cc r place the obligation to fix stiffler roof on the association,so she can not be liable for the cost.there is no promise here,only an obligation she finds in the cc r.that is an action to enforce the cc r,whether framed in terms of farber rights against the association or stiffler.
alternatively,farber contends she only used the cc r defensively,to avoid liability to stiffler.but that simply is not true.farber claims are presented in a complaint and,not as defenses in an answer.there is no avoiding t
