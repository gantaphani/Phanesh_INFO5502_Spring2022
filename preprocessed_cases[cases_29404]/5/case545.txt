for this second appeal in this action,the principal issue is whether,on remand from the first appeal,the district judge exceeded our mandate directing him to recalculate sanctions.following her unsuccessful trial on the merits,and prior to that first appeal,plaintiff sandy tollett had been awarded sanctions attorney fees and all court costs against not only the defendant,the city of kemah,texas,but also two of its employees.the sanctions arose out of a discovery dispute.
tollett conceded in the first appeal,however,that those sanctions were not supported by proof of reasonable fees and costs.therefore,our mandate for the first appeal,consistent with the terms of the contested sanctions order,directed the district court to assess reasonable fees and costs,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure failure to produce documents and to comply with discovery order.instead,on remand,pursuant to its inherent power,the district court imposed sanctions and attorney fees against the city and,instead of its two employees,against its counsel,william helfand.those followed the district judge stating he was insulted and angry because the original sanctions had been appealed.
in addition to the challenge by the city and its counsel to the revised sanctions,sandy tollett contests the denial,on remand,of a new trial.
that denial is affirmed the sanctions and attorney fees awarded on remand,as well as the findings and conclusions in the orders,are vacated and judgment is rendered,with the original sanctions being recalculated in accordance with our original mandate.
most unfortunately,what should have been a simple,expeditious,and inexpensive undertaking on remand has been just the opposite,to say the least.it goes without saying that our mandate from the first opinion stands.therefore,it is neither necessary,much less appropriate,to question,or otherwise reconsider,the merits of the underlying discovery dispute or the correctness of either the original sanctions or our subsequent first opinion and corresponding mandate.but,to unravel the erroneous result on remand,as well as to understand why this was unnecessary,requires revisiting and dissecting,in considerable detail,the events leading up to,and following,our mandate for the first appeal.
tollett was a,city police officer.becoming pregnant,she left that position on returning,she was allegedly informed she would have to retrain and would be on probationary status.as a result,she brought this action in september against the city,claiming sex discrimination,violative of title vii of the civil rights act of,et,and violation of the family and medical leave act,et.
tollett made discovery requests in january.simply put,the city position,as stated in the affidavit of its secretary,further discussed below,was that it ha d no records to produce of any employee or volunteer who was,as described earlier in the affidavit,similarly situated to sandy tollett.emphasis added.that may,unsatisfied with the city responses concerning police department personnel records,tollett moved to compel.the motion was granted that june.
that october,claiming the city had failed to comply with the discovery order,tollett moved,pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure and,for sanctions and attorney fees.tollett reasserted that motion during a hearing the court took it under advisement.
during the march trial,the discovery dispute over the existence of the records became hotly contested when one of tollett witnesses,deputy police chief peter munoz,acknowledged the existence of some employment records.the district court ordered that any records be produced in court the next day,and announced that,if it was shown there had been any impropriety with respect to them,it was going to ask the fbi to go over there to the police department and turn that office upside down and put everybody in jail that belongs there.the records were produced the next day,the last day of testimony and the court engaged in extensive questioning about them.
a jury found for the city,with judgment entered on march.on march,tollett moved for a new trial pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure rule,as discussed infra.
tollett asserted in the new trial motion the city had improperly withheld employment records it and its counsel had lied about the records existence and,had they been properly produced,the outcome of the trial would have been different.but,without explanation,the district court denied the new trial motion that may.
earlier,however,in a march order four days after entry of judgment and six days before the new trial motion was filed,the district court had granted the sanctions motion.in the sanctions order,it made the following findings and conclusions the city secretary knew that her statements in her summary judgment affidavit concerning the requested records would mislead the court the deputy chief knew the falsity and deception of the city secretary statement.nevertheless,he testified falsely concerning the whereabouts of the police personnel records and these perversions of the truth are serious and require serious sanctions against the two individuals and the city.but,instead of imposing the requested extreme sanctions and attorney fees,and in the light of its knowledge about,and extensive participation in resolving,the discovery dispute,it assessed in attorney fees and all court costs against the defendant city,as well as the two employees discussed in the sanctions order,city secretary kathy pierce and deputy chief munoz.
the city moved the court to reconsider the award,asserting there had been no proof to support the amount awarded.the motion was denied without explanation.
both sides appealed.the city did not challenge the imposition of sanctions,only their amount.nor did the two city employees contest being included among those liable for the sanctions.the city maintained,as it had in its motion to reconsider,that tollett had not submitted any evidence to support her fees request and stated that the district court had failed to articulate why it assessed the specific amount of or what proof existed to support that amount.
in no respect did tollett appeal the sanctions.instead,she challenged only the new trial denial.
that denial was affirmed.tollett city of kemah,at cir unpublished.concerning the city challenge to the sanctions amount,we held the city contends,and tollett concedes,that the sanction imposed by the district court is not supported by proof of the incurred fees and expenses.it is necessary,therefore,to remand for a redetermination and assessment of reasonable attorney fees and costs under rule,at emphasis added.
on remand,the district court stated in a october order t he court is required to determine reasonable sanctions for the conduct of the defendants sic counsel not named in the original sanctions order in failing to comply with the discovery request ordered by the court.approximately two months later,at a december hearing,the following colloquy ensued 
counsel for the city as i sure this court is aware,the issue here today is solely regarding the issue of the amount of sanctions.
the court well,i do know that that all that it about,because what the circuit court did is i believe they said that the record was not sufficient for me to have entered sanctions.they not saying sanctions should not have been entered.they saying i need to make a complete record,it seems to me,and then determine whether sanctions should be entered or not.because based on the way that i did it,the circuit court reversed it,i believe.maybe i read that incorrectly,but i believe they saying the record is insufficient to support any amount of sanctions,because it seems to me that they could have said,well,there is some evidence to support some of this,not all of this.let redetermine what amount,if any.
i do not intend to walk away from this,because i insulted.i angry by the fact that this case would go up on a simple award that was designed to ameliorate tollett problem.
emphasis added.the district judge stated he had hoped that this would have gone away he was disappointed that the appeal was taken by the city and it might be that the court ought to defy,if necessary,the fifth circuit and say i granting a new trial and i going to retry this case.emphasis added.
the district court ordered an evidentiary hearing to investigate the circumstances of the discovery requests and the personnel records,and advised the city to retain new counsel,opining that a conflict of interest existed between the city and its counsel,william helfand.a january order set the hearing stated who was to testify prohibited helfand and another member of his firm from representing the city in the proceeding and stated the hearing was necessary to determine whether sanctions should be imposed and,if so,against whom.
on january,two days before the order,tollett had filed an amended sanctions motion,again pursuant to rules and,seeking in sanctions and in attorney fees from the city,helfand,and helfand firm.the motion also requested,pursuant to rules b and,a new trial on the basis of claimed newly discovered evidence and fraud.
over two days that march,the evidentiary hearing was held to consider the amended sanctions request,but not that for a new trial,the district court concluding the latter had been adequately addressed in the documents and papers.that october,pursuant to its inherent power,the court imposed against the city and helfand in sanctions and in attorney fees.
although the district court did not expressly deny tollett new trial motion in that october order and an accompanying separate final judgment,it stated in the former it was convinced tollett can not now,nor could she have ever received a fair trial.this is so because the records of the city of kemah can not be authenticated,having been purged by city officials.in short,there is no explicit district court ruling on tollett rule b and new trial motion.
the city,helfand,and tollett appeal.accordingly,at issue are whether the sanctions exceeded our mandate and whether a new trial should have been granted.

helfand and the city contend that the district court redetermination,on remand,of whether,and against whom,sanctions should be imposed,exceeded our mandate the law of the case.they maintain the district court was limited to a redetermination of the amount of sanctions,pursuant to rule,to be assessed against the city and,instead of helfand,against the two city employees.

in imposing the original sanctions,the district court did not state under what authority it was acting.as noted,they had been requested pursuant to rules and.and,the sanctions order contains findings related to both rules.as discussed supra,it also includes findings concerning the affidavit by one sanctioned city employee and the trial testimony by the other.those two individuals being sanctioned,in addition to the city,does not fall under either rule.but,as noted,they did not contest the sanctions on the first appeal.
as discussed infra,because the original sanctions genesis was a discovery dispute,and because they were limited to attorney fees and court costs,they were more akin to those permitted by rule.compare fed.civ.signing of pleadings,motions,and other papers representations to court sanctions emphasis added,especially subparts c sanctions d inapplicability to discovery,with.failure to make disclosure or cooperate in discovery sanctions,especially subparts a motion for order compelling disclosure or discovery expenses and sanctions b failure to comply with order sanctions by court in which action is pending.moreover,for the first appeal,the city asserted,and tollett did not dispute,that the sanctions had been imposed pursuant to rule.
accordingly,for that appeal,we held 
t he district court abused its discretion in imposing sanctions.under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,a party may be liable for reasonable expenses including attorney fees caused by the failure to comply with a discovery order.the language of rule provides that only the expenses and fees caused by the failure to comply may be assessed against the noncomplying party.
the district court sanctioned the city the sum of in attorneys sic fees and all court costs the city contends,and tollett concedes,that the sanction imposed by the court is not supported by proof of the incurred fees and expenses.it is necessary,therefore,to remand for a redetermination and assessment of reasonable attorney fees and costs under rule.
at third alteration in original internal citations omitted emphasis added.the separate mandate stated the cause is remanded to the district court for reconsideration and assessment of sanctions.
tollett maintains the district court correctly interpreted this court ruling as setting aside its previous ruling and a requirement that an evidentiary hearing be held to determine liability,if any,for any of the parties subject to sanctions.this reading is totally at odds with our opinion.
instead,it was clear from our opinion that the district court was not to redetermine the type of sanctions,or whether,and against whom,sanctions should be imposed.the opinion expressly directed the district court only to determine the proper amount to impose as rule sanctions reasonable expenses,including attorney fees.the opinion stated this was necessary because the original award was not supported by any evidence of the attorney fees and related other expenses incurred by tollett.there can be no dispute about that.
tollett contends,however,that exceptions to the law of the case doctrine prevent its application here.the doctrine is not inviolate a prior decision of this court will be followed without unless i the evidence on a subsequent trial was substantially different,ii controlling authority has since made a contrary decision of the law applicable to such issues,or iii the decision was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice.becerra,at internal quotation marks omitted.tollett relies on the first and third prongs.
tollett claims the evidence adduced during the hearing was substantially different from that before the district court prior to the first appeal
