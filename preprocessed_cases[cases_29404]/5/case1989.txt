introduction 
the issue presented in this petition for writ of mandate is whether a violation of statutory protections against discriminatory violence and intimidation and against denial of civil rights by means of threats and intimidation,may be asserted as a separate cause of action in an action alleging wrongful termination and employment discrimination the trial court ruled these sections were part of the unruh civil rights act the unruh act and,thus,were inapplicable in the employment context.we conclude there is no bar to asserting violations of sections and in employment cases.accordingly,we reverse the trial court order sustaining real parties in interest demurrer and granting their motion to strike.
factual and procedural 
jv and traylor,collectively traylor is a mining company that employed petitioner robert stamps as a tunnel miner.stamps sued traylor and his supervisor,travis thompson,alleging he was subjected to retaliation,violence,and intimidation by threat of violence.stamps,an,further alleged thompson verbally harassed him with racist remarks,yelled at him in an intimidating manner,threatened him with physical violence for not completing work assignments,and generally placed him in unsafe work situations without proper equipment and training,all on account of his race.thompson alleged lack of concern for stamps safety resulted in an injury that caused several of stamps toes to be amputated.stamps was terminated as a result of his injury.
the operative pleading was the first amended complaint,which alleged three causes of action wrongful termination in violation of public policy,retaliation in violation of public policy,and violation of sections and.traylor and thompson collectively real parties demurred and filed a motion to strike.among their contentions,real parties argued the third cause of action failed because sections and are part of the unruh act and the supreme court held in rojo kliger cal d,rojo,that the unruh act does not apply to employment cases.
the trial court agreed with real parties and sustained the demurrer to the third cause of action without leave to amend.the court also struck stamps request for attorneys fees and penalties under sections and.on stamps petition,we issued an alternative writ of mandate and heard oral argument.as we will discuss,we hold stamps properly stated a cause of action the trial court,therefore,erred in its rulings 
we organize our opinion by first providing an overview of the applicable legislation and its history.we then conclude that sections and are not part of the unruh act,the supreme court in rojo did not adopt a rule barring employment cases from being founded on the two statutes,and there is no other reason to preclude such statutory claims in employment cases.

as the issues presented are all entirely legal in nature,we employ our independent judgment.citations.gatto county of sonoma th,d gatto.
the legislative framework of relevant civil code sections 
sections and overview.section broadly provides that all persons have the right to be free from violence and intimidation by threat of violence based on,among other things,race,religion,ancestry,national origin,political affiliation,sex,or position in a labor dispute the rights protected by section may be enforced by a private action for damages.see,subd.b.section allows a civil action for damages and equitable relief for interference,by threats,intimidation or coercion,with the exercise of constitutional or other rights provided by law.the section also provides criminal sanctions for violations attorneys fees may be awarded under both statutes,subd.b,subd.h.
sections and legislative history.the history of section indicates the legislation was referred to as the ralph civil rights act and enacted in as part of assembly bill.an assembly committee report stated that while there were numerous state and federal laws providing for full and equal civil rights protections in employment,housing,and access to public accommodations and facilities,there was no specific prohibition protecting individuals from violence because of their race,religion,color,ancestry,or national origin.assem.com.on labor relations,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.april.the report continues,although it is impossible to estimate the instances of violence against persons in california because of race,color,religion or other factors,there have been enough occurrences such as the one in taft,california last year where black college students were threatened with violence and chased out of town to signify a possible need for greater protection of this fundamental right this measure declares that all persons have a right to be free from violence or threat of violence committed against their persons or property because of race,color,religion,ancestry,national origin,political affiliation,or position in a labor dispute.see also venegas county of los angeles cal th,d,venegas conc,baxter,describing the historical background of the ralph civil rights act in re joshua th,fn,d referring to section as the ralph civil rights act.

the second statute on which stamps third cause of action was based,section,was enacted a decade later as part of assembly bill and is known as the tom bane civil rights act.it was intended to supplement the ralph civil rights act as an additional legislative effort to deter violence.see assem.comm.on public safety,analysis of assem.bill as amended.the stated purpose of the bill was to fill in the gaps left by the ralph act by allowing an individual to seek relief to prevent the violence from occurring before it was committed and providing for the filing of criminal charges.assem.comm.on ways and means,analysis of assem.bill as amended.
the assembly committee on public safety reported,the attorney general office states that the number of crimes which are committed because of the victim racial,ethnic,religious,or other minority status are increasing,that members of minority groups increasingly believe they are threatened by attack or harassment,and that existing law is inadequate to protect them.they also stated that existing civil rights statutes do little to deter hate violence because there are no criminal penalties.existing criminal statutes trespass,vandalism,do not reflect the seriousness of the problem of racially motivated violence.the purpose of this bill is to give law enforcement officials clear effective authority to prevent acts of hate violence,and to deter such conduct by establishing serious criminal penalties and by a llow ing an individual,or the attorney general,district attorney,or city attorney,to bring an action to enjoin crimes of hate violence where they are threatened.assem.comm.on public safety,analysis of assem.bill as amended,see also venegas,supra,cal th at,d,conc,baxter,describing the historical background of the tom bane civil rights act in re joshua,supra,th at,fn,d referring to section and penal code section as the tom bane civil rights act,and stating that,along with the ralph civil rights act and related statutes,it is california response to the increase in hate crimes cabesuela industries of california,th,d part of tom bane civil rights act.
the legislative history reveals that the broad and plain language of sections and was chosen to provide protection from discriminatory violence and intimidation,and from threats,intimidation and coercion that denied the civil rights of others.the creation of civil causes of action by victims of such conduct was at the heart of the legislation.neither the words of the statutes nor their lineage reflects an explicit intent by the legislature either to include or exclude sections and from the realm of the unruh act.
c.the unruh act.section provides in relevant part,all persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal,and no matter what their sex,race,color,religion,ancestry,national origin,disability,or medical condition are entitled to the full and equal accommodations,advantages,facilities,privileges,or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever,subd.b.the statute prefatory clause states this section shall be known and may be cited as the unruh civil rights act,subd.a,italics added.the act traces its origins to similar legislation enacted in and again in.see historical note,west annot.ed.foll.at.its purpose is to compel recognition of the equality of all persons in the right to the particular service offered by an organization or entity covered by the act.curran mount diablo council of boy scouts d.see also marina point,wolfson cal d.as part of amendments,it was named after california former speaker of the house,jesse unruh.ibid.
although the breadth of the unruh act is wide,its mission explicit,and is to be liberally construed koire metro car wash cal d,our supreme court has stated that the unruh act has no application to employment discrimination.rojo,supra,cal d at,see also alcorn anbro engineering,cal d,alcorn.in alcorn,an employment discrimination case,the supreme court concluded that,notwithstanding the statute extensive reach,there is no indication that the legislature intended to broaden the scope of section to include discriminations other than those made by a business establishment in the course of furnishing goods,services or facilities to its clients,patrons or customers.id.at,see also isbister boys club of santa cruz,cal d,fn,relationship is not covered by the unruh act.
interplay among the unruh act and the ralph and tom bane civil rights acts 
in their opposition to the petition for extraordinary writ,real parties state their principal argument in words that could not be clearer civil code sections and are part of the unruh civil rights act,civil code sections et from this proposition,real parties argue that since the two statutes in question are part of the unruh act and since rojo holds the unruh act does not apply to employment cases,it flows that stamps can not base his third cause of action on sections and.
we find two flaws in this argument.first,neither legislative history nor case law supports the conclusion that sections and are included in what is known as the unruh act.second,even if the unruh act reach did extend to these two statutes,there is nothing in rojo that suggests the supreme court intended to preclude employment cases from being founded on sections and even if they may not be predicated on section.
a.the unruh act does not include the ralph or tom bane civil rights acts.the parties vigorously debate whether the sections under consideration are or are not part of the unruh act.before we reach our destination,we gently observe a point that is beyond controversy the courts generally have done a poor job of describing the various components of the unruh act.not until did an appellate court tackle the issue head on.in gatto,supra,th,d,the court was confronted with determining the statute of limitations for actions under sections and.the case had nothing to do with employment discrimination rather,a hell angel was ejected from a county fair for not removing his motorcycle club vest.the court refused to assume that the statutes of limitations for the two sections were necessarily the same instead,it initially reflected on the lack of precision in describing the components of the unruh act.
by its own terms,the unruh civil rights act comprises only section.subdivision a of section states this section shall be known,and may be cited,as the unruh civil rights act.italics added.the courts,however,have consistently described as unruh civil rights act claims causes of action based under seemingly related provisions set forth in sections of the civil code that follow section.west shield is a good example.that case presented no claim of denial of full and equal accommodations in violation of section however,the court treated causes of action alleging interference with the exercise of constitutional rights under section,and sexual harassment under section as unruh civil rights act claims.similarly,section was treated as an unruh civil rights act claim in brown smith th,d,as was section in independent housing services,supra.citing several state and federal opinions,the court in doe petaluma city school dist.stated that i t appears that section is at least a component of the unruh civil rights act.id.at.it is noteworthy,however,that in construing section,our supreme court explained that it was enacted by the legislature to stem a tide of hate crimes jones kmart cal th,d,and never referred to it as part of the unruh civil rights act which,at least originally,dealt only with the issue of equal accommodations.other courts have referred to section and related statutes,including section,as part of the bane act.see,bay area rapid transit dist.superior court th,d boccato city of hermosa beach th,d.in re joshua th,d,also refers to section as part of the bane act but refers to section as the ralph civil rights act.boccato,at,fn,d.reference to a statute or statutory scheme by the name of its author does not influence the meaning and effect of the enactment,but an erroneous denotation that includes one measure as part of another may obscure differences that are legally very significant.this is what appears to have happened to the unruh civil rights act,which is increasingly treated as an omnibus antidiscrimination statute no longer limited to merely ensuring equal access to accommodations.for purposes of determining the applicable statute of limitations,this creates a problem,for the provisions now seen as parts of the unruh civil rights act do not all share the same common law provenance.gatto,supra,th,d.
although the gatto court does not unequivocally hold that sections and are not part of the unruh act,we are not so reserved we conclude neither section is part of a properly denominated unruh act this conclusion is based largely on the legislative history that we have described above and is consistent with that reached by two commentators in the civil rights litigation field.their treatise devotes entire sections to two subjects ralph act is not part of the unruh act or feha,and bane act is not part of the unruh act,the ralph act or another statute.kahn and links,cal.civ.practice civil rights litigation.
the authors observe that several cases have erroneously referred to the ralph act as the unruh act.citations.although the ralph act and the unruh act are codified near each other in the,and both share the same remedy statute,there are significant differences between them.the ralph act focuses on violence or intimidation by threat of violence,while those concepts are absent in the unruh act.the unruh act,is a public accommodations statute that focuses on discriminatory behavior by business establishments,while the ralph act has nothing to do with public accommodations or business establishments.kahn and links,cal.civ.practice civil rights litigation,supra.similarly,many cases have referred to a bane act claim as an unruh act claim stated that the bane act is a component of the unruh act.id,at.this,the authors assert,is erroneous.ibid.we agree 
real parties authorities are not persuasive.the cases on which real parties rely to support their argument that section and are part of the unruh act do not so hold.as gatto observes,those cases generally reflect a lack of clarity as to which provisions of the civil code actually comprise the unruh civil rights act gatto,supra,th at,d.for the most part,these authorities do not even discuss sections or and had no cause to decide what provisions actually comprise the unruh act.
for example,in los angeles county metropolitan transportation authority superior court th,d,the court was confronted with whether government code section prohibiting punitive damages against public entities applied to section,subdivision b which allows for a civil penalty the court of appeal framed the case thusly in this writ proceeding,we are asked to address the novel question of whether section precludes the award of the civil penalty specified in the unruh civil rights act,et.unruh act for the violation of certain of its provisions.los angeles county metropolitan transportation authority superior court,supra,at,d.neither in its prefatory statement nor in connection with the several other occasions where it used the term unruh act did the court have occasion to consider whether sections or were part of the unruh act.that determination was not germane to the issue of whether the california tort claims act forbade the civil penalty from being imposed against the municipal defendant.if the court had eliminated all references to the unruh act and instead had identified the statutes only by their code section,its analysis would have been intact.see also schifando city of los angeles cal th,d,schifando referring to unruh act as,et major miraverde homeowners th,d unruh civil rights act,section et schmidt superior court cal d,unruh act as section et,but only addressing section and section dealing with age discrimination in housing.
in gates superior court th,d,the appellate court was also presented with the relationship between the civil code and the tort claims act.there the precise issue was whether the government code section that precluded civil lawsuits for failure to provide police protection applied to claims under sections and.the court answered the question affirmatively.ibid.as was the case in los angeles county metropolitan transportation authority superior court,the court of appeal made repeated references to the unruh act.but again,whether or not individual code sections were or were not part of the unruh act had no bearing on its analysis.
finally,references to the unruh act are found in west shield,supra,th at pages,d,in the same context as the other appellate decisions cited above.the issue there was whether a personal injuries or liability founded on a statute statute of limitations applied to claims under sections and in concluding that the statute applied,the court of appeal noted that what it called the various unruh act statutes were all rooted in the common law and hence did not qualify for the longer limitations period.again,the analysis did not turn on whether a particular statute was or was not properly included in the legislative short title 
real parties also rely on several federal cases that discuss the relationship of the various statutes starting with section.mccalden california library association,et cir,mccalden,is arguably the most helpful to their position.there,a holocaust revisionist brought suit in federal court.he included a claim under section,in which he claimed intimidation because of his political beliefs.the ninth circuit assumed that section was part of the unruh act,stating the california courts,however,have considered to be a component of the unruh civil rights act.see long valentino,d.mccalden,at.mccalden does use section authority to support its conclusion that the various categories enumerated in section,race,national origin are not exclusive and the protected classes include membership in political groups.id.at.again,however,there is no effort to analyze how section is or is not part of the unruh act.the fact that closely related statutes may be used to assist in statutory interpretation does not mean that one is included in the other.rather,mccalden approach was an application of a venerable method of statutory construction.see hicks legg associates th,d a statute is not to be read in isolation it must be construed with related statutes and considered in the context of the statutory framework as a whole.unquestionably,sections and are related to the unruh act.
waters,also cited by real parties,involved a section action in the employment context,the setting present here.however,the court dismissed the case without a discussion of the merits of the controversy,as the plaintiff had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies.
remarkably,real parties also direct our attention to taormina california department of corrections,taormina.taormina involves a federal civil rights action against a state correctional facility over an injury to an inmate.the opinion addresses pendent state claims which appear to be based primarily on sections,arbitrary discrimination in business establishments,and section.id.at.the court described the plaintiff complaint as follows plaintiff fifth cause of action interference with statutory and constitutional rights is premised on the banes sic act,section et seq in omitting reference to the unruh act,the opinion not only misidentifies section,it does so by misspelling the name of the author of section 
rojo does not address whether employment discrimination cases may be based on sections or.real parties central assertion is that the supreme court case of rojo,supra,cal d,compels the ruling of the trial court.their argument is founded on the assumption that sections and are part of the unruh act,and rojo statement that the unruh civil rights act has no application to employment discrimination.id.at,see also id.at.as we have already discussed,sections and are not part of the unruh act,thus kicking out the underpinnings of real parties contention.more fundamentally,rojo has nothing to do with the statutes involved in this case.
the issues articulated by the supreme court in rojo were whether the fair employment and housing act feha,et provides the exclusive remedy for injuries relating to sex discrimination in employment whether an employee must exhaust the administrative remedies under the feha as a prerequisite to pursuing a civil action and whether sex discrimination in employment may give rise to a claim of wrongful discharge in contravention of public policy.rojo,supra,cal d at.these subjects are not present here.
as to the code sections that comprise the unruh act,the supreme court mentioned the statute by name five times.twice,it was with specific reference to section rojo,supra,cal d at,fn,twice to both sections and id.at,and once without reference to any code section at all id.at.concerning the language seized upon by real parties in support of their position here,the supreme court expressly referred to section no specific mention was made of civil code section because none was needed the unruh civil rights act has no application to employment discrimination.id.at,
rojo stands for the proposition that violations of section may not be asserted in the employment context.this rule is consistent with supreme court precedent cited in rojo.see isbister boys club of santa cruz,supra,cal d,fn,alcorn,supra,cal d at,see also alch,supra,th at,d.but rojo does not mention either section or section,and the two earlier supreme court decisions were authored before either statute had become law.
the rule that employment cases can not be based on section is explained simply section,on its face,applies to accommodations,advantages,facilities,privileges,or services in business establishments.as the court in alcorn stated,there is no indication that the legislature intended to broaden the scope of section to include discriminations other than those made by a business establishment in the course of furnishing goods,services or facilities to its clients,patrons or customers.alcorn,supra,cal d at.
thus,even if we were to conclude that sections and were part of the unruh act which we do not,the rule expressed in rojo would have no application to the present case,as neither statute contains the limiting statutory language of section that was instrumental to rojo holding.see little auto stiegler,cal th,d,cases are not authority for propositions not considered.
sections and authorize a private cause of action in employment cases 
in the preceding sections we have held that sections and are not part of the unruh act and neither rojo,the cases on which it is based,nor any other authorities cited by real parties prohibit a statutory claim in employment cases.our inquiry is not over.ultimately,the question before us is whether the statutes in question do create a private cause of action in the employment field.at its core,this is a matter for the legislature.the question of whether a regulatory statute creates a private right of action depends on legislative intent.goehring chapman university th,d.the legislature also has the power to limit private statutory civil actions to,for example,certain classes of individuals or types of claims.see faria san jacinto unified school dist.th,d.
here,there is no doubt that private causes of action are expressly authorized by both sections and.a civil action under section is provided for in section,subdivision b,which provides that anyone who commits an act proscribed in section is liable for the actual damages suffered by any person denied that right.additional private remedies include punitive damages,a civil penalty and attorneys fees,sub.b.these rights are separate from those given to the attorney general and other prosecutors,who may seek certain relief,subd.c.
section provides that any individual whose rights under the statute have been interfered with may institute and prosecute in his or her own name and on his or her own behalf a civil action for damages,subd.b.a plaintiff may recover damages,obtain an injunction,other equitable relief and attorneys fees,subd.h,and his or her right to proceed is independent of relief available under section,subd.g.the attorney general and other prosecutors likewise have standing,subd.a.
private causes of action under sections and have been recognized by the appellate courts.see venegas,supra,cal th at,d,jones kmart,supra,cal th at,d,bay area rapid transit dist.superior court,supra,th at,d boccato,supra,th,d winarto toshiba america electronics components,cir,and fn.
since private civil remedies have been expressly authorized by the two statutes,we turn to whether there is anything in these laws that evinces an intent by the legislature to prohibit their use in actions involving discrimination and other wrongdoing in the employment sector.we find nothing.
on their face,neither section nor section is restricted to certain types of cases as long as the proscribed conduct is involved.these statutes were designed to stem the number of hate crimes which the legislature recognized had grown to an alarming proportion.see assem.com.on labor relations,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.april,assem.comm.on public safety,analysis of assem.bill as amended,see also venegas,supra,cal th at,d,conc,baxter,sadly,hate does not end when an employee walks through the door of his or her place of employment.the staggering impact of cases of workplace violence based on race,religion and other classifications described in these statutes is unfortunately known to us too well.see generally national institute of health,civil,http civil.nih.gov whatis.html last visited feb.
given this obvious state of affairs,we would find it odd that the legislature intended to exclude employment discrimination,workplace violence and similar cases based on race or other characteristics from the protections of these statutes.the legislative history reveals no such intent,which eventually became section,was assigned to the assembly committee on labor relations,a committee whose responsibilities included employment matters.a report from that committee acknowledged that,at the time of drafting,there were numerous laws protecting civil rights in employment,housing and access to public accommodations and facilities.assem.com on labor relations,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.april.nevertheless,the report expressed concern that there was no specific prohibition protecting individuals from violence because of their race,religion,ancestry,or national origin.ibid.since employment was expressly mentioned in the report,it appears obvious that cases of this sort were intended to be included within the act coverage.one of the specific advantages of the proposed legislation was that an individual could immediately file a private civil action while at the same time pursuing a complaint with the fepc.assem.com on labor relations,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.april.obviously,fepc complaints included workplace matters.similarly,the breadth of the assembly report for ab,which eventually became section,reflects the continuing concern over violence.nothing suggests an intent to exclude the workplace.see assem.comm.on public safety,analysis of assem bill as amended.
we have found no california case that squarely upholds a private action under either section or in the employment context.our supreme court in schifando,supra,cal th,d,seems to have assumed such a cause of action exists.the more narrow issue addressed by the court in schifando was whether a city employee was required to exhaust both feha and the city charter administrative remedies as a condition to filing his employment discrimination suit.in the course of its discussion,the court stated in other words,although the feha does not limit the application of other state statutes,or constitutional provisions involving discrimination,it expressly preempts local governmental laws,regulations,and procedures that would affect the rights included in its provisions.id.at,d.
the same assumption was made in hour fitness,superior court th,d,in which the appellate court affirmed an order compelling arbitration of the plaintiff claims.one of the causes of action ordered into arbitration was a section claim against the plaintiff employer.
in winarto toshiba america electronics components,supra,at pages,the circuit upheld a jury verdict based on,among other things,sections and for workplace violence motivated by gender and national origin bias.the court construed the statutes broadly in keeping with their statutory purpose.t here is no requirement that the violence be extreme or motivated by hate in the plain language of the sections,or in the cases construing them there is also no requirement that the act constitute a crime.if the california legislature wanted to limit the reach of the statute to extreme,criminal acts of violence,it could have explicitly said so.what it did instead was create civil liability which sweeps more broadly than the common,colloquial meaning of the phrase hate crime.id.at.there was no discussion that the statutes could not be used in a private civil action for workplace violence or intimidation.
finally,in diem city and county of san francisco,the plaintiff filed a religious discrimination claim against his former employer.the defendant claimed a cause of action based on section was preempted by feha.the united states district court denied motions for judgment on the pleadings and summary judgment on the statutory claim,holding this civil code section asserts that california residents have a right to be free from violence or threats of violence directed against them on account of,among other factors,their religion.civil code b permits anyone whose rights under section have been violated to collect both actual and statutory damages.sections e and f specifically provide that this statute furnishes an independent basis for recovery apart from the fair employment and housing act.plaintiff has alleged sufficient threats of violence,notwithstanding the assault,to state a cause of action under this section.see also burnette godshall,private cause of action under section based on workplace assault by not preempted.
we conclude that nothing in either the language of sections and or in their history expresses a legislative intent to exclude employment discrimination or other employment cases from their ambit.on the contrary,given the need for employees to be protected from the conduct condemned by the ralph civil rights act of and the tom bane civil rights act,limitations as suggested by real parties would do serious disservice to the effectiveness of this legislation.
