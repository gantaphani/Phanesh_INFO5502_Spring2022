discussion 
legal standard and standard of review 
the eaja provides that a court shall award to a prevailing party other than the united states fees and other expenses unless the court finds that the position of the united states was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.d a.the government position is substantially justified if it is justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person and has a reasonable basis both in law and fact.pierce underwood,internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the government position includes the prelitigation actions of the relevant administrative agency,as well as the department of justice litigation arguments.see smith principi,fed.cir.although the government position involves both prelitigation and litigation conduct,only one threshold determination for the entire civil action is to be made.ins jean,footnote omitted.
we review the cit determination to award attorney fees under the eaja for abuse of discretion.see chiu united states,fed.cir.o nly if the cit erred in interpreting the law or exercised its judgment on clearly erroneous findings of material fact,or its decision represents an irrational judgment in weighing the relevant factors can its decision be overturned.id.citations omitted.
ii.the cit did not abuse its discretion by awarding attorney fees to icp 
the cit found that the government position was not substantially justified and,consequently,awarded attorney fees to icp.icp vii,supp.at.the cit determined that t he record,considered as a whole,establishe d that the g overment position was rooted in a desire to avoid the timely revocation process by using the notice of action,rather than following the procedures of c,to improperly revoke the ruling letter.id.at.thus,the cit held that the g overnment position was not founded on a reasonable basis both in law and fact,justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person.id.quoting pierce,at.
the government argues that the cit abused its discretion by committing five legal errors using an improperly heightened legal standard,appellant br.reject ing the notion that surviving a motion to dismiss or a motion for summary judgment indicates that the surviving party has presented significant evidence that its position is substantially justified,id.at improperly minimiz ing the significance of the government trial evidence because of the government decision not to appeal adverse factual findings,id.at rejecting the government position that an eaja award was not warranted in light of the novel or unsettled area of law upon which one of the government defenses was based,id.at and find ing that customs was not substantially justified in its actions during the administrative phase of the matter,id.at.we address these arguments in turn.
a.the cit did not apply a heightened legal standard 
the government first argues that the cit misapplied the substantially justified standard when it stated that the substantial justification standard is slightly more stringent than a simple reasonableness standard,and requires that the government show that its position was clearly reasonable,because the supreme court rejected the slightly more and clearly standards in pierce.id.at quoting icp vii,supp.at.according to the government,the recitation of the slightly more and clearly standards undermines the cit entire substantial justification review and,thus,the fee award should be vacated and the matter remanded with instructions to apply the proper legal standard.id.at.we disagree.
the government is correct that the cit erred by reciting in the standard of review section of its opinion the slightly more and clearly standards,which the supreme court rejected in pierce.see at rejecting the slightly more and clearly standards internal quotation marks and citation omitted.however,a single reference to an incorrect legal standard does not undermine a final decision,only its application does.although the cit referenced the slightly more and clearly standards once,icp vii,supp.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted,it repeatedly applied the correct substantially justified standard,evaluating whether the government position was justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person and had a reasonable basis both in law and fact,pierce,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.indeed,the cit repeated the word reasonable or its variants no less than nine times when evaluating the government position.see icp vii,supp.at.
in contrast,there are no instances where the cit actually applied the slightly more and clearly standards,as the government acknowledged during oral argument.see oral argument at,stating that it true that when the cit made its actual findings,it used the word reasonableness and did restate the clearly reasonable standard or restate the slightly more stringent standard.the government nevertheless argues that the cit recitation of the heightened standards infected the cit entire analysis.id.at.however,the government cites no affirmative evidence in support of its argument,and speculation does not demonstrate reversible error.see rogers united states,fed.cir.holding that speculation can not demonstrate an abuse of discretion.as a result,the cit lone recitation of the slightly more and clearly standards,when viewed against the remainder of the cit analysis,did not constitute an abuse of its discretion.
surviving summary judgment alone does not prove that the government position was substantially justified 
the government next contends that surviving a motion for summary judgment strongly suggests that the government position was substantially justified for eaja purposes and that,consequently,the cit erred by holding otherwise.appellant br.in particular,the government alleges that the cit committed legal error because it presented sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment,wh
