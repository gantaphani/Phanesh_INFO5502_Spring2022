opinion of the court 
this appeal arises out of a class action filed on behalf of investors in cendant corporation cendant after cendant disclosed prior accounting irregularities on april,several actions were filed as a result of this disclosure,including an action commenced on june,on behalf of purchasers of cendant feline prides shares.the prides litigation was subsequently consolidated with the other pending cendant actions.however,on august,the district court ruled that separate lead plaintiffs and lead counsel were to represent the interests of the prides shareholders,as distinct from the rest of the cendant class.
the firm of kirby,mcinerney squire,formerly kaufman,malchman,kirby squire,kirby was appointed as lead counsel of the cendant prides class.on november,kirby filed a motion for class certification,for summary judgment on the claims under of the securities act,and for injunctive relief.on behalf of the prides class,kirby entered into a proposed settlement agreement with cendant on march,and a half months after kirby motions were filed and no more than nine months after the action had been started.
under the settlement agreement,cendant agreed to issue rights to new prides,with a stated value of.those rights were in trade for existing prides.the total possible number and amount of rights to be distributed pursuant to the agreement was,with an approximate stated value of.regarding kirby attorneys fees,the settlement agreement provided cendant will take no position on an application by lead counsel for an award of fees and expenses provided that such application shall not request fees in excess of percent sic of the aggregate stated value of rights,which is approximately,plus reasonable expenses incurred by lead counsel in connection with this action.
the notice of pendency of class action summarized the proposed settlement of the prides litigation.in connection with lead counsel fees and expenses,the notice stated lead counsel has notified the other signatories hereto that it intends to apply to the court for an award of fees,in an amount not to exceed of the aggregate stated value of rights,or approximately million,plus reasonable expenses.the notice went on to explain how the attorneys fees would be paid,first out of unclaimed rights,then out of opt out rights,then out of the rights of class members with claims 
the notice also asserted 
you also should know that the lead counsel appointment process included a bidding process.this was intend to assure that the largest possible portion of any recovery remained with participating class members,or conversely that qualified lead counsel took the least possible sums from the benefits to be obtained by participating class members.in lead counsel view,under the fee mechanism proposed by lead counsel and described herein,there is a substantial likelihood that a substantial part,if not all,of the fees sought will be obtained from unclaimed rights and opt out rights.as a consequence,in lead counsel view,those class members who become authorized claimants will not have to pay any of lead counsel fees,or if they do,there is a substantial likelihood that it will be less than the amount otherwise payable under the bids approved by the court in the process of appointing lead counsel.
on may,the joanne aboff trust trust filed several objections to the notice of settlement,all of which pertained to kirby representation and fee request as well as a notice of its intention to appear at the settlement hearing.at the settlement hearing on may,lead counsel stated that t here is no objection to the settlement,and the trust attorneys objected only to selection of class counsel and kirby request for attorneys fees.
on june,the district court signed an opinion and order approving the settlement,stating the court considers the settlement to be eminently fair and reasonable.the class is made completely whole by such compensation.there are no objections voiced to the to the request for attorney fees.the proposed settlement is approved subject to the following modifications to the attorneys fees.in re cendant.prides,d.
the district court granted kirby request for expenses,finding that the requested expenses of were reasonable and necessary to the prosecution of this litigation.d at.then the court found that,for attorneys fees,kirby should receive a number of rights equivalent to of the balance of rights received by the class.that percentage amounts to rights,valued at approximately.the district court directed lead counsel to seek to satisfy payment of these awards of expenses and fees from any unclaimed rights.then,and only then,to the extent that such fees and expenses have not been satisfied by unclaimed rights,shall any deficiency be assessed against and borne by the class.d at.the court went on to instruct that a ny rights unclaimed after authorized class claimants and lead counsel have been issued their entitled rights shall be canceled by cendant corporation.d at.
on june,the district court entered an order and judgment certifying the prides class for settlement,approving the settlement and the distribution of rights and new prides to authorized claimants set forth therein,dismissing with prejudice all settled claims,and awarding lead counsel rights as reasonable attorneys fees and rights as reimbursement of lead counsel reasonable expenses.on the same date and as part of its opinion,the district court denied the trust application for attorneys fees.on july,the trust timely appealed the district court june orders and judgment.
we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to the final order doctrine of,and we review the district court award of attorneys fees for an abuse of discretion,which can occur if the judge fails to apply the proper legal standard or to follow proper procedures in making the determination,or bases an award upon findings of fact that are clearly erroneous.zolfo,cooper,cir quoting,sirote permutt,in re prince,cir.
on august,kirby filed a motion in this court to dismiss the trust appeal for lack of standing,as well as presenting the standing issue in its appellate brief.
before we consider the merits of the trust appeal,a threshold question must be answered does the trust have standing to challenge the district court award of attorneys fees to kirby see steel citizens for a better env t,d stating that t he requirement that jurisdiction be established as a threshold matter spring s from the nature and limits of the judicial power of the united states and is inflexible and without exception.because the core component of standing is an essential and unchanging part of the requirement of article iii,lujan defenders of wildlife,d,we may not hear this appeal if the trust does not have standing.
ordinarily,only a party aggrieved by a judgment or order of a district court may exercise the statutory right to appeal therefrom.a party who receives all that he has sought generally is not aggrieved by the judgment affording the relief and can not appeal from it.deposit guar.bank roper,d emphasis added.in ace heating plumbing crane,the third circuit explicated the application of this principle to class actions,holding aggrieved class members may appeal any final order of a district court in proceedings held pursuant to rule.this general proposition holds true even though such class members have the right to exclude themselves from the class,cir emphasis added.
the standing question in this case is troublesome,because it appears as if the prides settlement has provided the class members with full recovery and because any reduction in the amount of attorneys fees to kirby will not be distributed among the class members,but instead those rights will be returned to and canceled by cendant.therefore,kirby argues,the t rust is not aggrieved by the award of attorneys fees and has no standing to appeal.
while this argument admittedly has a superficial attraction because the prides class members will seemingly recover a return for their claims and kirby fees will not reduce their recovery,we nevertheless hold that the trust does have standing to appeal the award of attorneys fees we base this holding on two related concepts the nature of the relationship between class plaintiffs,class counsel,and defendants in class actions requires that the aggrieved requirement be construed broadly in class action cases and the judiciary independent authority over the appointment of class counsel,the grant of attorneys fees,and the review of attorneys fee awards in class actions.in connection with these two principles,we require that district courts conduct an extensive analysis and inquiry before determining the amount of fees,because we have an independent interest in monitoring district courts fee awards,particularly those awards stemming from rule class actions.see,zucker occidental petroleum,cir see generally advisory committee notes on,notes following rule addressing,inter alia,the question of the measures that might be taken during the course of the action to assure procedural fairness.indeed,we are in effect third parties to the fee award process,albeit silent parties for the most part until the award is finalized and reviewed.
ostensibly,lead class counsel represents all class plaintiffs.however,in attempting to settle a large class action,class counsel must often spend more time negotiating with and interacting with the defendants than with their own clients.this situation presents several dangers.first,as we observed in prandini national tea,a defendant is interested only in disposing of the total claims asserted against it,and the allocation between the class payment and the attorneys fees is of little or no interest to the defense,cir.moreover,the divergence in class members and class counsel financial incentives creates the danger that the lawyers might urge a class settlement at a low figure or on a basis in exchange for treatment for fees.in re general motors.truck fuel tank prod.liab.litig.hereinafter in re gm trucks,cir quoting weinberger great northern nekoosa,cir.
this unique relationship among plaintiffs counsel,plaintiffs,and defendants in class actions imposes a special responsibility upon appellate courts to hear challenges to fee awards by class members whose claims may have been reduced or in some way affected in exchange for large fee awards.see in re gm trucks,at.this is so even in this case,where the trust presumably will not benefit from a reduction in kirby attorneys fees,because the prides settlement was structured so that any remaining rights will be returned to cendant.
the ninth circuit addressed a similar situation in zucker occidental petroleum,cir,pointing out in its discussion that,even where the plaintiff gets the same money whether the fee is cut or not,a client whose attorney accepts payment,without his consent,from the defendants he is suing,may have a remedy,and this remedy may extend to a plaintiff class whose class attorneys accept payment from the defendants the class is suing.at.
the ninth circuit took this reasoning a step further in lobatz west cellular of,in which the court,holding that a class member had standing to appeal an attorneys fee award even though that award was payable independent of the class settlement,stated 
if class counsel agreed to accept excessive fees and costs to the detriment of class plaintiffs,then class counsel breached their fiduciary duty to the class,and any excessive award could be considered property of the class plaintiffs,and any injury they suffered could be at least partially redressed by allocating to them a portion of that award.
lobatz,cir.
under the ninth circuit analysis,therefore,the trust need not benefit from a reduction in kirby fee to have standing to appeal.moreover,the ninth circuit suggested in zucker that the requirement that class plaintiffs be aggrieved should be construed broadly,citing judge sneed observation in his dissent in in re first capital holdings that a rguably,a class member always retains an interest in attorney fees,even when her claims have been met in full.zucker,at quoting in re first capital holdings.fin.prods.sec,cir sneed,dissenting.
as a class member,the trust was eligible to receive one right,a marketable security freely tradeable until february,having the terms described herein for each income prides and growth prides face amount beneficially owned by class members at the close of business on april,if such class member submits a valid and timely proof of claim form.the notice of the proposed settlement stated that e ach right will be designed to have a stated or theoretical value of,but acknowledged that the rights may trade in the market at a price below their theoretical value.moreover,the notice stated that cendant believes that recoverable damages if any per share could be lower or higher than the per prides damages estimated by lead counsel for the class.
though kirby asserts that each class member received full recovery from this settlement,in which case,it is contended,the trust would not be aggrieved by the fee award,the description of the settlement in the notice and its ultimate implementation by class members is uncertain as to class members actual recovery.because class members received rights which must be traded on the market to be liquidated,a number of factors could contribute to class members not receiving the theoretical per right.it is noteworthy that the settlement provided class members with no immediate cash payment,but rather left class members in the position of relying on the marketability of their new rights for reimbursement of their claims.that reliance,apart from any other market risks,might itself be chancy in light of cendant history of accounting irregularities and in light of the recent market and economy slow down.
nor does even a recovery in cash undermine our power and jurisdiction and our special responsibility to review fee awards.indeed,though the fact of market fluctuation and its effect on the value of class members recovery influences our decision that the trust has standing,we are equally convinced of our appellate jurisdiction over class settlements in which plaintiffs received a recovery in cash.indeed,it would be preposterous to hold that,even where a district court awarded a fee of of the recovery to class counsel,we would have no power to review such an inappropriate and outrageous award in the absence of an objector whose claims had been directly reduced as a result of the award.our oversight and supervisory function would necessarily come into play to correct such a decree.this duty of review with which we are vested will be discussed in more detail in the next section.
as indicated above,we are convinced of our obligation to vacate the district court order awarding fees by the special position of the courts in connection with class action settlements and attorneys fee awards.as we observed in in re gm trucks,a thorough review of fee applications is required in all class action settlements.at.specifically,the danger inherent in the relationship among the class,class counsel,and defendants generates an especially acute need for close judicial scrutiny of fee arrangements in class action settlements at.in discussing this duty of district courts to oversee class settlements in in re gm trucks,we explained 
the court oversight task is considerably complicated by the fact that these conflicts are often difficult to discern in the class action context,where full disclosure and consent are many times difficult and frequently impractical to obtain.finally,we emphasize that the court oversight function serves not only to detect instances of the actual abuse that potential conflicts may cause,but also the potential public misunderstandings they may cultivate in regard to the interests of class counsel.
at quoting in re agent orange prod.liab,cir.in other words,we indicated in in re gm trucks the importance of the judicial role in finalizing class action settlements,and we suggested that this importance derived from general concerns about potential public misunderstandings as much as from a desire to protect the plaintiffs in the particular class.
in zucker,in asserting that the district court was required to review the award of attorneys fees regardless of whether anyone had standing to challenge the award,the ninth circuit stated 
in a class action,whether the attorneys fees come from a common fund or are otherwise paid,the district court must exercise its inherent authority to assure that the amount and mode of payment of attorneys fees are fair and proper.this duty of the court exists independently of any objection.therefor e it exists,a fortiori,regardless of whether an objector has a remediable economic stake in the court decision.because the district court had the authority and duty to pass upon the fairness of the attorneys fees settlement independently of whether there was objection,we need not decide whether the objector had standing.
the court in zucker further explained that n o article iii case or controversy is needed with regard to attorneys fees as such,because they are but an ancillary matter over which the district court retains equitable jurisdiction.at.the ninth circuit found support for this proposition in the reasoning of the eighth circuit that because the reasonableness of attorneys fees is within the overall supervisory authority of the court in a class action,the court did not need to reach the question of whether an objector has standing.zucker,at quoting grunin int l house of pancakes,cir.
while the statements in in re gm trucks and zucker refer to the authority of district,not appellate,courts in connection with class action settlements,the cases make clear that reviewing courts retain an most special and predominant the fairness of class action settlements and attorneys fee awards.accordingly,our interest as a reviewing court in ensuring that district courts fulfill their obligations and comply with the instructions and guidelines in this area bolsters our determination that the trust has standing to challenge kirby fee award.
nor is our responsibility in connection with class action matters restricted to reviewing the final fee determination made by the district court.our interest and supervisory role is pervasive and extends not only to the final fee award but also to the manner by which class counsel is selected and the manner by which attorneys fee conditions are established.
here,the district court employed a auction to select class counsel.that process,which occurred virtually at the inception of the instant class action,is itself.as such,it invites,indeed requires,judicial examination and,hence,our jurisdiction.this is so both because of the unique relationship between class members,class counsel,and the defendants in class actions and because of our strong interest in the fair ness of class settlements and the cost of achieving such settlements.see,john coffee,national law journal,at discussing selection of lead counsel through auctions and bidding rules.
because it is the district court function to participate in the litigation process in this way,as the district court did here,and because,as noted,our judicial scrutiny reaches to all corners of the class action process including the selection of class selection which impacts on the final fee award and fairness of the would be remiss if we failed to exercise our jurisdiction in this area.
an analogy,albeit one that is far a field from class action fees,is helpful to illustrate and emphasize the court interest and the role that our interest plays in our decision to hear this appeal.in powers ohio,a case the supreme court held that a white criminal defendant had standing to object to and appeal the exclusion of black jurors through peremptory challenges,even though the defendant and the potential jurors were of different races,d.in its discussion of standing,the court stated 
the discriminatory use of peremptory challenges by the prosecution causes a criminal defendant cognizable injury,and the defendant has a concrete interest in challenging the practice.this is not because the individual jurors dismissed by the prosecution may have been predisposed to favor the defendant if that were true,the jurors might have been excused for cause.rather,it is because racial discrimination in the selection of jurors casts doubt on the integrity of the judicial process,and places the fair ness of a criminal proceeding in doubt.
powers,at.internal citations omitted.
likewise,just as discriminatory selection of jurors casts doubt on the integrity of the judicial process such that the defendant in powers had standing to appeal,the integrity and fairness of class settlements is threatened by excessive attorneys fee awards such that class plaintiffs have standing to challenge excessive fee awards,even when they have received recovery in the class settlement.
because of the possible injury to the trust as well as other class members from the fee award in this case and,more importantly,because of our overarching interest in class fee awards,we therefore hold that the trust has standing to appeal the fee award.accordingly,we now turn to the fee award that the district court granted to kirby and review that award for an abuse of discretion.see in re gm trucks,cir.
there are two primary methods for calculating attorneys fees the method and the lodestar method the method is generally favored in cases involving a common fund and is designed to allow courts to award fees from the fund in a manner that rewards counsel for success and penalizes it for failure.in re prudential,at.the lodestar method is more commonly applied in statutory cases,and is designed to reward counsel for undertaking socially beneficial litigation in cases where the expected relief has a small enough monetary value that a method would provide inadequate compensation.at.
the total settlement in this case was valued at,and the district court granted attorneys fees in the amount of as the district court noted,this amount constitutes of the class total recovery.in connection with the lodestar calculation,the district court observed that lead counsel,through its principal partners,associates,and paralegals expended approximately hours,and its senior partners have a regular hourly rate of.d at.using the hourly rate,the lodestar multiplier for the district court fee award is 
two primary principles govern our review of the district court fee award to kirby did the district court provide sufficient explanation for granting the fee award of million and was the award so unreasonably high that the district court abused its discretion in granting that amount in attorneys fees 
in gunter ridgewood energy,we considered a district court award of attorneys fees in a class action settlement.cir.that case involved a million settlement,out of which the district court allowed attorneys fees amounting to of the settlement fund,significantly less than the requested by the attorneys.at.the district court in gunter explained its decision as follows the nature of this litigation,its resolution at this stage without the necessity of trial,the nature of the settlement,and its value,convince the court that it would place a reasonable burden on the class to award attorneys fees of of the settlement fund,or.at citing gunter ridgewood energy,civ.whw,at.the attorneys appealed the district court reduction of their fee request.
in reviewing the district court fee award in gunter,we stated that w e give a great deal of deference to a district court decision to set fees.at.however,we noted,n otwithstanding our deferential standard of review,it is incumbent upon a district court to make its reasoning and application of the jurisprudence clear,so that we,as a reviewing court,have a sufficient basis to review for abuse of discretion.at.therefore,if the district court opinion is so terse,vague,or conclusory that we have no basis to review it,we must vacate the order and remand for further proceedings.at.in addition,if a district court does not fulfill its duty to apply the relevant legal precepts to a fee application,it abuses its discretion by not exercising it.at.
in gunter,we vacated the district court fee award because the district court dealt with the issue in a cursory and conclusory fashion and did not employ the factors which this court has stated that district courts should consider in awarding fees using the method in class actions.see gunter,at.these factors were set forth in gunter in a footnote 
among other things,these factors include the size of the fund created and the number of persons benefitted the presence or absence of substantial objections by members of the class to the settlement terms fees requested by counsel the skill and efficiency of the attorneys involved the complexity and duration of the litigation the risk of nonpayment the amount of time devoted to the case by plaintiffs counsel and the awards in similar cases.
gunter,at citing in re prudential,cir in re gm trucks,cir.
as in gunter,the district court fee opinion in this case was too cursory for us to have a sufficient basis to review for abuse of discretion.gunter,at.the district court did not even specify whether it was using the method or the lodestar method to set attorneys fees.nor,if the district court intended to utilize the lodestar method,did it calculate the lodestar multiplier.rather,the district court,in a conclusory paragraph bereft of analysis,stated 
this court has examined the time expended by lead counsel and the regular hourly rates of its services.lead counsel,through its principal partners,associates,and paralegals expended approximately hours,and its senior partners have a regular hourly rate of.this represents significant effort.but the court is more impressed by the quality of result than the quantity of effort.the class will receive its full entitlement.and resolution of this matter was greatly accelerated by the creative dynamism of counsel.for this,counsel should not be penalized by a slavish application of the lodestar.we have seen the gifted execution of responsibilities by a lead counsel.
d at.despite the district court obvious dissatisfaction with the lodestar method,the court did not even address the method,except to the extent that it calculated that the fee award constituted of the total class recovery.
the method has long been used in this circuit in cases.indeed,in the third circuit task force report entitled court awarded attorney fees,the task force discussed the problems with the lodestar method in detail.accordingly,the task force recommend ed that in the traditional situation,the district court should attempt to establish a percentage fee arrangement.task force report.since that time,we have several times reaffirmed that application of a method is appropriate in cases.see,gunter ridgewood energy,cir brytus spang,cir in re prudential,cir in re gm trucks,cir.
though this is not a traditional case,because the unclaimed portion of the settlement fund is returned to cendant and because the plaintiffs who recover may not be affected by the attorneys fee award depending on the number of plaintiffs who recover rights from the fund,use of the method is appropriate in this case.since the district court highlighted the inadequacy of the lodestar method,it can be assumed that that court also perceived that the percentage method was a better method of calculating attorneys fees in this case.this is consistent with the district court opinion awarding attorneys fees in the larger and separate cendant settlement,in which it did declare,f ollowing established third circuit law,the court will award fees by a method.in re cendant,d,
as discussed above,we have articulated at least seven factors to be considered by district courts in setting percentage fee awards in common fund cases.see gunter,cir.the district court,however,did not explicitly consider any of these factors in addition to rejecting the lodestar method,the district court stated the court appreciates lead counsel verve and the eminently satisfactory results it obtained for the class.there are no objections to the settlement agreement.d at.in addition,the district court mentioned the initial sealed bidding process and referred to the resulting bid to which kirby agreed as a benchmark of reasonableness.d at quoting in re cendant.however,when it came to setting the fee award,the district court said simply,t he court deter mines that counsel fees of of this net balance of the total award less lead counsel expenses of are reasonable.d at.
it could be argued that,in the few terse statements quoted above,the district court took into account three of the seven gunter factors the presence or absence of substantial objections by members of the class to the settlement terms fees requested by counsel the skill and efficiency of the attorneys involved and the amount of time devoted to the case by plaintiffs counsel.gunter,at.however,the district court brushed over our required analysis of those factors in setting the attorneys fees.
significantly,the district court did not consider at all the other factors which we deem to be more important in this case,namely the complexity and duration of the litigation and the range of awards in similar cases.at emphasis added.nor does it appear that the district court ed the percentage award against the lodestar award method,which is suggested practice for district courts setting fee awards by the method.gunter,at.further,the district court did not make its reasoning and application of the jurisprudence clear.gunter,at 
because the district court failed to consider the gunter factors that we deem essential to a proper exercise of discretion and to an appropriate consideration of attorneys fee awards,we will discuss those factors here.
complexity and duration of litigation 
in april,cendant announced past accounting irregularities and stated that its financial statements for certain past years would be restated.d at.on behalf of the cendant prides class,kirby filed an amended and consolidated class action complaint on november,accompanied by a motion for class certification,a motion for summary judgment,and a motion for preliminary injunctive relief.less than two months later,on january,the parties announced that they had reached an agreement in principal sic,and the parties presented a proposed settlement agreement to the district court on march.d at.
as the district court observed,t his stage of the litigation,notwithstanding that lead counsel has moved for summary judgment,is what would be normally the discovery period,very early on in the litigation.d at.the district court also noted that kirby spent approximately hours on this action.
in setting kirby fee award,the district court apparently turned a blind eye to the following factors the case was relatively simple in terms of proof,in that cendant had conceded liability and no risks pertaining to liability or collection were pertinent the case was settled at a very early stage of the litigation,with an agreement being announced two months after kirby filed for class certification and a proposed settlement being submitted to the district court two months after that there was a minimal amount of motion practice in this settlement,kirby submitted only the complaint and three motions,all on the same day discovery was virtually the district court did not mention any depositions taken or document review conducted by kirby and kirby spent a relatively small amount of time on this case compared to the amount of time expended in most other large class actions.
range of awards 
before reviewing specific awards in other large class settlements,we will review generally the range of attorneys fee awards in common fund settlements of class actions.in in re gm trucks,we observed that o ne court has noted that the fee awards have ranged from nineteen percent to percent of the settlement fund,cir citing in re smithkline beckman.sec.we also noted in in re prudential that t he district court examined the fee awards in class actions with recoveries exceeding million and found the fee percentages ranged from to,cir.
however,recently two district courts in this circuit have declined to follow this court statement of the range in in re prudential,stating that the cases cited in in re prudential were all decided at least thirteen years ago.in re ikon office solutions.sec,in re orthopedic bone screw prod.liab,wl,at.indeed,in another cendant opinion dealing with attorneys fees,this same district court stated that,in cases surveyed by lead counsel,a wards ranged from a low of in the case with a million recovery to a high of for cases with recoveries of million and million.in re cendant.sec,d.these varying ranges of attorneys fees confirm that a district court may not rely on a formulaic application of the appropriate range in awarding fees but must consider the relevant circumstances of the particular case.
one important consideration is the size of the settlement.the task force report stated,with reference to fee awards in common fund cases the negotiated fee,and the procedure for arriving at it,should be left to the court discretion.in most instances,it will involve a sliding scale dependent upon the ultimate recovery,the expectation being that,absent unusual circumstances,the percentage will decrease as the size of the fund increases.we called attention to this statement in in re prudential,explaining that t he basis for this inverse relationship is the belief that i n many instances the increase in recovery is merely a factor of the size of the class and has no direct relationship to the efforts of counsel.in re prudential,at quoting in re first fidelity bancorporation sec.accordingly,district courts setting attorneys fees in cases involving large settlements must avoid basing their awards on percentages derived from cases where the settlement amounts were much smaller.
other awards 
the district court did not undertake to review the fees granted in other class action settlement cases,particularly in other large settlement cases,cases in which the common fund exceeded million had it conducted such a review,the district court should have looked specifically at cases in which the method,not the lodestar method,was employed to set the fee award,and it should have examined the reasoning behind the district courts fee awards in cases of similar size.
below,we have set forth a chart of fee awards given in federal courts since in class actions in which the settlement fund exceeded million and in which the percentage of recovery method was used we have outlined the amount of settlement,the percentage of the settlement that made up the attorneys fee award and the lodestar multiplier.
in the charted cases,the attorneys fee awards ranged from to of the total settlement fund.looking at the percentage of recovery in this case,it appears that it is in line with the other cases and even at the low end of the range.however,a brief review of the facts and posture of these other cases makes clear that,when examined through the lens of gunter,the higher fees awarded in the other cases were far more justified than the high award in this case.accordingly,the district court should have learned from those cases that extensive time and effort exerted by the attorneys and the existence of complex legal and factual issues warranted higher fee awards than the fee award that would have been appropriate for kirby.
the district court in in re auction houses relied on a bidding process in awarding attorneys fees.the bidding process in that case differed from the process employed by the district court in this case,but it raised similar problems.however,regardless of the arguable flaws in the method by which the district court awarded fees in in re auction houses,that case was far more complex than the instant case and,as such,is distinguishable.indeed,the comments of interim lead counsel,excerpted in the district court opinion,are telling 
furth,on behalf of all of the interim lead counsel,said that he never in his fondest dreams believed that these defendants would pay million and that this settlement is the most outstanding result i have ever heard of in the history of the antitrust laws.another of the interim lead counsel noted that he and his colleagues had been negotiating with defendants prior to the appointment of plaintiffs lead counsel,that they had really good hard solid numbers from defendants,and we did think we could have accomplished what boies did.
in re auction houses antitrust,wl,at.
in in re orthopedic bone screw,the district court described the case as nothing less than an uninterrupted,antagonistic legal battle,in which the attorneys seeking fees had conducted substantial,widespread and extensive discovery including reviewing more than pages of documents,and had defended a variety of pleadings and discovery matters and litigated a plethora of motions,which resulted in the court issuing nearly pretrial orders.wl,at.
in in re ikon office solutions,the district court granted the fee request because,inter alia,counsel expended more than hours on this case and paid out expenses of more than million with no guarantee of recovery,the case presented the legal obstacles of establishing scienter,damages,causation,and the like,and derivative counsel fees will be taken from this amount.at.
in shaw toshiba,the district court noted the protracted schedule of the case,because of which it has been necessary to prosecute this action continuously,around the clock,seven days a week,workdays and holidays alike.d at.other factors that made litigation of shaw difficult included the two million pages of documents reviewed by class counsel,the fact that defendant corporate headquarters were located in tokyo,japan,as well as the additional burden of having to translate many documents and much of the testimony from japanese to english.even with these numerous procedural difficulties,the district court only awarded of the settlement in attorneys fees.
the attorneys in sumitomo spent more than hours on the case and inspected million pages of documents,and the case had legal and factual complexities including the existence and analysis of the relationships between and among more than thirty comex futures contracts,more than lme contracts,literally hundreds of physical contracts,and millions of tons involved in the copper futures,the copper options and the copper derivative contracts.sumitomo,d at.
in kurzweil,the district court noted that,before the settlement,t here had been no large settlements in tobacco litigation generally,and no successful action had yet been brought against a tobacco company based on allegations of addictiveness of nicotine.wl,at.in addition,the attorneys encountered several obstacles,including that the action was originally dismissed,and the attorneys reviewed millions of documents and tens of thousands of deposition and trial transcripts and conducted numerous depositions.wl,at.
in in re lease oil,the district court explained 
as well as being novel,this litigation was highly complex and thus required a great deal of lawyering skill.as just explained,the task of simply compiling the evidence was an unusually difficult task,requiring the assistance of experts and the investment of many hours also,being novel,the legal issues raised in the litigation required skilled attorneys to handle them.
the district court in copley,in granting the fee award,observed that,d uring expedited discovery,class counsel reviewed and analyzed more than pages of documents and deposed roughly one hundred witnesses.d at.the case also included days of trial,and class counsel spent hours on the case.finally,the legal questions involved in copley were both novel and complex.as the court explained not only was the certification of this class a complex question,but this was also the first and only mass tort class action to go to trial,and the case presented complex medical and scientific issues of causation.d at.
painewebber too had many features that would dictate a high fee award.class counsel conducted extensive,coordinated discovery,including coordinating discovery of hundreds of boxes of documents through the use of sophisticated computer databases,and deposing many key witnesses.at.in more than two years of litigation,counsel spent approximately hours in heretofore uncompensated legal work in pursuit of factual investigation,drafting of documents,brief writing,document analysis,depositions,trial preparation,settlement negotiation and other tasks.at.finally,the legal issues in painewebber were complex,and class counsel faced significant substantive and procedural defenses.at.
walco investments was described by the district court as comprising four years of litigation.at.the case involved multiple defendants,and the claims were only loosely related,making class litigation exceedingly complicated,because claims raised against each category of defendants presented separate issues of fact and law and involved differing theories of recovery.at.these circumstances encouraged the court to award in attorneys fees to attorneys from fourteen different firms representing class plaintiffs.
the action in in re combustion was eleven years old at the time of settlement and the attorneys had spent over hours on the case.in the litigation,there had been roughly complaints filed,answers,motions,with almost memoranda in support of or in opposition to these motions,depositions,hearings,at least one oral argument per month since the case was removed to federal court,and endless numbers of settlement conferences,as well as three fairness hearings,the first one lasting one week,and the other two lasting approximately one day each and one daubert hearing lasting a total of two weeks.in re combustion.at.
in local,the court acknowledged the complexity of the issues in this case,the significant attendant risks of proceeding with litigation,and the tenacity and vigor with which all counsel represented their clients interests,in this class action which lasted for four years.at.even so,class counsel fees amounted to only of the total settlement,a far smaller percentage than the fee awarded to kirby by the district court.
in bowling,the district court averred that t he court choice of a percentage will be heavily informed by the value of the services rendered by counsel.at.the court observed that counsel were confronted with myriad complex legal and factual questions in bringing this action and in negotiating the settlement.at.
domestic air involved a class action against several airline companies claiming a conspiracy to fix prices.the court observed 
counsel negotiated a significant settlement for the class in light of the precarious financial position of most of the defendants and over defendants insistence that they could not provide a larger cash settlement.were it not for the considerable skill and effort of plaintiffs counsel,the action would never have been certified as a class action and members of the class would receive nothing in return for their claims against defendants.
in other words,the action in domestic air involved fundamental procedural obstacles that could easily have resulted in no recovery at all.accordingly,class counsel was rewarded significantly for negotiating such a large settlement.
finally,in in re mgm grand hotel,the court considered the particular and unique circumstances of this case,including the fact that the attorneys had recovered over objects from the fire site and had conducted over depositions,in granting the fee award.at.
indeed,in case after case,the same factors recur complex novel legal issues,extensive discovery,acrimonious litigation,and tens of thousands of hours spent on the case by class counsel.because none of these factors which increase the complexity of class litigation was present here,it makes sense that the fee awarded in this case should be far lower than those awarded in the charted cases,which fees ranged from to of the total settlement.
also relevant to the district court analysis in this case is our holding in in re prudential remanding the case to the district court.in that case,we rejected an award of of the settlement fund in a case with a fund of billion to billion because the district court had failed to explain adequately why it had applied such a high percentage to the settlement figure and because the court had not explained why the lodestar multiplier was justified.we also warned in in re prudential against overemphasizing counsel role in recovery,in the context of our criticism of the district court assumption that counsel had been a catalyst for a plan authored by the multi state life insurance task force,which facilitated the class action settlement in that it established prudential liability.we explained that a llowing private counsel to receive fees based on the benefits created by public agencies would undermine the equitable principles which underlie the concept of the common fund,and would create an incentive for plaintiffs attorneys to minimize the costs of failure by free riding on the monitoring efforts of others.in re prudential,at.similarly,as we have consistently observed,cendant liability and consequent collectability had been conceded at the outset of the prides controversy,and that fact should have been given major consideration by the district court when setting kirby attorneys fees.
our review of the lack of complexity of this case and of awards in other large class action settlements,all of which involved more complex issues,more time invested by the attorneys,and,with only a few exceptions,smaller total settlements,leads us to the conclusion that the district court abused its discretion in granting a attorneys fee award in this case 
checking against lodestar 
the district court abuse of discretion in this case is magnified when one looks at the lodestar multiplier.as we stated above,we have suggested that district courts the percentage award at which they arrive against the lodestar award method.gunter ridgewood energy,cir see also in re prudential,at stating that it is sensible for a court to use a second method of fee approval to cross check its initial fee calculation.even when the lodestar method is used only as a,courts must take care to explain how the application of a multiplier is justified by the facts of a particular case.in re prudential,at.
in this case,the lodestar multiplier is at a minimum using kirby senior partner rate as the rate for all hours,and the trust calculates the lodestar multiplier as either of these multipliers kirby multiplier of or the trust multiplier of is substantially higher than any of the multipliers in the cases charted above,which range from to,and is also significantly higher than the large multiplier in in re prudential,which we questioned because the court offer ed little explanation as to why a multiplier was necessary or appropriate.at.in allowing such a high multiplier in this case without even calculating it,much less explaining how it is justified,the district court strayed from all responsible discretionary parameters in the awarding of kirby attorneys fees.
in all the cases in which high percentages were applied to arrive at attorneys fees,the courts explained the extensive amount of work that the attorneys had put into the case,and appropriately the lodestar multiplier in those cases never exceeded.this range is consistent with the principle that m ultiples ranging from one to four are frequently awarded in common fund cases when the lodestar method is applied.in re prudential,cir quoting herbert newberg alba conte,newberg on class actions,s at ed.in this case,the district court judge made clear that he wanted to reward kirby for kirby quick and beneficial settlement of the case,and that may be a good reason for the fee award to exceed the lodestar,but not to the exclusion of all other factors.on remand of this case to the district court,we strongly suggest that a lodestar multiplier of the highest multiplier of the cases reviewed above is the appropriate ceiling for a fee award,although a lower multiplier may be applied in the district court discretion.the multiplier would result in an award of no more than million for kirby calculating the lodestar at.
we are seriously troubled by the district court award of attorneys fees constituting to of the total settlement.as discussed above,this case was neither legally nor factually complex and did not require significant motion practice or discovery by kirby,and the entire duration of the case from the filing of the amended complaint to the submission of a settlement agreement to the district court was only four months.other cases in which higher percentages were awarded are so dissimilar factually and legally from this case that they can not be relied upon to support the award made in this case.in addition,our discussion and holding in in re prudential requires a holding here that the district court award was an abuse of its discretion,particularly where the district court appeared to be attributing more responsibility to kirby for the quality of the settlement than may legitimately be warranted.accordingly,we will vacate the district court fee award to kirby and remand the issue of kirby attorneys fees to the district court for a more thorough and thoughtful evaluation,including an analysis of,and compliance with,the factors enunciated by us in gunter and in this opinion.
finally,the trust argues that the district court erred in not granting attorneys fees to the trust attorneys for suggesting a bidding process to choose lead counsel and for objecting to lead counsel fee application.
the second circuit stated in white auerbach 
it is well settled that objectors have a valuable and important role to perform in preventing collusive or otherwise unfavorable settlements,and that,as the district court recognized,they are entitled to an allowance as compensation for attorneys fees and expenses where a proper showing has been made that the settlement was improved as a result of their efforts.
ordinarily the trial judge has broad discretion in deciding whether,and in what amount,attorneys fees should be awarded,since he is in the best position to determine whether the participation of objectors assisted the court and enhanced the recovery.
in this case,the district court judge exercised his broad discretion in finding that the trust attorneys had not made the proper showing that the settlement was improved as a result of their efforts.the district court judge made clear that he had considered the idea of a bidding process before the trust attorneys suggested that procedure,stating walker opinions have been out there since at least why do you think that the door was only opened by your key.he also asserted that my last year clerk and i actually had brooded this idea of an auction long before you came down the pike.
with respect to the trust claim that its attorneys objections to the fee application resulted in a reduction of the fee award from million to approximately million,the district court gave no indication that the objections were the reason for the reduction and even stated,if i find that what kirby wants is excessive,i not dependent upon you.hence,because the trust had not demonstrated that it had been responsible for the procedure utilized by the district court or that its actions had resulted in a reduction of kirby fees from million to which are not clearly will sustain the district court in its rulings on these points.
however,our review of the district court attorneys fee award to kirby would not have come about had it not been for the trust appeal.as the ninth circuit observed in zucker occidental petroleum,to which we have earlier adverted,t he contribution a particular class member attorney made,by providing an adversarial context in which the district court could evaluate the fairness of attorneys fees,was substantial,cir.
recognizing this fact,that it was the trust which called our attention to the many aspects of kirby fee award which we have discussed and which we have found requires reconsideration by the district court,we would be remiss if we did not acknowledge this benefit and remand the trust claims for its own attorneys fees to the district court for reconsideration together with kirby fee application.of course,this will require the necessary submissions by the trust attorneys to comply with normal fee procedures.under these circumstances,we think it appropriate for the district court to evaluate the value of the benefit of the trust contribution to the ultimate fee to be decided by the district court on remand and to compensate the trust to that extent 
in so holding,we are fully aware that cendant had agreed not to contest the award of fees as part of its settlement agreement.we also acknowledge that the return to cendant of any unclaimed rights may well enhance the value of cendant rights to its shareholders and rights beneficiaries.
although we will not disturb the settlement itself which has not been challenged on appeal,we will vacate the award of attorneys fees to kirby and remand this case to the district court for a reevaluation of the amount of attorneys fees,both because the district court did not adequately explain its reason for the fee award and because the fee award does not comply with the requirements of our jurisprudence.we will also vacate the district court order denying attorneys fees to the trust and remand for reconsideration in light of the foregoing discussion and opinion.
although there are other defendants,we refer to all the defendants as cendant.
unclaimed rights are defined in the stipulation and agreement of compromise and settlement as rights as to which a timely and valid proof of claim has not been filed by a holder.all unclaimed rights shall be cancelled and cendant shall not issue,sell,or distribute any further rights to any other person.notice of proposed settlement.in addition,the settlement provided that,though merrill lynch beneficially owned prides as of the close of business on april,merrill lynch nevertheless is not a class member and can not recover new prides in connection with the settlement.
the settlement consisted of rights.after subtracting the attorneys fees and expenses for lead counsel,rights remained.proofs of claim were filed with respect to rights,of which rights were validated by the claims administrator as of august.kirby,ex.l,at.pursuant to the settlement agreement,the unclaimed rights that were not used to pay kirby for its fees and expenses were to be canceled by cendant.because the total amount of rights requested in the proofs of claim rights was less than the amount of the settlement,after subtracting the amount to be given to kirby rights,valued at,no claiming class members have had or will have their recovery reduced by the fees and expenses taken by kirby.
the trust objections concerned a confidential supplemental agreement between lead plaintiff and cendant which was included in the settlement but not published and apparently contained information about cendant and lead plaintiff obligations under the settlement and lead counsel excessive fee request.the trust argued,inter alia,that t he combination of this unusual confidential agreement with lead counsel excessive fee request multiplies the potential that the class and the public will suspect that the settlement contains a collusive or improper provision by which lead plaintiff,lead counsel,cendant will benefit at the expense of the class.the text of this supplemental agreement does not appear in the record,nor can we tell if it was discussed in the notice.
the district court judge signed both the opinion and the order and judgment on june,but the opinion was filed on june,and the order and judgment was filed on june.
our holding that the trust has standing to appeal disposes of the motion made by kirby on august,to dismiss the trust appeal.we will deny that motion.
the settlement,as noted above,provides for rights which are freely tradeable until february,which date has passed.the record does not disclose whether all the claimed rights have been traded or the actual value of those rights.hence,because the record is silent and the settlement itself has not been challenged on this appeal,we do no more than call attention to that aspect of the settlement.
we should make clear that we do not attribute any motives or designs to kirby that would indicate any conflict by kirby with its responsibility to the class,nor do we mean to intimate that kirby acted improperly.indeed,as the district court found and we have no reason to dispute,kirby discharged its function as lead counsel in exemplary fashion.the cautions we express,which are present in the unique context of class actions and the fee awards which arise in this context,pertain solely to the issue of whether,where class members have apparently received recovery,standing is available for an objector to a fee award.for all the re
