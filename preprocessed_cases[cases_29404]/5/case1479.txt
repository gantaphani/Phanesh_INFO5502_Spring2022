background 
feco and highway equipment are iowa corporations that manufacture and sell agricultural equipment including spreaders for applying particulate material,such as fertilizer to fields or salt to roads.highway equipment is also the owner of patent the patent,directed to an adjustable spreader that allows for a more precise application of the various types and densities of particulate material.
on october,highway equipment entered into an agreement with feco,authorizing feco to sell highway equipment adjustable spreader.the agreement was governed by the iowa agricultural equipment dealer statute,iowa code,which regulates certain aspects of contractual relationships between agricultural equipment suppliers and dealers.provides,among other things,that a supplier shall terminate a dealership agreement only upon good cause and with at least prior written notice.on september,without good cause and without prior written notice,highway equipment terminated feco as its agricultural equipment dealer.
in december of,or sometime shortly thereafter,feco began manufacturing an adjustable spreader.the patent issued on february.on june,highway equipment sued feco and its president,stan duncalf collectively feco for infringement of the patent.also named as a defendant in that case was doyle equipment manufacturing company doyle.highway equipment averred in its complaint that the district court possessed subject matter jurisdiction over the counts alleging infringement pursuant to a.
feco filed affirmative defenses,based on inventorship and inequitable conduct,and counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment of and invalidity and for tortious interference with a prospective business relationship.feco also sought damages pursuant to for wrongful termination of its dealership agreement with highway equipment.feco asserted that the district court possessed supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaim,alleging violation of the iowa code pursuant to a.feco also sought attorney fees and costs.
on november,highway equipment moved for partial summary judgment on feco counterclaim for damages pursuant to.on march,the district court,by an interlocutory order,granted highway equipment summary judgment motion.the district court held that,as a matter of law,feco was not entitled to damages for wrongful termination of dealership under the statute because the statute expressly lists certain acts that are violations of and wrongful termination of dealership is not enumerated on the list.see highway equipment feco,order see also iowa code.trial on the remaining issues was scheduled to begin in april,with the final pretrial conference set for april.
on march,highway equipment filed a stipulation and motion for dismissal with prejudice of all of its claims against doyle.doyle likewise stipulated to dismiss with prejudice all claims against highway equipment.the next day,on april,highway equipment filed the following declaration and covenant not to sue covenant 
highway equipment company,on behalf of itself and any to the patent,hereby unconditionally and irrevocably covenants not to assert at any time any claim of patent infringement including direct infringement,contributory infringement inducing infringement against feco under the patent,as it currently reads,based on feco manufacture,use,offer for sale,or sale of 
any product that feco currently manufactures 
any product that feco manufactured prior to the date of this declaration.
by order dated that same day,the district court entered a dismissal with prejudice as to the claims between highway equipment and doyle,based on the stipulations between them.because the covenant withdrew the controversy regarding infringement,on april,the district court canceled the jury trial and set april,as the deadline for feco to file a motion for attorney fees under.
on april,feco filed its motion for attorney fees pursuant to and requested a hearing.feco alleged the case was exceptional under because highway equipment engaged in litigation misconduct and inequitable conduct during prosecution of the patent.on april,highway equipment filed an opposition to the motion,contending that the court could not properly entertain the attorney fee issue because highway equipment covenant not to sue feco for infringement divested the court of subject matter jurisdiction over the claim for attorney fees and that,in the alternative,feco did not obtain a disposition on the merits that would make it a prevailing party for purposes of.
on april,pursuant to.a,feco sought an order dismissing highway equipment underlying infringement claim with prejudice and retaining jurisdiction to entertain the fee request.on april,highway equipment filed a brief resisting the motion,arguing that,although the covenant rendered all matters moot such that the court should dismiss all claims,including the fee claim,a dismissal with prejudice was not warranted.on april,feco filed a reply,arguing that a dismissal with prejudice was required under the facts of this case because,among other things,the filing of the covenant is a unilateral declaration of intent not supported by consideration,which highway equipment can attempt to withdraw,amend,or alter at any time.feco april,brief reiterated its demand for dismissal of the patent claims with prejudice,arguing that a bsent a definitive and judicially sanctioned resolution of highway equipment affirmative claims demanding among other things damages for past infringement,the threat of further litigation is substantial.
on april,the district court ruled that,although it was dismissing the entire action under.a in light of the filing of the covenant,it nonetheless retained subject matter jurisdiction over feco fee request under.see highway equipment feco,iowa,april,jurisdiction order.the court also found that it could properly entertain the fee claim because it concluded that feco was a prevailing party for purposes of.the court then set a hearing date on feco fee motion,slip op.at.
on july,after a evidentiary hearing on the fee question,the court found that the case was not exceptional and denied feco request for attorney fees.see highway equipment feco,fee order.on july,the district court entered final judgment,dismissing highway equipment claims against feco and feco counterclaims against highway equipment with prejudice based on the covenant and denying feco claim for attorney fees and costs under.see highway equipment feco,final order.

standard of review 
whether an actual controversy exists to support subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law subject to de novo review.fort james solo cup,citing bp chems.union carbide.the district court factual determinations made in the process of resolving questions of law are reviewed for clear error.see vanguard research,peat.in considering the jurisdictional issues presented herein,we follow the fundamental precept that federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction,empowered to act only within the bounds of article iii of the united states constitution.owen equip.erection kroger,d marbury madison,cranch.see also mansfield,coldwater lake.ry.swan.t he judicial power of the united states must not be exerted in a case to which it does not extend,even if both parties desire to have it exerted.
before considering the effect of the district court dismissal with prejudice,we must first determine whether to apply eighth circuit law or federal circuit law to the question of what effect a dismissal with prejudice has on the legal requirements under.keeping in mind the policy interests both in bring ing about uniformity in the area of patent law and in minimizing confusion and conflicts in the federal judicial system,manildra milling ogilvie mills,citations omitted,and that federal circuit law governs the substantive interpretation of,which is unique to patent law,pharmacia upjohn mylan,we resolve the issue by deciding that the question of the effect of a dismissal with prejudice on is a matter of federal circuit law.we do so in order to promote national uniformity concerning the availability of attorney fees under.were we to apply regional circuit law,the effect of a dismissal with prejudice on might vary with the regional circuit in which the case originated.as discussed below,there is a noted lack of uniformity among the regional circuits regarding the effect of a dismissal with prejudice on the availability for attorney fees.applying our own law will ensure uniformity when patent issues are litigated.we apply a de novo standard of review to this question of law.inland steel ltv steel.
where a district court finds a case exceptional under,this court reviews the underlying factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions without deference.rambus infineon techs.ag.once the district court has found a case to be exceptional,we review any award of attorney fees for an abuse of discretion.id.
highway equipment first argues that the district court erred in retaining jurisdiction over feco request for attorney fees under because,once highway equipment gave feco a covenant not to sue on the patent infringement issues,the court lost article iii subject matter jurisdiction over the fee request.we disagree.under our precedent,the district court correctly retained jurisdiction over feco claim for attorney fees under see,astechnologies,holding that a claim for attorney fees under is independently within the district court federal question jurisdiction imagineering,van klassens,since section appears in title and was enacted as a part of united states patent law,the question whether a case is exceptional within the meaning of section arises under the patent act.cambridge,penn nutrients.
highway equipment also argues that,in the alternative,even if the district court had subject matter jurisdiction,the district court erred in entertaining feco request for attorney fees under because feco did not receive judicial relief on the merits that alters the legal relationship of the parties.highway equipment argues that its strategic decision to file the covenant and not to assert its infringement claim reveals nothing about the merits of highway equipment case.it contends that because the covenant can not be construed as anything other than an abandonment of the litigation,the dismissal,even though characterized as with prejudice,did not and could not change the legal relationship between the parties on the merits of the underlying claim,which was not considered by the district court.we disagree.
provides that t he court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.the supreme court has considered several fee shifting statutes and has consistently held that such statutes prohibit an award of fees to the plaintiff unless the court awards relief on the merits,either through a judgment on the merits or through a settlement agreement enforced through a consent decree.see buckhannon bd.and care home.dep t of health and human,d addressing a request for attorney fees under the fair housing amendments act and the americans with disabilities act see also kentucky graham,d addressing a request for attorney fees under the civil rights attorney fees awards act of.in buckhannon,the supreme court rejected the catalyst theory,which maintained that a plaintiff obtained relief on the merits if the plaintiff achieved its desired result due to the defendant voluntary change in conduct.buckhannon,at.in rejecting this theory,the court explained that the critical focus is not on the defendant voluntary change in conduct,but rather whether there is a judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties.id.at.the court held that a defendant voluntary change in conduct,even if it accomplishes what the plaintiff sought to achieve,lacks the necessary judicial imprimatur on the change.id.we apply the requirements of buckhannon to.see indep.fed of flight attendants zipes,d noting that the similar language of statutes is a strong indication that they are to be interpreted alike.
the dispositive issue is thus whether the dismissal with prejudice had sufficient judicial imprimatur to constitute a judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties.buckhannon,at.
in this case,the district court exercised its discretion in dismissing the patent claims raised in the underlying action with prejudice pursuant to.a.that rule provides in relevant part that an action shall not be dismissed at the plaintiff instance after answer save upon order of the court and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper.as expressly provided in rule,the district court has discretion to condition the plaintiff voluntary dismissal on terms that would avert any prejudice to the defendant,including dismissing the case with prejudice.the eighth circuit has held that voluntary dismissals under.a should be granted only if no other party will be prejudiced.kern txo production,cir.one sort of prejudice that can not be cured simply by a reimbursement of costs and dismissal without prejudice is the loss by defendant of success in the first case.id.stating that i f defendant has already won its case,reimbursement of fees and expenses can not make it whole from the injury of being sued again,perhaps this time to lose.factors that the eighth circuit considers in determining whether to dismiss with or without prejudice include whether the party has presented a proper explanation for its desire to dismiss whether a dismissal would result in a waste of judicial time and effort whether a dismissal will prejudice the defendants and whether a dismissal is sought merely to escape an adverse decision or to seek a more favorable forum.hamm,at.the district court also considers whether the motion to dismiss is presented at a late time in the proceedings.see williams ford motor credit,cir.
highway equipment cites rice services,united states,as support for its argument that the dismissal with prejudice does not make feco a prevailing party for purposes of.in rice,rice brought a bid protest action in the court of federal claims against the navy,disputing the award of a contract for dining services.the navy then voluntarily agreed to reevaluate the bids,and the government moved to dismiss the case without prejudice as moot.the court of federal claims ordered the navy to take the promised actions and dismissed the case without prejudice.id.at.we noted that the navy acted unilaterally in initiating a reevaluation of bids and that the navy acted voluntarily by taking remedial action before any rulings by the court of federal claims.id.at.we then held that rice was not a prevailing party because the government had voluntarily abandoned its position and the court did not state that it was entering the order as a merits adjudication in the face of a continuing controversy.id.at.
the present situation is different from the situation in rice,in which voluntary action was taken outside the proceedings,was not designed to be judicially enforceable,and resulted in a dismissal without prejudice.in contrast to rice,the voluntary filing of the covenant in this case was designed to be judicially enforceable and was the basis for the court order dismissing the claims with prejudice.the covenant was not simply an extrajudicial promise made by one party to another outside the context of litigation.the district court determination to dismiss the remaining controversy with prejudice evidently was prompted by the fact that hi
