defendants and appellants city of corona city,the members of the city council of the city,karen stein,janice rudman,darrell talbert,jeff miller,jeffrey bennett,and keith clark,the building officer of the city collectively,defendants appeal from a judgment entered in favor of plaintiff and appellant george jenkins jenkins,and from the trial court denial of their motion to vacate the judgment.jenkins from the same judgment,from various rulings made by the trial court during the trial,and from the court denial of his motion for attorney fees under code of civil procedure section.for the reasons set forth below,we shall reverse the judgment.
factual and procedural history 
on may,plaintiffs the paladin fair housing coalition,dba the paladin group paladin,barratt american incorporated barratt,and jenkins collectively,plaintiffs filed a complaint for validation proceeding,declaratory relief,injunctive relief,and petition for writ of mandate against defendants.
paladin provides consulting services to individuals,businesses,corporations,industries and utilities which need representation and advice with respect to government regulations,fees and exactions.barratt is a merchant builder constructing a large number of residences in various counties throughout the state of california.in the past,barratt constructed single family homes in riverside county and may,depending upon economic circumstances,construct single family homes in the city in the future.jenkins is a citizen and resident of the city.
plaintiffs and the city have been adversaries in previous legal proceedings.in,barratt sued the city for a refund of building permit and plan check fees.barratt alleged violations of the mitigation fee act et the act.the city prevailed on statute of limitations grounds,and we affirmed the judgment.in,barratt,paladin and jenkins filed a lawsuit against the city alleging that one of the city fee resolutions violated the act by setting fees that exceeded the cost of providing services.paladin and barratt dismissed the action with prejudice when the city passed a new fee resolution.
most recently,in this case,plaintiffs challenge building inspection and safety fees established by the city under resolution resolution.
background on resolution 
the city regularly adjusts and recalculates its building and safety plan check fees.as part of its ongoing effort to ensure compliance with the act,the city has retained revenue cost specialists rcs every two years since,to perform a cost of service fee study and to generate a cost allocation plan to ensure that the city sets fees at levels corresponding to the estimated cost of providing future services.
before adopting resolution,the city commissioned rcs to perform a cost of service fee study to ensure compliance with the requires that local agency regulatory fees not exceed the reasonable estimated cost of providing services.
in march,rcs performed a study for the city building department.the study documented the revenues generated and costs incurred by all the city services,and made fee recommendations based on rcs analysis of that data.
rcs calculated proposed fee reductions for each building department service using a ratio of budgeted cost divided by average revenue.based on this study,on may,the city passed resolution to reduce the building permit and plan check fees to eliminate the surplus,in accordance with rcs recommendations.
procedural background 
on may,plaintiffs filed a complaint for validation proceeding government code,ccp declaratory relief ccp injunctive relief ccp,civil code and petition for writ of mandate ccp and request for attorney fees against the city,the city council and the city building official.plaintiffs alleged that resolution imposed fees that violated the act,various provisions of the health and safety code,proposition,proposition,the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution,and title united states code section.they sought a judicial declaration that the resolution was invalid,an injunction against enforcing the resolution,a writ of mandate ordering the city to cease collecting fees under the resolution,and an order compelling the city to apply past excess revenues to reduce future fees.
the city moved for summary judgment on the ground that plaintiffs lacked standing to sue because they were not interested persons under california validation statutes,those with a direct interest in the litigation and not merely a consequential interest in its outcome.the court granted the motion as to paladin and barratt,but denied it as to jenkins.
thereafter,the city moved for summary judgment arguing in part that the act applies only to new or increased fees,not to the city reduction of fees accomplished by the resolution.the court denied the motion on the ground that sections and allow lawsuits challenging reductions in existing fees.
subsequently,the case went to trial.in its statement of intended decision,the trial court again found that and read in concert do not prevent challenges to fees that are reduced by a public entity.the court went on to find that the city method of determining the fee did not comply with government code or.in the judgment issued on april,the trial court adopted its statement of intended decision as a statement of decision and directed that a judgment and preemptory writ of mandate should issue in the case.the court ordered that the city cease and desist using the current methodology employed by the city to determine the fees and charges by the city to the public for the services of its building department as the methodology presently used violates the law and enact a new resolution or ordinance which establishes fees for the building department such that those fees do not exceed the estimated reasonable cost of providing the service and such that those fees are reduced 
on april,defendants filed a motion to vacate the judgment.on june,the trial court denied the motion to vacate.
defendants appeal from the judgment and the trial court denial of their motion to vacate the judgment.jenkins from the same judgment,from various rulings made by the trial court during the trial,and from the court denial of his attorney fees under code of civil procedure section.
i.the city appeala.resolution is subject to challenge under the act 
the gravamen of plaintiffs complaint is that defendants failed to comply with the act when it enacted resolution.defendants contend that plaintiffs action is barred as a matter of law because a reduction in fees can not be challenged under the act.in a recent decision filed on december,the california supreme held that a reenactment of a previous building permit and plan review if the fee remains the same,not increased constitutes a modif ication or amend ment of an existing fee or service charge under section,subdivision a.barratt american,city of rancho cucamonga cal th,d,barratt.

t he trial court construction of a statute is purely a question of law and is subject to de novo review on appeal.citation.reis biggs unified school dist.th,d.
principles of statutory construction 
the fundamental principle of statutory construction is to ascertain legislative intent and to interpret the statute so as to give effect to the legislature objective.pollack department of motor vehicles cal d.to determine the intent of a statute or regulation,the court turns first to the words,attempting to give effect to the usual,ordinary import of the language and to avoid making any language mere surplusage.citations.the words must be construed in context in light of the nature and obvious purpose of the regulation where they appear.citation.the various parts of an enactment must be harmonized in context of the framework as a whole.citations.the regulation or statute must be given a reasonable and common sense interpretation consistent with the apparent purpose and intention of the agency,practical rather than technical in nature,and which,when applied,will result in wise policy rather than mischief or absurdity.citation.mileikowsky tenet healthsystem th,d.
the first step is to analyze the words of the statute in context with related provisions and to give the words their plain and common sense meaning.people mchenry th,d.the court can neither insert language that has been left out nor omit language that has been inserted.california school employees kern community college dist.th,d.if the language is clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction,nor is it necessary to resort to indicia of the intent of the legislature citation.delaney superior court cal d.
however,the literal meaning of a statute must be in accord with its purpose as the supreme court noted in lakin watkins associated industries cal th,d,as follows we are not prohibited from determining whether the literal meaning of a statute comports with its purpose or whether such a construction of one provision is consistent with other provisions of the statute.the meaning of a statute may not be determined from a single word or sentence the words must be construed in context,and provisions relating to the same subject matter must be harmonized to the extent possible.citation.literal construction should not prevail if it is contrary to the legislative intent apparent in the statute citation.people mchenry,supra,th at,d.
finally,w hen a statutory provision is ambiguous and there is no clear case or other persuasive authority on the subject,contemporaneous administrative construction of a statute by an administrative agency charged with its enforcement and interpretation is entitled to great weight unless it is clearly erroneous or unauthorized.citations.citations.mcgraw department of motor vehicles d.
background on the act 
the mitigation fee act,fn.omitted the act was passed by the legislature in response to concerns among developers that local agencies were imposing development fees for purposes unrelated to development projects.ehrlich city of culver city cal th,d.barratt,supra,cal th,d.
the act generally states that zoning and permit fees may not exceed the estimated reasonable cost of providing the service for which the fee is charged,unless a question regarding the amount of the fee charged in excess of the estimated reasonable cost of providing the services or materials is submitted to,and approved by,a popular vote of of those electors voting on the issue.
section,subdivision a provides the remedy for unless there has been voter approval,as prescribed by section or,no local agency shall levy a new fee or service charge or increase an existing fee or service charge to an amount which exceeds the estimated amount required to provide the service for which the fee or service charge is levied.if,however,the fees or service charges create revenues in excess of actual cost,those revenues shall be used to reduce the fee or service charge creating the excess.barratt,supra,cal th at,d.

a reduction in fees can be challenged under section 
here,there is no dispute that under resolution,the city reduced building permit and inspection fees.the city therefore argues that t he text of sections and precludes any argument that the mitigation fee act applies to the reduction or recodification of a fee or service charge.this argument has been rejected by the supreme court in barratt,supra,cal th,d.
in barratt,the city of rancho cucamonga rancho cucamonga adopted a resolution in july setting forth a comprehensive fee schedule for various services that rancho cucamonga provided.barratt,supra,cal th at,d.in december,rancho cucamonga adopted a second resolution which modified certain fees set in.ibid.the second resolution slightly increased,by cents.ibid.the resolution explained that the new fee was a correction of a previous typographical error.ibid.in january,rancho cucamonga adopted a third resolution,which modified certain fees set in.however,the building permit fee was reduced by resolution apparently reintroduced the typographical error that the ordinance had corrected.ibid.barratt sued rancho cucamonga on various grounds.id.at,d.pertinent to this appeal,barratt sought the invalidation of the third resolution under sections and.barratt,supra,cal th at,d.rancho cucamonga demurred to the complaint.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.among other findings,the trial court found that barratt could not attack the third resolution because it was not a new or increased fee under section.id.at,d.we agreed with the trial court and affirmed the judgment.ibid.the supreme court,however,has disagreed.
in barratt,the supreme court found that the third resolution,a reenactment of the previous building permit and plan review fees constituted a modif ication or amend ment of an existing fee or service charge,subd.a.although the amount of the permit and plan review fees remained the same,the third resolution changed the duration of the fee by extending its applicability,and by implication its validity.barratt,supra,cal th at,d.the supreme court went on to state that without this interpretation of the act,if a fee was not challenged at its initial enactment,then the validity of all subsequent reenactments would be immune to judicial challenge or review.thus,there would be no effective enforcement mechanism to ensure that local agencies are complying with their duty to reduce the fees if revenues exceed actual costs.ibid.therefore,the supreme court concluded that barratt could seek to invalidate the building permit and plan review fees in the third resolution.id.at,d.
based on this recent supreme court case,under the doctrine of stare decisis,we are bound to find that jenkins could seek to invalidate resolution under the act.auto equity sales,superior court of santa clara county cal d.
b.the trial court abused its discretion in invalidating the resolution 
the city contends that the judgment should be reversed because the trial court erred by abandoning the abuse of discretion standard when it ignored substantial evidence demonstrating the rationality of the city fees methodology.
background 
the gravamen of the complaint is that the city,under resolution,set fees of the building department which exceeded the estimated reasonable cost of providing the service and failed to comply with the last sentence of a and determine actual revenue costs and return the profit to the public.
in general,the city regularly adjusts and recalculates its building safety and plan check fees.every two years since,the city has retained rcs to perform a cost of service fee study and generate a cost allocation plan to ensure that the city sets fees at levels corresponding to the estimated cost of providing future services.eric johnson,a partner of rcs,testified on behalf of rcs.
a cost of service fee study identifies all the services that the city building department provides,and establishes the cost for those services.a cost allocation plan is a method of establishing overhead rates between the building department and other city departments that provide services to each other.rcs provided both of these services to the city in.
in preparing the cost of service fee study,rcs has to qualify percent of the city building department costs and to identify all building department employees through detailed interviews with staff in that department.
at this stage,the whole emphasis of rcs is to identify the cost of city services because that information does naturally exist in city documents.rcs calculates revenue and costs by identifying and cataloguing the services at issue,rather than tracking departments.rcs creates a master list of public agency services through an iterative process of interviewing staff three or four the steps involved in providing each service.
when rcs creates a fee study for a current client,such as the city,most of this baseline information already exists thus,rcs focuses its interview process on procedural changes implemented since its last study,until,at the very end of the process it has allocated out percent of the time of percent of the employees.
after rcs finishes the iterative cataloguing of services,rcs commences to calculate the appropriate fees.first,rcs creates a revenue estimate by averaging building department revenue collected over years this average includes revenue recorded for each of the nine previous years,and revenue budgeted to the current,tenth year.
rcs averages these figures because the city building permit and plan check fee revenue fluctuate with the regular business cycle.accordingly,corresponding demand for new construction requiring inspections and plan checks varies over time.this revenue picture provides more stability to the organization and provides a picture of those revenues over time when a public entity is setting fees.in essence,the city avoids overcorrecting its fees by chasing the business cycle by relying on a revenue average,rather than revenue figure.
thus,the study allows a fairly accurate,if not very accurate,estimate of costs versus revenues,at the time the fee study is prepared,because with the nine years actual on the revenue side and estimate,the city is confident that it takes into consideration any overages from prior years.
next,rcs creates a cost estimate consisting of a time detail and a cost detail.rcs generates the time detail based on time allocation matrices obtained from the city building director these matrices state the annual number of hours devoted by each building department employee to each service for which the building department will charge.the cost detail is subdivided into numerous components,using data provided by the city finance department salary,fringe benefits,operating expenses,capital improvements,debt servicing,general overhead,equipment,and infrastructure.rcs uses these cost components to calculate a hourly rate for every position within the building department.integrating the time detail with the cost detail yields the cost of providing the service in question.thus,the cost estimate provides the city with a of the building department expenses at one point in time.
in march,rcs performed a cost of service fee study for the city building department.the study documented the revenues generated,and costs incurred,by all the city services,and made fee recommendations based on rcs analysis of that data.
rcs calculated proposed fee reductions for each building department service using a ratio of budgeted cost divided by average revenue.the ratio yielded a percentage figure.rcs multiplied the percentage figure by the amount of the current fee to achieve the required reduction,which eliminated the entire temporary surplus for that fee.the specifics are noted below 
the fiscal year budgeted cost,the cost estimate for building plan check fees was.the average revenue for building plan check fees from and,the revenue estimate was.average revenue was percent of budgeted costs,an of.therefore,this called for a corresponding fee reduction to meet the requirement under section,subdivision a,of the act.
the ratio for building plan check fees was.accordingly,the rcs study recommended that the current fee be set at percent of the present level,as reflected by comparing the items labeled current fee structure and suggested fee for cost recovery of in the revenue and cost summary worksheet the worksheet.the worksheet explained the reduction 
the current fee structure describes building and plan check fees as of table of uniform building code.the suggested fee recommends setting building and plan check fees at of table of uniform building code,which is approximately percent of the current fee structure amount.
the current fee structure described repetitive building and plan check fees as of table of uniform building code.the suggested fee recommends setting repetitive building and plan check fees at of table of uniform building code,which is also approximately percent of the current fee structure amount.
on may,the city adopted resolution by applying the calculations to all of the fees analyzed by the rcs study.because the rcs study reflected that the city had temporarily overcollected for building department permit and plan check fees,the resolution lowered such fees.
during trial,plaintiff expert,richard mccarthy,argued that the city must adopt a different method for calculating the cost of providing services.mccarthy testified at length concerning the generic average inspection time for single family homes mccarthy testified he calculated the time necessary to perform the inspection function for three typical new homes mccarthy applie d his generic study to the city fully burdened cost to reach his opinion of the reasonable cost of inspection.mccarthy then compare d his hours and the city fully burdened cost to the fee charged by the city,to determine that the city makes a profit.citation.
the trial court found that the city method for generating source data for the rcs study was reasonable.the court stated i going to find the way you determine the hours required for building inspection department to perform their various tasks is not unreasonable.in other words,your matrix and your going out and interviewing the people and having people who have done the work say this is what it takes,i not going to find that unreasonable the court,however,found that the city method for tracking historical fee revenue violated the act i do not see how taking nine years worth of actual revenue,estimating the tenth year worth of revenue,and making that your fee,without considering what your costs are,meet the requirements of the statute,which is that your fee may not exceed your cost s.to me,that is just an average number of your revenues over that period,and if in the year that you are making your study you happened to make a profit,you put that profit into your average number.maybe i wrong.you dilute it by a factor of ten,so you not actually,as was testified to,reducing the next year fees by the excess revenue.
in its statement of intended decision,the trial court stated as follows 
the thrust of mccarthy testimony is that he has determined,based on his experience,the time it takes to perform a specific task.mccarthy argues that his generic study multiplied by the city fully burdened cost equates to the reasonable cost of providing the services required by the statute.mccarthy wants to impose his methodology on the city.mccarthy crusade may serve a useful purpose in focusing attention on the basis for determining the fee.however,the city has the legislative discretion to proceed as the majority of the city council decides.
the city has not shown that the method used to determine the amount of the fee bares sic any reasonable relation to the cost of services.the city develops time estimates for the performance of services by interviews with the employees who perform the tasks.after developing the time element of the fee charge,the city then compares on the revenue side,nine years of actual revenue plus one year of projected revenue for the current budget year with the expected budgeted costs,salaries and benefits for the current budget year on the expenditure side.the comparison of the nine year actual plus one year budgeted revenue with one year budgeted costs does not meet the statutory requirement of determining if fees exceed the estimated cost to perform the service.
a ten year average is just that,a ten year average of revenue.by definition the ninth year revenue which is evidence of actual revenue averaged with the budgeted revenue and the other eight years of actual revenue will reduce the ninth year actual revenue and correspondingly any excess revenue over costs.
this imprecise method of determining the fee does not comply with government code or.italics added.
standard of review 
code of civil procedure section permits judicial review of ministerial and legislative acts.mandate will lie to compel performance of a clear,present and usually ministerial duty in cases where a petitioner has a clear,present and beneficial right to performance of that duty.citation.mandate will also lie to correct the exercise of discretionary legislative power,but only if the action taken is fraudulent or so palpably unreasonable and arbitrary as to reveal an abuse of discretion as a matter of law.citations.this test is highly deferential,as it should be when the court is called upon to interfere with the exercise of legislative discretion by an elected governmental body.citation.legislative enactments are presumed to be valid to overcome this presumption the petitioner must bring forth evidence compelling the conclusion that the ordinance is unreasonable and invalid.citation.county of del norte city of crescent city th,d.
in a mandate proceeding,the trial court findings as to foundational facts are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.this court performs essentially the same function as the trial court,determining if the local entity action was arbitrary or palpably unreasonable.county of del norte city of crescent city,supra,th at,d.
the city decrease in fees was neither arbitrary nor unreasonable 
the act required that the city fees not exceed the estimated reasonable cost of providing the service for which the fee is charged,subd.a.if,however,the fees or service charges create revenues in excess of actual cost,those revenues shall be used to reduce the fee or service charge creating the excess,subd.a.the act does not set forth how the city should calculate the estimated reasonable cost or reduce its fees,if the city fees generate a surplus.
here,the city demonstrated that its actions were neither arbitrary nor capricious when determining that its fees should be reduced.the city consultant,rcs,averaged nine years of historical actual revenue and a tenth year of current estimated revenue rcs did so because building department fee receipts fluctuate based on the business cycle.receipts depend on the volume of permitting activity generated by developers,who calibrate their building activity to the changes in the housing market.rcs was t rying to take a look at these revenues,because in essence building revenues follow the building cycle.so rcs was trying to follow that cycle over,again,the longest period of time that was still relevant to get a more accurate picture.the early part of the period included a recession,whereas the middle and later years included periods of economic growth.
with respect to the revenue data,the city compiles its budget six months before the end of the current fiscal year,and tries to project revenue months into the future.the uncertainty inherent in making such revenue projections,and the degree to which the actual revenue fluctuated from year to year,illustrates why rcs chose to calculate historic revenue based on an average including the nine previous years.revenue projections are akin to projecting what the stock market is going to be tomorrow,or even a week later,because of the fluctuations in demand for housing,and,accordingly,for permitting activity in the construction industry.
therefore,given the circumstances under which cities must calculate building safety and plan check fees,one year data was really providing an accurate picture of the organization over a period of time.i nstead of capturing extremes at both ends of the cycle,the revenue averaging techniques tries to capture a middle ground to try and get some stability to the system,so that the fees just are chasing the business cycle.if the city relied on a revenue history,then in a year when the building department conducted an unusually large amount of inspections,the revenue figure would be correspondingly high.conversely,in a year when the building department conducted an unusually small amount of inspections,the revenue figure would be correspondingly low.therefore,the revenue achieves an accurate representation of the city past and present revenue recovery.should the city recover more revenue than expected,rcs incorporates that spike in receipts into the revenue average in the next fee study.
the rcs fee study captured a picture of a time period when the building department costs were fixed and the level of building activity and inspections increased dramatically.thus,the fee reduction recommended by rcs and implemented by the city eliminated,for each building and inspection fee analyzed by rcs,the surplus reflected in the study.
notwithstanding the above,the trial court found that the city had abused its discretion because the city failed to show that the method used to determine the amount of the fee bares sic any reasonable relation to the cost of services.in essence,the trial court disagreed with the amount of the fee reduction because the city calculated it by comparing an average revenue for years with the present year budgeted costs,rather than comparing the previous year actual revenue surplus to the present year budgeted costs.the court found that the averaging method was imprecise.it stated a ten year average is just that,a ten year average of revenue.by definition the ninth year revenue which is evidence of actual revenue averaged with the budgeted revenue and the other eight years of actual revenue will reduce the ninth year actual revenue and correspondingly any excess revenue over costs.the court then concluded that t his imprecise method of determining the fee does not comply with government code or.
in making its finding,however,the trial court went beyond its limited scope of review.as an appellate court in city of dublin county of alameda th,d city of dublin stated,specificity in calculating costs with certainty is not required.id.at,d.instead,the record need only demonstrate a reasonable relationship between the fees to be charged and the estimated cost of the service or program to be provided that requirement may be satisfied by evidence showing only that the fees will generate substantially less than the anticipated costs.citations.ibid.moreover,in california of professional scientists department of fish game th,d professional scientists,the court of appeal found a regulatory fee was not a special tax subject to voter approval requirements because it was reasonably not on a the cost of services.id.at,d.the court noted that a regulatory fee,to survive as a fee,does not require a precise ratio.id,d.demanding such a precise calculation was impractical,given the complexity of the regulatory program at issue,whose fees were not easily correlated to a specific,ascertainable cost.ibid.
here,as provided above,the act requires only that fees may not exceed the estimated reasonable cost of providing the service for which the fee is charged,absent voter approval,italics added.the trial court implicit finding that the act requires a yearly,correspondence between the city fee revenue and costs,is not supported by the act.as the courts above have found,we,too,find that the act does not require a precise calculation.instead,the study performed by rcs and adopted by the city in assessing its fee reduction,as specified above,is supported by substantial evidence.
on appeal,jenkins argues that the trial court correctly ruled that the averaging method failed to comply with the act because the city of corona never determined actual cost of providing the service for any year prior to the preparation of exhibit bb and never made a comparison between actual revenue and cost to determine if it had a profit.we do not agree with jenkins assessment of the evidence.on the contrary,we find that there was substantial evidence to support the city decision to decrease its building fees.
here,exhibit bb showed the actual expenditures and revenues for the fiscal year for the city building department.as to the prior years,the evidence showed that rcs performed a cost of service fee study and generated a cost allocation ensure that the city sets fees at levels corresponding to the estimated cost of providing future services.in order to calculate the appropriate fees,rcs created a revenue estimate by averaging building department revenue collected over average included revenue recorded for each of the nine years prior to,and revenue budgeted for the tenth year.rcs averaged these figures because of fluctuations in the housing market.rcs also created a detailed cost estimate for the city,as outlined in detail above.thereafter,rcs prepared a cost of service fee study for the city building department.the study documented the revenues generated,and costs incurred,by all the city services,and made fee recommendations based on rcs analysis of that data.based on this find jenkins argument to be unavailing.nothing in the act mandates how a city should perform its duties.here,the city properly exercised its discretion in deciding how to proceed with the mandates of the act.we,as the judicial branch of government,are bound by the city decisions so long as they are not capricious or arbitrary.as noted above,we find the city actions to be neither.
moreover,in support of his argument,jenkins relies heavily on exhibits that were not admitted into evidence.for example,jenkins stated w hile the court did not admit exhibits,and,those exhibits clearly show the inaccuracies of the budgeting process of the city of corona.t he plaintiff had other exhibits for prior years showing that actual revenue for the building department far exceeded budgeted revenue for every year commencing with the fiscal year.however,these were not presented to the lower court because this evidence was not a part of the record below,we can not consider it on appeal.
based on the thoughtful and deliberative process that the city employed before adopting its fee reduction,we find that there is sufficient evidence to support the city fee reduction,and discern no abuse of discretion by the city.
two appellate court development hayward unified school dist.th,d garrick,and mike moore towing city of san diego th,d mike moore towing support our holding.
garrick development hayward unified school district 
in garrick,plaintiff developers of residential property appealed from an order denying them a petition for writ of mandate by which they sought the return of school facilities fees they had paid under protest as conditions to obtaining building permits.fn.omitted.garrick,supra,th at,d.the developers argued that the hayward unified school district the district and its governing board of education the board imposed the fees in violation of statutory requirements and constitutional limitations.ibid.the appellate court affirmed the trial court denial of the petition.ibid.
the appellate court rejected the plaintiffs contention that the district should have provided specific plans for new facilities,rather than a list of projects,their costs and approximate completion dates.garrick,supra,th at,d.in garrick,the district relied on a report prepared by urbanplan the report identified increased enrollment and attendant new school construction costs attributable solely to new development,e vidence of this sort meets case law requirements citation without the need to show specific construction plans.id.at,d.
the court also rejected the plaintiffs criticisms of the urbanplan report.the plaintiffs asserted that the report projections could not be accurate.the court noted that although accurate projections are more difficult over long time periods,this does not make the use of years arbitrary in a legal sense.garrick,supra,th at,d.such long term forecasts are neither inherently unreliable nor so arbitrary as to be mere speculation.ibid.
the plaintiffs also asserted that the report should have focused on mobile buildings,and not on more costly permanent buildings.garrick,supra,th at,d.again,the court disagreed it found that the choice between permanent and movable facilities is a legislative one whose wisdom we can not second guess.ibid.therefore,the court found that the record provided a reasonable basis for upholding the fee as reasonably related to the cost of school facilities.id.at,d.
this case is similar.just as garrick,supra,th,d,used a projection in its study,rcs generated a revenue average in its plan for the city.as the court in garrick stated,even though it is more difficult to have accurate projections over long periods,this does not make the use of a revenue average to be arbitrary in a legal sense.id.at,d.notwithstanding the trial court dismay at the ten year average as being an imprecise method of determining the fee,we agree with the court in garrick that a forecast,using an average,is neither inherently unreliable nor so arbitrary as to be mere speculation.ibid.therefore,because the decrease in fees adopted by the city was supported by substantial evidence,the trial court abused its discretion in finding that the method used by the city to determine the amount of fees violated the act.
mike moore towing 
in mike moore towing,the city of san diego awarded contracts for vehicle towing in nine districts.mike moore towing,supra,th at,d.moore,a losing bidder for some of the contracts,petitioned for a writ of mandate to reverse the city rejection of its protests that the winning bidder,san diego police tow operators,sdpto,should have been disqualified for omissions in its bid and moore own bid should not have been disqualified as incomplete.ibid.the trial court rejected moore claim that its bid should have been found complete,but accepted the argument of the moore group that a fair hearing had not been held before the city council because the evidence presented at the hearing included a misrepresentation by city staff that there were no material omissions in the sdpto bid.the trial court remanded the matter to the city council to reconsider the bids submitted in the three districts,with directions to consider a particular document presented at the protest hearing supporting the moore group allegations of material omissions by sdpto.ibid.
on appeal,the appellate court concluded that both the award of the contracts and the decision to reject the protest should be considered legislative actions.fn.omitted.mike moore towing,supra,th at,d.therefore,the review of the city legislative determination is through ordinary mandamus under section.such review is limited to an inquiry into whether the action was arbitrary,capricious or entirely lacking in evidentiary support.citation.however the test is formulated,the ultimate questions,whether the agency decision was arbitrary,capricious or entirely lacking in evidentiary support,contrary to established public policy or unlawful or procedurally unfair,are essentially questions of law.with respect to these questions the trial and appellate courts perform essentially the same function,and the conclusions of the trial court are not conclusive on appeal.citations.citation.mike moore towing,supra,th at,d.
keeping this standard of review in mind,the appellate court deferred to the city judgment that sdpto responses to specific inquiries during the bidding process were sufficient according to the guidelines imposed by the city request for proposals rfp.the court stated that the city could waive sdpto failure to provide a specific verbatim response to the agreed cost and conflict of interest provisions.sdpto provision of insurance information regarding its members,rather than its corporate entity,was immaterial because corporate insurance information was not required at the bidding stage.the city reasonably concluded that the credit rating information sdpto provided was adequate for purposes of accepting the bid.sdpto general description of its operational methodology for towing services was sufficient in lieu of a narrative detail of its technical approach to each aspect of towing.mike moore towing,supra,th at,d.therefore,the court stated,o n the entire record,we conclude that the city could reasonably have found that the rfp requirements were satisfied by the sdpto bid,and there were no material omissions interfering with the city ability to understand and approve that bid.id.at,d.
similarly,the appellate court concluded that the city properly rejected moore bid for inadvertently omitting biographical data that the city considered indispensable.mike moore towing,supra,th at,d.the court emphasized that it is a legislative function to consider data,opinion,and arguments,and then to exercise discretion guided by considerations of the public welfare.id.at,d.the court concluded by stating,o n this record,the city decision was not substantively irrational,arbitrary,capricious or wholly lacking in evidentiary support.citation.id.at,d.
this case is similar.here,as noted above,the city considered data,opinion and arguments regarding the average of revenue analyzed by rcs.the city then exercised its discretion in considering the rcs report and adopting the fee decrease.on the record summarized above,the city decision was not substantively irrational,arbitrary,capricious or wholly lacking in evidentiary support.citation.mike moore towing,supra,th at,d.therefore,the trial court overstepped its role in finding that the city should have used a different method to determine the fees in question.
in sum,we find that the city demonstrated that its actions were neither arbitrary nor capricious when determining that its fees should be reduced.therefore,we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in finding to the contrary

standard of review 
the trial court is vested with broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility of evidence.its ruling will be upset only if there is a clear showing of an abuse of discretion.tudor ranches,state comp.ins.fund th,d.the abuse of discretion standard implies absence of arbitrary determination,capricious disposition or whimsical thinking.citation.d iscretion is abused whenever the court exceeds the bounds of reason,all of the circumstances being considered.citation.people mullens th,d.
the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting defendant motion in limine nos.one and two 
in the defendants first motion in limine,defendants claimed that plaintiff proposed to present evidence at trial on the way the county of riverside,the city of murietta sic and possibly other public entities set and charge their respective building permit fees.defendants argued that this type of evidence was inadmissible and should be excluded.
first,defendants argued that evidence of other cities and counties building department procedures or fee calculations are irrelevant to determine whether the city own practices violate the act,because the act does not require that public entities employ identical or similar building inspection procedures fees assessed by public entities be similar or one public entity policies and procedures set a precedent for another public entity policies and procedures.
second,defendants argued that if the trial court admitted evidence from the county of riverside and city of murrieta,the city would have offered rebuttal testimony showing that approximately percent of california cities use the same method for calculating building permit fees as corona.therefore,admitting this type of evidence would cause undue delay,cumulative presentation,and confusion of issues.
in the second motion in limine,defendants argued that the trial court should exclude testimony from plaintiff designated ingram an employee of the county of riverside and dennis blundell an employee of the city of murrieta on the evidence discussed above.defendants argued that the proffered testimony of ingram and blundell regarding the procedures and fees of their respective jurisdiction was irrelevant for the reasons set forth above.
moreover,plaintiff failed to file a declaration under code of civil procedure section,subdivision f,indicating that ingram and blundell would submit to a meaningful oral deposition regarding their testimony.ingram and blundell both admitted that they had no expert opinion on the issues in this case.
on the hearings of the first motion in limine,the court and the attorneys for plaintiff and defendants discussed in great detail the issue of admissibility of the proffered evidence.when the city counsel indicated that the city set a fee for whatever the item is that comes across the desk that has to be reviewed by an employee,the court then inquired,what is the relevance of whatever the county of riverside or city of murrieta does the court emphasized that evidence of what the city was charging for an inspection and what the cost was for the inspection was whether the city of riverside does it faster.the court went on to elaborate why do i have to compare the time if it takes the city of corona three hours to do it,and it takes the county of riverside two hours to do it,why does that mean that corona is charging more than their cost after further discussions between the court and plaintiff counsel,the court asked,why is the court in a position to in essence run the city of corona business i here to determine whether or not they charged a fee of,and it only cost them to do it,and therefore they have to adjust the fee so that the fee equals their costs,and if they want to spend more time to do it or if they want to have more people do it,that their business.after this colloquy,the court granted the motion in limine subject to plaintiff making a prima facie case,and then maybe the court may have some way to determine what the evidence should be.
the court thereafter stated,the same thing goes with motion in limine number two,because that your expert who testifies about it takes him two hours and and two are granted.you can renew your argument after you finished with your prima facie case.
when these issues arose again during the proceedings,the court made the following comments it not the court function to decide that somebody time estimate is better than somebody else.it is the function of the court to look at what the evidence was and decide whether or not what they did was reasonable.
based on the careful consideration of the motions in limine by the court,we can not discern an abuse of discretion by the trial court in ruling on the motions.as provided above,the abuse of discretion standard implies absence of arbitrary determination,capricious disposition or whimsical thinking.citation.d iscretion is abused whenever the court exceeds the bounds of reason,all of the circumstances being considered.citation.people mullens,supra,th at,d.here,the trial court was thoroughly aware of the issue at hand,allowed plaintiff counsel to argue his position,and gave a thoughtful disposition on the issue.we can not say that the trial court decision was arbitrary,capricious or of whimsical thinking.
the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting defendant motion in limine no.three 
in the third motion in limine,defendants argued that the trial court should exclude evidence regarding the fees collected by the city prior to the adoption of resolution because a ny claim that the fees the city collected prior to the adoption of resolution is barred by the statute of limitations in government code section.
the act requires that a ny judicial action or proceeding to attack,review,set aside,void,or annul the ordinance,resolution,or motion authorizing the charge of a fee subject to this section shall be brought pursuant to section,subd.c.any proceeding challenging a resolution adopting a new fee or service charge,or modifying or amending an existing fee or service charge shall be commenced within days of the effective date of the ordinance,resolution,or motion,subd.a.
the limitations period runs from the effective date of the ordinance,resolution,or motion imposing fees,not from the date the fee is actually charged to the customer.utility cost management indian wells valley water dist.cal th,d,indian wells.thus,the enactment of a utility rate or rate increase,and not a subsequent act which actually imposes a utility charge,triggers the statute of limitation
