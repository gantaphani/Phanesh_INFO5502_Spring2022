we must decide whether,and to what extent,the publisher of a monthly prison news magazine may recover attorneys fees from the state of california and various of its officers for monitoring their compliance with a settlement agreement resolving claims about prison conditions.
prison legal news pln is a nonprofit charitable organization based in seattle,washington.pln publishes prison legal news,a monthly magazine containing news and analysis relating to the legal rights of prisoners.it also distributes books.
in september,pln contacted the california department of corrections and rehabilitation cdcr with concerns about the delivery of its materials to prisoners in the cdcr custody.pln complained that some cdcr institutions refused to deliver prison legal news to prisoners housed in particular units,while other cdcr institutions disallowed delivery of the magazine altogether on the ground that pln was not an approved vendor.pln also complained about bans on its hardcover books.in pln view,these and other cdcr policies violated pln first amendment right to free speech and fourteenth amendment right to due process of law.
on december,after a year of negotiation,pln and the cdcr entered into an agreement to settle specific claims alleging that the cdcr,or cdcr employees,censored pln publications.the agreement was signed on behalf of the cdcr by james tilton,secretary of the cdcr,and michael jorgenson,deputy attorney general of the state of california.the parties agreed,among other things,that t he practice by cdcr adult institutions of requiring publishers such as pln to obtain approved vendor status shall cease that t he practice by cdcr adult institutions of banning hardcover publications shall cease that when cdcr adult institutions disallow books,magazines,newspapers,or periodicals,the adult institutions shall notify the inmate that it is disallowed and will notify the publisher in compliance with due process requirements and that cdcr will develop a centralized list of disapproved magazines or publications that are prohibited as offensive,threatening,contain security concerns,or obscene.
the cdcr also agreed to pay pln for alleged violations of constitutional and statutory rights under federal and state law,and to pay pln counsel reasonable attorneys fees,costs and expenses until the time that this settlement agreement is signed by the parties.in addition,paragraph b of the agreement provided 
pln and its attorneys expressly reserve their rights to pursue claims for attorneys fees,costs and expenses for work performed after the time the settlement agreement is signed by all parties,including for work spent on substantive issues related to this agreement work spent securing their fees for fees and collecting any and all fees,costs and expenses that are due to them.the cdcr expressly reserves its right to oppose any such claim.
finally,the parties agreed that pln would file a complaint in federal district court within days of the signing of the agreement,alleging the claims that the agreement resolved.the parties stipulated that the agreement shall accompany the complaint,and that following dismissal of pln claims,the court will retain jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement and to determine,if necessary,reasonable attorneys fees,costs and expenses.
as contemplated by the settlement agreement,pln filed a complaint in april against governor arnold schwarzenegger and various officers of the cdcr collectively,the state officials in their individual and official capacities,seeking monetary,injunctive,and declaratory relief under for violations of the first and fourteenth amendments.soon thereafter,the parties informed the district court that they had negotiated resolution of claims asserted in the complaint,requested that the complaint be dismissed without prejudice,and stipulated that pln was entitled to in attorneys fees and costs for work done through december,date of the settlement.
the district court granted the parties request for dismissal without prejudice,and entered an order retain ing jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement between the parties including,without limitation,disputes over defendants compliance with the terms of the agreement and disputes over the amounts of attorneys fees,costs and expenses to be paid to plaintiff attorneys.the court also confirmed the award of in attorneys fees and costs to pln for the period leading up to the settlement.
in october,pln moved for attorneys fees and costs incurred from december,through august.concluding that pln was entitled to attorneys fees for work performed after the settlement agreement was signed,prison legal news schwarzenegger,d,the district court ordered the state officials to pay pln an additional in fees and costs for the period in question,id.at.although the state officials had opposed pln motion,they did not appeal the court order,which effectively brought the total fees and costs to nearly as of that point.
in october,pln filed a second motion for attorneys fees and costs,requesting a further for the period between september,and october.attorneys fees constituted of the requested amount.pln arrived at that figure by multiplying the number of claimed hours by the hourly rates of the attorneys who performed the work.in the relevant period,pln attorneys claimed hours of merits,work ensuring compliance with the settlement hours of fees,work securing fees,including fees requested in pln first motion.the hourly rates of the attorneys who performed the work were for a law firm partner who graduated from law school in for a law firm associate who graduated in for a law firm associate who graduated in and for a law firm paralegal.
the state officials opposed pln second motion for attorneys fees and costs,arguing that the hours claimed and the rates billed were unreasonable.the state officials further argued that they had met all of their obligations under the settlement agreement.they thus urged the district court to terminate its jurisdiction over the agreement and to refuse to entertain any additional fee requests by pln.
in december,the district court granted in part pln second motion.the court determined that the rates billed by pln attorneys were reasonable,and that the hours claimed were reasonable as well,with the exception of hours of merits work related to censorship issues outside the scope of the settlement agreement.after reducing the fee request accordingly,the court awarded pln in attorneys fees and costs in fees and costs for merits work,and in fees and costs for fees the cumulative total to about.the court then decline d the state officials request to conclude that cdcr has completed all of its obligations under the settlement agreement and that no more fees applications may be submitted by pln.the court stated that the state officials shall continue to follow the terms of the settlement and pln counsel may incur reasonable fees ensuring that they do.
the state officials appeal the district court ruling on pln second motion for attorneys fees and costs.until now,they have largely acquiesced in pln efforts to obtain reimbursement.it was,after all,they who entered into a generously worded settlement agreement with pln they who acceded to the district court retention of jurisdiction,including over fee disputes they who stipulated to an award of in fees and costs for work leading up to the settlement and they who declined to appeal the additional award of nearly upon pln initial fee request.all told,including the amount at issue here,the state officials have incurred over half a million dollars in fees and costs for pln attorneys.the narrow question before us now is whether they can be heard to complain about the latest bill for.
the state officials first contend that pln is not eligible to recover attorneys fees for the type of merits work claimed in pln,work monitoring the state officials compliance with the agreement.
title provides that in an action,such as this one,brought under,the court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney fee as part of the costs.in buckhannon board care home,west virginia department of healt
