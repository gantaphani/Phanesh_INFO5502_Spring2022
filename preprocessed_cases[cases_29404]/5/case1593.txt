introduction 
defendant and appellant floyd case voluntarily enrolled in a,educational program.he agreed in writing that if he quit his job within months of completing the program,he would reimburse his employer,uss posco industries upi,a prorated portion of program costs.two months after completing the program,case went to work for another employer.when he refused to reimburse upi,the company sued for breach of contract and unjust enrichment.case,asserting the reimbursement agreement was unenforceable and upi had violated the labor code and other statutory provisions in seeking reimbursement.
the trial court granted upi motion for summary judgment on both its complaint and case,and subsequently granted upi motion for attorney fees for defeating case wage claims.in granting the fee motion,the court applied the version of labor code section in effect at the time of the summary judgment proceedings,rather than the version in effect at the time it awarded fees,which permits fees to a prevailing employer only when the employee wage claims have been brought in bad faith.
we affirm the summary judgment,but reverse and remand the attorney fees award.under california supreme court precedent,statutory provisions that alter the recovery of attorney fees are deemed procedural in nature and apply to pending litigation.
ii.background 
case participation in upi training program 
upi hired case in.he initially worked as an laborer and side trim operator.as a condition of employment,case joined local of the united steelworkers of america.
upi faced a shortage of skilled maintenance technical electrical mte workers.to address this,upi,after consultation with local,decided to implement a learner program.thus,in june,the company and local entered into a memorandum of understanding mou stating upi would train up to current employees,while continuing to pay their wages and benefits,in an effort to qualify them as mtes.upi and the union recognized that,due to the strong demand for maintenance technician electrical,the company needs to retain successful candidates as employees for a reasonable period of time in order to recoup its substantial investment in their training.upi and the union therefore agreed upi may require candidates in the learner program to sign the attached reimbursement agreement that would require reimbursement for a portion of the training should a candidate voluntarily terminate employment within months of completion of the learner program.
the learner program required weeks of instruction,weeks of on the job training and weeks of classroom work partially courses at a local community college,partially other courses.the goal was to complete training within weeks,or just over three years.if a participant successfully completed the program and then passed upi mte test,he or she would be assigned to an mte vacancy.
the mte position and learner program aligned with case desire to work as an engineer.case understood joining the learner program was voluntary.he also understood he did not need to go through the learner program or a similar formal educational program to obtain an mte position.when asked if going to the mte learner program was the only avenue available to you to become an mte,case answered,no.a prospect could simply take and pass upi mte test.however,case did not attempt the test prior to participating in the learner program because he did not think he had the knowledge to pass.he was also unsure if he would pass if he undertook a program.in any case,the learner program allowed him to get trained during the workday instead of after hours,and it would lead to higher pay.accordingly,he applied for the program and was one of nine selected participants.
case was informed of the reimbursement obligation during a training session for prospective participants.a presentation slide entitled repayment agreement told prospects they would sign an agreement to reimburse a portion of their training cost should they voluntarily terminate employment within months of program completion.the slide,consistent with the mou,indicated the obligation would be prorated over months.
case was subsequently presented with a written reimbursement agreement and signed it without objection.under that agreement,case acknowledged upi would pay his wages,benefits and training expenses while he was in the learner program,but there would be no guarantee participation in the program would insure promotion,transfer,or continued employment with upi.he further agreed that if he was fired for cause or voluntarily left upi within months after completing the program,he would,absent a compelling hardship such as a serious injury or family death,refund of the expense of his training,less per month of subsequent service at upi 
two months after completing the learner program and obtaining an mte position,case left upi for lawrence livermore national laboratory to work as a high voltage electrician.
b.the lawsuit 
when case refused to reimburse upi,the company filed the instant lawsuit alleging breach of contract and unjust enrichment.upi sought damages of that is,per month that remained in case month period.
case,in turn,filed a on behalf of himself and an asserted class of individuals who signed the same training reimbursement agreement.the first cause of action,for declaratory relief,alleged the agreement was unlawful because a it violated labor code sections,and regarding wages,governing bonds,governing employee expenditures,regarding provision of workmens compensation insurance,and,subd.a regarding employer payment of costs of business operations b it violated the federal fair labor standards act free and clear payment requirement and its requirement that an employer negotiate with an employee union c it violated business and professions code section governing restraints on the right to practice a profession and d it lacked consideration.the second cause of action alleged the agreement was an unfair business practice under business and professions code section.the third through eighth causes of action alleged direct violations of various labor code provisions raised in the first cause of action,namely sections,and.the prayer sought a declaration that the reimbursement agreement was invalid,disgorgement of any payments made by employees under the agreement,civil penalties under the labor code private attorney general act paga,and attorney fees and costs.
upi subsequently moved for summary judgment on its complaint and case,asserting the reimbursement agreement was valid and not unlawful under any theory case raised in his.
the trial court granted upi motion,and the parties thereafter stipulated to a judgment in favor of upi in the amount of plus prejudgment interest and costs 
on december,pursuant to section,upi moved for in attorney fees for successfully defending against three of the labor code claims asserted in case for alleged violations of.in justifying the amount sought,upi claimed it had litigated the case aggressively in part because of the class action allegations and potential civil penalties under various code provisions,including paga assuming case could have satisfied the requirements of that statute.
case opposed the motion.he first maintained section,as amended effective january,authorizes fees to an employer only if the employee suit is brought in bad faith and he had not asserted his in bad faith.he second argued upi claimed fees were excessive,the wage claims added no real work for upi counsel,and paga fee shifting statute which favors only prevailing employees did not support any fee award to upi.
applying the pre version of section,the trial court granted upi fee motion,but cut the requested amount in half,awarding.
iii.discussion 
summary judgment 
on appeal after a motion for summary judgment has been granted,we review the record de novo,considering all the admissible evidence submitted in support and opposition.horne district council international union of painters allied trades th,d.a motion for summary judgment is properly granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.ibid.
labor code sections,and 
invoking labor code sections,and,which prevent employers from passing certain operating expenses on to employees,case contends the reimbursement agreement is an unlawful attempt to foist workforce costs onto employees.none of these statutes,however,is implicated by a strictly voluntary,optional training program of the sort upi offered here.
section provides in pertinent part,an employer shall indemnify his or her employee for all necessary expenditures or losses incurred by the employee in direct consequence of the discharge of his or her duties,subd.a cochran schwan home service,th,d.section provides that this indemnification requirement can not be waived by contract.edwards arthur andersen llp cal th,d,edwards.
section only applies,however,to expenditures made or losses sustained by an employee,and then,only to those expenditures or losses an employee must necessarily incur.gattuso harte hanks shoppers,cal th,d,see also carter entercom sacramento,llc th,d if employer offered legal counsel to employee,it would not be necessary for employee to hire own counsel los angeles police protective league city of los angeles th,d this right to indemnity encompasses only the right to indemnity for necessary expenditures.thus,the elements of a section claim are the employee made expenditures or incurred losses the expenditures or losses were incurred in direct consequence of the employee discharge of his or her duties,or obedience to the directions of the employer and the expenditures or losses were necessary.cassady morgan,lewis bockius llp th,d.
here,case,himself,made no expenditure,nor suffered any loss,in direct consequence of the discharge of his duties or in obedience to the directions of upi.rather,it was upi that fronted the costs of his voluntarily undertaken advanced training.
and even if case could be said to have made a qualifying expenditure or incurred a loss,such expenditure or loss was not necessary.there were at least three avenues to securing an mte position pass the mte test without any additional education or training pass the mte test after self study or study and pass the mte test after enrolling in and completing upi learner program.as case admits,an upi employee could have chosen options or,and owed upi nothing.case,however,voluntarily chose option,presumably because he would get training during the workday,would earn wages during the lengthy training period,and would obtain the training without any upfront cost and potentially without any cost at all.in short,the educational expenses case ultimately incurred were a matter of personal choice they were not an requirement of either continued employment as a laborer and side trim operator,or of the mte position he sought.
accordingly,the in re acknowledgment cases th d,on which case relies,are readily distinguishable.in fact,these consolidated cases highlight the important distinction between necessary and unnecessary expenditures.the in re acknowledgment cases addressed the city of los angeles requirement that all new police officers attend an academy which included not only peace officer standards and training post certification,but also supplemental training specific to the city law enforcement needs.concerned that it was training officers,only to see them depart for other departments,the city sought reimbursement from any officer who voluntarily left its force within five years of graduating.id.at.the appellate court held that because post certification is a requirement for any peace officer which can be obtained through a variety of programs,it is not an expense and therefore is not an expense of discharging the duties of employment with the city under section.in re acknowledgement cases,at.however,because the city additional training,required of all new city officers,is and is provided solely by the city,it is an expense for which the city can not seek reimbursement.id.at.
the learner program,in contrast,was not required of any upi employee,even those interested in becoming a mte.rather,the program was entirely voluntary and only one of the ways in which an employee interested in becoming a mte could secure the training for that occupation.that the program provided training for a readily transferable occupation as illustrated by case move to llnl also made it much more akin to basic post than to an training program like that required by,and provided solely by,the city of los angeles.
turning to section,subdivision a of that section provides,no employer,or agent or officer thereof,or other person,may compel or coerce any employee,or applicant for employment,to patronize his or her employer,or any other person,in the purchase of any thing of value,subd.a.as discussed,no compulsion or coercion was brought to bear on case to participate in the learner program.rather,the program was entirely voluntary.
for similar reasons,there was no violation of the statutes pertaining to employee bonds.section requires employers to pay for bonds if they are required,and so does not apply here.section prohibits the demanding,exacting,or accepting of any cash bond for most purposes.while a cash bond can take many forms,here case put up no cash.rather,it was upi that fronted his training expenses,and no deduction was ever made from his paid wages.thus,quillian lion oil d,which both parties cited in connection with the bond laws,is inapposite.that case concerned a reduction in wages in the amount of a business shortage,a scenario entirely different from that here.
business and professions code section 
case contends the reimbursement agreement is also an invalid restraint on employment under business and professions code section,which provides relevant part,every contract by which anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession,trade,or business of any kind is to that extent void.bus.a like argument was rejected in city of oakland hassey th d hassey,and we reach the same conclusion here.
in hassey,a new police officer recruit agreed to a conditional offer of employment.the agreement,authorized by a mou with the police officers union,provided that the new officer would be trained at the department academy at a cost of exclusive of wages,and if he left within the first five years of service,he would owe the department a prorated share of that cost.id.at.the officer completed the academy,but left within his first year of service.id.at.
with respect to the officer claim that the reimbursement agreement violated business and professions code section,the appellate court stated,to the extent that hassey argue d that his agreement to repay oakland was an impermissible covenant not to compete,an identical argument with respect to a wisconsin anticompetition statute was specifically rejected in heder.heder city of two rivers,wisconsin cir,reimbursement agreement did not restrict employee ability to compete with city after leaving its employ.we recognize that in california,the general rule is that covenants not to compete are void kelton stravinski th,whereas under the wisconsin law analyzed in heder,restrictive covenants in employment contracts are permitted if they are reasonably necessary for the protection of the employer or principal.stat.application group,hunter group,th,d bus,has specifically been held to invalidate employment contracts which prohibit an employee from working for a competitor when the employment has terminated,unless necessary to protect the employer trade secrets.citation.the fact remains,however,that nothing in the agreements hassey signed restrained him from engaging in his lawful trade,business or profession.kolani gluska th,d analyzing bus.nothing prevented him from working for another police department,or anywhere else,for that matter.hassey,supra,th at,fn.omitted.
we agree with the reasoning of hassey and,likewise,conclude case has no claim under business and professions code section.he voluntarily agreed to participate the training program and understood upi would front all the costs of the program and expected reimbursement of training costs if he chose to leave within months of completing the program.this was an agreement concerning advanced educational costs.it did not restrain case from working for a competitor or any other entity.indeed,case quit upi and went to work elsewhere,and he was entirely free to do so.he had also agreed to reimburse upi for the costs it fronted for his advanced training,a benefit case retained despite his departure.
case maintains hassey is no longer good law in light of the supreme court decision in edwards,supra,cal th,which considered t o what extent does business and professions code section prohibit employee noncompetition agreements.id.at,fn.omitted.the court broadly answered that an agreement violates this statutory provision even if it only limits,rather than prohibits,an employee practice of her profession,trade,or business.id.at.accordingly,courts need not evaluate the reasonableness of a restraint because all restraints are forbidden.id.at.
the court therefore conclude d that employer andersen noncompetition agreement was invalid.as the court of appeal had observed,the first challenged clause prohibited edwards,for an month period,from performing professional services of the type he had provided while at andersen,for any client on whose account he had worked during months prior to his termination.the second challenged clause prohibited edwards,for a year after termination,from soliciting,defined by the agreement as providing professional services to any client of andersen los angeles office.the agreement restricted edwards from performing work for andersen los angeles clients and therefore restricted his ability to practice his accounting profession.citation.the noncompetition agreement that edwards was required to sign before commencing employment with andersen was therefore invalid because it restrained his ability to practice his profession.edwards,supra,cal th at.
edwards thus addressed a quintessential noncompete agreement that expressly restrained an employee from working on certain matters and from soliciting certain former clients.the agreement at issue in hassey and the one case signed here did no such thing.rather,the reimbursement agreement case signed concerned the reimbursement of costs of a voluntarily attended education program.
nor do the cases cited in edwards and relied on by case compel a different result here.in muggill reuben donnelley cal d,muggill,for example,a provision forfeiting plaintiff pension rights if he works for a competitor restrain ed him from engaging in a lawful business and was therefore void.in chamberlain augustine cal,chamberlain,an employee agreed to pay the sum of as liquidated damages if he became involved in a competing business,which impermissibly operate d to restrain augustine from carrying on the business mentioned.id.at.muggill is readily distinguishable because it dealt with clawing back an employee earnings if he chose to work for a competitor,and chamberlin is similarly distinguishable because it dealt with liquidated damages,or a price,for choosing to compete.the reimbursement agreement here did not curb competition,but rather,addressed a voluntarily undertaken and valuable educational opportunity 
golden california emergency physicians medical group cir golden,which case emphasized at oral argument,is also distinguishable.the issue in golden was whether business and professions code section is limited to traditional noncompete clauses or can apply to other kinds of agreements.the parties,a physician terminated from an emergency medical practice and the medical consortium providing those services to numerous facilities,had reached a settlement in court that included an agreement the physician would not work for the consortium or at any facility it serviced or owned in the future.id.at.when the plaintiff refused to sign the written agreement memorializing the settlement,including because of its provision,his former attorney and the consortium successfully moved to enforce it.id.at.
the ninth circuit reversed and remanded,concluding section is not limited to standard noncompete clauses and the district court should determine whether the provision constituted a restriction of substantial character on the plaintiff practice.golden,supra,at.the circuit court discussed chamberlain and edwards,discerning nothing in those cases limiting the kind of provision subject to section.golden,at.it also observed hassey did not purport to limit the application of the statute,and in a single sentence,questioned whether perhaps the outcome in hassey should have been different.id.at.for all the reasons we have discussed,we do not share this concern.repayment of the fronted costs of a voluntarily undertaken educational program,the benefits of which transcend any specific employment and are readily transportable,is not a restraint on employment.
national labor relations act,title united states code section a 
case also claims the reimbursement agreement was the result of improper direct bargaining with him,circumventing the collective bargaining process envisioned by the national labor relations act nlra a a.case,however,reads the direct bargaining prohibition far too broadly.
the nlra makes it unlawful for a covered employer to refuse to bargain collectively with the representatives of his employees.a.further,representatives designated or selected for the purposes of collective bargaining by the majority of the employees in a unit appropriate for such purposes,shall be the exclusive representatives of all the employees in such unit for the purposes of collective bargaining in respect to rates of pay,wages,hours of employment,or other conditions of employment a.
according to case,the united states supreme court in case.case,construed these statutory requirements as barring an employer from negotiating any contract with an individual employee represented by a union.the supreme court never went as far as case suggests.
while the high court held an employer can not rely on individual employment contracts to defeat collective bargaining,it also held an employee separate individual contract that is consistent with a collective bargaining agreement may be enforced.willis prime healthcare services,th,d.the court continued we know of nothing to prevent the employee,because he is an employee,making any contract provided it is not inconsistent with a collective agreement or does not amount to or result from or is not part of an unfair labor practice.but in so doing the employer may not incidentally exact or obtain any diminution of his own obligation or any increase of those of employees in the matters covered by collective agreement.case,supra,at.
case offered no evidence the reimbursement feature of the lerner program was in any way inconsistent with the mou approving the program or any other collective bargaining agreement covering case employment.code civ,subd.p california bank trust lawlor th,d burden on defendant to show triable issue as to affirmative defense.to the contrary,the mou expressly authorized a reimbursement agreement calling for repayment of a portion of the learner program costs if a participant left within months of completing it.while the mou estimated upi would need to recoup in program costs per participant and the reimbursement agreement case signed called for reimbursement of only,this was not an inconsistency and certainly did not increase any obligation he had under the mou.and while no party provided a copy of the exemplar reimbursement agreement attached to the mou,that,alone,does not raise a triable issue that the reimbursement agreement was inconsistent with the mou.
consideration 
case maintains the reimbursement agreement also lacked consideration because upi had no obligation to keep case employed and,thus,no obligation to provide education,which case views as the only possible consideration listed in the reimbursement agreement.case view of the exchange is too constrained.
on entering the program,case held a new position of learner,which meant he would remain on upi payroll while additionally getting classroom and training,the costs of which upi would front.while case was not guaranteed a promotion,transfer,or continued employment,exactly the same had been true with respect to his previous position.the exchange,frankly,is obvious case got continued wages and fronted education costs,and upi got case agreement to repay those costs if he both completed the training and left the company before it could benefit from the investment.that either case or upi could have terminated the agreement by ending the employment relationship at some point during the educational program does not render illusory the parties exchange or require us to ignore the substantial benefits case obtained every day he spent on the payroll receiving advanced training with no upfront cost and potentially no cost at all to him.
unconscionable contract of adhesion 
case asserts the reimbursement agreement was an unconscionable contract of adhesion primarily because he views the value placed on the mte training as scandalous in comparison to the cost of tuition and books required for the classroom component of the program,which could be purchased from the local community college for approximately.
t he doctrine of unconscionability has both a procedural and a substantive element,the former focusing on oppression or surprise due to unequal bargaining power,the latter on overly harsh or results.sanchez valencia holding company,llc cal th,d,sanchez.the prevailing view is that both elements of unconscionability must be present before a court can exercise its discretion to not enforce a contract or clause as unconscionable.ibid.but both elements need not be present in the same degree.ibid.t he more substantively oppressive the contract term,the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable,and vice versa.peng first republic bank th,d peng.
the procedural element of an unconscionable contract generally takes the form of a contract of adhesion citation.an adhesive contract is defined as a standardized contract,which,imposed and drafted by the party of superior bargaining strength,relegates to the subscribing party only the opportunity to adhere to the contract or reject it.peng,supra,th at.where a party with superior bargaining power has imposed contractual terms on another,courts must carefully assess claims that one or more of these provisions are and unreasonable.ibid.for a term to be substantively unconscionable,though,it must be in the universe of being overly harsh,unduly oppressive,or so as to shock the conscience.sanchez,supra,cal th at.u nconscionability requires a substantial degree of unfairness beyond a simple bad bargain.ibid.italics omitted.
an agreement as to price,like any other contract provision,may be found unconscionable.citation.i t is clear that the price term,like any other term in a contract,may be unconscionable.citations.allegations that the price exceeds cost or fair value,standing alone,do not state a cause of action.citations.instead,plaintiff case will turn upon further allegations and proof setting forth the circumstances of the transaction.the courts look to the basis and justification for the price citation,including the price actually being paid by other similarly situated consumers in a similar transaction.citation.while it is unlikely that a court would find a price set by a freely competitive market to be unconscionable citation,the market price set by an oligopoly should not be immune from scrutiny.thus courts consider not only the market price,but also the cost of the goods or services to the seller citations,the inconvenience imposed on the seller citation,and the true value of the product or service citation.wayne staples,th,d wayne.
the reimbursement agreement is not procedurally unconscionable.to begin with,the mou which had estimated the education program cost at per participant,rather than the ultimately specified in the reimbursement agreement,came into being following negotiations between upi and case union,two entities with parity in bargaining power.see madden kaiser foundation hospitals cal d,madden although plaintiff did not engage in the personal negotiation of the contract terms,she and other public employees benefitted from representation by a board,composed in part of persons elected by the affected employees,which exerted its bargaining strength to secure medical protection for employees on more favorable terms than any employee could individually obtain.
additionally,the reimbursement terms were no surprise.not only was case aware of them before he ever committed to the program or saw the reimbursement agreement,the agreement is a single page and the reimbursement obligation is clearly spelled out.see wayne,supra,th at clear disclosure of disputed term weighs against procedural unconscionability.
there were also other realistic options for obtaining an mte position taking and passing the test,without further study or with study and participation in community college classes.madden,supra,cal d at in many cases of adhesion contracts,the weaker party lacks not only the opportunity to bargain but also any realistic opportunity to look elsewhere for a more favorable contract plaintiff,on the other hand,enjoyed the opportunity to select from among several medical plans negotiated and offered by the board,some of which did not include arbitration provisions,or to contract individually for medical care.morris redwood empire bancorp th,d procedural unconscionability may be defeated by availability of meaningful choice.
and finally,case was not contracting for necessities,but for an optional,advanced educational program.see ibid.
because there was no procedural unconscionability here,we need not even consider substantive unconscionability.
even if we did,we would conclude the reimbursement agreement is also not substantively unconscionable.there is not a shred of evidence the union was somehow colluding with upi to gouge employees by estimating the cost of the learning program at per participant.rather,all the evidence indicates this was a reasonable estimate for the program.compared with the initial estimated cost,case obligation to reimburse up to was eminently reasonable.although case disputed the necessity and reality of some of the more than in costs upi enumerated for the learner program,it can not be disputed upi investment in case and the other participants went well beyond providing the in tuition and books for classroom instruction,which accounted for only of total training time.case focus on those academic costs is therefore unavailing.there also was no evidence upi expenditures because some purchased items were ultimately donated to the community college so it could carry out a portion of upi training.whether ultimately donated or not,these were costs upi incurred in establishing and conducting the program.
in sum,there is no evidence the nearly learner program was improperly valued,let alone so misvalued as to render the reimbursement agreement substantively unconscionable.see wayne,supra,th at price must shock the conscious,not merely be unreasonable.
taking of wages under section,and 
finally,case asserts the reimbursement upi seeks is an unlawful garnishment or withholding of wages under sections,and.however,section,and address proper payment of wages,an issue not contemplated by an agreement to repay for training expenses.hassey,supra,th at.
case nonetheless asserts he had valid wage claims because upi initial complaints sought to recoup wages.they did not.true,paragraph in both the original and first amended complaints stated each employee in the learner program represented an investment of approximately,including wages,benefits,and training expenses for the week program.aa.but the complaints only sought in training costs under the reimbursement agreement.aa.thus,while the complaints may have referenced wages paid to case,they in no way alleged any part of the sought was wages under any provision of the labor code.
attorney fees 
after prevailing on its summary judgment motion,upi sought attorney fees under section because it had prevailed on three labor code wage claims taking wages,withholding wages,and reducing wages raised in case first amended.applying the version of section in effect at the time of the summary judgment,the court awarded upi fees,but only half the amount it had requested.case does not challenge the amount of fees awarded,but contends a newer version of the statute applied,and under it,upi is not entitled to any fee award.we agree the newer version of the statute applies and remand for further proceedings.
the new version of section governs this case 
section,with certain exceptions not relevant here,governs the award of attorney fees in any action brought for the nonpayment of wages,fringe benefits,or health and welfare or pension fund contributions,subd.a.in such actions,the court shall award reasonable attorney fees and costs to the prevailing party if any party to the action requests attorney fees and costs upon the initiation of the action.ibid.
prior to,section did not distinguish between prevailing employers and employees.it was a true two way fee shifting statute that awarded fees to the winner,whether employee or employer.kirby immoos fire protection,cal th,d.an amendment to section,effective january,changed this.now,if an employer defeats an employee wage action,attorney fees and costs shall be awarded only if the court finds that the employee brought the court action in bad faith.stats,ch.
case asserts the trial court should have applied the new version of section since it did not rule on upi fee motion until after its effective date.he thus contends the court erred in failing to determine whether he brought his wage in bad faith.he further contends the record does not show bad faith as a matter of law and therefore upi is not entitled to any fee award.upi maintains,in turn,that the new version of section can not be applied retroactively and thus does not apply to this lawsuit.in its view,since case has not challenged the amount of fees awarded,the fee award should be affirmed.
the general rule is that absent a clear,contrary indication of legislative intent,we interpret statutes to apply prospectively.quarry doe i cal th,d,quarry.in other words,when construing statutes,we presume they do not apply retroactively unless the legislature has said otherwise expressly or unmistakably.ibid.numerous general statutory provisions are considered to codify or relate to this general rule.evangelatos superior court cal d,evangelatos,citing,n o part of this code is retroactive,unless expressly so declared.code civ,n o part of this code is retroactive,unless expressly so declared.lab code,no action or proceeding commenced before this code takes effect,and no right accrued,is affected by the provisions of this code,but all procedure thereafter taken therein shall conform to the provisions of this code so far as possible.
but this general rule and these statutes,while seemingly straightforward,do not address the question of whether a statute,as applied,should be viewed as having only a benign prospective effect or a possibly troubling retroactive effect.quarry,supra,cal th at evangelatos,supra,cal d at concluding statute,if applied,would have retroactive effect id.at next concluding,under general rule,statute should not be interpreted to be retroactive,and so not deciding whether the effect would be constitutional wood mcgovern d,fn.wood section of the civil code does not answer whether provision under that code might have retroactive effect.
whether a statute has prospective or retroactive effect is not easily determined.see quarry,supra,cal th at californians for disability rights mervyn,llc cal th,d.courts are to consider the nature and extent of the change the statute brings about,and the relationship between the new rule of law and the relevant past events subject to the rule.they are also to take into account fair notice to,reasonable reliance by,and settled expectations of those subject to the new rule.quarry,supra,cal th at.
generally,a law has a retroactive effect when it functions to change the legal consequences of past conduct by imposing new or different liabilities based upon such conduct.quarry,supra,cal th at.if preexisting rights or obligations are substantially affected,then application of a statute to preenactment conduct is retroactive and forbidden,absent an express legislative intent to permit such retroactive application.if preexisting rights are not so affected,then application of a statute to preenactment conduct is prospective and therefore permitted.elsner uveges cal th,d,elsner.
changes to the law,however,are not necessarily considered retroactive even if their application involve s the evaluation of civil or criminal conduct occurring before enactment.quarry,supra,cal th at.for instance,changes to rules governing pending litigation,such as those changing procedures to be followed or applicable evidentiary rules,frequently have been designated as prospective,because they affect the future that is,the future proceedings in a trial.the prospective label applies even though the trial concerns conduct that occurred prior to the enactment of the new law.elsner,supra,cal th at.at bottom,we look to the function,not the form,or the new statute.elsner,at.
looking at the legislation amending section,we discern no expressed intent,one way or the other,as to its retroactivity.accordingly,we must consider whether the amendment actually has retroactive effect and thus is inconsistent with the presumption favoring prospective application.
under the general retroactivity principles just recited,legislation changing when attorney fees are available could readily be said to change the legal consequences of past conduct and substantially affect preexisting rights and obligations.certainly,a litigant suddenly deprived of a potentially large fee award,or conversely facing such an award,would view its rights and obligations as substantially modified.viewed as such,the new legislation,absent clear legislative intent to the contrary,would apply only prospectively.
and this is the view federal courts,including the united states supreme court,have taken when considering federal fee statutes.for instance,in martin hadix,d martin,the supreme court considered the applicability of a newly enacted fee cap in the prison litigation reform act of plra d.prior to the legislation,prisoners attorneys were receiving per hour pursuant to court orders under another statute,title united states code section.the plra reduced this rate.the high court ruled the attorneys were entitled to recover the higher amount for pre plra work they had reasonably relied on the rate,and to apply the plra to work would unfairly attach new legal consequences to completed conduct and upset the parties expectations.id.at.
in summers department of justice,summers,the court of appeals considered a statute expanding the recoverability of fees against the government under the freedom of information act.prior to the new legislation,fees were not recoverable where there was a settlement afterwards,a settlement that resulted in a change of an agency position could,under some circumstances,support a fee award.id.at.the circuit court concluded the new statute,if applied to a pending case that had been settled on the merits,would improperly expose the government to fees based on past conduct.summers,at.the government decision whether to litigate or settle such a case likely depended on an assumption attorney fees would not be available in connection with a settlement.ibid.and there was no reason for the government to have foreseen the subsequent statutory change.id.at.
indeed,california federal courts,applying federal law,have refused to apply the new version of section at issue here to pending cases.johnson hewlett packard cal,no.c crb wl,at johnson hewlett packard cir.july,wl,at.
while upi,in defending the trial court application of the older version of section,puts great reliance on martin,the statute is,obviously,a california law,not a federal one.and while california courts generally apply the same framework as federal courts to retroactivity questions myers philip morris companies,cal th,d,it is for california courts,alone,to interpret california statutes,and thus to determine whether those statutes result in o
