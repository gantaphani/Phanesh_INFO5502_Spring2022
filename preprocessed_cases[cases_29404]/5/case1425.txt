background 
a.the patent and accused devices 
synthes filed this action alleging that sk c and l intervertebral implants infringed claims of the patent.see synthes usa spinal kinetics,cv rmw,ecf.the patent originated from a german language pct application filed on april.the asserted claims were added by amendment on february.the patent is directed to an intervertebral implant,which is a prosthetic device designed to replace a diseased or degenerated disc located between adjacent vertebrae of the human spine 
a healthy disc depicted below has a fibrous,outer band called the annulus fibrosus,which surrounds a central,substance called the nucleus pulposus 
a natural disc provides functions and helps maintain proper spacing,stability,and motion within the spine.artificial discs attempt to replace some or all of these functions.claim,the independent claim from which claims and depend,provides 
an intervertebral implant for implantation between an upper and lower vertebrae,the implant having a central axis,the implant comprising 
a first substantially rigid bone contacting plate having an external surface extending generally transversely to the central axis for contacting at least a portion of the upper vertebra 
a second substantially rigid bone contacting plate having an external surface extending generally transversely to the central axis for contacting at least a portion of the lower vertebra 
a third plate operatively coupled to the first bone contacting plate,the third plate including a plurality of openings 
a fourth plate operatively coupled to the second bone contacting plate,the fourth plate including a plurality of openings 
a central part substantially located between the third and fourth plates,the central part including a flexible core and a fiber system,wherein the core is substantially cylindrical and includes a top surface and a bottom surface,the top surface of the core being in contact with the third plate and the bottom surface of the core being in contact with the fourth plate,and wherein the fiber system at least partially surrounds the core,and is at least partially received within the plurality of openings formed in the third and fourth plates so that the fiber system is joined to the third and fourth plates and 
an elastic sheathing body at least partially surrounding the fiber system and the core,and connected to the third and fourth plates.
claim requires that the first and second bone contacting plates recited in claim be made from titanium or titanium alloy.id.at,ll.claim requires the fiber system recited in claim to be constructed of an ultra high molecular weight polyethylene material.id.at,ll.according to synthes,claims and stand or fall with claim.the main features of claim are depicted in figures and of the patent 
sk manufactures the c cervical and l lumbar discs in california and sells them abroad.the united states food and drug administration has not approved the devices for sale in this country.the c and l are depicted below 
except for the shape of the cores,the c and l are identical for purposes of this litigation.
proceedings below 
during the course of the litigation,the district court construed a number of terms contained in claim of the patent.of particular relevance to the current appeal is the court construction of the phrase the third plate including a plurality of openings.synthes,ecf cal.june.sk argued that plurality of openings should be limited to grooves on the circumference of the claimed cover plates.id.sk argument was predicated on its contention that the written description of the patent does not describe a structure with holes or slots in the cover plates,but only describes grooves on the circumference of the cover plate that radially penetrate into the lateral surface of the plate.id.those grooves are depicted as element in figure of the patent 
see patent,ll.
synthes,on the other hand,contended that the claim was not so limited,and urged the court for a broader construction a third plate including two or more openings.id.while the district court did not adopt synthes construction wholesale,it did side with synthes regarding the breadth of the phrase and construed it as the third plate including two or more openings to allow the fiber system to be joined or anchored to that plate.id.the court concluded that claim requires openings in the cover plates,or third and fourth plates,which make it possible for the claimed fiber system to be joined or anchored to the plates.id.
the importance of the plurality of openings limitation to synthes infringement case is evident when viewed in light of the accused devices.sk devices do not employ peripheral grooves,but instead use slots,or openings,on the cover plates.the lumbar device uses trapezoidal slots,while the cervical device uses elongated circle slots 
joint appendix at.according to sk,synthes amended the application that led to the patent during prosecution to add claims only after the devices were on the market and synthes was advised that sk devices were a significant improvement in the technology.see at.
after the court construed the disputed terms of the patent,it entertained motions for summary judgment.the district court granted synthes motions dismissing sk enablement,indefiniteness,and utility defenses,but denied synthes motion to dismiss sk written description and best mode defenses.see synthes,ecf.the parties proceeded to trial on the remaining issues.after hearing all of the evidence,followed by four days of deliberation,the jury concluded that sk devices did not infringe the asserted claims of the patent and that sk proved by clear and convincing evidence that claim,and consequently claims and,were invalid for a lack of written description support.see synthes,ecf.
synthes then moved the district court for judgment as a matter of law jmol or new trial as to literal infringement and invalidity,among other things.id.sk moved for attorneys fees,among other things.id.the district court denied synthes motion for jmol or new trial as to literal infringement,but synthes motion regarding invalidity for lack of written description.see synthes,ecf,wl.according to the district court,the jury found the patent invalid for lack of written description on four claim limitations plate including a plurality of openings wherein the core is substantially cylindrical flexible core and substantially rigid bone contacting plate.id.synthes argued that sk failed to produce substantial evidence as to all four.id.the district court agreed with synthes that sk failed to carry its burden on substantially cylindrical core and substantially rigid bone contacting plate.id.the court affirmed the jury verdict,however,on plate including a plurality of openings and wherein the core is substantially cylindrical.id.the court also denied sk motion for attorneys fees under.id.synthes then filed this appeal and sk.
ii.discussion 
the district court found substantial evidence supported the jury verdict that the term plate including a plurality of openings lacked written description support,rendering the asserted claims invalid.the district court also concluded that sk failed to demonstrate that it was entitled to attorneys fees.we agree with the district court on both counts.consequently,we find the remaining issues on appeal moot.

written description 
the district court,at synthes urging,broadly construed the phrase third plate including a plurality of openings,which appears in claim.the relevant claims,moreover,include broad language added during prosecution.synthes amended the application that became the patent to add the concept of openings in claim almost five years after the application was originally filed,and after sk devices were already on the market.see at.the original disclosure claimed and disclosed a plurality of grooves and a plurality of channels,but did not describe openings generally.see id.while broadening claims during prosecution to capture a competitor products is not improper,the written description must support the broadened claims.see liebel flarsheim medrad,i t is not improper for an applicant to broaden his claims during prosecution in order to encompass a competitor products,as long as the disclosure supports the broadened claims.citing kingsdown med.consultants,hollister.after hearing the testimony of sk expert,lee,and its research and development manager,koske,indicating that the disclosure did not demonstrate possession of an intervertebral implant that employed any sort of openings anywhere on the cover plates,the jury determined that the patent was invalid under,paragraph.as the district court did before us,we find that substantial evidence supports that conclusion.
section,paragraph one of title requires a patentee to provide a written description that allows a person of skill in the art to recognize that the patentee invented what is claimed see ariad,eli lilly,en banc citing vas cath mahurkar.t he test for sufficiency is whether the disclosure of the application relied upon reasonably conveys to those skilled in the art that the inventor ha d possession of the claimed subject matter as of the filing date.id.determination of whether a patent satisfies the written description requirement is a question of fact.id.citing capon eshhar.the level of detail required to satisfy the written description requirement varies depending on the nature and scope of the claims and on the complexity and predictability of the relevant technology.id.
synthes contends that the jury verdict of invalidity for a lack of adequate written description was not supported by substantial evidence.synthes asserts that the patent written description does not limit the claimed plurality of openings to peripheral grooves.synthes next argues that the testimony and evidence presented by sk via its expert and fact witnesses regarding the plurality of openings limitation did not support the jury verdict.synthes also disputes the district court conclusion that sk produced evidence demonstrating that the field of intervertebral implants was sufficiently unpredictable such that a disclosure of one species of openings would not be enough to claim the entire genus.we disagree on all counts.
the patent written description,filed on april,discloses that the fiber system may be anchored by various means.see patent,ll.the written description then discloses a series of examples of how the fiber system may be anchored on the cover plates,third and fourth plates.all of these examples employ grooves,not slots or openings on the plates.see,patent,ll.describing anchoring the fiber system through grooves and over the external surfaces of the cover plates from one groove to another one,ll.anchoring the fiber system by using a construction of the grooves,ll.describing the cover plates as comprising a lateral surface with grooves distributed on the circumference and radially penetrating into the lateral surfaces,ll.disclosing an embodiment wherein the cover plates have grooves distributed on the circumference and radially protruding into the lateral surfaces,ll.describing an embodiment with the fiber system anchored on the cover plates by means of grooves.claims recite a plurality of openings used to join or anchor the fiber system to the cover plates,which synthes contends supports any type of openings located anywhere on the plates.the written description,however,never discloses anything broader than using grooves to anchor the fiber system to the cover plates.
the parties appear to agree that grooves are a species of opening,but do not agree that grooves constitute an adequate disclosure to claim all openings that may be used in the cover plates to anchor the fiber system.in other words,the jury was asked to determine whether the written description disclosure of grooves reasonably convey ed to those skilled in the art that the inventor had possession of an intervertebral implant that could utilize any sort of opening located anywhere on the cover plates to anchor the fiber system as of the filing date.ariad,at.the jury did not believe so and,when all reasonable inferences are drawn in favor of the jury verdict,we must affirm that decision.
sk presented testimony regarding the plurality of openings limitation via its expert,lee,and its research and development manager,koske.lee testified,based on his experience in designing total disc replacements,that a person of ordinary skill in the art would not believe that synthes had possession of an intervertebral implant utilizing openings located anywhere on the cover plates based on the disclosure of peripheral grooves in the written description.in particular,lee testified that based on his reading of the written description,the disclosure of peripheral grooves would not disclose openings located anywhere on the plates see,tr.transcript,at there are significant biomechanical property differences between using peripheral grooves and interior slots see id.at and when the fiber system is attached via peripheral grooves,the distance of the fibers to the central axis is limited,but when openings are used anywhere on the cover plates,the fibers are not so limited in proximity to the central axis of the device see id.at.
koske buttressed lee testimony that,based on his direct experience developing the accused products,the process of moving from peripheral grooves to internal slots is not a simple substitution,but a careful and task.koske,for example,testified that sk rejected early prototypes that used peripheral grooves on the cover plates.see,tr.transcript.koske was presented with a photograph of various sk devices,which he described as a design time line of devices.see,tr.transcript.koske then testified that the early prototypes with peripheral grooves were repeatedly rejected.see,tr.transcript.koske testimony and attendant trial exhibits demonstrated that sk development process from the peripheral grooves to the commercial products took months of work.see,sk meeting minutes from september describing devices in development process sk presentation from december illustrating design history of the devices,tr.transcript,koske testimony regarding april slide show depicting design of at the time.
koske also testified that sk had to overcome technical hurdles through its development process,one of which was to reduce wear on the device.because the devices may be used on people in their and and would be required to last a lifetime,wear was an important consideration in design choice.see,tr.transcript.in particular,koske stated that the shape of the slots on the cover plates played a role in wear reduction.koske explained that,because the metal cover plates are very thin,if the slots were too large,it would increase the risk of the cover plates breaking.see,tr.transcript.sk,therefore,had to determine the precise size and location of the slots to ensure that the cover plates used as little metal as possible,reduced fiber wear,and still performed all of the necessary functions of the device.id.
taken together,koske testimony is at least circumstantial evidence that it would not be evident that peripheral grooves on the cover plates would disclose to skilled artisans that internal slots would serve the same function.koske testimony and the exhibits used during it,coupled with lee testimony,provided ample evidence for the jury to conclude that the written description did not support the broad claim limitations in the asserted claims.
synthes contends that the difference lee identified is specious.rather than provide contrary evidence,however,synthes points to a very curt wherein lee agreed with synthes counsel that deeper grooves or grooves cut deeper into the cover plates might reduce the distance of the fibers from the central axis.at tr.transcript.synthes,however,does not address any of lee other points.and,even if synthes of lee would allow us to draw a different conclusion,so long as substantial evidence supported the jury verdict,we must affirm its decision.see first mortg,at see also guy city of san diego,cir i t has long been held that a jury may properly refuse to credit even uncontradicted testimony.citations omitted watec liu,cir we will not weigh the evidence or assess the credibility of witnesses in determining whether substantial evidence exists.citations omitted.
synthes also attempts to minimize the relevance of koske testimony by contending that his testimony was not directed to differences between using peripheral grooves and internal slots.koske,however,testified that the shape and size of the slots,and the optimization of those slots,were important design considerations.and,while synthes is correct that koske did not use magic words to explain why sk chose internal slots instead of peripheral grooves,the jury was free to draw its own conclusions from koske testimony.coupled with lee expert testimony on the plurality of openings limitation,the jury verdict that a person skilled in the art would not understand that a disclosure of peripheral grooves would teach that any and all openings on the cover plates are disclosed is supported by substantial evidence.
the jury was entitled to rely on the above testimony and evidence to conclude that the patent written description does not support the broad plurality of openings limitation.written description is a factual question,and whether the requirement is met varies depending on the nature and scope of the claims and on the complexity and predictability of the relevant technology.ariad,at.while the predictability of the aspect at issue is not the dispositive factor in determining whether the written description requirement is satisfied,the district court relied on it,and synthes strenuously disputes the district court conclusion.we,thus,briefly address it.id.
synthes frames the aspect at issue as the shape and locations of openings used to join or anchor a fiber system to a plate.synthes reply brief at.as chronicled above,lee testified that the difference between peripheral grooves and internal slots would present significant engineering and design choices and maintained that the differences between the two designs would present substantial biomechanical differences.koske also explained that sk itself began its development process with peripheral grooves and ended with internal slots.koske testimony also indicated that the shape of the internal slots was an important design choice that required testing to account for wear on the fiber system.all of this testimony was unrebutted.
based on this evidence,the jury was free to conclude that,because the patent written description does not disclose anything other than peripheral grooves,there would be significant biomechanical differences between using peripheral grooves and internal slots.the jury was also free to determine that sk skilled artisans made a specific design choice to change its first prototype with peripheral grooves to specifically shaped and located internal slots.and,the jury was free to conclude,based on the evidence,that the use of internal slots for these devices was not predictable.
sk is correct that a disclosure of a species may be sufficient written description support for a later claimed genus including that species.bilstad wakalopulos,emphasis added.but,as we stated in bilstad 
i f the difference between members of a species is such that a person skilled in the art would not readily discern that other species of the genus would perform similarly to the disclosed members,if the art is unpredictable,then disclosure of more species is necessary to adequately show possession of the entire genus.
id.at.in other words,predictability is a factual issue judged on a basis.here,sk presented its case to the jury,and the jury inferred that,in the field of intervertebral implants,the disclosure of peripheral grooves does not adequately demonstrate possession of the entire genus of possible openings.because the jury verdict is supported by substantial evidence,we must defer to that finding.
synthes contends that,because we remarked in bilstad that the mechanical world is a fairly predictable field,sk had to satisfy a heightened burden to demonstrate unpredictability.see bilstad,at.first,sk had no higher burden than providing clear and convincing evidence that the patent does not satisfy the written description requirement on the plurality of openings limitation.second,while we did state in bilstad that the mechanical field was fairly predictable,we did not hold that all inventions that may be characterized as mechanical allow claiming a genus based on disclosure of a single species.
as we noted in ariad,there are no rules governing,for example,the number of species that must be disclosed to describe a genus claim,as this number necessarily changes with each invention,and it changes with progress in a field.ariad,at.indeed,factual inquiries will,at times,create confounding results.but,whatever inconsistencies may appear to exist in the application of the law,those inconsistencies rest not with the legal standard but with the different facts and arguments presented to the courts.id.at.that is precisely the situation here.after hearing all of the testimony and evidence,the jury resolved the facts in favor of sk and determined that it had met its burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the patent did not satisfy the written description requirement.again,we are not entitled to disturb that finding when there was substantial evidence to support it.
exceptional case 
attorneys fees may be awarded to the prevailing party in exceptional cases.the exceptional nature of a case must be established by clear and convincing evidence.brooks furniture,dutailier,int l.absent litigation misconduct,sanctions may be imposed only if the litigation is brought in subjective bad faith,and the litigation is objectively baseless.id.at.in deciding whether a case is exceptional,trial courts are to consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding not just the initial allegations of infringement,but the maintenance of those claims throughout the litigation.see marctec,llc johnson johnson.thus,when information gleaned from discovery or the court rulings make clear that the continued pursuit of litigation is frivolous or vexatious,fees may be warranted even where the filing of the initial complaint was arguably justified.see id.
sk contends that synthes brought objectively baseless allegations of infringement and validity and continued to push those claims in the face of facts and claim construction rulings that made clear that synthes claims were unsupportable.sk alleges that synthes engaged in litigation misconduct by taking a number of baseless positions on everything from its claim construction arguments to its damages theory.sk contends that the district court view of synthes conduct was too myopic,failing to examine the propriety of its conduct as a whole.after an independent review of the record in its entirety we agree with the district court that sk failed to demonstrate with clear and convincing evidence that it is entitled to attorney fees under.see synthes,ecf,wl.
iii.conclusion 
based on the foregoing,we affirm the district court denial of jmol that claims of the patent are invalid under,paragraph for lacking an adequate disclosure to support the plurality of openings limitation.we also affirm the district court denial of sk request for attorneys fees under.accordingly,we need not reach the other issues addressed by the district court and addressed by the parties in the briefing before this court.
in my view,spinal kinetics failed as a matter of law to show,by clear and convincing evidence,that asserted claims of patent are invalid for inadequacy of the written description.in particular,spinal kinetics offered no clear and convincing proof that the difference between the openings of the claims and the grooves of the written description is one that in the eyes of skilled artisans has any effect,let alone an effect that is difficult to predict,on fulfillment of the identified purposes of the claims at issue.nor is there any basis for finding the written description inadequate to support the flexible core limitation or one other limitation for which the district court itself rejected spinal kinetics challenge.i therefore respectfully dissent from the majority affirmance of the judgment that the patent claims are invalid.
regarding the judgment of noninfringement,which must be addressed if the invalidity judgment is reversed,i conclude that the district court relied on an erroneous construction of the claim term fiber system.that error can not be disregarded as one we can be confident had no effect on the verdict of noninfringement,for the usual simple reasons.the jury did not specify that it found noninfringement on a basis other than the incorrectly construed limitation there is ample perhaps conclusive evidence that this limitation is met under the proper construction and there is sufficient evidence to have allowed the jury to find that the other limitations are met.the jury verdict of noninfringement therefore must be vacated.accordingly,i would remand the case for a determination,presumably through a new trial,of whether the accused products infringe under the proper claim construction.
the challenge in this case is to structural claim language that is broader than the specific embodiments disclosed in the written description.this is not a case such as some cases involving genetic or chemical inventions in which the claim language at issue is functional rather than an identifier of structure.see,ariad pharmaceuticals,eli lilly,regents of university of california eli lilly.nor is it a case in which the claim language includes details that do not appear in the written description.see,purdue pharma faulding.the question here is the familiar one involving whether the claim language is simply too broad given the disclosure notwithstanding that claim language may be and commonly is broader than described embodiments,as it identifies what aspects of the disclosed embodiments matter.see in re rasmussen,ccpa t hat a claim may be broader than the specific embodiment disclosed in a specification is in itself of no moment.ronald slusky,invention analysis and claiming a patent lawyer guide at discussing claim drafting process of identifying what features of embodiment matter.
in a case like this one,the requirement must focus on whether the way in which the broader claim term differs from the narrower disclosure is pertinent to fulfilling the identified purposes of the claims at issue.more specifically,for a challenger to prove insufficiency of the written description to support the claim language,the challenger must identify the respect in which the claim language differs from the disclosed embodiments.at a minimum,the challenger must then demonstrate that,in the eyes of a relevant skilled artisan,that particular difference has a material effect on whether the product or process would achieve the aims of the claims at issue,with materiality of the effect not the same as but related to predictability this case requiring no further definition of that relation.see ariad,at,bilstad wakalopulos,inquiry into whether skilled artisans would not readily discern that other members of the genus would perform similarly to the disclosed members,if the art is unpredictable in re curtis,inquiry into whether skilled artisan could not predict the operability in the invention of any species other than the one disclosed focus on unpredictability in performance rasmussen,at inquiry into whether difference from described embodiment is unimportant to operability 
it is commonly true,of course,that a skilled artisan has to make some judgments when seeking to implement the patent,whether it is the described embodiments or an undescribed embodiment of the broader claim that the artisan is proceeding to make and use.if those judgments are sufficiently unguided by the written description,unknown to a skilled artisan,or uncertain requiring undue experimentation,at least an enablement problem may arise though there is no enablement challenge here.what is critical for present purposes is this if there is materially the same range of implementation judgments for the described embodiments and the broader claim such as,here,how many to have,their shape,how close to the center and far from the periphery they would locate the fibers passing through the need for such judgments is irrelevant to the question.what matters is only the particular difference between the narrower embodiments and broader claims.
recognizing the burden of proof carried by the challenger,this approach implements the ariad formulations whether the inventor possessed the claimed invention,or actually invented the invention claimed.at.if the challenger does not make the showing identified above,the relevant skilled artisan will understand that,by expressly describing certain embodiments,the inventor possessed the more broadly claimed invention,because the differences are immaterial to what the inventor invented.see in re peters,ccpa reversing claim rejections that were based on a difference between the broader claim terms and the narrower disclosure,because m ost importantly,one skilled in the art would readily understand that in practicing the invention the difference is unimportant.if the challenger has made the identified showing,the relevant skilled artisan will understand that the inventor had not based on the disclosure addressed issues of consequence to fulfilling the invention purpose,and so did not possess in full the broadly claimed invention.see ariad,at requiring a written description of the invention limits patent protection to those who actually perform the difficult work of invention that is,conceive of the complete and final invention with all its claimed limitations.
at the same time,this approach aligns with a critical role of the requirement in a case involving a question of breadth.in such a case,the requirement serves to prevent an inventor from acquiring exclusivity rights over potential products or processes that present problems in achieving the invention aims that he or she has not solved.see fiers revel,attempt s to preempt the future before it has arrived are not in compliance with the description requirement.it thus confines patents to the problems the inventor solved and leaves to other people the solutions they identify that the inventor did not.
in this case,spinal kinetics failed to present the proof required to show an insufficient written description.the difference between the claimed openings and the disclosed grooves is simply that,for a groove,the space remains open at the perimeter whereas,for an opening,it need not be opening covers slots wholly interior to the outer boundary of the plate.but spinal kinetics did not prove that that difference potential closure at the perimeter had any effect on the ability of the invented implants to fulfill their purpose.
the evident role of the grooves is to prevent sideways movement of the fibers,along the perimeter of the plate,as they hold the components of the implant together.see patent at,lines by guiding the fibres in the grooves the fibre system can be so anchored on the cover plates,that in the case of tensile forces acting
