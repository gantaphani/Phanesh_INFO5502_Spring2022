these consolidated appeals have been taken by junho hyon from a judgment in an interpleader action that awarded respondents percentage shares in the proceeds derived from a global settlement of former litigation.the awards were based upon respondent contingent fee agreements with hyon and laurence colangelo.the court subsequently awarded respondents as prevailing parties attorney fees based on provisions in the same agreements in a attack on the judgment,hyon claims that respondent shopoff demurrers to his amended were erroneously sustained,he was improperly denied a jury trial,the judgment in favor of respondents is barred by principles of collateral estoppel,the retainer agreements are unenforceable under business and professions code section and rule of the rules of professional conduct,and the awards of attorney fees to respondents are based on unenforceable agreements.
we conclude that respondent shopoff demurrers were properly sustained,appellant hyon had no right to a jury trial in the interpleader action,and only the judgment and award of attorney fees in favor of respondent selten were based on an illegal,unenforceable contract.in all other respects we affirm the judgment and awards of attorney fees.
statement of facts and procedural 
we have before us another appeal in this contentious and dispute between parties claiming various interests in the assets hereafter the recovery obtained from litigation known as the decker island litigation.this litigation had been initiated by appellant junho hyon and respondent laurence colangelo as coplaintiffs in.by january of,hyon and colangelo began to search for a replacement attorney to continue the prosecution of the decker island litigation.to assist in that endeavor they entered into a contract the agreement with national legal network nln.respondent eric selten,who is not an attorney,was then president of nln.the agreement called for nln to act as hyon and colangelo agent,consultant,and case manager with regard to the decker island litigation.nln was authorized to retain counsel for hyon and colangelo and to provide other litigation support services,which included facilitating communication among hyon,colangelo,and counsel.the contract further provided that nln was to receive a contingent fee of percent of any recovery in the decker island litigation upon successfully retaining new counsel for hyon and colangelo,and performing the other services specified in the contract.if nln was unsuccessful in arranging for new counsel to represent hyon and colangelo in the litigation,then nln would not be entitled to compensation under this agreement.the agreement also specifically provided that selten shall not be expected to perform any legal services for hyon and colangelo.in,nln assigned all rights,title and interest and all the remaining and executory obligations under the contract to selten,and the parties agreed to increase his contingent fee from to percent.hyon selten,supra,th,d hyon.
selten successfully recruited respondent eliot disner of the law firm of ervin,cohen jessup to represent hyon and colangelo in the decker island litigation.disner firm in turn hired respondent jeffrey kirk as local counsel to assist with the case,primarily by pursuing and preventing fraudulent conveyances by the defendants in the decker island litigation that would dissipate recoverable assets.hyon,supra,th,d.
in november of,a jury returned a million verdict in favor of hyon and colangelo,but the trial court granted a defense motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict,leading to an appeal.to pursue the appeal,hyon and colangelo retained new appellate counsel,elliot bien,upon disner recommendation.the appeal was successful resulting in a reversal of the judgment notwithstanding the verdict,and a remand for a retrial of the action disner,who had been working on a contingency basis,declined to handle the retrial,so hyon and colangelo were compelled to retain new trial counsel on a pure contingency basis.by march of,hyon and colangelo retained respondent jeffrey shopoff of the law firm of jeffer,mangels,butler marmaro.according to shopoff agreement with hyon and colangelo,he was to receive a contingent fee of percent of the recovery,along with a lien on the recovery.shopoff later left the jeffer mangels law firm,but continued to represent hyon and colangelo in the decker island litigation through retrial of the case,which resulted in a million verdict for hyon and colangelo.
shortly thereafter,faced with obstacles to enforcing the million judgment shopoff negotiated a global settlement agreement gsa on behalf of hyon and colangelo that finally resolved the decker island litigation.pursuant to the terms of the gsa,the assets which constituted the recovery were transferred to hyon and colangelo.those assets consisted of all of the common stock of two corporations,mega sand incorporated and taiki corporation,which in turn own ed a sand mining operation with related use permits,along with real property called decker island which was encumbered by a deed of trust equipment for the mining operation and other tangible and intangible property real property and partnerships in oregon and cash.with the assets of mega sand incorporated and taiki corporation,hyon and colangelo intended to operate the sand mining business to protect and enhance their interests in the recovery.the gsa expressly granted them sole and exclusive discretion to sell or operate decker island and the sand business.the gsa also required hyon and colangelo to pay the defendants in the decker island litigation a total of million,in annual payments of,beginning in october of.shopoff cavallo llp hyon colangelo,supra,wl.
in addition to the percent and percent shares in the recovery claimed by shopoff and selten,respectively,other attorneys who performed legal services for hyon and colangelo during the course of the lengthy and protracted decker island litigation also claimed percentage shares of the recovery and associated lien interests pursuant to separate contingent fee agreements elliot bien,percent norman pine and the law firm of pine pine pine,percent the law firm of ervin,cohen jessup,percent and jeffrey kirk,percent.shopoff cavallo llp hyon colangelo,supra,wl.hyon and colangelo realized that the total of the contingent fees owed to all of the attorneys and selten could amount to between percent and percent of the recovery.id.at,wl.
by the time the gsa was executed,however,hyon and colangelo were already embroiled in a dispute over their own relative ownership interests in the recovery.colangelo believed he was entitled to of the proceeds of the recovery,less any contingent fee claims and amounts previously contributed by hyon to finance the litigation.hyon claimed that he was entitled to a larger percentage share of the proceeds due to his commensurately greater efforts and financial contributions to the pursuit of the recovery.shopoff cavallo llp hyon colangelo,supra,wl.according to the terms of a preexisting agreement between hyon and colangelo,the disputed amount of the recovery had been placed in the trust.shopoff was subsequently appointed trustee of the trust until hyon and colangelo resolved their differences and finally distributed the proceeds of the gsa.pursuant to the terms of the trust,shopoff,acting in the capacity of trustee,took legal possession of the assets of the recovery,including cash,stock certificates,and assignment of deeds of trust.ibid.
hyon and colangelo continued to negotiate their respective rights to the recovery proceeds.on december,they executed an agreement that contemplated their joint operation of the decker island business and delineated their respective shares in the business assets.a successor and superseding agreement dated may,the settlement agreement,resolve d the differences of the parties and confirmed their interests in the recovery and the decker island business percent to hyon,and percent to colangelo.they expressed an intent to transfer the assets of the recovery to a new entity formed and managed by the parties in accordance with their respective percentage interests stated in the settlement agreement.hyon and colangelo further agreed to use their best efforts to cooperate in the operation of the business of decker island and resolution of their remaining claims and disputes.the settlement agreement also specified that the contents of the trust shall be distributed in accordance with the written direction of the parties to the trustee.shopoff cavallo llp hyon colangelo,supra,wl.
colangelo sought to implement a partnership with hyon which also included selten as an active partner in the future operation of the decker island business.selten agreed to relinquish his percent interest in the recovery in exchange for a corresponding interest in the partnership.hyon,colangelo and selten thus embarked upon a new partnership,referred to as decker sand,llc,or newco,with their percentage interests in the partnership set at percent,percent,and percent,respectively.they advised shopoff that the three of them were members of the partnership,with an office at selten address,and were entitled to make all business decisions related to the sand mining operation.until july of,hyon,colangelo and selten functioned as partners to conduct the decker island business,with decisions made upon agreement of at least two of the three partners.shopoff cavallo llp hyon colangelo,supra,wl.
nevertheless,the relationships between the parties continued to deteriorate.hyon subsequently disavowed that selten held any valid,enforceable interest in the decker island business or partnership and repudiated the existence of any partnership with colangelo and selten.he requested that colangelo transfer control of the decker island business venture entirely to him.he also demanded that shopoff transfer the corporate stock to him.colangelo,in turn,advised shopoff not to turn over the stock to appellant,repudiated their settlement agreement,and terminated their partnership relationship.shopoff cavallo llp hyon colangelo,supra,wl.
on september,shopoff filed a complaint in interpleader in the superior court of the city county of san francisco the interpleader action to resolve multiple,conflicting claims with respect to the interests of the named included hyon,colangelo,selten,and the attorney claimants or their the recovery.the complaint alleged that as a result of an unyielding dispute among the claimants,the trustee of the recovery was given no direction or instructions,and was subjected to multiple and conflicting claims and demands with respect to the recovery.shopoff further alleged that the recovery was in imminent danger of loss due to the impasse of the conflicting claimants and array of conflicting demands.the complaint requested a determination of the validity and value of the share of each claimant in the proceeds of the recovery,an order delineating the respective rights and duties of the parties,appointment of a receiver to take possession and control of the recovery,and a discharge of the trustee from all liability to the defendants.shopoff cavallo llp hyon colangelo,supra,wl.
the defendants submitted answers to shopoff interpleader complaint in which their various claims to the recovery were asserted,and numerous and related pleadings were filed.first,on september,hyon filed a complaint,followed by a second amended complaint,in los angeles county superior court the la action against colangelo and selten,among others,for breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duties,fraud,and injunctive and declaratory relief.hyon la action essentially sought to enforce the provisions of the agreement with colangelo,to obtain a judicial determination that the partnership with colangelo and selten was invalid and unenforceable,and to distribute the proceeds of the recovery.shopoff cavallo llp hyon colangelo,supra,wl.
selten against hyon,colangelo,and others in the la action.selten first amended alleged claims for breach of partnership agreement,breach of fiduciary duty,and fraud,as well as common counts for the agreed price or,alternatively,the reasonable value of work,labor,and services he rendered.hyon,supra,th,d.
on december,colangelo filed a against hyon and selten in the interpleader action for dissolution of partnership and an accounting,rescission,breach of fiduciary duty,and intentional interference with contract.colangelo requested appointment of a receiver and liquidation of the partnership assets.pursuant to a change of venue motion by hyon,the court ordered a transfer of colangelo to los angeles county.colangelo and selten then filed against hyon in the la action which included causes of action for dissolution of partnership,rescission,fraud,breach of fiduciary duty,and breach of partnership agreement.they requested a dissolution of the partnerships,appointment of a receiver,and a determination of the respective rights of the parties to the recovery and the decker island business partnership.shopoff cavallo llp hyon colangelo,supra,wl.
hyon filed a against shopoff in the interpleader action on january,which alleged that shopoff committed legal malpractice,conversion,breach of fiduciary duties,misappropriation of assets,and constructive fraud.after shopoff demurrers were ultimately sustained to hyon first and second amended,shopoff remitted the sum of in the interpleader action to satisfy hyon claims of his misconduct.shopoff cavallo llp hyon colangelo,supra,wl.
on april,colangelo and selten filed a motion in the interpleader action for appointment of a receiver to take possession of the recovery proceeds.the motion was joined by shopoff,kirk and bien.hyon was the only party to the interpleader action who actively opposed the motion.shopoff cavallo llp hyon colangelo,supra,wl.
the interpleader action and the la action proceeded along separate but intermittently intertwined paths.hyon moved for summary judgment on selten first amended in the la action on grounds that all of selten claims were based on the illegal and unenforceable contract,which called for selten to engage in the unauthorized practice of law and to provide unlawful attorney referral services bus,hyon,supra,th,d.
in opposition to the motion,selten argued that the contract did not call for,and he did not in fact engage in,the unauthorized practice of law.hyon,supra,th,d.selten did not dispute that neither he nor nln was registered with the state bar as an attorney referral service as required by section,but introduced declarations from attorneys disner,kirk,bien,and shopoff,among others,in which they stated that they never witnessed selten engage in the unauthorized practice of law,and that all legal work was performed by them or under their supervision or control,without selten interference or participation.selten separately asserted that his business,nln,did not constitute an attorney referral service within the meaning of section.selten also recited in his declaration that he worked approximately hours for hyon and colangelo pursuant to the agreement until the decker island litigation was settled in.hyon,supra,at,d.
the trial court in the la action granted hyon summary judgment motion on the ground that selten provided unlawful attorney referral services to hyon and colangelo pursuant to his agreement with them.the court further found that the unlawful provisions of the contract could not be severed,and was therefore unenforceable in its entirety.all of selten claims required proof of the unlawful contract and the consideration purportedly due under it,so the court determined that hyon was entitled to judgment in his favor on selten first amended.the court did not reach the issue of the unauthorized practice of law hyon,supra,th,d.
then,a fter a hearing in the interpleader action on the motion to appoint a receiver on june,the trial court found that the inability of hyon,colangelo and selten to agree on important issues related to the operation of the decker island business placed the recovery in serious risk of loss and material injury,and a receiver is required to preserve the property and the rights of the interested parties,which parties include not only hyon and colangelo,but probably the other parties in this action.the court granted the receiver full powers to manage the recovery to preserve and maximize its value,including encumbering the recovery in order to preserve it,such as obtaining a loan secured by the assets.shopoff cavallo llp hyon colangelo,supra,wl.an appeal to this court followed.
while the appeal was pending,hyon legal claims in the la action were tried to a jury the remaining equitable issues were briefed and argued to the court.a judgment was entered on november,which resolved all causes of action as to all parties.hyon recovered nothing on his complaint against selten and colangelo.hyon,supra,th,d.the court ruled that hyon established no legal liability against colangelo and selten on his causes of action for breach of contract,fraud,concealment,breach of fiduciary duty,constructive fraud,and negligence.no partnership agreement with selten was found,but the settlement agreement between hyon and colangelo was found not rescinded,and pursuant to it their ownership interests in the decker island business were distributed percent to hyon and percent to colangelo,with their commensurate shares of the recovery under the gsa calculated as percent to hyon and percent to colangelo.the judgment in the la action expressly did not dissolve the partnership of hyon and the partnership relationship was declared ripe for dissolution and directed that all remaining disputes between the parties were to be resolved in the san francisco interpleader action.shopoff cavallo llp hyon colangelo,supra,wl.selten filed a timely appeal from the judgment,challenging only the ruling on hyon motion for summary judgment on the first amended.hyon,supra,at,d.the remainder of the judgment became final on january.
then,while selten appeal of the summary judgment in favor of hyon was pending,in an opinion filed on june,we affirmed the trial court appointment of a receiver in the interpleader action with full powers to manage the recovery to preserve and maximize its value.shopoff cavallo llp hyon colangelo,supra,wl.the interpleader action returned to the trial court for resolution of the competing claims of the parties to their percentage shares of the recovery.
the appeal in the la action was still pending when the trial court issued its statement of decision in the case now before us on may.the court considered and determined the various individual claims to the recovery based on the contingent fee agreements of shopoff,selten,kirk,pine and the law firm of ervin,cohen and jessup with hyon and colangelo.to resolve the validity and extent of the individual claims to shares of the recovery,the court confronted hyon claims of unclean hands,unconscionability,violations of the rules of professional conduct of the state bar of california,primarily rule,judicial estoppel,selten unauthorized practice of law without a license and operation of an illegal lawyer referral service,and ethical considerations.the court found that the retainer agreements did not violate rule,selten did not operate an illegal referral service or engage in the unauthorized practice of law,and respondents shares were not subject to diminution under equitable principles.other than reducing the percentage share awarded to the law firm of ervin,cohen and jessup from the court found was an unfairly high percent,the court awarded respondents the full shares they claimed from the residue of the recovery,along with costs advanced and attorney fees.
motions for attorney fees were subsequently filed and considered by the trial court.after a hearing,the court awarded the respondents costs and attorney fees as the prevailing parties,in their actions against hyon hyon was found not to be the prevailing party in any of the various actions and was denied an award of costs or attorney fees.the court filed an amended order that approved the receiver final report,terminated the receivership,discharged the receiver,and distributed the recovery assets on september,hyon has appealed from orders in the interpleader action and the order awarding attorney fees.
in june of,the second district court of appeal issued its opinion in hyon,supra,th,d,in which it agreed with the trial court conclusion that selten agreement with hyon and colangelo was illegal in part and that the illegal portions can not be severed from the remainder of the agreement,but further concluded that selten should nonetheless be permitted to pursue his common count for the reasonable value of any lawful services rendered.id.at,d.the la action was remanded,with selten granted the opportunity to pursue his common count for reasonable value of services he lawfully provided,and hyon free to pursue the claim that selten engaged in the unauthorized practice of law and for that reason was not entitled to any recovery id.at,d.
discussion 
hyon waiver of the right to appeal.
as a threshold matter we first confront respondents claim that hyon waived the right to pursue the present appeal by his voluntary acceptance of the benefits of the judgment in the form of distribution of his adjudicated share of the proceeds of the recovery.respondents rely on the settled rule that the voluntary acceptance of the benefits of a judgment will bar appeal therefrom in re marriage of fonstein cal d,citing gudelj gudelj cal d,schubert reich cal d.they claim that hyon has obtained substantial benefits from the judgment,and can not now be heard to appeal those portions of the judgment with which he disagrees.
however,the rule that voluntary acceptance of the benefits of a judgment bars appeal therefrom is subject to qualifications.citation.the party relying on a waiver theory must demonstrate a clear and unmistakable acquiescence in the judgment,an unconditional,voluntary,and absolute acceptance of the fruits thereof.citations.kacha allstate ins.th,d.furthermore,where the benefits accepted are those to which the appellant would be entitled even in the event of reversal,acceptance thereof does not bar prosecution of the appeal.citations.thus,i f the appeal is only from a portion of a judgment in which the issues are severable,the portions from which no appeal is taken may become final and beyond the scope of review of the appellate court citations and so where the judgment clearly establishes the appellant right to recover but the amount is less than he demands,he may accept it and nevertheless appeal,claiming the larger recovery.citations.citation.in re marriage of fonstein,supra,cal d.
hyon has accepted distribution of a portion of the proceeds of the recovery to which he is entitled under the trial court judgment,but claims in this appeal that the trial court erred by failing to reduce the share awarded to respondents and commensurately increase the judgment awarded to him.we conclude that hyon has preserved his appeal rights by consistently pursuing his objections to the trial court rulings in re marriage of cream th,d,and has not acquiesced in the judgment below or waived his right to appeal.in re marriage of fonstein,supra,cal d,kacha allstate ins,supra,th,d phillips isham d.
ii.the rulings on shopoff demurrers to hyon.
addressing the merits of the appeal,we first turn to hyon argument that the trial court erred by sustaining shopoff demurrers to his first and second amended in the interpleader action.shopoff demurrer to the first amended was sustained by the court on june,without leave to amend as to the conversion and abuse of process causes of action and with leave to amend as to the causes of action for legal malpractice,breach of fiduciary duty,constructive fraud and accounting.hyon filed a second amended on june,shopoff responded with a general and special demurrer.after a hearing,the court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend the cause of action for legal malpractice and the part of the breach of fiduciary action that alleged misappropriation of the recovery assets,and without leave to amend as to the remaining associated causes of action.hyon did not amend the second amended,but rather filed a motion for reconsideration,along with a proposed third amended,which was denied for failure to assert new and different facts as required by code of civil procedure section.hyon now claims that he properly alleged causes of action for conversion,legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty,and his pleading was erroneously dismissed.
our task in reviewing a judgment sustaining a demurrer is to determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.citation.we assume the truth of the properly pleaded material facts and the reasonable inferences that may be drawn therefrom.citation.we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.reynolds bement cal th,d.
a.the conversion cause of action.
hyon maintains that he alleged the essential elements of a conversion action,which are the plaintiff ownership or right to possession of the property at the time of the conversion the defendant conversion by a wrongful act or disposition of property rights and damages.it is not necessary that there be a manual taking of the property it is only necessary to show an assumption of control or ownership over the property,or that the alleged converter has applied the property to his own use.citations.citation.money can be the subject of an action for conversion if a specific sum capable of identification is involved.farmers ins.exchange zerin th,d.hyon asserts that he was entitled to ownership of the recovery proceeds,and at least a portion of the shares of common stock of mega sand and taiki converted by shopoff failure to transfer or return it to him and colangelo upon request.he also alleged in the that additional conversion occurred as a result of losses he incurred by being unable to take the corporate actions necessary to operate the decker island business as a going concern.
we have no quarrel with the premise espoused by hyon that some of the recovery assets,including the stock in the decker island business,may be the proper subject of a conversion action.see fremont indemnity fremont general th,d.where hyon conversion cause of action patently founders,however,is in the failure to assert the essential elements that shopoff exercised dominion over the recovery proceeds and converted them to his own use.shopoff,as trustee of the recovery proceeds,retained and interpled the funds precisely to avoid potential liability for conversion.if he had disbursed the funds to an improper that was hyon or anyone knowledge that another claimant had lawful contractual rights to the proceeds,an action for conversion against him may have been appropriate.see farmers ins.exchange smith th,d fischer machado th,d mccafferty gilbank d.miller rau d.instead,when presented with competing claims,shopoff properly held the funds,then filed the interpleader action,and thereby avoided the risk of liability to the person lawfully entitled to the recovery proceeds if it turned out that the person to whom the distribution was made was not rightfully entitled to the funds.see kaiser foundation health plan,aguiluz th.d.
shopoff as a mere custodian,intermediary or conduit,who interpled the recovery proceeds when faced with conflicting claims,did not exercise dominion over the funds sufficient to convert them to his own use in denial of hyon rights.see simonian patterson th,d.a party who interpleads funds can not be held accountable in tort because it declined to resolve a problem and instead tendered the funds into court for resolution of competing claims to funds it held.cantu resolution trust th,d italics omitted,citing pacific loan management superior court d.as a matter of law hyon did not state a cause of action for conversion against shopoff,and we are convinced that there is no reasonable possibility an amendment can cure the glaring defect in the pleading.the trial court did not err by sustaining the demurrer to the conversion cause of action without leave to amend.simonian,supra,at,d.
b.the legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty causes of action.
we proceed to the legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty causes of action,which we examine together,as both are based on shopoff status and associated duties as counsel for hyon.actionable legal malpractice is compounded of the same basic elements as other kinds of actionable negligence duty,breach of duty,causation,and damage.the elements of a cause of action for professional negligence are the duty of the professional to use such skill,prudence and diligence as other members of the profession commonly possess and exercise breach of that duty a causal connection between the negligent conduct and the resulting injury and actual loss or damage resulting from the professional negligence.citation.loube loube th,d.to establish a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty,a plaintiff must demonstrate the existence of a fiduciary relationship,breach of that duty and damages.charnay cobert th,d.
the trial court found that hyon allegations of proximately caused damages were either inadequate,uncertain or speculative,and we agree.if the allegedly negligent conduct does not cause damage,it generates no cause of action in tort.budd nixen cal d.to show damages proximately caused by the breach,the plaintiff must allege facts establishing that,but for the alleged malpractice,it is more likely than not the plaintiff would have obtained a more favorable result.citations.charnay cobert,supra,th,d,italics omitted.unless a party suffers damage,appreciable and actual harm,as a consequence of his attorney negligence,he can not establish a cause of action for malpractice.breach of duty causing only speculative harm is insufficient to create such a cause of action.citation.d amages may not be based upon sheer speculation or surmise,and the mere possibility or even probability that damage will result from wrongful conduct does not render it actionable.citation.citation.thompson halvonik th,d.also,allegations of damages without allegations of fact to support them are but conclusions of law,which are not admitted by demurrer.zumbrun university of southern california d.on demurrer,the court does not assume the truth of contentions,deductions or conclusions of law.soliz williams th,d.
hyon legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty causes of action,although infused with a multitude of complicated and in some instances confusing or even inconsistent allegations,are based on several essential theories of proximately caused damages.the first is that without shopoff breach of of improperly inducing hyon to agree to the gsa by representing that he would thereafter operate the decker island business,but not disclosing the liens granted to shopoff and the other claimants that effectively prevented that would not have approved the settlement,and ultimately would have obtained a more beneficial result in the decker island litigation by enforcing the million judgment so as to own the business and assets free and clear,without the personal obligation to pay the defendants million.hyon also alleged that shopoff provided him with inadequate advice associated with the approval of the gsa that diminished the value of the recovery by failing to clarify the status of the deed of trust which secured the million indebtedness owed by hyon and colangelo to the defendants and gave them a first position security interest in decker island,and with it the right to foreclose on the decker island business in the event the indebtedness is not paid by failing to investigate,consider,or advise hyon of substantial potential tax issues associated with the gsa that would have substantially lessened the tax burden now facing him by failing to discover a debt owed by the companies whose stock was included in the recovery proceeds and,by forcing hyon to incur a personal debt to continue operation of the decker island business and thereby preserve the recovery assets due to his inability to operate the business without the threat of foreclosure by lienholders.
hyon theories of recovery for legal malpractice in the suffer from a critical infirmity they pled speculative damages that might occur in the future,but had not yet occurred.our high court has repeatedly stressed,the mere breach of a professional duty,causing only nominal damages,speculative harm,or the threat of future yet not suffice to create a cause of action for negligence citation.jordache enterprises,brobeck,phleger harrison cal th,d,italics added see also budd nixen,supra,cal d,fritz ehrmann th,d jackson johnson th,d.hence,until the client suffers appreciable harm as a consequence of his attorney negligence,the client can not establish a cause of action for malpractice.citation.international engine parts,feddersen cal th,d,see also sahadi scheaffer th,d sindell gibson,dunn crutcher th,d.uncertainty as to the fact of damage negatives the existence of a cause of action.roger smith,shn consulting engineers geologists,th,d,citing walker pacific indemnity d.
all of hyon asserted claims of proximately caused damages are predicated on the fact that the ultimate liquidation and distribution of the recovery proceeds would result in less compensation to him than he would have realized if he had eschewed the gsa and proceeded to collect the entire million judgment in the decker island litigation.but when the pleadings and demurrers were filed,the recovery proceeds had been interpled and remained in the control of a court appointed receiver.until liquidation,the value of the stock and other tangible and intangible property awarded to hyon and colangelo in the gsa was could possibly exceed even the most optimistic recovery by hyon under the terms of the decker island litigation judgment.any damages hyon claimed from shopoff alleged legal malpractice were contingent upon the amount of the eventual liquidation of the recovery proceeds.the damages he asserted from the subordinate security interest on the deed of trust and the attendant potential for foreclosure was also contingent upon his default on the million debt to the decker island litigation defendants,which had not yet happened.further,no tax liability had been imposed upon hyon and,he was not alleged to be liable finally and directly for the debt owed by the decker island business entities whose stock was awarded to him and colangelo in the gsa.even hyon personal debt for expenses to operate the decker island business was to be repaid with the recovery proceeds and may not result in damages to him.in short,all of the harm alleged by hyon was potential and speculative,dependent on the outcome of the liquidation of the recovery proceeds 
as we read the operative pleading,the fact of any actual loss remained contingent rather than actual.see adams paul cal th,d,horne peckham d.fazio hayhurst d.i f the propriety of an attorney advice is contingent on the outcome of a claim by or against the client,the client does not sustain actual injury until the claim is resolved adversely,which indicates both that the attorney erred and that the error caused harm.van dyke dunker aced th,d see also baltins james th,d.actual injury occurs only when the client finally suffers a detriment,which is not merely potential or tentative,as a direct result of the malpractice tchorbadjian western home ins.th,d.even the mere probability that a certain event would have happened will not furnish the foundation for malpractice damages.damages to be subject to a proper award must be such as follows the act complained of as a legal certainty.citations.barnard langer th,d,italics omitted.
the trial court recognized that hyon may be able to state damages,particularly associated with the million debt he incurred in the gsa,and thus granted him the opportunity to file a new amended to plead other damages which are not speculative,but an amended pleading was never properly filed.nor did hyon demonstrate that an amendment would cure the defect in his.ortega contra costa community college dist.th,d ford pacific gas electric th,d.we are left with a pleading that did not state causes of action for legal malpractice or breach of fiduciary duty.the trial court did not err by sustaining shopoff demurrer to hyon.
iii.the right of hyon to a jury trial in the interpleader action.
hyon also argues that he was improperly denied the right to a jury trial on the interpleader action.he maintains each respondent presented essentially a contract claim for an interest in the recovery proceeds,which entailed a legal issue for resolution by a jury,despite his own assertion of an unclean hands defense to the action and the incidental application of equitable principles to the distribution of the interpleaded funds.from this premise hyon complains that by removing the legal issues from the hands of the jury the trial court deprived him of his constitutional right to a jury trial.
in c k engineering contractors amber steel cal d,our supreme court stated the right to a jury trial is guaranteed by our constitution.cal,art.i.we have long acknowledged that the right so guaranteed,however,is the right as it existed at common law in,when the constitution was first adopted,and what that right is,is a purely historical question,a fact which is to be ascertained like any other social,political or legal fact.citations.as a general proposition,t he jury trial is a matter of right in a civil action at law,but not in equity.citations.thus,at common law,the right to a jury trial existed for actions at law only,and there was no right to jury in an equitable action.people bhakta th,d.code of civil procedure section also specifically provides in full in actions for the recovery of specific,real,or personal property,with or without damages,or for money claimed as due upon contract,or as damages for breach of contract,or for injuries,an issue of fact must be tried by a jury,unless a jury trial is waived,or a reference is ordered,as provided in this code.where in these cases there are issues both of law and fact,the issue of law must be first disposed of.in other cases,issues of fact must be tried by the court,subject to its power to order any such issue to be tried by a jury,or to be referred to a referee,as provided in this code.corder corder cal th,d,see also kim yi th,d.
we recently discussed the essential precepts that govern the right to a jury trial in civil actions if the action is essentially one in equity and the relief sought depends upon the application of equitable doctrines,the parties are not entitled to a jury trial.citations.if the action has to deal with ordinary rights cognizable in courts of law,it is to that extent an action at law.in determining whether the action was one triable by a jury at common law,the court is not bound by the form of the action but rather by the nature of the rights involved and the facts of the particular gist of the action.a jury trial must be granted where the gist of the action is legal,where the action is in reality cognizable at law.citation.on the other hand,if the action is essentially one in equity and the relief sought depends upon the application of equitable doctrines,the parties are not entitled to a jury trial.citation.citations.dipirro bondo th,d.we realize that an action is not classified as equitable merely because it requires the application of equitable principles the fact that equitable principles are applied in the action does not necessarily identify the resultant relief as equitable.citations.equitable principles are a guide to courts of law as well as of equity.citations.citations.jogani superior court th,d.rather,references to the gist of the action are an expression of the rule that i n classifying a given action as legal or equitable,the court looks to its substance,the nature of the rights at issue and the remedy sought citations.id.at,d.
the gist of an interpleader action is not the subject of any dispute in the law.i nterpleader is an equitable proceeding in which the rights of the parties,as between themselves,are governed by principles of equity.williams gilmore d,see also virtanen th,d dial fesbinder th,d city of morgan hill brown th,d state farm life ins.pearce d.the purpose of interpleader is to prevent a multiplicity of suits and double vexation.citation.the right to the remedy by interpleader is founded,however,not on the consideration that a person may be subjected to double liability,but on the fact that he is threatened with double vexation in respect to one liability.citation.city of morgan hill,supra,at,d.in an interpleader action,the court initially determines the right of the plaintiff to interplead the funds if that right is sustained,an interlocutory decree is entered which requires the defendants to interplead and litigate their claims to the funds.dial,supra,at,d,italics added.then,in the second phase of an interpleader proceeding,the trial court also has the power under code of civil procedure section to adjudicate the issues raised by the interpleader action including the alleged existence of conflicting claims regarding the interpleaded funds plaintiffs alleged position as a disinterested mere stakeholder and ultimately the disposition of the interpleaded funds after deducting plaintiffs attorney fees.id.at,d.
the california supreme court long ago established the principle that a suit in interpleader,such as this one,and involving like issues,is an equitable proceeding in which the rights of the parties as between themselves are governed by principles of equity citations,and in such cases the right to a trial by jury does not exist citation.union mutual life ins.broderick cal,italics added.even if the underlying controversy was one of law,the gravamen of an interpleader action between rival claimants to the proceeds is of an equitable nature,and denial of an application for a jury trial is not error.pomeroy collins cal.
recently in corder corder,supra,cal th,d,our high court acknowledged that in an action to apportion the proceeds of an award of pecuniary damages among heirs following settlement of the underlying wrongful death suit,the general equitable nature of apportionment proceedings precludes a jury trial,even if the court takes additional evidence regarding the competing interests in the proceeds.the court further concluded that code of civil procedure section,which grants the right to a jury trial for issues of fact in actions for the recovery of specific,real,or personal property,with or without damages,or for money claimed as due upon contract,or as damages for breach of contract,or for injuries,provides no independent basis for a right to a jury in the apportionment of wrongful death settlement proceeds.corder,supra,at,d.p roceedings to apportion a settlement fund among heirs are not actions for injuries within section contemplation,because they typically involve no allegation of injury infliction or wrongdoing by one heir against other heirs.id.at,d,citing kim yi,supra,th,d.furthermore,the court added,to the extent plaintiff assumes a separate interpleader action or a separate quiet title action would afford the right to a jury,plaintiff is wrong.union mutual life ins.broderick cal,interpleader thomson thomson cal d,quiet title action when possession of the property not involved see estate of phelps d.quiet title.id.at,d,italics added.
similarly,the apportionment of the recovery proceeds from the settlement of the underlying decker island litigation among competing claimants in the interpleader action before us is an equitable proceeding that does not bring with it the right to a jury trial.the legal remedy of the total amount of damages to be awarded to the parties was conclusively decided in the gsa.hyon legal claims against shopoff had been resolved by the trial court prior rulings that sustained demurrers to the amended.for purposes of the right to a jury trial,the primary remaining issue in the interpleader action was apportionment,and the fact that the equitable issue of apportionment was dependent partially upon resolution of contractual issues of law does not change that.corder corder,supra,cal th,d,citing kim yi,supra,th,d see also williams gilmore,supra,d.
further,this is not a case in which the sole claim was to enforce the legal remedy of quantum meruit recovery for the reasonable value of services provided.see jogani superior court,supra,th,d.the possible quantum meruit claims were decidedly peripheral and alternative to the substance and nature of the rights at issue,and were ultimately never reached by the court.even hyon claims that the underlying retainer agreements of respondents were unenforceable did not depend upon resolution of legal contractual issues,but instead on essentially equitable considerations related to the effect of the illegality of the contracts upon the parties rights to recover.see chiba greenwald th,d yoo robi th,d.although tangential legal issues may have remained for adjudication,the gist of the interpleader action was equitable.pomeroy collins,supra,cal.we conclude that the trial court did not err by denying hyon the right to a jury trial.union mutual life ins.broderick,supra,cal.
iv.business and professions code section.
next,we confront hyon argument that neither selten nor any of those attorneys who received illegal referrals from him may be awarded any portion of the recovery proceeds.hyon maintains that selten violated section by providing unlawful attorney referral services,and thus can not recover under his unenforceable contingent fee agreement.he points out that the second district court of appeal so concluded in the recent opinion in hyon,supra,th,d,and that final determination is binding in this action under collateral estoppel principles.he adds that section also provides that no attorney shall accept an unlawful referral of potential clients,so the retainer agreements of those respondents who accepted referrals from selten are unenforceable.hyon therefore requests that we reverse the contingent fee shares awarded to the attorneys who accepted illegal referrals from selten,and strike the awards of contractual attorney fees to them.
a.the collateral estoppel effect of the ruling in hyon upon selten.
as selten acknowledges,the opinion in hyon,supra,th,d,determined that he or nln did recruit counsel for hyon and colangelo,because otherwise he would not be entitled to anything under the contract.because the contract called for nln to operate for the direct or indirect purpose,in whole or in part,of referring potential clients to attorneys,it violated section.nor do the parties dispute that nln did so operate,pursuant to the contract.the court in hyon further concluded the contract is therefore illegal,at least in part.and because the contract provided for only a single consideration the contingent fee in exchange for all of nln services,including attorney referrals,the illegal portions of the contract can not be severed.the trial court thus correctly concluded that the contract is illegal and unenforceable in its entirety.ibid.nevertheless,the hyon opinion found that the trial court erred when it concluded that the illegality of the contract barred selten claim for the reasonable value of the lawful services he or nln provided.selten can not recover for the reasonable value of his unlawful attorney referral services,his unauthorized practice of law if any,or other unlawful conduct if any.but he may recover the reasonable value of the lawful work he performed.id.at,d.
selten,hyon and this court are bound by the pronouncements made in the hyon opinion.t he fundamental principles that govern the doctrine of collateral estoppel are issue preclusion by collateral estoppel prevents relitigation of issues argued and decided in prior proceedings.citation.citations.the doctrine rests upon the ground that the party to be affected,or some other with whom he is in privity,has litigated,or had an opportunity to litigate the same matter in a former action in a court of competent jurisdiction,and should not be permitted to litigate it again to the harassment and vexation of his opponent citations.citation.mooney caspari th,d.traditionally,collateral estoppel has been found to bar relitigation of an issue decided at a previous proceeding if the issue necessarily decided at the previous proceeding is identical to the one which is sought to be relitigated the previous proceeding resulted in a final judgment on the merits and the party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted was a party or in privity with a party at the prior proceeding.citations.citations.in addition to these factors,the courts consider whether the party against whom the earlier decision is asserted had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue.citation.citation.ibid.
the final and definitive decision in hyon that selten can not recover on his illegal and unenforceable agreement is identical to the issue presented here.the opinion in hyon became final,so it must be given collateral estoppel effect.see rodgers sargent controls aerospace th,d golden cheese voss d.brake beech aircraft d.not only is the issue here identical,but selten was a party to the hyon action.we must therefore follow the hyon opinion to conclude in this action that respondent selten contingent fee arrangement with hyon and colangelo is illegal in its entirety,and therefore he is not entitled to the specified percent share of the recovery proceeds as awarded by the trial court.
selten nevertheless seeks to save a portion of his contingent fee by claiming that colangelo has not disputed selten rights to the contingency fee he owes under the is,half of the total percent fee owed conjointly by colangelo and hyon has the right to challenge of the contingency fee,not the entire.selten also submits that the percent increase in his contingent fee from to percent as agreed to by hyon and colangelo in was separate and distinct from the agreement,and hence not tainted by the illegality.he further claims that the settlement agreement of the parties,by which he was expressly given a share ultimately percent of the trial court reduction of the fee paid to the ervin,cohen jessup law firm from percent to percent,is also separate and can not be taken from him by the hyon opinion.the straightforward response to selten claim is that the hyon opinion found selten contingent fee contract illegal and unenforceable in its entirety.hyon,supra,th,d.the fact that colangelo may be willing to honor his contractual obligation to selten does not render the agreement valid in part,nor does it grant selten the right to recover any portion of his contingent fee.the percent increase in selten contingent fee in,and the right granted to him to share in the diminution of the ervin,cohen jessup award,are also based on the illegal agreement,and as the court in hyon indicated,can not be severed.id.at,d.
under the binding authority of hyon,we are compelled to decide that selten can not recover any part of his contingent fee share of the proceeds of the recovery.we must also conclude,however,that appellant hyon is equally bound by the determination that selten may be entitled to recover the reasonable value of the lawful work he is,other than unlawful attorney referral services or any unauthorized practice of determined on remand 
b.the collateral estoppel effect of the ruling in hyon on the other respondents.
the other respondents in the present case are not bound by any adjudication of the issues in hyon.none were parties to the la action,nor were any of them in privity with selten.without a strict identity of parties,collateral estoppel must be based upon the concept of privity.collateral estoppel applies not only to parties to an action or proceeding,but also to those in privity with the parties.citation.privity refers to a mutual or successive relationship to the same rights of property,or to such an identification in interest of one person with another as to represent the same legal rights citations and,more recently,to a relationship between the party to be estopped and the unsuccessful party in the prior litigation which is sufficiently close so as to justify application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel.citations.citations.this requirement of identity of parties or privity is a requirement of due process of law.citation.citations.citations.citation.mooney caspari,supra,th,d.only selten was a party to the la action,and he did not represent the interests of the other respondents.there is nothing in the record before us to suggest that the other respondents participated in the la action by gathering information or assisting any party in that litigation.mooney,supra,at,d.
moreover,the opinion in hyon did not address or resolve the issue of the effect of selten illegal referral contract upon the right of the other retained attorneys to recover their percentage shares of the recovery proceeds pursuant to their separate contingent fee agreements.the court in the hyon case,not having any parties but hyon,colangelo and selten before it,did not adjudicate the issue of illegal acceptance of referrals by respondents.the hyon opinion also did not make any findings that attorneys other than disner were even recruited by selten to act as counsel for hyon and colangelo in violation of section thus,with the sole exception of selten,the hyon opinion does not preclude respondents,disner included,from recovering pursuant to their contingent fee agreements with hyon and colangelo.
c.the acceptance of referrals by respondents.
we turn to the merits of hyon claim that respondents accepted illegal referrals from selten in violation of section,which not only proscribes any business that operates for the direct or indirect purpose,in whole or in part,of referring potential clients to attorneys,but also provides that no attorney shall accept a referral of such potential clients,unless the enumerated requirements of the statute are met this issue was presented to the trial court in the present case by hyon,but was not explicitly resolved due to the court finding that selten did not operate an illegal referral service hyon now complains that under section,just as selten agreement is unenforceable,the retainer agreements entered into by the attorneys who accepted referrals from selten are unenforceable because such attorneys would not have earned their fees without the illegal conduct accepting the illegal referral.nor,for the same reasons,can the trial court award of attorney fees based on those contracts stand.
first,nothing in the pronouncement in hyon that selten operated an illegal referral service consequentially establishes acceptance of an illegal referral on the part of any of the attorneys.operating an illegal referral service and accepting an illegal referral are separate violations and separate issues under section.the hyon opinion thus has no collateral estoppel effect in this proceeding on our resolution of the issue of whether respondents violated section by accepting illegal referrals of potential clients from selten.noble draper th,d.for a prior adjudication to give rise to issue preclusion,it must appear that the identical issue was actually litigated and necessarily decided in a prior proceeding.yield dynamics,tea systems th,d,italics omitted.unless the issue or cause of action in the two actions is identical,the first judgment does not stand as a bar to the second suit.citations.if anything is left to conjecture as to what was necessarily involved and decided there can be no collateral estoppel citations i t must appear that the precise question was raised and determined in the former suit citation.citation.dunkin boskey th,d.we must examine individually the circumstances of the various retainer agreements of the attorneys to determine if an acceptance of an illegal referral occurred 
upon doing so we do not find substantial evidence in the record to establish that any of the respondents accepted an illegal referral.first,pine was retained long before selten was involved in the case at all.once selten was hired,we know from the evidence and findings that he recruited at least disner,and disner then separately recruited kirk and bien to work on the decker island litigation for hyon and colangelo.selten recruitment of disner services do not establish an illegal acceptance of referrals by bien and kirk for purposes of section.bien and kirk accepted referrals from disner,not selten.selten operation of an illegal referral service does not taint the agreements of bien and kirk obtained through the efforts of disner,and nothing in the record indicates to us that disner conducted a referral service that failed to comply with section.
the evidence also demonstrates that shopoff did not accept a referral from selten.rather,he was initially contacted by bien through another attorney named bob wallach.hyon then proposed the contingent fee agreement for shopoff to act as counsel in the decker island litigation.at most,selten assisted hyon by contacting shopoff periodically during the discussion process,but his tangential participation did not include referral services.shopoff did not accept an illegal referral.
even disner,who,according to the decision in hyon,was directly engaged by selten,did not,as we view the evidence in the record before us,accept an illegal referral within the meaning of section.we have acknowledged the binding determination in the hyon opinion that selten operated an illegal referral service by obtaining disner services as counsel for hyon and colangelo.we also realize that disner must have therefore at least agreed to accept an offer from selten to represent hyon and colangelo as clients in the decker island litigation.we find nothing in the hyon opinion,however,that establishes a violation of section by disner.the fact that selten acted illegally by operating a referral service in contravention of section does not in itself mean that the referral must have also been accepted illegally by disner within the meaning of the statute.an attorney does not accept an illegal referral pursuant to section merely because he or she was retained by someone who was operating an illegal referral service.as we interpret section,acceptance of an illegal referral by an attorney must be with knowledge of at least the nature of the referral business that violates the is,a business that operates for the direct or indirect purpose,in whole or in part,of referring potential clients to attorneys.id.at subd.a.otherwise,attorneys who have accepted employment in good faith and without any awareness of an association with an illegal operation would fall within the proscription of the statute just by agreeing to represent clients.we are persuaded that the legislature did not intend to punish those who have no knowledge of or complicity in the illegality.
nothing in the record indicates that disner had any knowledge of the nature of selten business operation or his agreement with hyon and colangelo.as the trial court observed,selten assisted with retaining disner pursuant to his agreement with hyon and colangelo,but to do so he did not choose disner from a panel of lawyers to whom he routinely or even sporadically referred business.instead,selten located suitable counsel for his clients by referring to general lists of attorneys.hyon failed to present any evidence that disner was aware of a referral service,legal or illegal,being operated by selten,or even that selten was performing attorney referral services that fell within the provisions of section.disner was certainly aware that selten contacted him to act as counsel for hyon and colangelo,but,as far as the record tells us,nothing more.disner also did not compensate selten in any way for his efforts.as the hyon opinion pointed out,section does not make the commonplace uncompensated attorney referrals illegal.hyon,supra,th,d.nor do we interpret the statute to make an uncompensated acceptance of a referral illegal,particularly where the evidence fails to show the attorney was aware an unlawful referral service was in operation.id.at,d.we therefore conclude that the retainer agreements of the respondents other than selten do not violate section.
hyon also complains that respondents violated rule by acquiring attorney liens on the recovery proceeds in their retainer agreements without complying with the disclosure and consent requirements specified in the rule he argues that the retainer agreements create a charging lien in violation of rule,so neither the liens they create nor the percentage contingent fees can or should be enforced by this court.he maintains that respondents are limited to quantum meruit recovery for the reasonable value of services rendered,to be determined by a jury on remand.
rule prohibits attorneys from acquiring interests adverse to those of their clients unless specified requirements are satisfied.frye tenderloin housing clinic,cal th,d.in fletcher davis cal th,d,fletcher,the california supreme court determined that an attorney charging lien is an adverse interest within the meaning of rule.a charging lien grants the attorney considerable authority to detain all or part of the client recovery whenever a dispute arises over the lien existence or its scope.that would unquestionably be detrimental to the client.ibid.thus,when an attorney wishes to secure payment of hourly legal fees and costs of litigation by obtaining a charging lien against a client future recovery,id.at,d,italics added under rule the attorney must explain the transaction fully,to offer fair and reasonable terms,to provide a copy of the agreement,to give the client an opportunity to seek independent legal advice,and to secure the client written consent.id.at,d,see also fergus songer th,fn,d.if the attorney fails to comply with the rule,the lien may not be enforced in a proceeding to enforce a charging lien.fletcher,supra,at,d,italics added.
the fletcher opinion expressly declined to decide the precise issue presented here,whether rule applies to a arrangement coupled with a lien on the client prospective recovery in the same proceeding.fletcher,supra,cal th,fn,d.the court noted an opinion of the los angeles county bar association,however,that suggested rule did not apply to a contingency fee coupled with a lien against the client prospective recovery in the same matter in which legal services are being provided.cal.compendium on responsibility,county bar.formal opn,italics omitted.but even if we were to find that the rule announced in fletcher extends to liens attached to contingent fee agreements,only the liens asserted by respondents would be unenforceable.id.at.fletcher did not state that noncompliance with rule invalidates an underlying fee agreement or precludes an attorney from recovering a specified contractual fee.
we are also persuaded that granting recovery under a contingent fee agreement although the charging lien may be invalid is consistent with the law of severability of contracts.t he need to void contracts in violation of the law must be tempered by the countervailing public interest in preventing a contracting party from using the doctrine to create an unfair windfall.mcintosh mills th,d.to implement the fundamental rule of law that forfeiture is disfavored,the law of severability of contracts provides in civil code section that,where a contract has several distinct objects,of which one at least is lawful,and one at least is unlawful,in whole or in part,the contract is void as to the latter and valid as to the rest.citation.by its terms,it applies,the parties have contracted,in part,for something illegal.notwithstanding any such illegality,it preserves and enforces any lawful portion of a parties contract that feasibly may be severed.marathon entertainment,blasi cal th,d.
the overarching inquiry is whether the interests of justice would be furthered by severance.citation.citation.citation.templeton development superior court th,d.courts are to look to the various purposes of the contract.if the central purpose of the contract is tainted with illegality,then the contract as a whole can not be enforced.if the illegality is collateral to the main purpose of the contract,and the illegal provision can be extirpated from the contract by means of severance or restriction,then such severance and restriction are appropriate.citations.marathon entertainment,blasi,supra,cal th,d.two reasons to sever illegal terms rather than void the entire contract are to conserve a contractual relationship without condoning an illegal scheme,and prevent parties from gaining undeserved benefit or suffering undeserved detriment as a result of voiding the entire when there has been full or partial performance of the contract.armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,d.when the transaction is of such a nature that the good part of the consideration can be separated from that which is bad,the courts will make the distinction,for the law divides according to common reason and having made that void that is against law,lets the rest stand citations.if the court is unab
