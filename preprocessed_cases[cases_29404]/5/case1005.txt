background 
a.the fair credit billing act,fcba 
congress enacted the fcba in order to regulate billing disputes involving open end consumer credit plans.see gray am.express,the fair credit billing act seeks to prescribe an orderly procedure for identifying and resolving disputes between a cardholder and a card issuer as to the amount due at any given time.if a holder sends a written notice disputing a charge within sixty days of receiving a bill,the fcba requires a issuer to acknowledge the dispute within thirty days,investigate the matter,and provide a written explanation of its decision within ninety days.a am.express koerner,d.
the creditor must send its explanation before making any attempt to collect the disputed amount.koerner,at see also a b.further,the card issuer must notify the cardholder on subsequent statements of account that he need not pay the amount in dispute until the card issuer has complied with.gray,at citing c.additionally,a creditor or his agent may not directly or indirectly threaten to report to any person adversely on the obligor credit rating and such amount may not be reported as delinquent to any third party until the creditor has met these requirements.a.if a creditor fails to comply with any of these provisions,it is subject to civil liability under and forfeiture of the disputed amount under e.
oregon unlawful debt collection practices act,udcpa 
oregon enacted the udcpa to prohibit debt collectors from using specific abusive practices.see.stating that i t shall be an unlawful collection practice for a debt collector,while collecting or attempting to collect a debt to undertake actions such as to threaten the use of force or violence,t hreaten arrest or criminal prosecution,or u se profane,obscene or abusive language in communicating with a debtor specifically,oregon revised statutes k prohibits a debt collector from a ttempt ing to or threaten ing to enforce a right or remedy with knowledge or reason to know that the right or remedy does not exist.
c.the circumstances of the billing dispute 
in,barbee lyon opened a visa account with chase and identified his wife,joan kruse,as an authorized user.in september,lyon wallet was stolen,and he notified chase of the theft of the card.lyon spoke with chase fraud department to identify fraudulent charges but advised chase that a pending charge payable to resorts advantage was a valid,authorized charge.nonetheless,chase declined to make payment on this charge,and after being contacted by resorts advantage,lyon paid the debt through a different credit card.
unbeknownst to lyon,chase mistakenly credited his account during the process of resolving fraudulent charges and issuing a new account number.to correct this mistaken credit,chase added a charge to lyon bill months later,which it incorrectly identified as a transaction with resorts advantage.after confirming that resorts advantage had not been paid by chase,lyon disputed this charge,not knowing that chase was attempting to correct its prior mistake.on april,chase acknowledged receipt of the billing dispute and notified lyon that it was investigating the matter and would write to respond to his question.
chase admits that it never sent a written explanation of the charge and that it failed to respond to multiple letters lyon sent about the issue.indeed,months after the original notification,lyon independently determined that the mistaken credit was the likely basis for the charge and specifically asked chase to confirm this.chase again failed to respond.chase admits that it continued to attempt to collect the debt from lyon and levied finance charges related to the debt.chase also admits that it reported to credit agencies a delinquency by lyon in paying the debt.
procedural history 
lyon and kruse filed this action in the district of oregon,alleging violations of the fcba,a violation of the udcpa,defamation of their credit,and intentional infliction of emotional distress.adopting the findings and recommendation of the magistrate judge,the district court granted chase partial summary judgment.as to the udcpa claim,the magistrate judge found that plaintiffs have presented evidence which,if believed by a trier of fact,could be reasonably viewed as constituting coercive and abusive methods by chase to collect its debts from plaintiffs.nonetheless,the court dismissed the claim,deciding sua sponte that the language of the complaint failed to state a claim under oregon law.as to the fcba claims,the district court found that kruse lacked standing,but lyon claims under the statute remained alive because chase had not contested his standing or allegations.as to the tort actions,the district court found triable issues of fact as to defamation but granted chase summary judgment on the emotional distress claim.
the parties subsequently agreed to proceed before the magistrate judge,who denied appellants motion to amend their complaint.lyon,who is an attorney,had been representing himself up to this point,but retained separate counsel in december as the case neared trial.chase then moved to limit argument or evidence of its multiple violations of the fcba.while admitting it had violated the fcba,chase argued that lyon is precluded from recovering separate statutory penalties for multiple technical violations.the magistrate judge granted this motion in limine during an initial pretrial conference without issuing a written order.
chase further moved to exclude evidence or argument regarding lyon right to recover actual damages,arguing that lyon suffered no economic loss and that an award of actual damages under the fcba requires evidence of detrimental reliance.the magistrate judge stated during the pretrial conference that lyon time and its value does constitute an item of special or actual damage.nonetheless,the court held that lyon had to provide evidence of detrimental reliance in order to support an award of actual damages resulting from chase violations of the fcba.because lyon had not relied on information from chase,as chase had provided none,the court granted the motion.
the magistrate judge subsequently allowed chase to amend its answer to admit liability under the fcba up to a maximum statutory penalty.accordingly,only appellants defamation claim was presented to the jury,which rendered a verdict in favor of chase.although the magistrate judge entered judgment in favor of lyon as to his fcba claims,his recovery was limited to in statutory damages and an award of reasonable attorneys fees.
lyon moved for an award of in attorneys fees,based on the work of his separate counsel before and during trial in pursuing both the fcba and defamation claims.while finding the requested hourly rate reasonable,the court stated that it would grant fees only for work related to lyon attempted recovery of multiple statutory penalties under the fcba,not for any other work.the court found,however,that the billing statements presented in support of the fees did not separately identify work related to pursuing multiple statutory penalties for violations of the fcba.the magistrate judge concluded that the billing statements therefore did not meet the level of specificity for fee petitions recommended by the district of oregon on this basis,the court decided that it was unable to award such fees because the billing statement is insufficiently specific.the magistrate judge then denied lyon request for attorneys fees completely.
ii.discussion 
arguing that the district court misconstrued the basis of their udcpa claim,appellants first contend that the district court erred in deciding that they failed to state a claim under oregon law.further,they ask this court to certify the following question to the oregon supreme court whether a creditor violates oregon udcpa when its attempt to collect a debt is prohibited by the fcba.as to lyon claims under the fcba,he contends that the magistrate judge erred by requiring evidence of detrimental reliance to support actual damages and by restricting statutory damages to a single penalty.finally,lyon argues that the magistrate judge abused his discretion in denying any award of attorneys fees related to his fcba claims.
standard of review 
while neither the magistrate judge nor the district court identified the procedural basis for the sua sponte dismissal of appellants udcpa claim,we construe the dismissal for failure to state a claim as being made under rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure.see.c after the pleadings are closed but early enough not to delay trial a party may move for judgment on the pleadings.dworkin hustler magazine,cir noting that dismissal for failure to state a claim under rule b is functionally identical to a dismissal under rule c.we review judgments on the pleadings made under rule c de novo.ileto glock,cir citing fajardo cnty.of,cir.a judgment on the pleadings is properly granted when,taking all the allegations in the pleadings as true,a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.dunlap credit prot.ass n,cir per curiam quoting owens kaiser found.health plan,cir.

appellants claim under the udcpa 
as noted,oregon enacted the udcpa to prohibit debt collectors in the state from using certain abusive collection practices.see.specifically,k prohibits a debt collector from a ttempt ing to or threaten ing to enforce a right or remedy with knowledge or reason to know that the right or remedy does not exist 
appellants complaint states that chase violated oregon revised statutes k by attempting to collect a debt when it knew or had reason to know that its right to do so did not exist.in support,the complaint alleges that chase failed to comply with the requirement under a that it provide a written explanation for a properly disputed debt.the complaint further alleges that chase was prohibited under the fcba from attempting to collect the disputed debt.it also alleges that chase was prohibited under from reporting the debt as delinquent to credit agencies.in short,appellants udcpa claim is predicated on chase violation of the fcba and the federal statute restrictions on chase right to attempt to collect the debt or report it as delinquent.
in isom portland general electric,the oregon court of appeals held that plaintiffs stated a valid claim to relief under k where a bill collector took actions related to their debts that were prohibited by separate federal and state statutes.see also porter hill,or,or citing isom as a correct application of k.the plaintiffs in isom alleged that portland general electric pge violated k because it insisted on full payment of utility bills instead of explaining the option of partial payment as required under oregon revised statutes,asserted a right to plaintiffs full cash payment which,under the low income energy assistance act et,they knew did not exist and terminated service despite full payment.at.the court held a jury could find pge attempted to or threatened to enforce the right to terminate service when it had reason to believe that the right to terminate was not available because plaintiffs qualified for legislatively mandated relief.id.at emphasis added.
under the analysis adopted in isom,appellants have stated a valid claim for relief under k.pursuant to the requirements imposed under the fcba,chase did not have the right to attempt to collect the disputed charge or to report it to credit agencies as delinquent without first providing a written explanation.see a,a koerner,at.by asserting rights through the actions of its collections agents when it had reason to know of the relevant restrictions imposed by the fcba,chase could be found to have violated oregon revised statutes k.because this result is controlled by isom,we conclude that certification of appellants proposed question to the oregon supreme court is unwarranted,and deny the motion on this basis see.stating that the oregon supreme court may answer certified questions of law only when there is no controlling precedent in the decisions of the supreme court and the intermediate appellate courts of this state see also estrella brandt,cir an intermediate state appellate court decision is a datum for ascertaining state law which is not to be disregarded by a federal court unless it is convinced by other persuasive data that the highest court of the state would decide otherwise.quoting west.
the district court erred by suggesting that plaintiffs premise their oregon udcpa claim on the fact that there was no underlying debt,which allegations do not invoke the udcpa coverage.the district court is correct that k does not protect against efforts to collect a nonexistent debt.see porter,at the statute proceeds from the assumption that a debt does or might exist and prohibits the debt collector from using unfair practices to collect it.nothing in the statute evidences a legislative concern with the existence or amount of the underlying debt,as distinct from the use of abusive methods to pressure debtors to pay their debts.there is no allegation in the complaint,however,that suggests the disputed amount was not owed at all.to the contrary,the complaint includes a letter lyon sent to chase in which he asks it to confirm what we now know to be correct that the charge was added to his bill in order to correct a mistaken credit chase had previously applied.in determining whether a complaint states a plausible claim to relief,a court must accept the plaintiffs allegations as true and construe them in the light most favorable to plaintiffs.state inv.council ernst young llp,cir quoting gompper visx,cir.seen in the light most favorable to the appellants,the allegations in the complaint suggest that the was owed due to the mistaken credit,but that chase failed to provide the required clarification of the charge and was therefore prohibited from attempting to collect it or report it as delinquent.
because this conduct by chase violates the fcba whether or not the debt was owed,appellants claim does not violate the decision in porter.see at.the oregon supreme court held that k should be read to prohibit certain methods of collecting a debt,such as enforcing a right collateral to the debt in order to pressure the debtor to pay the debt.id.at.congress clear intent in adopting the fcba was to prevent a creditor from simply ignoring a billing dispute when attempting to collect a debt.see a stating that the purpose of the statute is to protect the consumer against inaccurate and unfair credit billing and credit card practices.the ultimate validity of a disputed charge does not relieve a creditor of the obligations and restrictions imposed under the fcba.accordingly,the statute restrictions fit within porter interpretation of k as prohibit ing certain methods of collecting a debt.at.we therefore reverse the district court dismissal of appellants udcpa claim and remand this claim for further proceedings.
actual damages resulting from violations of the fcba 
chase admits that it violated the fcba by failing to provide a written explanation in response to lyon billing dispute.see a.chase further admits that because no explanation was provided,it also violated the fcba by attempting to collect the disputed charge and reporting it as delinquent to credit agencies.see a b,a.pursuant to a,a creditor who fails to comply with any requirement imposed under the fcba is liable for any actual damage sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the failure.the magistrate judge found that lyon loss of personal time in trying to resolve the disputed charge constitute d an item of special or actual damage.chase argues,however,that lyon can not recover actual damages because ninth circuit precedent requires evidence of detrimental reliance for any such recovery under a.we hold that evidence of detrimental reliance is not required to support an award of actual damages resulting from violations of or.
chase mistakenly suggests and the magistrate judge appears to have accepted that our holding in gold country lenders smith in re smith,cir per curiam,applies to lyon claims under the fcba.in re smith addressed whether a plaintiff could recover actual damages under a based on a creditor violations of the truth in lending act tila under a and for failing to conspicuously disclose and define the finance charge and annual percentage rate of a credit transaction.at.we held that a bankruptcy claimant could not recover actual damages because she failed to present evidence of her detrimental reliance on the inadequate financing terms presented to her at the time of the loan agreement.id.at.agreeing with the other circuits that have addressed the issue,we concluded that without evidence of detrimental reliance,the claimant could not satisfy the causation element necessary to support actual damages under a 
we join with other circuits and hold that in order to receive actual damages for a tila violation,an amount awarded to a complainant to compensate for a proven injury or loss,black law dictionary ed emphasis added,a borrower must establish detrimental reliance.without any evidence in the record to show that smith would either have secured a better interest rate elsewhere,or foregone the loan completely,her argument must fail she presents no proof of any detrimental reliance,any actual damage.

notably,in re smith as well as the decisions that it follows involves tila violations,not violations of the fcba.while the fcba is technically an addition to the tila,both statutes are part of the larger statutory scheme of the consumer credit protection act,although both statutes rely on to delineate civil liability,they differ in ways that affect the application of.accordingly,chase suggestion that all precedent related to the tila applies with equal force to the fcba is an oversimplification of the relevant statutes.because t he purpose of the tila is to promote the informed use of credit by consumers,anderson.ford valencia,d quoting,the tila requirements principally focus on disclosures that creditors must make when offering credit.see a it is the purpose of this subchapter to assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available to him and avoid the uninformed use of credit,and to protect the consumer against inaccurate and unfair credit billing and credit card practices.a enumerating r equired disclosures to be made by a creditor to a consumer before an open end consumer credit account can be opened,including disclosures related to billing disputes a enumerating required disclosures to be made by a creditor for other consumer credit transactions.the fcba,on the other hand,does not mandate disclosures to be made before credit is offered,rather it outlines procedures and limitations to be followed by creditors during a billing dispute involving an already opened consumer account.see.indeed,while a creditor must disclose some of its obligations under the fcba before opening an open end consumer credit account,these disclosure requirements are contained within the tila.see a,b.
whether detrimental reliance has anything to do with causation to support an award of actual damages resulting from violations of the fcba appears to be a question of first impression.we conclude that applying such a requirement to the fcba violations admitted here would distort the analysis of causation and thereby contradict the purpose of a.as noted,a b requires a creditor who is timely notified of a billing dispute to either make appropriate corrections in the account of the obligor or send a written explanation or clarification to the obligor.chase did neither and then undertook collection actions prohibited by the statute if it did not meet this obligation.see a b,a.there is simply no relevant disclosure or conduct under these circumstances that lyon could have relied upon.thus,lyon lack of detrimental reliance is immaterial to a determination of whether chase violations resulted in actual damages.if chase argument were to be followed in cases of defiant refusal to comply with a b,the bank has discovered that silence is truly golden.
to require evidence of detrimental reliance on an unmade explanation would necessarily bar recovery of actual damages because such evidence could never exist.consumers can not rely on unmade explanations,and creditors could simply avoid actual damages under the fcba by never responding to billing disputes the exact conduct the statute aims to prevent.such an irrational requirement would contradict the express language of a that a civil plaintiff can recover actual damages resulting from any violation of the fcba.see anderson united states,cir stating courts have an obligation to so construe federal statutes so that they are consistent with each other,quoting get oil out exxon,cir.accordingly,we hold that evidence of detrimental reliance is not required to support an award of actual damages resulting from violations of or.we reverse the magistrate judge order denying an award of actual damages resulting from chase fcba violations and remand this issue for further proceedings.
statutory damages for multiple violations of the fcba 
pursuant to a,a creditor who fails to comply with any requirement imposed under the tila,the fcba,or the consumer leasing act is liable for an award of statutory damages.i n the case of an individual action,the amount of the statutory penalty is twice the amount of any finance charge in connection with the transaction.a a i.
under g,however,congress expressly limited a plaintiff recovery for multiple violations of these statutes where the violations involved multiple failures to disclose.this subsection states
