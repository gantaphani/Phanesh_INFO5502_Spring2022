the issue we decide is whether the superior court may assess attorney fees against an employer who unsuccessfully appeals an administrative order to pay wages if the employee can not afford counsel and is represented without charge by the labor commissioner.the court of appeal held that attorney fees could not be awarded in such circumstances,because an indigent employee who is represented by the labor commissioner has not incurred attorney fees within the meaning of labor code section,subdivision c we disagree and reverse the judgment of the court of appeal.
in april,chris lolley filed a claim before the labor commissioner against his former employer shawn campbell,doing business as builders supply,to recover unpaid overtime wages and penalties.following an administrative hearing,at which lolley represented himself and campbell appeared through counsel,the hearing officer awarded lolley a total of in unpaid overtime wages,penalties,and interest.
campbell filed a notice of appeal requesting that the cause be set for a hearing de novo in the superior court.at lolley request,the labor commissioner determined that lolley could not afford counsel and agreed to represent him at the hearing de novo.as part of the agreement for representation,lolley assigned to the labor commissioner any attorney fees recovered in the pending hearing.
the hearing de novo was held in january.the superior court determined that campbell had violated state wage and hour laws and awarded lolley a total of plus costs.
in may,lolley filed a memorandum of costs requesting in attorney fees.campbell filed a motion to strike or tax costs on the ground,among others,that lolley was not entitled to attorney fees because he had been represented by the labor commissioner.the superior court granted the motion to strike,concluding that lolley had not incurred attorney fees within the meaning of the statute.
the court of appeal affirmed,concluding that because lolley was not obligated to pay attorney fees to the labor commissioner he was not entitled to recover them.we granted review.

the parties may seek review of the commissioner decision by filing an appeal to the superior court where the appeal shall be heard de novo,subd.a.a hearing de novo under section literally means a new hearing,that is,a new trial.citation.the decision of the commissioner is entitled to no weight whatsoever,and the proceedings are truly a trial anew in the fullest sense.citation.post associates cal th,d.
if the employee is unable to afford counsel,the employee may ask the labor commissioner to represent him or her at the hearing de novo.section provides that the labor commissioner may represent an employee who is financially unable to afford counsel,and shall represent such an employee if the employee is attempting to uphold the amount awarded by the labor commissioner and is not objecting to any part of the labor commissioner final order.ibid.
section,subdivision c,provides if the party seeking review by filing an appeal to the superior court is unsuccessful in the appeal,the court shall determine the costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred by the other parties to the appeal,and assess that amount as a cost upon the party filing the appeal.
noting that section,subdivision c requires an unsuccessful appellant to pay the costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred by the other parties to the appeal,the court of appeal concluded that an indigent employee who is represented by the labor commissioner may not collect attorney fees under this provision because such an employee has not incurred them within the meaning of the statute.
we begin by examining the statutory language,but our inquiry does not end there.our purpose in construing a statute is to determine the intent of the legislature.accordingly,we must determine the meaning of the phrase reasonable attorney fees incurred by the other parties to the appeal as it appears in section,subdivision c,giving due consideration to its statutory context.see hodges superior court cal th,d.
the court of appeal observed that the dictionary definition of incur is to become liable or subject to webster new internat.dict.and concluded that lolley had not incurred fees because he was not obligated to pay attorney fees to the labor commissioner.in practice,it has been generally agreed that a party may incur attorney fees even if the party is not personally obligated to pay such fees.a party entitlement to fees is not affected by the fact that the attorneys for whom fees are being claimed were funded by governmental or charitable sources or agreed to represent the party without charge.cal.attorney fee awards ed.the principle was explained by the federal circuit court in ed wilson,general services admin,it is that an award of attorney fees is not necessarily contingent upon an obligation to pay counsel.generally,awards of attorneys fees where otherwise authorized are not obviated by the fact that individual plaintiffs are not obligated to compensate their counsel.more specifically,courts have awarded attorney fees under statutes that apply when fees are incurred when the party seeking fees was represented by a legal services organization or counsel appearing pro bono publico attorney fees are incurred by a litigant if they are incurred in his behalf,even though he does not pay them.ibid.
