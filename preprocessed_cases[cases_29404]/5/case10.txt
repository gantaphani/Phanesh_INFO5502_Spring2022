respondent ratliff was ruby kills ree attorney in ree successful suit against the united states social security administration for social security benefits.the district court granted ree unopposed motion for attorney fees under the equal access to justice act eaja,which provides,inter alia,that a court shall award to a prevailing party fees and other expenses in any civil action brought by or against the united states.d a.before paying the fees award,the government discovered that ree owed the united states a debt that predated the award.accordingly,it sought an administrative offset against the award under,which subjects to offset all funds payable by the united states,a,to an individual who owes certain delinquent federal debts,see b,unless,payment is exempted by statute or regulation.see,e.the parties to this case have not established that any such exemption applies to d fees awards,which,as of,are covered by the treasury department offset program top.after the government notified ree that it would apply top to offset her fees award against a portion of her debt,ratliff intervened,challenging the offset on the grounds that d fees belong to a litigant attorney and thus may not be used to satisfy the litigant federal debts.the district court held that because d directs that fees be awarded to the prevailing party,not to her attorney,ratliff lacked standing to challenge the offset.the eighth circuit reversed,holding that under its precedent,eaja attorney fees are awarded to prevailing parties attorneys.
held a d a attorney fees award is payable to the litigant and is therefore subject to an offset to satisfy the litigant debt to the government.
a nothing in eaja contradicts this court longstanding view that the term prevailing party in attorney fees statutes is a term of art that refers to the prevailing litigant.see,buckhannon board care home,west virginia of health and human resources.that the term has its usual meaning in subsection d a is underscored by the fact that subsection d b and other provisions clearly distinguish the party who receives the fees award the litigant from the attorney who performed the work that generated the fees.the court disagrees with ratliff assertion that subsection d a use of the verb award nonetheless renders d fees payable directly to a prevailing party attorney.the dictionaries show that,in the litigation context,the transitive verb award has the settled meaning of giving or assigning by judicial decree.its plain meaning in subsection d a is thus that the court shall give or assign by judicial determination to the prevailing party here,ree attorney fees in the amount sought and substantiated under,inter alia,subsection d b.that the prevailing party attorney may have a beneficial interest or a contractual right in the fees does not alter this conclusion.
b the court rejects ratliff argument that other eaja provisions,combined with the social security act ssa and the government practice of paying some eaja fees awards directly to attorneys in social security cases,render d at least ambiguous on the question presented here,and that these other provisions resolve the ambiguity in her favor.even accepting that d is ambiguous the provisions and practices ratliff identifies do not alter the court conclusion.subsection d b and other provisions differentiate between attorneys and prevailing parties,and treat attorneys on par with other service providers,in a manner that forecloses the conclusion that attorneys have a right to direct payment of subsection d a awards.nor is the necessity of such payments established by the ssa provisions on which ratliff relies.that ssa fees awards are payable directly to a prevailing claimant attorney,see b a,undermines ratliff case by showing that congress knows how to create a direct fee requirement where it desires to do so.given the stark contrast between the language of the ssa and eaja provisions,the court is reluctant to interpret subsection d a to contain a direct fee requirement absent clear textual evidence that such a requirement applies.such evidence is not supplied by a eaja amendment requiring that,where the claimant attorney receives fees for the same work under both b and d,the attorney must refun d to the claimant the amount of the smaller fee.see note following.ratliff argument that this recognition that an attorney will sometimes receiv e d fees suggests that subsection d a should be construed to incorporate the same direct payments to attorneys that the ssa expressly authorizes gives more weight to recei pt than the term can bear the ensuing reference to the attorney obligation to refund the smaller fee to the claimant demonstrates that the award belongs to the claimant in the first place.moreover,ratliff reading is irreconcilable with the textual differences between the two acts.the fact that the government,until,frequently paid eaja fees awards directly to attorneys in ssa cases in which the prevailing party had assigned the attorney her rights in the award does not alter the court interpretation of the act fees provision.that some such cases involved a prevailing party with outstanding federal debts is unsurprising,given that it was not until that the top was modified to require offsets against attorney fees awards.and as ratliff admits,the government has since discontinued the direct payment practice except in cases where the plaintiff does not owe a federal debt and has assigned her right to fees to the attorney.finally,the court conclusion is buttressed by cases interpreting and applying,which contains language virtually identical to d a.see,evans jeff,and.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit 
justice thomas delivered the opinion of the court.
section d of the equal access to justice act eaja,codified in d,provides in pertinent part that a court shall award to a prevailing party fees and other expenses in any civil action brought by or against the united states unless the court finds that the position of the united states was substantially justified.we consider whether an award of fees and other expenses to a prevailing party under d is payable to the litigant or to his attorney.we hold that a d fees award is payable to the litigant and is therefore subject to a government offset to satisfy a debt that the litigant owes the united states.
this case arises out of proceedings in which a social security claimant,ruby willows kills ree,prevailed on a claim for benefits against the united states.respondent catherine ratliff was ree attorney in those proceedings.the district court granted ree unopposed motion for a d fees award in the amount of.before the united states paid the fees award,however,it discovered that ree owed the government a debt that predated the district court approval of the award.accordingly,the united states sought an administrative offset against the fees award to satisfy part of that debt.
the government authority to use administrative offsets is statutory.see a,a authorizing an agency whose debt collection attempts are unsuccessful to collect the claim by administrative offset congress has subjected to offset all funds payable by the united states,a,to an individual who owes certain delinquent federal debts,see b,unless,as relevant here,payment is exempted by statute,see e.no such exemption applies to attorney fees awards under d a hereinafter subsection d a,which are otherwise subject to offset,see cfr e,and which,as of january,are covered by the treasury offset program top operated by the treasury department financial management service fms.see brief for petitioner explaining top extension to cover miscellaneous payments that include attorney fees payments the treasury department makes on behalf of federal agencies 
in this case,the government,relying on the top,notified ree that the government would apply her d fees award to offset a portion of her outstanding federal debt.ratliff intervened to challenge the offset on the grounds that d fees belong to a litigant attorney and thus may not be used to offset or otherwise satisfy a litigant federal debts.the district court held that because d directs that fees be awarded to the prevailing party,not to her attorney,ratliff lacked standing to challenge the government proposed offset.see no.civ,wl,d sd,may.
the court of appeals for the eighth circuit reversed.it held that under circuit precedent,eaja attorneys fees are awarded to prevailing parties attorneys.at.the court of appeals recognized that its decision did not accord with a literal interpretation of the eaja,and exacerbated a split among the courts of appeals,compare,at,with,reeves astrue,manning astrue,fdl technologies,united states,ca fed.panola land buying clark,we granted certiorari.
subsection d a directs that courts shall award to a prevailing party fees and other expenses incurred by that party.emphasis added.we have long held that the term prevailing party in fee statutes is a term of art that refers to the prevailing litigant.see,buckhannon board care home,west virginia of health and human resources.this treatment reflects the fact that statutes that award attorney fees to a prevailing party are exceptions to the american rule that each litigant bear his own attorney fees.at citing key tronic united states.nothing in eaja supports a different reading.arthur andersen llp carlisle,slip,at,where congress employs identical words and phrases within the same statute,they are presumed to carry the same meaning internal quotation marks omitted.indeed,other subsections within d underscore that the term prevailing party in subsection d a carries its usual and settled meaning prevailing litigant.those other subsections clearly distinguish the party who receives the fees award the litigant from the attorney who performed the work that generated the fees.see,d b hereinafter subsection d b the prevailing party must apply for the fees award and sho w that he is a prevailing party and is eligible to receive an award by,among other things,submitting an itemized statement from any attorney representing or appearing in behalf of the party that details the attorney hourly rate and time spent on the case emphasis added see also part iii,infra.
ratliff nonetheless asserts that subsection d a use of the verb award renders d fees payable directly to a prevailing party attorney and thus protects the fees from a government offset against the prevailing party federal debts.see brief for respondent arguing that subsection d a use of the word award expressly incorporates a critical distinction between the right to an award of fees and the right to receiv e the fees.we disagree.
the transitive verb award has a settled meaning in the litigation context it means t o give or assign by sentence or judicial determination.black law dictionary ed.emphasis added see also webster third new international dictionary to give by judicial decree emphasis added.the plain meaning of the word award in subsection d a is thus that the court shall give or assign by judicial determination to the prevailing party here,ratliff client ree attorney fees in the amount sought and substantiated under,inter alia,subsection d b.
ratliff contrary argument does not withstand scrutiny.according to ratliff,subsection d b,which uses the noun award to mean a decision,requires us to construe subsection d a which uses award as a verb to mean that o nly the prevailing party may receive the award the decision granting fees,but only the attorney who earned the fee the payment asked or given for professional services is entitled to receive it.brief for respondent,emphasis in original some internal quotation marks and footnote omitted.this argument ignores the settled definitions above,and even the definitions ratliff proffers,because each makes clear that the verb award in subsection d a means to give by the decision of a law court or to grant by judicial decree,not simply to give a decision itself,at,and emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.we thus agree with the government that under the statutory language here,the judicial decision is the means by which the court confers a right to payment upon the prevailing party it is not itself the thing that the court gives or orders the defendant to give to the party.reply brief for petitioner emphasis in original citing hewitt helms,explaining that i n all civil litigation,the judicial decree is not the end but the means this settled and natural construction of the operative statutory language is reflected in our cases.see,scarborough principi,eaja authorizes the payment of fees to a prevailing party emphasis added.
ratliff final textual argument that subsection d a reference to attorney fees itself establishes that the fees are payable to the prevailing party attorney,see brief for respondent proves far too much.the fact that the statute awards to the prevailing party fees in which her attorney may have a beneficial interest or a contractual right does not establish that the statute awards the fees directly to the attorney.for the reasons we have explained,the statute plain text does the opposite it awards the fees to the litigant,and thus subjects them to a federal administrative offset if the litigant has outstanding federal debts.
in an effort to avoid the act plain meaning,ratliff argues that other provisions of eaja,combined with the ssa and the government practice of paying some eaja fees awards directly to attorneys in social security cases,render d at least ambiguous on the question presented here,and that these other provisions resolve the ambiguity in her favor.again we disagree.even accepting d as ambiguous on the question presented,the provisions and practices ratliff identifies do not alter our conclusion that eaja fees are payable to litigants and are thus subject to offset where a litigant has outstanding federal debts.
to begin with,d provisions differentiate between attorneys and prevailing parties,and treat attorneys on par with other service providers,in a manner that forecloses the conclusion that attorneys have a right to direct payment of subsection d a awards.as noted above,subsection d b requires the prevailing party to submit a fee application showing that she is otherwise eligible to receive an award and,as a complement to that requirement,compels the prevailing party to submit an itemized statement from any attorney representing or appearing in behalf of the party that details the attorney hourly rate and time the attorney spent on the case.emphasis added.this language would make little sense if,as ratliff contends,d prevailing party language effectively refers to the prevailing litigant attorney.subsection d b similarly makes clear that the prevailing party not her attorney is the recipient of the fees award by requiring the prevailing party to demonstrate that her net worth falls within the range the statute requires for fees awards.and eaja cost provision further underscores the point.that provision uses language identical to that in the attorney fees provision to allow prevailing parties to recover the reasonable expenses of expert witnesses and any study,analysis,engineering report,test,or project necessary to prepare the party case,d a,yet ratliff does not argue that it makes costs payable directly to the vendors who provide the relevant services.
nor do the ssa provisions on which ratliff relies establish that subsection d a fees awards are payable to prevailing parties attorneys.it is true that the ssa makes fees awards under that statute payable directly to a prevailing claimant attorney.see b a providing that where a claimant who was represented before the court by an attorney obtains a favorable judgment,the court may determine and allow as part of its judgment a reasonable fee for such representation,not in excess of percent of the benefits award and may certify the full amount of the statutory fees award for payment to such attorney out of,and not in addition to,the amount of the claimant benefits award emphasis added.but the ssa express authorization of such payments undermines ratliff case insofar as it shows that congress knows how to make fees awards payable directly to attorneys where it desires to do so.given the stark contrast between the ssa express authorization of direct payments to attorneys and the absence of such language in subsection d a,we are reluctant to interpret the latter provision to contain a direct fee requirement absent clear textual evidence supporting such an interpretation.
ratliff contends that congress amendments to b of eaja supply just such evidence,at least in social security cases.see,stat,note following.the amendments address the fact that social security claimants may be eligible to receive fees awards under both the ssa and eaja,and clarify the procedure that attorneys and their clients must follow to prevent the windfall of an unauthorized double recovery of fees for the same work.section b provides that no violation of law occurs if,where the claimant attorney receives fees for the same work under both b and d,the claimant attorney refunds to the claimant the amount of the smaller fee.according to ratliff,the fact that b recognizes,or at least assumes,that an attorney will sometimes receiv e fees under d suggests that we should construe subsection d a to incorporate the same direct payments to attorneys that the ssa expressly authorizes.
this argument gives more weight to b reference to attorney recei pt of fees than the reference can bear.section b ensuing reference to the attorney obligation to refun d the amount of the smaller fee to the claimant,which reference suggests that the award belongs to the claimant in the first place,alone undercuts ratliff reading of receives as implying an initial statutory payment to the attorney and ratliff reading is in any event irreconcilable with the textual differences between eaja and the ssa we discuss above.thus,even accepting ratliff argument that subsection d a is ambiguous,the statutory provisions she cites resolve any ambiguity in favor of treating subsection d a awards as payable to the prevailing litigant,and thus subject to offset where the litigant has relevant federal debts.
the government history of paying eaja awards directly to attorneys in certain cases does not compel a different conclusion.the government concedes that until,it frequently paid eaja fees in social security cases directly to attorneys.reply brief for petitioner.but this fact does not alter our interpretation of subsection d a prevailing party language or the government rights and obligations under the statute.as the government explains,it most often paid eaja fees directly to attorneys in cases in which the prevailing party had assigned its rights in the fees award to the attorney which assignment would not be necessary if the statute rendered the fees award payable to the attorney in the first instance.the fact that some such cases involved a prevailing party with outstanding federal debts is unsurprising given that it was not until that the treasury department modified the top to require offsets against miscellaneous payments such as attorney fees awards.and as ratliff admits,the government has since continued the direct payment practice only in cases where the plaintiff does not owe a debt to the government and assigns the right to receive the fees to the attorney.brief for respondent boldface deleted.the government decision to continue direct payments only in such cases is easily explained by the amendments to the top,and nothing about the government past payment practices altered the statutory text that governs this case or estopped the government from conforming its payment practices to the treasury department revised regulations.for all of these reasons,neither eaja nor the ssa supports ratliff reading of subsection d a.
our cases interpreting and applying,which contains language virtually identical to the eaja provision we address here buttress this conclusion.our most recent cases applying b prevailing party language recognize the practical reality that attorneys are the beneficiaries and,almost always,the ultimate recipients of the fees that the statute awards to prevailing part ies.see,venegas mitchell.but these cases emphasize the nonstatutory contractual and other rights that typically confer upon the attorney the entitlement to payment of the fees award the statute confers on the prevailing litigant.as noted above,these kinds of arrangements would be unnecessary if,as ratliff contends,statutory fees language like that in b and eaja provides attorneys with a statutory right to direct payment of awards.hence our conclusion that the party,rather than the lawyer,at,is entitle d to receive the fees under b,at,and that the statute controls what the losing defendant must pay,not what the prevailing plaintiff must pay his lawyer,at see also evans jeff,and explaining that the language of bestow s on the prevailing party generally plaintiffs a statutory eligibility for a discretionary award of attorney fees and does not besto w fee awards upon attorneys themselves footnote omitted.these conclusions apply with equal force to the functionally identical statutory language here.
we reverse the court of appeals judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

justice sotomayor,with whom justice stevens and justice ginsburg join,concurring.
i join the court opinion because i agree that the text of the equal access to justice act eaja and our precedents compel the conclusion that an attorney fee award under d is payable to the prevailing litigant rather than the attorney.the eaja does not legally obligate the government to pay a prevailing litigant attorney,and the litigant obligation to pay her attorney is controlled not by the eaja but by contract and the law governing that contract.that conclusion,however,does not answer the question whether congress intended the government to deduct moneys from eaja fee awards to offset a litigant and unrelated debt,as the treasury department began to do only in pursuant to its authority under the debt collection improvement act of dcia.in my view,it is likely both that congress did not consider that question and that,had it done so,it would not have wanted eaja fee awards to be subject to offset.because such offsets undercut the effectiveness of the eaja and can not be justified by reference to the dcia text or purpose,it seems probable that congress would have made,and perhaps will in the future make,the opposite choice if clearly presented with it.
in enacting the eaja,congress found that certain individuals,partnerships,corporations,and labor and other organizations may be deterred from seeking review of,or defending against,unreasonable governmental action because of the expense involved in securing the vindication of their rights in civil actions and in administrative proceedings.a,stat,note following,congressional findings.as we have often recognized,the specific purpose of the eaja is to eliminate for the average person the financial disincentive to challenge unreasonable governmental actions.commissioner jean,see also scarborough principi,by expressly authoriz ing attorney fee awards against the federal government,congress sought to eliminate the barriers that prohibit small businesses and individuals from securing vindication of their rights in civil actions and administrative proceedings brought by or against the federal government quoting,sullivan hudson,the eaja was designed to address the problem that f or many citizens,the costs of securing vindication of their rights and the inability to recover attorney fees preclude resort to the adjudicatory process quoting.eaja fee awards,which average only to per case,have proved to be a remarkably efficient way of improving access to the courts for the statute intended beneficiaries,including thousands of recipients of social security and veteran benefits each year brief for respondent see also jean,at,nn.
