dillingham construction,appeals from a postjudgment order awarding fees and costs to willie greene in this california fair employment and housing act,et hereafter feha action.it contends that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to apportion the fee award between greene successful claim and those claims on which he did not prevail,and awarding fees for the period following greene rejection of dillingham settlement offer.in a,greene argues that the trial court erred in denying his request for a multiplier.we affirm the award of fees but remand the matter to the trial court to reconsider greene request for a multiplier.
factual background 
this court previously decided the underlying action in this case.greene dillingham construction,nonpub.opn.
in that action,a jury,by special verdict,found in favor of greene on his claim that he was subjected to racial harassment in violation of feha.the jury awarded greene in emotional distress damages.it rejected greene retaliation and punitive damages claims.we affirmed the trial court judgment on appeal.
in june,greene moved for an award of attorney fees pursuant to government code section,subdivision b.dillingham did not contest greene entitlement to fees but argued that his request should be reduced by percent because that amount related to fees incurred in prosecuting greene unsuccessful claims.it also argued that greene request should be reduced by the amount of fees and expenses incurred after greene rejected a settlement offer made in conjunction with a mediation.the trial court concluded that greene claimed hours were reasonable especially given the adjustments the plaintiff has made in the exercise of billing judgment and to account for the lack of success on the retaliation claim and the issue of punitive damages.it rejected dillingham argument that the fee award should be reduced by fees incurred after dillingham settlement offer to greene,adopting greene argument that the offer was not a statutory code of civil procedure section offer and that it was improper for the court to rely on an informal settlement offer to determine whether a fee award was appropriate.the court thus ordered fees in the amount of,representing for work on the merits and in fees for fees.the court denied greene request for a multiplier.
ii.discussion 
dillingham.amount of fee reduction for unsuccessful claims 
the feha provides that the court,in its discretion,may award to the prevailing party reasonable attorney fees and costs,subd.b.in determining the fee award,the trial court must first determine a lodestar or touchstone figure,which is the product of the number of hours worked by the attorneys and a reasonable fee per hour.downey cares downey community development com.d.serrano priest cal d,hereafter serrano iii.the trial court then has the discretion to increase or reduce the lodestar figure by applying a positive or negative multiplier based on a variety of factors.press lucky stores,cal d,serrano iii,supra,cal d at.we review the trial court decision on attorney fees under an abuse of discretion standard.steele jensen instrument th,d.
dillingham first contends that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to consider any apportionment of attorney fees between greene claim for harassment and his claims for discrimination,retaliation and punitive damages.it argues that greene fee claim ignored the fact that he pursued a separate claim of intentional race discrimination up until the time of trial.
the record refutes dillingham argument.in submitting his fee request,greene attorneys first adjusted their billing hours in the exercise of billing judgment,reducing the cost of their actual time billed by a total of.greene also adjusted the claimed hours billed to account for the lack of success on his claims for retaliation and punitive damages,eliminating all time entries specifically addressed to either issue.further,greene reduced the lodestar by an additional percent to reflect time that might not have been spent had he not pursued claims for retaliation and punitive damages.the trial court found the claimed hours were reasonable and that dillingham arguments for an additional apportionment of fees were without merit.we find no error.
although it is appropriate to reduce a fee award when a plaintiff prevails on only one of his causes of action see sokolow county of san mateo d,the trial court order here did consider the results obtained in arriving at its fee award.accordingly,the court awarded fees not for the actual hours billed,but for a reduced number of hours,including reductions for time spent on claims on which greene did not prevail.the total adjustment to billed hours was greater than percent.
the court also agreed with greene contention that the harassment and discrimination claims were so intertwined that a further allocation of fees between successful and unsuccessful claims was not possible because the claims were based on the same set of facts and course of conduct.the trial court was in the best position to understand the relationship between the claims and to determine whether time spent on a related claim contributed to greene objectives at trial.see downey cares downey community development,supra,d at.where a lawsuit consists of related claims,and the plaintiff has won substantial relief,a trial court has discretion to award all or substantially all of the plaintiff fees even if the court did not adopt each contention raised.ibid.this rule is particularly apt here where greene claims of harassment and retaliation were based on the common core of facts that the presence of hangman nooses in the workplace,including one with an effigy,created a hostile work environment.as greene points out,his complaint alleged a single cause of action for race discrimination and harassment.that he prevailed on only one theory under that claim is not dispositive attorneys generally must pursue all available legal avenues and theories in pursuit of their clients objectives it is impossible,as a practical matter,for an attorney to know in advance whether or not his or her work on a potentially meritorious legal theory will ultimately prevail.sokolow county of san mateo,supra,d at.in light of the strong interrelationship between greene claims,the court did not err in not further reducing its award of fees 
postsettlement offer fees 
dillingham contends that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding attorney fees for the period of time after greene rejected a settlement offer.it argues that the public policy of encouraging settlements as set forth in code of civil procedure section section supports an order denying an award of fees for attorney time expended after greene rejected its settlement offer.
dillingham relies on meister regents of university of california th,d in which the court held that a trial court could reduce the lodestar figure by the amount of fees incurred by the plaintiff after he declined an informal settlement offer.the court rejected the plaintiff argument that the trial court use of the informal offer undermined the public policy underlying section,reasoning,the inapplicability of section did not prevent the trial court from allowing the underlying policy concerns addressed by that section to guide its exercise of its discretion in this case.the basic premise of section is that plaintiffs who reject reasonable settlement offers and then obtain less than the offer should be penalized for continuing the litigation.meister,at,d.the court concluded that irrespective of section,a trial court retained discretion to consider a party rejection of a nonstatutory settlement offer because it was based on the court assessment of whether the hours which plaintiff attorneys claimed to have expended on the litigation were reasonably spent.meister,at,d.the court thus held that the trial court reduction of the plaintiff request of fees from to,the latter amount reflecting fees incurred prior to the informal settlement offer,was justified since the plaintiff recovery at trial of was less than the offer of.id.at,d.
we respectfully disagree with the court reasoning in meister.section is a
