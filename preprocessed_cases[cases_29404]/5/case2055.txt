appellant sylmar air conditioning sylmar appeals from an order awarding attorney fees and costs against it after the trial court granted a special motion to strike pursuant to code of civil procedure section,a slapp motion the slapp motion addressed the third cause of action in a filed by sylmar against respondent pueblo contracting services pueblo.prior to the hearing on the slapp motion,pursuant to authority granted by section,sylmar filed a first amended.it contends that by filing the first amended,the slapp motion was rendered moot and the trial court erred in addressing the merits of the motion and awarding attorney fees and costs.it also contends that its pleading was not a pleading falling within the scope of the statute.we conclude the trial court did not err.
it is the public policy of the state that complaints arising from the exercise of free speech rights be evaluated at an early stage.this can not be defeated by filing an amendment even as a matter of right pursuant to section.with regard to the merits of the motion,the third cause of action asserted fraud based upon communications between attorneys for pueblo and sylmar and between employees of pueblo and sylmar concerning pending litigation involving work performed by sylmar pursuant to a subcontract issued by pueblo.as such,the communications qualified for treatment under the litigation privilege of civil code section,subdivision b.sylmar failed to present evidence to demonstrate a probability of overcoming application of the privilege.
background 
on august,the boys and girls club filed an action against pueblo and others,alleging breach of contract and negligence in connection with the renovation and expansion of the plaintiff facilities.pueblo against and various subcontractors,including sylmar,seeking from the subcontractors indemnity and contribution,alleging breach of contract and negligence.sylmar,in turn,filed a against pueblo,alleging breach of contract,fraud,and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.it is this latter which was the subject of the special motion to strike which was granted,giving rise to this appeal.
the slapp motion was addressed to the third cause of action of sylmar,a judicial council form pleading,which identifies the third cause of action as one for fraud and contains allegations of intentional misrepresentation,negligent misrepresentation and concealment.the gist of the claim for fraud which was addressed by the parties in connection with the slapp motion is contained in the following allegations 
pueblo attorney,christopher morrow,stated that the ow ner had chargebacked pueblo for defective or incomplete work of sylmar.morrow and dorene schiavone,manager for pueblo,also stated that the owner had withheld funds for the defective or incomplete work of sylmar.
the owner had not backcharged pueblo for defective or incomplete work of sylmar and had not withheld funds for the defective work or incomplete work of sylmar.
when defendant made the representations,defendant knew they were false.
pueblo filed its slapp motion to strike the third cause of action at the same time it filed demurrers to sylmar,including the third cause of action.the matters were scheduled for hearing on the same day.
three days before the slapp motion and demurrers were to be heard,sylmar filed a first amended complaint.the third cause of action still alleged fraud,but it was pleaded in greater detail.
on september,the trial court granted the slapp motion and issued a written decision setting forth its reasoning.the court struck the third cause of action and awarded attorney fees and costs to pueblo.it also found the demurrers moot.
on october,pueblo filed a new slapp motion,directed at the third cause of action of the first amended complaint.at a status conference on november,sylmar voluntarily withdrew the third cause of action in the amended complaint and the new slapp motion was taken off calendar.sylmar then filed a timely notice of appeal from the order granting the first slapp motion.
discussion 
sylmar right to amend 
as pertinent,section,subdivision b,provides a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.subdivision c of the same section provides that a prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike shall be entitled to recover his or her attorney fees and costs.
sylmar contends that the trial court erred in hearing the slapp motion because it filed a first amended complaint pursuant to section prior to the hearing on the motion.sylmar draws its reasoning from the language of that section,which provides any pleading may be amended once by the party of course,and without costs,at any time before the answer or demurrer is filed,or after demurrer and before the trial of the issue of law thereon.italics added.referencing the italicized language,sylmar contends that an award of attorney fees and costs to a successful moving party under section is in direct conflict with section that an amendment of right is to be allowed without costs.
we discern no conflict between the two sections.sylmar received the benefit of section when it was permitted to file the first amended complaint.the filing of the first amended complaint rendered pueblo demurrer moot since an amendatory pleading supersedes the original one,which ceases to perform any function as a pleading.citations.citation.foreman clark fallon cal d.the trial court agreed that the demurrer was moot and took it off calendar.and no costs were assessed against sylmar in connection with the filing of the first amended complaint.the attorney fees and costs were awarded based upon filing of the original complaint.
it is settled that a plaintiff may not avoid liability for attorney fees and costs by voluntarily dismissing a cause of action to which a slapp motion is directed.pfeiffer venice properties bernard th,d kyle carmon th,d liu moore th,d coltrain shewalter th,d.nor is the issue of attorney fees and costs rendered moot even by an involuntary dismissal after a demurrer is sustained without leave to amend.white lieberman th,d.sylmar contends that an amendment of the complaint is qualitatively different than dismissal of the complaint and therefore it should not be treated similarly.we disagree.
simmons allstate ins.th,d simmons,establishes there is no express or implied right in section to amend a pleading to avoid a slapp motion.sylmar contends that simmons,which deals with an amendment for which leave of court was required,is distinguishable from this case where it filed its amendment as a matter of right,pursuant to section.given the public policy behind section,we perceive no distinction in substance.
simmons addresses the potential mischief a plaintiff could cause by using an amendment to defeat the legislative purpose of section 
in enacting the statute,the legislature set up a mechanism through which complaints that arise from the exercise of free speech rights can be evaluated at an early stage of the litigation process and resolved expeditiously.citation.section is just one of several california statutes that provide a procedure for exposing and dismissing certain causes of action lacking merit.citation.
allowing a slapp plaintiff leave to amend the complaint once the court finds the prima facie showing has been met would completely undermine the statute by providing the pleader a ready escape from section quick dismissal remedy.instead of having to show a probability of success on the merits,the slapp plaintiff would be able to go back to the drawing board with a second opportunity to disguise the vexatious nature of the suit through more artful pleading.this would trigger a second round of pleadings,a fresh motion to strike,and inevitably another request for leave to amend.
by the time the moving party would be able to dig out of this proce
