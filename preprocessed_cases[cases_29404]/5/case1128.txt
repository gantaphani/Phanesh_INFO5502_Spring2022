this appeal concerns the appropriate standards and procedures for awarding attorney fees in connection with chapter bankruptcy petitions.the bankruptcy court for the northern district of california has established three means by which a debtor attorney may obtain a fee award in a chapter case.the attorney may submit a fee application under guidelines that establish presumptive fees for a basic case and specified variations thereon,submit a detailed fee application based on the hours actually spent on the case,or first submit a application and later submit a detailed application seeking additional fees based on the hours actually spent.
in this case,appellant law offices of david boone boone initially submitted a fee application under the guidelines.boone later submitted a second fee application in which he sought additional fees based on the hours actually spent.in ruling on the second application,the bankruptcy court allowed a fee for a basic case based on the guidelines and some additional fees according to the hours actually spent,but it refused to allow the full amount of fees requested.the bap affirmed.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand.
factual background 
on january,filiae and judy eliapo the eliapos hired boone to assist them in filing for bankruptcy.on january,boone filed a chapter petition on their behalf.a plan was first filed on february.the plan was amended and on april.the plan was amended a second time and on april.
on may,boone signed a application for attorney fees under the bankruptcy court guidelines,reproduced infra,in the amount of.this figure included for the basic case,because the case involve d real property claims,and because the case involve d vehicle loans or leases.the bankruptcy court approved the eliapos second amended plan on june and approved boone fee application on the same day.
on february,boone filed a second fee application requesting an additional.this application included time sheets describing the tasks performed and hours spent by boone.boone had already been provided compensation,pursuant to his application,for some of the work described in the time sheets.boone did not place under separate headings the work he had performed on the basic case,or the work involving vehicle loans or leases or real property claims.most,perhaps all,of the work for which boone sought additional compensation was performed after the date on which the fees were awarded.the bankruptcy court initially scheduled a hearing on the second application,but took the matter under submission when no objection to the application was filed.
the bankruptcy court ruled on boone second fee application on august,without a hearing.the court divided the tasks performed by boone into two categories.the first category was compensation for work involving normal preparation of the petition,schedules and statement of affairs and the moving of the case to confirmation.in re eliapo eliapo i,j rg,wl,at,august.the court concluded that boone was seeking for this work,based on hours of work.
the court wrote that,absent extraordinary circumstances,compensation for this work should not exceed the boone had already been paid for the basic case under the guidelines.the court held that there were no extraordinary circumstances,and it refused to award additional fees beyond the already awarded.
pursuant to his application,boone had been awarded for work involving vehicle loans or leases.even though boone did not list work under that heading in his second application,it is apparent from the confirmed plan and the second fee application that boone had indeed done such work.the confirmed plan lists a secured claim by americredit with value of collateral of,for which a minimum of per month is to be paid.schedule b of the plan lists a dodge durango with a current market value of,and schedule d lists americredit as a secured creditor with a claim of.boone second fee application lists various tasks pertaining directly to this secured claim prepare letter to americredit for of an hour on receive and review correspondence from americredit regarding value of collateral telephone call to dawn at americredit regarding same on and telephone call to dawn regarding value of dodge durango left message on for of an hour,no charge.the application lists other tasks,such as prepare schedules and statement of financial affairs for hours,that obviously include work relating to the secured loan on the vehicle.however,in ruling on the second application,the bankruptcy court wrote,the vehicle loan is and encumbers a dodge durango.there is no suggestion of a problem in this area.eliapo i,at.the court added nothing to the basic case guideline fee to take into account boone work involving this vehicle loan.
the second category of tasks boone performed involved motions for relief from the automatic stay brought by the first and second mortgage holders.pursuant to his application,boone had been awarded an additional for work involving real property claims.the court concluded that boone was seeking for this work,based on hours of work related to these motions.the court wrote that this work appears suspect.however,given the debtors problems with their mortgage payments,the court declined to second guess the time spent on these motions.id.it therefore awarded the full for the work related to motions for relief from the automatic stay.
the court awarded a total attorney fee of based on the second application for the basic case,an additional for work on the stay motions,and an additional for preparation of the second application.the court did not award the guideline amount for work involving vehicle loans or leases.because boone had already been awarded based on his application,the net award based on his second application was.this amount was less than the net amount boone had requested in the second application.the bankruptcy appellate panel bap affirmed the decision of the bankruptcy court.law offices of david boone in re eliapo eliapo ii.boone now appeals to this court,listing numerous questions in his brief.the questions overlap to a considerable extent and may be reduced to four first,do the presumptive fee guidelines violate second,did the bankruptcy court criterion for awarding additional fees beyond the presumptive fees violate third,did the bankruptcy court abuse its discretion in ruling on boone second application without a hearing fourth,did the bankruptcy court abuse its discretion in refusing to give boone credit for having performed work involving vehicle loans or leases all but the fourth question were raised in boone appeal to the bap 
ii.standard of review 
we independently review the bankruptcy court rulings on appeal from the bap.see salazar mcdonald in re salazar,cir miller cardinale in re deville,cir.because we are in as good a position as the bap to review bankruptcy court rulings,we independently examine the bankruptcy court decision,reviewing the bankruptcy court interpretation of the bankruptcy code de novo and its factual findings for clear error.united states hatton in re hatton,cir see also am.law ctr.pc stanley in re jastrem,cir.we will not disturb a bankruptcy court award of attorney fees absent an abuse of discretion or an erroneous application of the law.in re nucorp energy,cir see also dawson.mutual bank in re dawson,cir.that is,we will not reverse an award of fees unless we have a definite and firm conviction that the bankruptcy court committed clear error in the conclusion it reached after weighing all of the relevant factors.
iii.discussion 
a bankruptcy court in a chapter case may allow reasonable compensation to the debtor attorney for representing the interests of the debtor in connection with the bankruptcy case based on a consideration of the benefit and necessity of such services to the debtor and the other factors set forth in this section.a b.the other factors are listed in a.at the date of boone fee application,that section provided 
in determining the amount of reasonable compensation to be awarded,the court shall consider the nature,the extent,and the value of such services,taking into account all relevant factors,including 
a the time spent on such services 
b the rates charged for such services 
c whether the services were necessary to the administration of,or beneficial at the time at which the service was rendered toward the completion of the case 
d whether the services were performed within a reasonable amount of time commensurate with the complexity,importance,and nature of the problem,issue,or task addressed and 
e whether the compensation is reasonable based on the customary compensation charged by comparably skilled practitioners in cases other than cases under this title.
a a e west the bankruptcy court has sua sponte authority to award compensation that is less than the amount of compensation that is requested.id.a.
local bankruptcy rule for the northern district of california allows the bankruptcy court to adopt guidelines for attorney fees.the local rule provides,in pertinent part,
the judges of the bankruptcy court or any division thereof may adopt,and as needed revise,guidelines concerning the allowance and disallowance of professional fees and expense reimbursement and the contents and format of applications therefor filed pursuant to a and and fed.a although referenced herein,such guidelines are not intended to be local rules,and shall not have the force and effect thereof.
cal.as authorized by local rule,bankruptcy judges for the northern district have adopted guidelines establishing presumptive fees for routine services in chapter cases.the guidelines in effect when boone represented the eliapos provided as follows 
fee applications.
counsel may receive an order approving fees up to the amounts set forth in paragraph without filing a detailed application if 
counsel has filed and served the chapter trustee with an executed copy of the rights and responsibilities of chapter debtors and their attorneys,copies of which are available in the clerk office and in the office of the chapter trustee 
counsel has accepted no more than as a retainer in the case,unless counsel thereafter applies for and receives court approval of a larger advance retainer and 
no objection to the requested fees has been raised.
the maximum fee which can be approved through the procedure described in paragraph is 
for the basic case and an additional 
if the case involves real property claims 
if the case involves state or federal tax claims 
if the case involves vehicle loans or leases 
if the case involves an operating business 
if the case involves support arrears claims and 
if the case involves student loans.
if an executed copy of the rights and responsibilities of chapter debtors and their attorneys is not filed,counsel has accepted more than without court approval,or there is an objection,an order will not be entered automatically pursuant to these guidelines.
if counsel elects to be paid other than pursuant to these guidelines,all fees including the retainer shall be approved by the court whether or not the fees are payable through the chapter trustee office and whether or not fees are paid for services in connection with the chapter case.
if counsel applies for fees,counsel shall comply with rules and of the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure as well as the guidelines for compensation and expense reimbursement of professionals adopted by the bankruptcy judges of the northern district of california.
on its own motion or the motion of any party in interest,the court may order a hearing to review any fee paid or unpaid.
the rights and responsibilities form,referred to in paragraph a a,supra,is signed by both the chapter debtor and his or her attorney.in pertinent part,that form provides,
if the initial fees ordered by the court are not sufficient to compensate the attorney for the legal services rendered in the case,the attorney further agrees to apply to the court for any additional fees 
if the debtor disputes the legal services provided or the fees charged by the attorney,an objection may be filed with the court and the matter set for hearing.
consistency of guidelines with 
boone argues that the bankruptcy court presumptive fee guidelines are inconsistent with.we disagree.
the customary method for assessing an attorney fee application in bankruptcy is the lodestar,under which the number of hours reasonably expended is multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate for the person providing the services.hensley eckerhart,d unsecured creditors comm.puget sound plywood,cir.however,the lodestar method is not mandatory.see unsecured creditors,at although in re manoa finance,cir,suggests that starting with the lodestar is customary,it does not mandate such an approach in all cases.in re busy beaver,cir while bankruptcy fees are commonly calculated using the lodestar method,by no means ossifies the lodestar approach as the point of departure in fee determinations.
we see nothing in that prevents a bankruptcy court from issuing and then relying on guidelines establishing presumptive fees for routine services in chapter cases.such presumptive fees,if set at an appropriate level,have a number of virtues.first,use of presumptive fees in a application saves attorney time that would otherwise be spent preparing detailed applications using the lodestar method.saving attorney time has the potential,perhaps even likely,consequence of lowering attorney fees.
second,use of presumptive fees encourages efficient use of attorney time by providing fair compensation to efficient practitioners and by preventing inefficient practitioners from passing on the cost of their inefficiency.as stated by judge lundin,
three or four hours of attorney time and a like number of hours of paralegal time in an experienced debtors attorney office can produce excellent results in a typical chapter case.another lawyer who less regularly handles chapter cases might double or triple the time investment to produce the same or less desirable results.applying normal lodestar methodology can penalize the efficient volume counsel by reducing the fee in each case while rewarding the inefficient practitioner with higher fees.
keith lundin,chapter bankruptcy,at to ed.supp.
third,the presumptive fee guidelines benefit attorneys by providing for earlier payment of fees.in this case,boone was awarded the requested in his fee application several months before he even filed his second fee application.indeed,since a fee is intended to cover all services required in the usual case,an attorney who opts to file a application may receive full payment even before all the services covered by that payment have been performed.
fourth,use of presumptive fees saves time that a busy bankruptcy court would otherwise be required to spend dealing with detailed fee applications.as stated by the bap in this case,t he sheer volume of chapter cases and the rarity of creditor or debtor objections to attorney fees in such cases make court review of each fee application or fee arrangement administratively burdensome.eliapo ii,at see also lundin,supra,at to it is almost inconceivable that bankruptcy courts would engage in lodestar calculation of debtors attorneys fees in every chapter case,especially in districts with chapter programs.
as the bap noted in this case,bankruptcy courts around the country have been experimenting for several years with presumptive fees for routine services in chapter cases,based on guidelines issued by the executive office of the united states trustee.see eliapo ii,at.the fifth circuit has recently approved the use of a precalculated lodestar as a basis for awarding attorney fees in typical chapter cases.in re cahill,cir this precalculated lodestar aids bankruptcy courts in disposing of chapter fee applications expeditiously and uniformly,obviating the need for bankruptcy courts to make the same findings of fact regarding reasonable attorney time expenditures and rates in typical cases for each fee application that they review.the seventh circuit has also approved the use of presumptive fees in routine chapter cases.see in re kindhart,cir approving concept of presumptive fee schedule in chapter cases and remanding to the bankruptcy court to review and update its presumptive fees in re kindhart,cir approving use of update
