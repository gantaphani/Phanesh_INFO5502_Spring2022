the parties to this appeal are two insurance companies.employers reinsurance erc and casualty mccc,a property and casualty insurance company,entered into a liability excess reinsurance agreement the agreement.under the agreement erc reinsured mccc with respect to certain payments and expenses for which mccc was responsible to its insureds under policies it issued.in addition,erc insured mccc for some liabilities it might incur to its as liability for bad faith denial of a claim.of particular concern on appeal,if mccc had to pay a loss exceeding,erc would reimburse mccc for the excess of the loss above,up to a maximum loss of.we will refer to the threshold as mccc retention,which is similar to a deductible in ordinary insurance policies.additionally,the agreement required erc to pay a share of claim expenses incurred by mccc if the retention was exceeded.
the amounts disputed in this case arise out of declaratory judgment actions between mccc and its insureds.in several such actions it was determined that mccc should have provided its insured with a defense to a tort action brought by a third party against the insured.as a result,mccc had to pay its insureds the attorney fees and expenses incurred by the insureds in the declaratory judgment actions mccc paid its own attorney fees and expenses in the declaratory judgment actions and mccc had to pay the attorney fees incurred by the insureds in defending the underlying tort actions.this appeal centers on whether these payments and expenses were covered by the agreement as losses,claim expenses,or neither.
regarding the first type of payment,mccc contends that the agreement definition of loss unambiguously requires erc to reimburse amounts mccc paid to its insureds to cover the insureds attorney fees in the declaratory judgment actions.erc contends that the agreement unambiguously imposes no such obligation.we disagree with both,reverse the district court summary judgment on the issue in favor of mccc,and remand for further proceedings to resolve the meaning of agreement language that we hold to be ambiguous in this context.
as for mccc own attorney fees incurred in the declaratory judgment action,we affirm the district court ruling that under the contractual language presented to the district court,erc must reimburse these attorney fees as claim expenses.
with respect to the third challenged payment of the insureds attorney fees incurred in defending the underlying tort reverse the district court and hold that erc need not reimburse mccc for those payments as loss.rather,those payments should be treated as claim expenses for which erc need make only a proportionate payment.
we also address several additional issues,including the agreement characterization of postjudgment interest as loss or claim expenses,the percentage rate at which damage payments should be included as loss under the agreement,prejudgment interest,a discovery dispute,and a by mccc for attorney fees in this action.
background 
description of reinsurance agreement 
reinsurance is essentially insurance for insurance companies.spreading part of the risk to the reinsurer can prevent a catastrophic loss from falling upon the insurance company and enable the insurance company to serve more clients.see,unigard sec.ins,north river ins,cir.unlike typical insurance contracts that are offered on a basis,reinsureds ordinarily negotiate the terms,conditions,and rates in their reinsurance contracts.
for nearly years mccc purchased reinsurance coverage from erc.from january,until april,erc and mccc operated under the agreement whose meaning is at issue in this appeal.
the agreement required erc to reimburse mccc for all loss in excess of for each occurrence,with a reinsurance limit of for each occurrence.additionally,the agreement required erc to reimburse mccc for claim expenses at a rate equal to the fraction of the loss for which erc was responsible.if,for example,mccc had to pay a loss of,erc would have to reimburse mccc for of that loss.because erc thus paid of the total loss,erc would reimburse mccc for of the claim expenses mccc incurred.
the parties dispute the meaning of the terms loss and claim expenses in the agreement.article viii of the agreement defines loss 
the word loss shall mean only such amounts 
a within applicable policy limits as are actually paid by mccc in settlement of claims or in satisfaction of awards or judgments including prejudgment interest and plaintiff costs included in the judgment and subject with the judgment to the applicable policy limit 
b equal to of the amount paid by mccc in excess of applicable third party liability coverage policy limits occasioned by liability imposed upon mccc on account of the failure of mccc to settle a claim for an amount within such policy limits 
c equal to of the amount paid by mccc for punitive,exemplary,or compensatory damages awarded to the insured and arising out of the conduct of mccc in the investigation,trial or settlement of any claim or failure to pay or delay in payment of any benefits under any policy if erc has not,in advance of any such conduct by mccc counseled with mccc and concurred in mccc course of conduct or 
c equal to of the amount paid by mccc for punitive,exemplary,or compensatory damages awarded to the insured and arising out of the conduct of mccc in the investigation,trial or settlement of any claim or failure to pay or delay in payment of any benefits under any policy if erc has,in advance of any such conduct by mccc counseled with mccc and concurred in mccc course of conduct.
app.for the dispute before us,the relevant part of the definition appears in paragraphs c and c,which require erc to reimburse mccc for compensatory damages arising out of the conduct of mccc in the investigation,trial or settlement of any claim or failure to pay or delay in payment of any benefits under any policy.a subsidiary dispute concerns whether it is c or c that applies.
claim expenses are defined in article viii of the agreement as follows 
the term claim expenses shall mean all payment under the supplementary payments provisions of the mccc policy,including court costs,interest upon judgments,and allocated investigation,adjustment and legal expenses.
app.as presented to the district court,the pertinent part of the supplementary payments provisions incorporated by reference from insurance policies issued by mccc states 
supplementary a and b 
we will pay,with respect to any claim we investigate or settle or suit against an insured we defend 
all expenses we incur.
all costs taxed against the insured in the suit.
prejudgment interest awarded against the insured on that part of the judgment we pay.if we make an offer to pay the applicable limit of insurance,we will not pay any prejudgment interest based on that period of time after the offer.
all interest on the full amount of any judgment that accrues after entry of the judgment and before we have paid,offered to pay,or deposited in court the part of the judgment that is within the applicable limit of insurance.
these payments will not reduce the limits of insurance.
b.the district court ruling 
the payments and expenses at issue in this litigation arose out of other lawsuits tort actions against mccc insureds,and declaratory judgment actions between mccc and its insureds to determine mccc responsibility to provide coverage with respect to the tort actions.as a result of the declaratory judgment actions,mccc had to pay its insureds attorney fees in the declaratory judgment actions,had to pay its own attorney fees for attorneys representing mccc in the declaratory judgment actions,and had to reimburse its insureds for the damages awarded in the underlying tort actions and for the fees incurred by the insureds for legal representation in the tort action.
the lawsuit between mccc and erc involves whether erc must reimburse mccc for these costs and expenses.after erc had reimbursed mccc for payments and expenses arising out of four declaratory judgment actions,it brought this diversity action for return of the reimbursements.mccc counterclaimed for reimbursement of payments and expenses arising out of three other declaratory judgment actions.
the district court granted mccc summary judgment against erc with respect to mccc payment of its insureds attorney fees and expenses in the declaratory judgment actions.the court ruled that the plain and ordinary meaning of the term compensatory damages included attorney fees and costs and that the declaratory judgment fees and expenses arose out of mccc conduct in failing to pay or delaying payment of benefits under the policy.app.therefore,it held,the insureds attorney fees and expenses in the declaratory judgment actions fell within the agreement unambiguous definition of loss.the district court also granted summary judgment to mccc on its claim that erc had to reimburse mccc for a portion of mccc own attorney fees and expenses in the declaratory judgment actions,because those fees and expenses were claim expenses within the meaning of the agreement.
after a subsequent trial the district court further held that erc had to reimburse mccc for mccc payment of attorney fees and expenses incurred by its insureds in defending the underlying tort actions.the court stated that these payments by mccc were loss within the meaning of the agreement.
erc appeals and mccc cross appeals.we now proceed to address in turn the issues raised by the parties.we have jurisdiction under.
ii.meaning of loss and claim expenses 
most of the issues before us require determination of the meaning of loss and claim expenses under the agreement.because no facts are in dispute,we review de novo the district court legal conclusions.see dang unum life ins.of,cir.the parties agree that oklahoma law governs the interpretation of the agreement.under oklahoma law the court interprets an insurance contract in accordance with principles applicable to all contracts.first bank of turley fdic.a contract must be so interpreted as to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties,as it existed at the time of contracting.stat.ordinarily,this means that the contract should be construed according to the plain meaning of its language.id.at.the court determines,as a matter of law,whether the contract is ambiguous.pitco production chaparral energy.a contract is ambiguous if it is reasonably susceptible to more than one meaning.id.at.the mere fact the parties disagree or press for a different construction does not make an agreement ambiguous.id.at.

insureds attorney fees and expenses in declaratory judgment actions 
we first consider whether the agreement requires erc to reimburse mccc for mccc payment of its insureds attorney fees and expenses in the declaratory judgment actions.the resolution of this issue turns on whether the agreement includes such payments within the definition of loss.each party contends that the agreement is unambiguous.rejecting their views,we hold that the language of the agreement is,as a matter of law,ambiguous on this point.the pertinent part of the agreement definition of loss is as follows 
the word loss shall mean only such amounts 
paid by mccc for punitive,exemplary,or compensatory damages awarded to the insured and arising out of the conduct of mccc in the investigation,trial or settlement of any claim or failure to pay or delay in payment of any benefits under any policy 
article viii,c,c,app.as do the parties,we focus on the phrase compensatory damages awarded to the insured.the agreement does not define compensatory damages.mccc urges that the insureds attorney fees and expenses in the declaratory judgment actions constitute compensatory damages.erc contends that the attorney fees and expenses are not compensatory damages,but rather litigation costs for which it need not reimburse mccc.
before analyzing the phrase,we consider an argument by erc that appears to make the intent of the parties irrelevant.erc asserts that although oklahoma law governs the interpretation of the agreement,the full faith and credit clause of the united states constitution requires that texas law govern whether the attorney fees and expenses are loss or litigation costs.because the amounts at stake were awarded in texas courts,it argues,the texas courts characterization of these compensatory damages,costs,or entitled to full faith and credit in other states.thus,erc concludes,we are bound by texas law declaring that the judgments awarded by the texas courts were litigation costs rather than compensatory damages.
we disagree.the parties to the agreement could define compensatory damages as they saw fit,without regard to the characterization by the state in which judgment had been entered.the full faith and credit clause is simply irrelevant to the issue before us.the full faith and credit clause states full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts,records,and judicial proceedings of every other state.and the congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts,records and proceedings shall be proved,and the effect thereof.const.art.iv.although federal judicial proceedings are not expressly included within the clause,the clause and its implementing statute,as well as interstitial federal common law,dictate that courts in the united states,both state and federal,must recognize and give effect to valid judgments rendered by other courts in the united states,including state and federal courts.moore federal practice matthew bender ed.
in other words,roughly speaking,a judgment must be given the same legal effect in every court within this country.if,for example,a texas court had interpreted the meaning of compensatory damages in the agreement between erc and mccc,that interpretation would have the same preclusive effect in oklahoma,or federal,litigation that it would have in litigation in a texas state court.see dean witter reynolds,byrd,d the statute requires that federal courts give the same preclusive effect to a state judicial proceedings as would the courts of the state rendering the judgment emphasis omitted.here,however,no texas judgment has interpreted the term compensatory damages in the agreement,so no texas judgment is binding with respect to the meaning of that term.of course,the agreement could have provided that the term should be construed in accordance with the law of the state where the underlying judgment was entered.but erc does not argue for such a construction.the requirement does not restrict the parties right to define contractual terms as they wish.at oral argument erc properly conceded that if texas law conflicted with an explicit definition in the agreement,the agreement would control.in short,erc reliance on the full faith and credit clause is misplaced.
the district court ruled that compensatory damages unambiguously includes attorney fees.after noting that attorney fees are sometimes awarded as costs and sometimes as compensatory or punitive damages,it said that the label is unimportant.citing our decision in prudential insurance company of america carlson,cir,which held that an award of attorney fees is a substantive right for purposes of analysis,the court reasoned that such an award is intended to compensate the prevailing party,and thus is compensatory damages within the definition of the term in webster third new international dictionary compensatory damages are damages awarded to make good or compensate for an injury sustained.the court concluded,t he plain and ordinary meaning of the term compensatory damages includes attorneys fees and costs.app.
in support of the district court ruling,mccc cites a legal dictionary that states compensatory damages are such as will compensate the injured party for the injury sustained,and nothing more such as will simply make good or replace the loss caused by the wrong or injury.damages awarded to a person as compensation,indemnity,or restitution for harm sustained by him.black law dictionary ed.mccc argues that an award of the insured declaratory judgment expenses is intended to make the insured whole for all the expenses it has incurred in enforcing the insurer duty to defend and indemnify it with respect to the underlying claim.thus,mccc concludes,the insured declaratory judgment expenses constitute compensatory damages,which compensate for an improper denial of coverage.
to challenge the district court ruling,erc also relies on a dictionary,the same one that the district court quoted.erc argues that attorney fees are clearly included within the definition of costs 
costs pl expenses incurred in litigation as a those payable to the attorney or counsel by his client esp.when fixed by law b those given by the law or the court to the prevailing against the losing party in equity and frequently by also bill of costs.
webster,supra,at.consequently,erc asserts,attorney fees are litigation costs,not compensatory damages.
we do not see the issue as so as the parties seem to.the difficulty here is that payment of attorney fees undoubtedly compensates the prevailing party for losses ultimately caused by the opposing party wrongdoing,but such fees can also be considered as simply the cost of recovering compensatory damages a cost which is not itself considered to be part of compensatory damages and is therefore not recoverable.after all,the american rule which is followed in oklahoma,see kay venezuelan sun oil,ordinarily bars the recovery of attorney fees by the prevailing party in litigation,on the theory that such fees are a cost of recovering damages,not damages in themselves.see,peter church beach,wl,at now the expenses of litigation are never damages sued for in any case when the action is brought for the wrong itself,not even if the tort be wanton or malicious.they are not the natural and proximate consequence of the wrongful act,which is the universal rule,but are remote,future and contingent.internal quotation marks omitted.
both of these strains of attorney fees are compensatory damages or are only unrecoverable costs of litigation to recover compensatory reflected in oklahoma statutes and judicial opinions.some oklahoma authority leads to the conclusion that attorney fees are compensatory damages.see,floyd anderson,w e think that all actual damages,compensatory in their nature,such as costs and expenses,including a reasonable attorney fee.on the other hand,mcalester urban renewal authority hamilton,held that interest on costs,including attorney fees,was not recoverable,whereas interest on damages was.see also.stat.a for purposes of this subsection,attorney fees and costs shall not be considered as or included in actual or compensatory damages.there appears to be no oklahoma rule that attorney fees are or are not compensatory damages.
thus,we can not hold the term compensatory damages in the agreement to be unambiguous with respect to whether it includes or excludes attorney fees.the term is reasonably susceptible to more than one meaning.
to break the standoff between the alternative plausible interpretations of compensatory damages,mccc argues that ambiguous contract language must be construed against its drafter.this rule of interpretation,often referred to as contra proferentem,is particularly suitable for standard insurance contracts where the insured does not have an opportunity to negotiate or bargain.the rule is less appropriate in reinsurance agreements,however,because the parties typically have comparable bargaining power in negotiating the terms of their contracts.for this reason some courts have declined to apply the rule to reinsurance contracts.see,unigard sec.ins.river ins,cir.
in any event,oklahoma appears to have codified the rule.an oklahoma statute states in cases of uncertainty not removed by the preceding rules.stat,the language of a contract should be interpreted most strongly against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist.the promisor is presumed to be such party.stat.yet the statute itself,as well as courts construing the statute,state that this rule is to be applied only when the ambiguity has not been removed by the preceding statutory rules.see,cities service oil geolograph.among the preceding rules is.stat,which states that a contract may be explained by reference to the circumstances under which it was made,and the matter to which it relates.accordingly,a court should not resort to the doctrine of contra proferentem until the parties have an opportunity to present the circumstances surrounding the execution of the contract and other relevant evidence,such as custom in the industry.see restatement second of contracts setting forth types of evidence appropriate to consider in construing contracts.that opportunity should be afforded the parties here.
we therefore remand this issue to the district court for further proceedings regarding the meaning of compensatory damages in the agreement.
mccc own attorney fees incurred in declaratory judgment actions 
we next address whether the agreement requires erc to indemnify mccc for mccc own attorney fees and expenses associated with the declaratory judgment actions.the answer turns on whether these attorney fees and expenses constitute claim expenses within the meaning of the agreement.the district court held that mccc attorney fees and expenses were such claim expenses and therefore were subject to proportionate reimbursement as provided in the agreement.
the agreement defines claim expenses to mean all payment under the supplementary payments provisions of mccc policy,including court costs,interest upon judgments,and allocated investigation,adjustment and legal expenses.this definition incorporates by reference the supplementary payments provisions of mccc policies with its insureds.
the statement of uncontroverted facts in erc memorandum in support of its motion for summary judgment contained what it asserted to be the language of the supplementary payments provisions.mccc response stated that the assertion was uncontroverted.app.the pertinent part of that language is as follows 
supplementary payments coverages a and b 
we will pay,with respect to any claim we investigate or settle or suit against an insured we defend 
all expenses we incur 
these payments will not reduce the limits of insurance.
the district court held 
a plain reading of the supplementary payments provision indicates that it covers mccc declaratory judgment fees and expenses.the provision provides that mccc will pay all expenses which it incurs with respect to any claim that it investigates.certainly,mccc investigated the claims for which it litigated coverage.moreover,the fees and expenses which mccc incurred in the declaratory judgment proceedings are expenses which it incurred with respect to such claims.accordingly,the declaratory judgment fees and expenses fall within the plain and ordinary meaning of the supplementary payments provision.
app.emphasis added.
we agree with the district court that claim expenses,which include all payments under the supplementary payments provisions of mccc policy,thus covers mccc declaratory judgment attorney fees and expenses.mccc investigated the claims that formed the basis of the declaratory judgment actions.mccc incurred attorney fees and expenses with respect to those claims.hence,the declaratory judgment attorney fees and expenses fall within the unambiguous language of the supplementary payments provisions.erc must reimburse mccc for those claim expenses at the contractually provided proportionate rate.
erc contends that this construction of the language makes the words settle or suit against an insured we defend superfluous,because any case that is settled or involves a suit must also be investigated.citing bituminous casualty corporation cowen construction,erc relies on the general proposition that courts should avoid construing a document in such a way as to render some of the language surplusage.erc suggests 
a more reasonable construction of the supplementary payments provision is that mccc will pay all expenses that it incurs with respect to any suit against an insured that it defends.it also will pay all expenses that it incurs with respect to any claim that it investigates or settles.this construction makes sense.a provision that mccc will pay its own expenses in any suit where mccc defends its insured leaves mccc insureds liable for all expenses incurred when mccc settles a claim before suit is filed.the addition of the investigate or settle language would provide coverage for those expenses.
aplt.br.at.
but erc construction does not avoid the surplusage problem.first,the words or settle serve no purpose,since it is impossible to believe that mccc would settle a claim without having investigated it.moreover,although erc argument explains why the words any claim we investigate would need to be added to the words suit against an insured we defend,it does not explain why,once the words any claim we investigate are in the mccc policy,there is any need to retain the words or suit against an insured we defend.at times,no reasonable interpretation of contract language can avoid rendering some of the language surplusage.erc construction of the policy language here has no advantage over the natural reading insofar as avoiding surplusage is concerned.
erc principal argument on appeal,however,avoids the difficulty of construing the language.it points out that the quoted language is not the actual language of the supplementary payments provisions in the mccc policies at issue.rather than saying,we will pay,with respect to any claim we investigate or settle or suit against an insured we defend,the provisions say,we will pay,with respect to any claim or suit we defend.
the problem with this argument is that it was never presented to the district court.it is well settled that i f a party fails to raise an issue in the trial court,it is deemed waived on appeal unless plain error is demonstrated.hynes energy west,cir.
the role of plain error in civil litigation is very limited.there is no plain error provision in the rules governing civil matters except with respect to erroneous instructions,see.d amendment,and rulings on evidence.d.yet we have recognized the possibility of plain error in other circumstances.see quigley rosenthal,cir charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure ed.a lthough the civil rules do not contain a formal provision allowing the appellate courts to notice plain error,the appellate courts have held in a few cases that despite the absence of an objection they may consider an error so fundamental that it may have resulted in a miscarriage of justice.
in reviewing for plain error,we have used the standard applied in criminal proceedings.federal rule of criminal procedure b states a plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the court attention.b.as pointed out by the supreme court,rule b is permissive,not mandatory.if the forfeited error is plain and affect s substantial rights,the court of appeals has authority to order correction,but is not required to do so.united states olano,d.t he discretion conferred by rule b should be employed in those circumstances in which a miscarriage of justice would otherwise result.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.the doctrine is limited to correct ing a plain forfeited error affecting substantial rights if the error seriously affects the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.internal quotation marks and bracket omitted.accord quigley,at.establishing entitlement to relief is an extraordinary,nearly insurmountable burden.quigley,at.
in our view,several factors combine to make this an inappropriate occasion to grant relief under the doctrine.first,the error was not an action or omission by the district court it was an error by the parties.in their pleadings,erc misquoted the policy language and mccc responded that the quote was accurate.to be sure,erc provided the district court with copies of the policies,which contained the correct language.erc,however,miscited the record it referred to page of the contracts,but the pertinent language is not on any page numbered in any of the contracts.of course,the district court could have searched the record to verify the accuracy of language to which the parties stipulated.but courts could never complete their work if they have the burden of engaging in such that would be totally fruitless if attorneys performed their duties adequately.
second,erc had ample opportunity to bring the error to the district court attention.the district court,relying on the language provided by erc,granted summary judgment with respect to recovery of mccc own attorney fees on may.trial on the issues not resolved by summary judgment was on june,almost a month later.erc could also have alerted the district court to the matter by a,or even,motion.
third,the alleged error here does not concern any matter of significant public policy.we are dealing with a private contract dispute in a business relationship.and fourth,we are not certain whether the result we reach would be different under the language now presented to us by erc.the proper construction of erc new language is not obvious.
in short,the judicial proceeding below was fair,and the error by the parties should not raise serious doubts about the integrity of that proceeding or bring disrepute upon the district court.we therefore affirm the district court on this issue.
mccc reimbursement of its insureds attorney fees incurred in underlying tort actions 
erc does not dispute that it must partially reimburse mccc for amounts that mccc paid its insureds for their defense costs in the underlying tort actions in which mccc should have provided a defense and did not.the parties dispute what the amount of the reimbursement should be.the specific disagreement is whether the insureds attorney fees constitute loss under the agreement,or merely claim expenses.under the agreement erc reimburses mccc at a different rate for loss than for claim expenses.
we hold that mccc payment of an insured attorney fees in defending a claim is a claim expense under the agreement.erc need only reimburse mccc at the contractual proportionate rate.
the relevant portion of the loss definition provides 
the word loss shall mean only such amounts 
paid by mccc for punitive,exemplary,or compensatory damages awarded to the insured and arising out of the conduct of mccc in the investigation,trial,or settlement of any claim or failure to pay or delay in payment of any benefits under any policy 
article viii,c,c,app.there are two requirements for a payment to constitute loss.first,the payment must be for punitive,exemplary,or compensatory damages.second,it must aris e out of the conduct of mccc in the investigation,trial,or settlement of any claim or failure to pay or delay in payment of any benefits here,the amounts paid do not arise out of mccc conduct.
the amounts at issue are fees for attorneys to represent the insureds in the underlying tort litigation.these fees were a consequence of the underlying litigation,not of any conduct by mccc.whatever mccc conduct had been in the investigation,trial,or settlement of the claim,attorneys would be needed to represent the insured in the tort action.perhaps the fees for attorneys to defend the tort actions would have been less if mccc had hired and paid for the attorneys because of lower hourly rates,more efficient conduct of the defense,or even earlier resolution by settlement,but the fees might also have been greater higher hourly rates,greater willingness to play hard ball.regardless,the payments to attorneys for the insured in the tort action do not arise out of the conduct of mccc.rather,they arise out of the fact that a third party sued the insured.
we are reinforced in this interpretation of the agreement by the observation that adopting mccc the payments constitute loss would create a perverse incentive for mccc when the loss would otherwise approach the retention threshold.there is no dispute that if mccc had provided attorneys to defend its insureds in the underlying tort actions,the fees and expenses it incurred would have been treated under the agreement as claim expenses.erc would have been required to reimburse mccc for these claim expenses at the contractual proportionate rate,once the loss exceeded.in other words,mccc would receive,at most,partial payment from erc.a loss,however,is fully reimbursable by erc once the threshold is passed.thus,if mccc is correct that payment to the insured for hiring its own attorneys is a loss,then mccc would have a financial incentive to refuse to pay for a defense of its insureds.it would usually end up paying less after reimbursement from erc if it paid its insured for having hired an attorney than if it hired an attorney itself to represent the insured.this is a highly unlikely intent of the parties,and the result might well violate public policy favoring the honoring of insurance contracts because mccc could be induced to refuse to provide an attorney for its insured.
we therefore reverse the district court and hold that mccc payments of its insureds attorney fees incurred in the underlying tort actions should be treated as claim expenses.
safe tire interest 
one of mccc claims for reimbursement arises from its payments to its insured,safe tire disposal corporation.erc argues that mccc is not entitled to any reimbursement on the safe tire claim,because mccc loss on the claim does not exceed mccc retention.the validity of this argument turns on whether postjudgment interest is a loss or a claim expense.we hold,as erc contends,that such interest is a claim expense.
mccc requested reimbursement for the following amounts with respect to the safe tire claim for funds mccc paid to claimants in the underlying lawsuit awarded to safe tire to reimburse it for attorney fees incurred in the underlying lawsuit awarded to safe tire to reimburse it for attorney fees it incurred in the declaratory judgment action awarded to safe tire to reimburse it for attorney fees it incurred on the appeal of the declaratory judgment action and for postjudgment interest awarded to safe tire in the declaratory judgment action.erc concedes that the is loss.as for item,we have already held that the for attorney fees incurred by the insured in the underlying action was a claim expense,not a loss.see supra section ii.regarding items and,we are remanding to the district court the question whether reimbursement of the insured declaratory judgment attorney fees and expenses constituted loss,see supra section ii.a but even if we assume that they should be considered loss,the total for items,and is just.thus,the loss exceeds mccc retention threshold only if the postjudgment interest of is included.for the following reasons we hold that the postjudgment interest is not loss,so the safe tire loss is less than.
the district court treated the postjudgment interest as loss,just as it treated the declaratory judgment fees and expenses themselves.erc disputes that ruling,arguing that postjudgment interest on the attorney fees awarded to mccc insureds are claim expenses.erc asserts that postjudgment interest is covered explicitly by the supplementary payments provisions of mccc policies,which are incorporated into the definition of claim expenses.the pertinent language of the supplementary payments provisions as provided to the district court states 
we will pay,with respect to any claim we investigate or settle or suit against an insured we defend 
all expenses we incur.
all interest on the full amount of any judgment that accrues after entry of the judgment and before we have paid,offered to pay,or deposited in a court the part of the judgment that is within the applicable limit of insurance.
we agree with erc.the claim expenses language clearly includes postjudgment interest.we note that erc previously mentioned error in quoting the mccc policies has no bearing on this issue.not only is erc position supported by the plain language of the agreement together with the supplementary payments provisions,but it also makes sense.if postjudgment interest were considered a loss,mccc would have an incentive not to pay a judgment owed to an insured near or above.delay in payment could result in sufficient interest being due that the retention would be exceeded and once the retention threshold was reached,erc would have to pay all subsequently accruing interest.delay would be an unmitigated boon to mccc,because the cost of the delay accruing interest would be borne solely by erc.it would be remarkable if erc agreed to such a result,which would also seem to violate public policy in favor of prompt payment of insurance claims.
as a result of determining that postjudgment interest is a claim expense,we hold that mccc can not satisfy the retention for the safe tire claim.
does loss include or of payments arising from the declaratory judgment actions 
under the agreement,when mccc makes certain payments for damages,the loss includes either or of the payments,depending on whether erc agreed to the conduct causing the damages.the relevant provisions of the loss definition state that loss is 
c equal to of the amount paid by mccc for punitive,exemplary,or compensatory damages awarded to the insured and arising out of the conduct of mccc in the investigation,trial or settlement of any claim or failure to pay or delay in payment of any benefits under any policy if erc has not,in advance of any such conduct by mccc counseled with mccc and concurred in mccc course of conduct or 
c equal to of the amount paid by mccc for punitive,exemplary,or compensatory damages awarded to the insured and arising out of the conduct of mccc in the investigation,trial or settlement of any claim or failure to pay or delay in payment of any benefits under any policy if erc has,in advance of any such conduct by mccc counseled with mccc and concurred in mccc course of conduct.
app.emphasis added.
erc challenges on appeal the district court ruling with respect to three claims that erc had counseled and concurred in mccc course of conduct in denying coverage to its insureds,thereby triggering paragraph c and inclusion of the payments at a rate of.the court based its ruling on the following stipulated facts erc counseled with mccc and concurred in mccc course of conduct after the date of filing of any declaratory judgment actions and erc never advised mccc orally or in writing that mccc had not counseled with erc and that erc had not concurred in mccc course of conduct.app.after trial the district court decided under the language of c,the court finds that mccc did counsel with erc in advance of the investigation,trial or settlement of the three claims at issue and that erc concurred in mccc course of conduct in the three claims.app.
erc sole appellate claim on this issue is that for the damages to be included as loss at the rate,the counseling and concurrence must have occurred before the first step in mccc course of is,before mccc filed the declaratory judgment action.mccc responds that it sufficed for the counseling and concurrence to occur before the last step in its course of the declaratory judgment action concluded.
we disagree with both parties.as we read the plain language of the agreement,the percentage treated as loss depends upon whether the damages arose from conduct predating erc concurrence in the course of conduct.some damages could have arisen from conduct predating erc concurrence in the course of conduct and some could have arisen from conduct postdating such concurrence.for example,much of an insured attorney fee in the declaratory judgment action could have been incurred after erc approved of
