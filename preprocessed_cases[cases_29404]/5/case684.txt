jo ann tate claims that the administrator of her employer disability plan the plan violated the employment retirement income security act erisa,et,when,after four years,it terminated her disability benefits.the plan determination was based on its conclusion that despite tate long history of psychiatric difficulties,including a major depressive disorder and bipolar disease,she is able to perform an occupation for which she is qualified.yet the plan did not determine what occupation that might be,or explain why,after years of concluding that tate was disabled,it found tate a former sales employee who has not left her house in many years except to see her treating physicians suddenly able to work.tate filed suit to recover benefits after exhausting her administrative appeals.on for summary judgment,the district court determined that the plan administrator had acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying tate benefits and remanded the case so that the plan could conclusively establish whether tate is entitled to benefits.the district court also denied tate motion for attorney fees.
we affirm the district court decisions.because the record does not suggest the plan decision to terminate tate disability benefits was the result of an informed reasoning process,we conclude that the decision was arbitrary and capricious.but we can not say that tate was entitled to continued disability benefits at the time her benefits were terminated,so we affirm the district court decision to remand the case for further proceedings.additionally,because it is too early to tell if tate is the prevailing party in this case,we affirm the district court denial of tate motion for attorney fees.
background 
tate was employed as a sales representative at nationwide papers,a subsidiary of champion international corporation,until june,when she left work due to problems with severe anxiety and depression.as an employee of champion,tate was eligible for and disability benefits.champion benefits plan is governed by erisa,et 
after receiving disability benefits for six months,tate applied for disability in.the plan determines an employee eligibility for disability benefits in two stages.for the first months after an employee receives disability benefits,the employee must be found unable to perform the duties of her employment with the company.to qualify for benefits after that time,the employee must be found unable to engage in any occupation for which she is or may become reasonably qualified by training,education,or experience.the plan refers to these different standards of eligibility as the own occupation standard and the any occupation standard.tate was approved for disability on march.the own occupation stage ended in and tate continued to receive benefits for another two years,during which time she submitted reports by her physicians regarding her condition.
pursuant to the administrative services agreements between the plan administrators and champion,the plan relied on consulting physicians to review the files of employees receiving benefits.in the four years that tate received benefits,at least twelve physicians evaluated her condition.among those physicians are tate own physicians,sharon greenburg and lawrence kayton,both of whom treated tate,as well as a multitude of physicians retained by the plan to evaluate tate disability.
although tate entire medical history need not be cataloged here,a brief synopsis provides context for this case.tate suffered from depression,panic disorder,and bipolar disorder.in,she was diagnosed by greenburg as having a major depressive disorder that caused her to feel hopeless,fatigued,irritable,and uninterested in people.kayton who conferred with greenburg about tate condition diagnosed tate with bipolar disorder.tate physicians attempted to improve her condition with medication which had varying results.in november,tate reported she was able to perform some activities of daily living but that she did not leave her house except to see her doctor.she continued to suffer from severe mood swings and had difficulty maintaining concentration,engaging in social interactions,and completing tasks.although her mood swings appear to have ceased in late and early,they returned by june,when her overall condition worsened.her depression never subsided.in february,she was struggling with activities of daily living other than eating and cleaning.
on may,the plan informed tate she was no longer eligible for disability benefits because she did not meet the definition of totally disabled under the any occupation standard.the plan terminated her benefits based on a report by gail tasch,who stated that although tate exhibited signs of major depressive disorder,she did not manifest significant measurable impairment which would prevent her from performing her occupation or any occupation.tasch noted that tate,who had difficulty concentrating and establishing a daily routine,was nonetheless able to care for her affairs and herself and her pets.tasch did not examine tate her analysis was based on a review of tate file,which included case manager notes,an employee questionnaire,a discussion with kayton,psychotherapy progress notes,and the review of another physician report dated april.
tate appealed the plan decision to terminate her benefits,arguing that tasch opinion was based on outdated medical records.tate submitted a report from kayton dated november,which stated that tate suffered from moderately severe bipolar disorder that,despite intensive treatment,had not sufficiently stabilized to permit her to work in a job commensurate with her abilities,experience,and previous levels of employment.in support of his conclusion,kayton noted that tate was hypomaniac,inefficient in completing tasks,and that she suffered from concentration problems and episodic rages.
in response to tate appeal,the plan had tate medical record reviewed by barbara center.center,like tasch,did not examine tate,but spoke to both of her treating physicians and reviewed,among other things,tate job description and résumé.center concluded that tate did not manifest significant measurable impairment that would render her unable to do any job for which she was qualified.center based this conclusion on the fact that tate was able to maintain her own home,complied with treatment,and had experienced benefit from medication.the plan notified tate that based on center review,she no longer qualified for disability benefits.
tate brought suit challenging the termination in the northern district of illinois.the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court granted tate motion for summary judgment,holding that the plan decision to terminate tate benefits was arbitrary and capricious because the reviewing physicians opinions were comprised of conclusory assertions unsupported by facts.specifically,the court noted that the plan failed to identify the types of positions tate could undertake,conduct an employability review,or conduct a transferable skills analysis tsa.the plan appeals this decision.
the district court remanded the case so that the plan could conclusively determine whether tate is entitled to disability benefits.the court also denied tate request for attorney fees,holding tate was not yet a prevailing party and that the record did not suggest the plan had terminated tate benefits in bad faith.tate filed a motion to alter or amend the court judgment pursuant to rule e of the federal rules of civil procedure,arguing that the court should have reinstated her benefits rather than remanding the case for further disposition.the court denied tate motion on the ground that the plan denial of tate benefits was an initial denial rather than a termination of benefits for which tate had previously been determined eligible.tate appeals these decisions and seeks attorney fees.
ii.analysis 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.schneider sentry group long term disability plan,cir.in reviewing for summary judgment,we view all facts and draw all reasonable inferences in a light most favorable to the party against whom the motion is made.gazarkiewicz town of kingsford heights,cir.
termination of tate benefits was arbitrary and capricious.
where,as is the case here,the benefit plan gives the administrator discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan,we review a denial of benefits under the arbitrary and capricious standard.firestone tire rubber bruch,d hackett xerox.disability income plan,cir.the parties do not dispute that the plan administrator has discretionary authority and that the district court used the correct standard when it reviewed tate denial of benefits under the arbitrary and capricious standard.
notwithstanding the highly deferential nature of this standard,we have held that termination procedures must substantially comply with the erisa requirement that specific reasons for denial be communicated to the claimant and that the claimant be afforded an opportunity for full and fair review by the administrator.halpin grainger,cir.w e will not uphold a termination when there is an absence of reasoning in the record to support it.hackett,at standard of review is not a rubber stamp halpin,at t he administrator must weigh the evidence for and against the denial or termination of benefits,and within reasonable limits,the reasons for rejecting evidence must be articulated if there is to be meaningful appellate review.internal quotation marks omitted.
the issue in this case is whether the plan offered a reasonable explanation,based on the evidence,for its determination that tate was not totally disabled as defined by the terms of the plan.in determining tate eligibility for disability benefits,the plan had to determine whether tate was incapable of performing any occupation or employment for which she was qualified by education,training,or experience.so as a matter of logic,this means the plan needed to consider at minimum tate qualifications in determining whether her impairment affects her ability to work.
we agree with the district court that the plan decision to terminate tate benefits was arbitrary and capricious because the plan conclusion that tate disability did not render her unable to do any job for which she was qualified was not based on any explanation or reasoning.the plan twice informed tate of its decision to terminate her benefits,first based on a report by tasch,and then based on a report by center in response to tate appeal.both determinations are at issue here.
tasch first reviewed tate file and issued the report that provided the basis for the plan may,determination that tate did not qualify for benefits.as an initial matter,the record does not demonstrate that tasch even reviewed tate employment file so it is not clear how she could have come to any reasonable conclusion about tate qualifications.see quinn blue cross blue shield ass n,cir finding that plan administrator review was arbitrary and capricious when the reviewer failed to adequately investigate the requirements of the claimant previous occupation.in her report,tasch states that though tate appears to meet the criteria for a diagnosis of major depressive disorder,she is not unable to perform any occupation.in lieu of an explanation for this conclusion,tasch states and this is the full extent of her analysis that because tate was working in a high stress position previously she may benefit from a job that is not so intense.we do not know what she means by jobs that are not intense or whether tate is qualified for those jobs.the plan letter informing tate that her benefits were being denied contains no reasons for the denial other than stating that a physician found that tate was not totally disabled from any occupation so there is nothing further in the initial denial letter for the court to review.
in response to tate appeal the plan had her file reviewed by center,whose report indicates that she considered tate résumé and job description,in addition to her medical files.but what center did with that additional information is less than clear.for example,center report states that interpersonal relationship difficulties characterized by the patient becoming enraged if she feels she is being patronized or if others are incompetent may be limiting in terms of future vocational options.nevertheless,center concludes that tate who was employed in sales is not totally disabled from any occupation at this time because she is able to maintain her own home,complies with treatment,and there is no documentation of suicidal ideation,homicidal ideation,or psychosis.center also states that the addition of adderall to her medication regimen in september provided her significant benefit.
center report is just as defective as tasch because nowhere in the report does center connect her conclusion that tate is not totally disabled to something that is relevant to tate ability to work.similarly,center general conclusion that medication has provided significant benefit to tate does not prove anything unless the improvement is shown to be connected in some rational way to her ability to work.see elliott metropolitan life ins,cir getting better,without more,does not equal able to work.
the plan second letter to tate informing her that its decision to deny her benefits would remain the same echoes center analysis.the letter states 
it is the opinion of the reviewer that you are able to maintain your own home and care for your animals.there is no documentation of suicidal ideation,homicidal ideation or psychosis.you have been compliant with outpatient psychotherapy and multiple medication trials.you are able to understand and participate in the process regarding disability determinations.it appears that you have had an exacerbation of mood symptoms following the determination regarding disability.however,no specific measurable impairments rendering you unable to do any job for which you are qualified by reason of training,education,experience were noted.
that tate can clean her home and care for her pets after years of treatment and medication does not support a conclusion that she is capable of employment unless the plan believes she is qualified to care for animals as a living.that she has not contemplated killing herself or others is even less probative of her ability to work.these reasons are not relevant to a conclusion that tate,a former sales employee,is able to do a job for which she is qualified.
the plan protests that it should not be required to review vocational evidence in making disability determinations.but logically,the plan could have made a reasoned determination that tate was not totally disabled only if it relied on evidence that assessed her ability to perform a job for which she is qualified by education,training,or experience.this means the plan must have made a reasonable inquiry into tate medical condition as well as her vocational skills and qualifications for its decision denying benefits to be upheld.quinn,at.in so holding,we express no opinion as to whether erisa plan administrators as a rule must hire vocational experts or perform a transferrable skills analysis.but it is the plan burden to make sure its tate could perform a job for which she was qualified despite her medical reached in a manner that substantially complies with erisa,see halpin,at.that did not happen here.
although the record shows center was given tate résumé and job description as part of her materials to consider,nothing in center report or the plan specific reasons for denial relates to tate job qualifications.unless the plan provides a reasonable explanation for its conclusion that tate was capable of performing another job for which she was qualified,we have no basis to uphold the plan decision.conclusions without explanation do not provide the requisite reasoning and do not allow for effective review.hackett,at see also halpin,at rejecting plan administrator denial of benefits as too conclusory to permit appellate review where administrator did not weigh the evidence for and against a determination that a claimant is ready to return to work.
the plan contends that tate bears the burden of demonstrating through a vocational expert that she is unable to perform any job for which she is
