plaintiff ronald tutor tutor filed this action after defendants denied him permission to land his boeing business jet at friedman memorial airport in hailey,idaho.tutor brought several claims under.the district court granted defendants summary judgment on all claims,and defendants subsequently filed a motion for attorney fees and costs under the district court found that all but two of the bases of tutor claim were frivolous it therefore granted defendants motion in part for fees and costs incurred in defending against tutor frivolous claims,while denying the motion with respect to fees and costs incurred in defending against tutor claims.
tutor then moved to vacate the fee order,arguing that the district court applied an improper legal standard when evaluating the motion for attorney fees and costs because the district court found that two bases of the claim were not frivolous,the entire cause of action was necessarily not frivolous and the district court fee allocation,including costs,was unreasonable and not supported by the record.the district court denied tutor motion to vacate and tutor now raises the same arguments on appeal.we have jurisdiction under over this order.we affirm the district court conclusion that defendants were entitled to partial attorney fees and costs incurred in defending against tutor frivolous claims.however,because the district court failed to explain adequately how it arrived at the amount of its attorney fee and cost award,we vacate the award and remand so that the district court may further elucidate its reasoning.
factual and procedural background 
defendants operate friedman memorial airport,which is a airport serving the resort areas of hailey,ketchum,and sun valley,idaho.tutor owns a vacation home in ketchum and requested permission to land his personal boeing business jet at the airport in order to access his vacation home.
the airport maintains a runway weight restriction that prohibits operations by aircraft with a maximum gross weight of pounds or more.tutor boeing jet has a maximum gross weight of pounds.defendants applied this weight restriction and denied tutor request to operate his boeing jet at the airport.although tutor was denied permission to operate his boeing jet at the airport,he was able to access his vacation home by using an alternative private jet that met the airport weight requirements.
tutor complaint challenged defendants restriction as violating substantive due process,procedural due process,equal protection,and right to travel and his rights under the commerce clause,the airport and airway improvement act of,aaia,the airport noise and capacity act of,anca,and state law.tutor sought damages pursuant to,as well as declaratory and injunctive relief,and attorney fees under.
following discovery,both sides moved for summary judgment.the district court denied tutor motion for summary judgment and granted defendants motion for summary judgment on all claims,finding that a number of tutor claims were frivolous.defendants subsequently moved for attorney fees and costs pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure and.the district court granted defendants motion in part,concluding that all of tutor constitutional claims,his substantive due process,procedural due process,equal protection,commerce clause,and right to travel claims,were frivolous.it also found,however,that tutor aaia and anca claims were issues of first impression,and therefore were not frivolous.after reviewing the record,briefs,and legal bills,the district court determined that percent of defendants legal fees were attributable to defending against the frivolous constitutional claims.it then found that the hourly rate charged by defendants counsel was reasonable for the skill and experience of the lawyers and awarded in legal fees,representing percent of the total fees requested,plus in costs,mostly for travel and depositions.the district court denied defendants request for expert fees and costs.it also denied tutor motion to vacate the fee award.tutor appeals the fee award

discussion 
tutor constitutional claims were frivolous.
in addition to relief available under,provides,in relevant part,that the court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney fee as part of the costs.b.the supreme court has instructed that a prevailing defendant in a action is entitled to an attorney fees award under only when the plaintiff action is frivolous,unreasonable,or without foundation.hughes rowe,d per curiam quoting christiansburg garment eeoc,d.in determining whether this standard has been met,a district court must assess the claim at the time the complaint was filed,and must avoid post hoc reasoning by concluding that,because a plaintiff did not ultimately prevail,his action must have been unreasonable or without foundation.warren city of carlsbad,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted christiansburg,at.
a.the district court applied the proper legal standard.
tutor first argues that the district court erred by applying an incorrect legal standard when it evaluated whether his constitutional claims were frivolous,unreasonable,or without foundation.tutor contends that the district court improperly relied on evidence offered by the parties in support of their motions for summary judgment and its review of the record and its own assessment of tutor claims,rather than on the nature of the claims at the outset of the litigation.
the only support tutor offers for his argument is a string of partial quotes from the district court opinions.tutor contends that the quotes prove that the district court applied reasoning and hindsight logic because they are in the past tense.a review of the district court rulings,however,belies tutor argument.in its summary judgment ruling,the district court cited to christiansburg,indicating that it was aware of the proper legal standard.the district court also carefully evaluated each of tutor claims and focused on whether there was any colorable legal or factual basis for each claim.
moreover,in response to tutor motion to vacate,the district court expressly stated that its decision was based on the fact that tutor could not,even at the outset of the litigation,establish that he had a constitutionally protected right to operate his preferred aircraft at his preferred airport.see head medford,cir per curiam reversing the denial of attorney fees after summary judgment because the assertion of a constitutional claim based knowingly on a nonexistent property interest was legally groundless flowers jefferson hosp.ass n,cir per curiam affirming fee award where district court specifically considered the supreme court admonition in christiansburg to refrain from post hoc reasoning and to view the reasonableness of the matter from the plaintiff perspective at the time.accordingly,we conclude that the district court applied the proper legal standard when it determined that tutor constitutional claims were frivolous.
tutor constitutional claims were frivolous.
we next examine whether the district court abused its discretion when it concluded that tutor constitutional claims were frivolous at the outset of the litigation.see christiansburg,at.thomas city of tacoma,cir.tutor argues that his constitutional claims were not frivolous because they were supported by existing case law.although tutor cites various cases which he contends demonstrate that his claims were not frivolous,as we explain below,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it found that tutor lacked a factual and legal basis for his constitutional claims at the outset of the litigation.
substantive due process 
tutor alleged that the airport runway weight limitation violated his substantive due process right because it denied him access to the airport and his real property in ketchum,idaho.to establish a violation of substantive due process,a plaintiff must first show a deprivation of some fundamental right or liberty interest that is deeply rooted in this nation history and tradition.washington glucksberg,d internal quotation marks omitted.we need not address whether tutor was deprived of a fundamental right,however,because tutor complaint makes it clear that he was not deprived of access to the airport or to his vacation home.
tutor knew or should have known that his substantive due process claim lacked merit at the outset of the litigation because he had continuous access to the airport,and his vacation home,through the use of an alternative aircraft.accordingly,the district court did not abuse its discretion when it found that this claim was frivolous.
procedural due process 
to establish a violation of procedural due process a plaintiff must demonstrate a deprivation of a constitutionally protected liberty or property interest,and a denial of adequate procedural protections.brewster bd.of educ.of lynwood unified sch,cir.
as noted above,tutor was not deprived of a liberty or property interest because he was able to access his vacation home by use of another aircraft.accordingly,the district court did not abuse its discretion when it found that tutor knew that this claim was frivolous from the outset of the litigation.
equal protection 
tutor claimed that the runway weight limitation violates the equal protection clause on the grounds that aircraft similar to the boeing business jet were permitted to operate at the airport in the past the airport permitted aircraft weighing more than pounds to operate and basing the rule on maximum certified weight,rather than actual operating weight,was arbitrary.
in order to determine whether a regulatory classification violates the equal protection clause,courts consider first whether the classification is based on a suspect class or implicates fundamental rights.nordlinger hahn,d.if so,the classification is evaluated under a heightened standard.id.if not,the classification is evaluated under the rational basis standard.id.
it is clear that aircraft weight is not a suspect classification,and there is no fundamental right to land an aircraft at any particular airport.see hager city of west peoria,cir access to real property does not rise to the level of a fundamental right such that its denial merits heightened scrutiny.therefore,rational basis review applies.
under rational basis review,the equal protection clause is satisfied if there is a plausible policy reason for the classification,the legislative facts on which the classification is apparently based rationally may have been considered to be true by the governmental decisionmaker,and the relationship of the classification to its goal is not so attenuated as to render the distinction arbitrary or irrational.nordlinger,at.citations omitted.
tutor arguments do not overcome the obvious rational basis for the weight limitation.since the weight restriction is closely related to the defendants interest in preserving the condition of the runway,and tutor had no factual basis to support his contention that the defendants permitted other aircraft exceeding the pound maximum weight to operate at the airport,the district court did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that tutor knew or should have known that this claim was frivolous.
impermissible burden on interstate commerce 
tutor argued that defendants ban on aircraft with a maximum weight in excess of pounds is an impermissible burden on interstate commerce.to prove a commerce clause violation,tutor had the burden of showing that defendants restriction has the effect of discriminating against interests as compared to instate interests,or was imposed with the primary purpose of regulating interstate commerce.hughes oklahoma,d.tutor,however,merely asserted that he believed the ban was an impermissible burden on interstate commerce without offering any evidence to support the claim.tutor offered no evidence indicating that the ban had anything more than an incidental effect on interstate commerce or that the weight restriction was imposed for an impermissible purpose,rather than the obvious purpose of promoting the safety of the airport by preventing deterioration of its runways.accordingly,the district court did not abuse its discretion when it found that tutor knew or should have known that this claim was frivolous from the outset of the litigation.
right to travel 
tutor claimed that defendants ban on aircraft with a maximum weight in excess of pounds denied him his right to travel as guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution.we have previously held,however,that burdens on a single mode of transportation do not implicate the right to interstate travel.miller reed,cir citations omitted.here,tutor right to travel was not violated because he was able to use a different private jet to access his vacation home.in addition,tutor could have flown into a different airport,flown on a commercial airliner,or used another mode of transportation.accordingly,the district court did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that tutor knew or should have known,from the outset of the litigation,that this claim was frivolous.
ii.a fee award is proper when distinct frivolous claims are joined with claims.
having concluded that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it found that tutor constitutional claims were frivolous,we must next decide whether attorney fees may be awarded to a defendant in a action when frivolous claims are joined with claims that are not frivolous.
tutor argues that the district court determination that two of the bases of his claim were not frivolous precludes an award of attorney fees under.while this is an issue of first impression in this circuit,we find the supreme court decision in hensley eckerhart,d,instructive.in hensley,the court decided whether plaintiffs could recover partial attorney fees when they brought both successful and unsuccessful claims.id.at.the court held that plaintiffs could recover partial fees in situations where their unsuccessful claims were distinct in all respects from their successful claims.id.although the court acknowledged that there is no certain method of determining when claims are related or unrelated,id.at.internal quotation marks omitted,it explained that claims involving a common core of facts,or based on related legal theories,should not be viewed as a series of discrete claims because m uch of counsel time will be devoted generally to the litigation as a whole,making it difficult to divide the hours expended on a basis,id.at.the court also noted,in dicta,that a defendant could recover attorney fees in situations where a plaintiff succeeds on one claim,but also asserts a frivolous claim unrelated to the successful claim.id.at.
some circuits have concluded that,where a plaintiff frivolous and claims are sufficiently intertwined,the defendant can not recover attorney fees for the time spent defending against the frivolous claims.see colombrito kelly,cir reversing district court award of attorney fees where plaintiff frivolous and claims were closely intertwined,and continuation of the meritless claim past discovery had only minimal effect on the time and other resource costs of the litigation tarter raybuck,cir finding that the district court abused its discretion in awarding attorney fees to the defendant because action that included one claim was not wholly meritless or without foundation.
tutor similarly argues that the district court erred in awarding defendants partial fees because his claim is a single,interrelated claim that arises from a common set of facts.this argument finds support in hensley,which instructs that claims involving a common core of facts,or related legal theories,should not be viewed as a series of discrete claims for purposes of awarding a prevailing plaintiff attorney fees.see at.in addition,the legislative history behind demonstrates congress intent to promote vigorous private enforcement of civil
