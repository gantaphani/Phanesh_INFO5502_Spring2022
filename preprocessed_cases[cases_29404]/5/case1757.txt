appellants state of california,california department of personnel administration,california department of corrections and rehabilitation,and three state officials appeal following the denial of two requests for attorney fees after they successfully defended against a claim brought by respondent california correctional peace officers association ccpoa and eight of its members pursuant to united states code section section.we conclude that appellants were not entitled to attorney fees pursuant to code of civil procedure section because this action did not qualify as a civil proceeding under the california tort claims act,subd.a for purposes of the statute.we also conclude that the trial court did not err in denying appellants second motion for fees under the federal civil rights attorney fees awards act of b section pursuant to section.we therefore affirm the judgment.
factual and proceduralbackground 
ccpoa is a union representing approximately state employees.according to the union complaint,the organization,along with union members michael jimenez,robert dean,james martin,lance corcoran,stephen walker,leonard mcleod,sandi campbell,and kevin raymond,respondents herein,campaigned heavily to defeat a state ballot measure proposition that would have limited the permissible political activity of labor organizations.after the measure was defeated,appellants tried to implement two new procedures affecting union members.one would have required union members to use a new form to report leave time taken for union activity,and the other would have required that union members undergo required training while on leave for union business.
on april,respondents filed a complaint for damages and injunctive relief against the state of california,the california department of corrections and rehabilitation,and the california department of personnel administration collectively,state defendants.the complaint also named as defendants appellants roderick hickman the former secretary of the department of corrections,timothy virga the chief of labor relations at the corrections department,and brigid hanson the assistant secretary for the corrections department collectively,individual defendants.respondents alleged that appellants intended to implement the new policies in retaliation for respondents participation in the campaign against proposition.the complaint alleged two causes of action against all appellants a federal claim under section of the civil rights act for violation of respondents first amendment rights to freedom of speech and freedom of association,and a state claim for violation of the california constitution,article i,section,subdivision a freedom of speech and civil code section interference with exercise of civil rights.after respondents filed their lawsuit,the state stopped trying to implement the two proposals that were the subject of the suit.
appellants demurred to the complaint.as for respondents state law claim,appellants argued,among other things,that respondents failed to comply with the requirements of the government claims act hereafter claims act,et.appellants also demurred to respondents claim based on federal law however,they did not claim that this cause of action was subject to the requirements of the claims act.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend on the state law claim,concluding that respondents had,in fact,failed to comply with the provisions of the claims act.the court overruled appellants demurrer as to respondents section cause of action,and the parties proceeded to conduct discovery.
nearly a year and a half later,appellants filed a motion for summary judgment on respondents section cause of action.they argued,among other things,that neither the state nor state officials sued in their official capacities could be sued in a state court under section,citing will michigan of state police,eleventh amendment bars section suits against states absent waiver of immunity.apparently recognizing that the state defendants were,in fact,immune from suit under section,respondents filed a request for dismissal with prejudice of the three state defendants before they filed their opposition to the summary judgment motion.this left only the individual defendants in the case.
the trial court granted summary judgment as to the individual defendants.the order granting summary judgment noted that respondents only remaining claim in this action is their first cause of action for violation of section section action,which is brought against the only remaining defendants in this action,the individual defendants,in both their official and individual capacities.the trial court first noted that a section action may be brought against state officials in their official capacities for injunctive relief only.it concluded that because the proposals at issue were never implemented,there was no basis for injunctive relief against the individual defendants.the court also noted that state officials have qualified immunity from section actions brought against them in their individual capacities unless a plaintiff can show a violation of constitutional rights and demonstrate that a reasonable official would understand that he or she was violating someone constitutional rights.the court did not reach the qualified immunity question,however,because it concluded that because the proposals were never implemented,no constitutional rights violation occurred.
appellants filed a motion for attorney fees and costs pursuant to section,which authorizes defendants to recover reasonable attorney fees and costs after they prevail on dispositive motions under the claims act.respondents opposed the motion,arguing that appellants had not secured a qualifying dispositive order under the relevant statute,and that they maintained their suit with reasonable cause and in good faith in any event.
the trial court issued a tentative ruling indicating that it intended to grant the motion and award appellants their attorney fees at the hearing on the motion,respondents counsel argued there were three reasons why the trial court should deny the motion.first,section a state statute governing fees and costs does not address claims brought pursuant to section,a federal civil rights law.second,a section claim is not subject to the claims act.third,respondents counsel argued that granting the motion under state law would contravene the will of congress,because the federal civil rights act permits the award of attorney fees only to prevailing plaintiffs,and not to defendants.as counsel later acknowledged,that was an incorrect statement of law,as any prevailing party other than the united states may recover attorney fees in the court discretion pursuant to section.
the trial court changed its tentative ruling in light of respondents arguments and denied the motion for attorney fees.in its written order denying the motion,the court stated that section did not authorize the requested attorney fees award,because the federal civil rights claim against appellants the only claim that remained at the time the trial court granted summary judgment was not a civil proceeding under the california tort claims act,as required by code of civil procedure section,subd.a.in light of its conclusion that code of civil procedure section did not apply,the court did not reach the issue of whether respondents brought the case in good faith and with reasonable cause pursuant to the statute.
appellants then filed a motion for attorney fees pursuant to section.at the hearing on the motion,the trial court stated that the motion was an improper motion for reconsideration of its previous denial of attorney fees.the trial court permitted appellants to submit supplemental briefing regarding baldwin home savings of america th,baldwin,cited by respondents for the first time at the hearing.following briefing,the trial court again concluded that the motion for attorney fees under section was,in effect,a motion for reconsideration,and that appellants could not seek the same relief under a different statute after they were previously denied attorney fees.the court denied the motion.appellants timely appealed from the subsequent judgment 
discussion 
section does not authorize attorney fees 
for successful defense of section claim.
appellants argue that the trial court erred in determining that there was no legal basis for an award of attorney fees pursuant to section,a legal question we review de novo.connerly state personnel bd.cal th,roybal governing bd.of salinas city elementary school dist.th.to resolve this question,this court first examines the competing legal principles that governed this action.
california,like all other states,enjoys sovereign immunity against claims for money damages.the claims act represents a limited waiver of that immunity,and provides that plaintiffs may bring actions against the state,local public entities,and public employees if they comply with strict procedural requirements,et under the act,no person may sue a public entity or public employee for money or damages unless a timely written claim has been presented to and denied by the public entity.county of los angeles superior court th,quoting.

code of civil procedure section provides defendants with a way to recover the costs including attorney fees of defending against unmeritorious and frivolous claims brought under the claims act.kobzoff los angeles county medical center cal th.the statute provides in part in any civil proceeding under the california tort claims act,the court,upon motion of the defendant,shall,at the time of the granting of any summary judgment,motion for directed verdict,motion for judgment under section,or any nonsuit dismissing the moving party determine whether or not the plaintiff brought the proceeding with reasonable cause and in the good faith belief that there was a justifiable controversy under the facts and law which warranted the filing of the complaint,subd.a,italics added.section permits trial courts to award defendants their costs and fees on a finding that plaintiffs did not bring or maintain the action either with reasonable cause or in the good faith belief in a justifiable controversy under the facts and law.kobzoff at,italics added.
section applies only if a defendant has made a successful motion for summary judgment,judgment under section,directed verdict,or nonsuit.respondents state law claim,which was subject to the claims act,was dismissed on demurrer,and there is apparently no dispute here that section does not apply to the sustaining of a demurrer.following demurrer,respondents maintained only a section claim against both the state defendants and individual defendants.after appellants filed a motion for summary judgment on that claim,respondents sought dismissal as to the state defendants.the trial court later granted summary judgment as to the individual defendants,and appellants sought their fees pursuant to section.appellants argue that,for purposes of section,they obtained summary judgment on their section claim,even though the state defendants were dismissed before summary judgment was granted.we need not decide whether respondents voluntary dismissal was a triggering event for purposes of section,because we believe that the controlling issue is whether respondents section claim against any defendant was a civil proceeding under the california tort claims act under the statute,subd.a.
we agree with the trial court that section was inapplicable here,because respondents section claim,the only claim remaining following demurrer,was not a civil proceeding under the california tort claims act,subd.a.although this is an issue of first impression,we believe that the trial court conclusion was consistent with decades of case law holding that section actions are not subject to the claims act.as this court observed nearly years ago it is well established that a constitutional cause of action is wholly separate and independent from a state cause of action,even where the same conduct gives rise to both.citation.although a plaintiff cause of action may be barred by public entity immunity under state law,this does not shield a public entity from liability under section for deprivation of a person civil rights under color of law.berman city of daly city th,italics added addressing section and state causes of action separately in appeal of summary judgment see also martinez california,immunity statute in claims act does not control in section case even though federal cause of action asserted in state court buenavista city and county of san francisco d,state immunity statute does not shield city from liability under section levy et,cal.torts general public entity liability,b immunity granted by claims act can be circumvented when acts of public entity not only cause injury but also violate constitutional rights under civil rights act.because a state may not impose substantive limitations on a civil rights act action,section claims are not subject to the procedural requirement in the claims act that a plaintiff must timely file a claim with a public entity as a prerequisite to later filing an action for damages against the entity.williams horvath cal d,claim provisions of claims act set forth in inoperative in section action lozada city and county of san francisco th,because supremacy clause prohibits states from altering federally created rights,section actions not subject to claims act filing requirements gatto county of sonoma th,same.
appellants claim on appeal that respondents section action was,in fact,a civil proceeding under the claims act.they reason that because the state and its officials acting in their official capacities were not subject to suit under section,this was simply an action against the state for money damages,which was therefore subject to the claims act.we disagree.the fact that the state and individual defendants were not subject to a section action is an argument that might have supported a motion for attorney fees under the federal attorney fees provision governing section claims,elwood drescher cir,california department of justice entitled to attorney fees under section where section claim dismissed on the basis of eleventh amendment.however,appellants did not seek attorney fees pursuant to that statute in their original motion the fact that appellants both the state defendants and the individual defendants acting in their official capacities may have been immune from suit under section an issue the trial court never decided does not transform this action into a proceeding under the claims act.
indeed,appellants cite no case where a court has found that defendants may recover attorney fees under section where they brought a successful summary judgment motion solely on a section cause of action.instead,they emphasize,as they did in their motion for summary judgment,that neither a state nor its officials acting in their official capacities can be sued under the civil rights act,because they are not persons under section.will michigan of state police,supra,at.although this is true,and it is no doubt why respondents dismissed the state defendants after they moved for summary judgment,it does not follow that appellants were entitled to attorney fees under a state statute for successfully defending a claim under the federal civil rights act.equally irrelevant are the parties arguments over whether the individual defendants were being sued under the civil rights act in their individual or personal capacities.even assuming,as appellants argue,that the individuals were being sued in their official capacities and that this was therefore no different from a suit against the state itself,which is impermissible will,supra,at,the fact remains that this was a suit brought against the state under the civil rights act,not the claims act.
appellants do not cite any persuasive authority to the contrary.in support of their claim that the claims act covers all claims for money damages against the state for an injury for which the state is liable,they first quote from a portion of the claims act regarding the procedural requirements of the statute,subd.b,italics added.again,however,it is well settled that the claims act provisions are inapplicable to section claims williams horvath,supra,cal d at lozada city and county of san francisco,supra,th at gatto county of sonoma,supra,th at.appellants later acknowledge that the claims presentation requirements of the claims act are inapplicable in section actions,but argue that section actions are nonetheless covered by the claims act.original italics.the only authority they cite for this proposition is the portion of williams horvath,supra,cal d,that held that the indemnification provisions of the claims act,apply whether an action is grounded on the claims act or on section.williams at.as the williams court noted,government code section provides indemnification where an employee of a public entity requests the public entity to defend him or her against any claim or action,not just those causes of action based on the claims act.williams,supra,at,quoting,italics added by williams court.section,by contrast,applies only to a civil proceeding under the california tort claims act.italics added.the statute uses specific terminology which,by its terms,applies only to actions brought under the claims act.the trial court correctly concluded that the statute did not apply to respondents federal section action.
appellants reliance on clark optical coating laboratory,th is misplaced.plaintiffs in clark brought a toxic tort lawsuit against the state of california and two other defendants.id.at.the court declared a mistrial based on the cumulative misconduct of plaintiffs attorneys,and awarded all defendants attorney fees and costs as sanctions.ibid.plaintiffs argued on appeal that fees awarded under section were inappropriate because their action was brought under proposition,and not the claims act.clark at.division one of this court rejected that argument,noting that the claims act governs all liability against public entities in california.ibid.however,the clark court was not asked to decide whether a section claim which is meant to protect rights conferred under federal law and does not sound in state law unlike an action purportedly brought pursuant to proposition was subject to the claims act or whether defendants in a section action were entitled to fees under section.
toscano county of los angeles d,upon which appellants also rely,likewise does not support their position.in toscano,plaintiffs sought an order permitting them to file an action against defendant los angeles county sheriff department even though they had not timely filed claims with the department under the claims act,and the trial court denied the petition.id.at.plaintiffs argued on appeal,among other things,that failure to file a timely claim against a government entity did not bar a cause of action under section,citing williams horvath,supra,cal d.toscano at.the court rejected the argument appellants correctly state that the claims provisions of the government code are inoperative to an action brought under section of the federal civil rights act,united states code section.citation.however,united states code section actions can only be brought against individuals.citations.therefore,to the extent that appellants claim was directed at the county of los angeles sheriff department,williams is not in point.citation.insofar as an action against the individual deputies is concerned,williams holds that no claim need have been filed.thus,to the extent that appellants petition was intended as a prelude to an action against the individual deputies under united states code section,appellants are correct.however,the unnamed individuals do not appear to have been made a party to the petition.citation.toscano at.in other words,the court concluded that the fact that plaintiffs were not required to comply with state claims provisions in a section action was not a ground to set aside the order denying their petition,because they could not properly maintain a section action against the sole defendant named in their petition in any event.toscano at.the court did not hold,as appellants claim,that the claims act applied to a section claim,but rather that plaintiffs had not named an appropriate defendant under section in the first place 
again,it is no doubt true here that respondents could not maintain a valid section action against appellants.indeed,they voluntarily dismissed the section claim against the state defendants in response to appellants arguments that they were immune from suit,and respondents do not challenge the trial court grant of summary judgment as to the individual defendants.appellants could have sought attorney fees as the prevailing parties pursuant to section,which specifically applies to section actions,but they waited until after their attorney fees motion under section was denied before seeking fees under the federal statute.we next consider whether their failure to include the federal basis for attorney fees in their original motion precluded them from recovering.
no abuse of discretion to deny second attorney fees motion.
appellants challenge the trial court conclusion that their motion for attorney fees pursuant to section was an improper motion for reconsideration of the court previous order denying attorney fees under state law.the resolution of this question is governed by section,which provides in part a party who originally made an application for an order which was refused in whole or part may make a subsequent application for the same order upon new or different facts,circumstances,or law,in which case it shall be shown by affidavit what application was made before,when and to what judge,what order or decisions were made,and what new or different facts,circumstances,or law are claimed to be shown,subd.b,italics added.section,subdivision e further provides this section specifies the court jurisdiction with regard to applications for reconsideration of its orders and renewals of previous motions,and applies to all applications to reconsider any order of a judge or court,or for the renewal of a previous motion,whether the order deciding the previous matter or motion is interim or final.no application to reconsider any order or for the renewal of a previous motion may be considered by any judge or court unless made according to this section.the statute is meant to reduce the number of motions to reconsider and renewals of previous motions heard by judges in this state.le francois goel cal th.we review the denial of a motion under section for abuse of discretion.lucas santa maria public airport dist.th.
as a preliminary matter,we agree with appellants insofar as they argue that their second motion for attorney fees was not a motion for reconsideration governed by section,subdivision a.that subdivision requires that where a party seeks to modify,amend,or revoke a prior order,the party motion for reconsideration must be filed within days after service of the order of which reconsideration is sought,based upon new or different facts,circumstances,or law,and supported by an affidavit setting forth the details of the order being challenged.appellants second motion for attorney fees,filed more than months after the denial of their first attorney fees motion and thus outside the time limit for motions for reconsideration,subd.a,did not resemble a motion for reconsideration because it did not request the court to reconsider the matter and modify,amend,or revoke the prior order on the first application.deauville restaurant,superior court th,quoting,subd.a.instead,the second motion was more akin to a renewed motion,subd.b than a motion for reconsideration.deauville restaurant at second application for writ of attachment was renewed motion.like a motion for reconsideration,a renewed motion must be based upon new or different facts,circumstances,or law,and must be accompanied by a supporting affidavit 
appellants argue that section,subdivision b did not apply to their second motion for attorney fees,brought under a federal statute,because they were not seeking the same order,subd.b as they did in their first motion for attorney fees,brought pursuant to a state statute that has different substantive and procedural requirements.however,it is beyond dispute that they sought identical relief in both motions namely,an award of their attorney fees.they requested in attorney fees in their original motion,and they sought the identical amount in their second motion.an order is defined as a direction of a court or judge,made or entered in writing,and not included in a judgment.whether appellants motions relied on two different grounds,the fact remains that both sought an order from the court directing respondents to pay their attorney fees.the nature of a motion is determined by the nature of the relief sought,not by the label attached to it.the law is not a mere game of words.sole energy petrominerals th,trial court had discretion to treat motion for reconsideration as motion for new trial.we conclude that appellants second motion for attorney fees was a motion for the same order,subd.b as they sought in their first motion,because they sought identical relief in both motions.the cases upon which appellants rely in claiming that they filed a different motion are distinguishable,because they involved situations where parties sought different relief,using procedures that had different purposes.emerald bay community golden eagle ins.th,ruling on motion for judgment not a reconsideration of summary judgment motion,which has different scope and focus community memorial hospital county of ventura th,motion for summary judgment or adjudication not reconsideration of order overruling demurrer,which raises only issues of law.
we disagree with appellants argument that a recent sixth district opinion dictates a contrary conclusion.standard microsystems winbond electronics th,petn.for review pending,petn.filed,standard microsystems.in standard microsystems,two corporations that were located outside the united states were served by mail with a complaint.id.at.their california attorney advised them incorrectly that service was ineffective and that they need not respond to the complaint,and plaintiff secured both defendants defaults.id.at.defendants filed motions to set aside the defaults pursuant to the discretionary relief provisions of section,subdivision b,which provides relief from a judgment,dismissal,or order taken through a party mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect.standard microsystems at.the trial court denied the motions and entered default judgments against defendants.id.at.after defendants hired new counsel,they moved for relief from both the defaults and default judgments pursuant to the mandatory relief provisions of section,subdivision b,which provides relief from a default or default judgment upon a showing of attorney fault.standard microsystems at.the trial court denied the motions,concluding that defendants had not made a sufficient showing under section,subdivision b,and the motion for relief was an improper motion for reconsideration of the trial court previous denial of the motion for relief from default.standard microsystems at.
the sixth district reversed.it first concluded that defendants second motion for relief was not a motion for reconsideration.subd.a,because like appellants second attorney fees motion here it did not seek to modify or set aside the court previous order.standard microsystems at.as for whether defendants second motion for relief was a renewed motion governed by section,subdivision b,the standard microsystems court found that the term same order in the statute contained a latent ambiguity.standard microsystems at.conceivably the legislature intended a distinction between facts,circumstances,and law on the one hand,and grounds on the other,such that the two motions seeking the same relief on different legal theories would not be viewed as seeking the same order.id.at,original italics.although the court concluded that s uch a gloss contained little basis in the actual language of the statute,it did not decide the issue.ibid.it instead assumed,without deciding,that defendants second motion sought the same order as the first in part insofar as it sought relief from the underlying default.id.at.because the second motion also sought the additional relief of setting aside the resulting default judgment,it was not barred by section,subdivision b ibid.we emphatically reject the proposition that a motion seeking a previously denied order in addition to newly requested relief is thereby entirely barred,as if its repetitive aspect somehow tainted the whole.defendants second motion rested on an entirely distinct factual predicate id.at,because it relied on an assertion of attorney fault not presented in the first motion.id.at.here,by contrast,as set forth above,appellants sought identical relief in both their first and second motions for attorney fees.although they relied in their second motion on a statute with different substantive rules,they did not rely on any new factual predicate for their relief.id.at.appellants therefore sought the same order,subd.b in their second motion.
the question remains whether appellants renewed motion complied with section,subdivision b,which requires that renewed motions be based upon new or different facts,circumstances,or law,and must be supported by affidavit setting forth what application was made before,when and to what judge,what order or decisions were made,and what new or different facts,circumstances,or law are claimed to be shown.appellants argued in their second motion for attorney fees that because section,the basis for the motion,was not either new or different law from what was available on or before march,when the trial court heard oral argument on the state motion under section,they did not renew their first attorney fees motion pursuant to section.in its written order denying appellants second motion,the trial court rejected the argument that appellants need not comply with section this is a motion to reconsider the court prior order rejecting the request for fees under california code of civil procedure section.defendants are correct that section provides a separate basis apart from section for defendants to seek attorneys fees,having prevailed in this action.however,defendants may not make seriatim motions that seek the same relief rather defendants were obligated to put forth all of their reasons for an award of attorneys fees when they made their initial request.that is the teaching of baldwin,supra,th.
in baldwin,plaintiffs sought,and were granted,attorney fees pursuant to civil code section.baldwin,supra,th at.in support of a motion for reconsideration,defendant submitted an affidavit stating that a published opinion not considered at the first hearing was relevant to the ruling and justified reconsideration.id.at.division two of this court disagreed and held that where a subsequent motion is based on different law,a trial court lacks jurisdiction to reconsider its previous order absent a party showing of diligence in its explanation of its failure to present the law earlier,and that defendant had made no showing that it could not have presented the case in its original motion id.at.without a diligence requirement the number of times a court could be required to reconsider its prior orders would be limited only by the ability of counsel to belatedly conjure up a legal theory different from those previously rejected,which is not much of a limitation.id.at.appellants distinguish baldwin on the basis that the opinion addressed decisional law original italics,as opposed to a different statute with different substantive and procedural requirements.this is a distinction without a difference.section,subdivision b provides that a party may bring a renewed motion upon new or different law,without distinguishing between statutory or decisional law.
the trial court reliance on baldwin,supra,th demonstrated that it concluded that appellants had not provided a satisfactory explanation for their failure to direct the court to section in their first attorney fees motion because appellants contend that section did not apply,they apparently argue that they were not required to provide any such explanation.to the extent that they argue that the trial court erred in concluding that they had no satisfactory reason for not presenting their legal theory that they were entitled to attorney fees pursuant to section in their first motion,we disagree.appellants claim that it was necessary to bring a second motion because of the incorrect assertion by respondents counsel at the first attorney fees hearing that only prevailing plaintiffs may recover attorney fees in section cases.first,the misstatement of law which the trial court characterized as completely innocent was not the basis for the trial court written order denying attorney fees under state law.more importantly,it was appellants responsibility to advance all correct legal theories for an award of attorney fees in their original motion,so as not to burden the trial court with repeated motions for the same relief.
appellants also note that there are different time limitations for filing motions under the different statutes,because attorney fees under the state statute must be brought before entry of judgment,subd.c,whereas a statutory motion for fees under section must be served and filed within the time for filing a notice of appeal.cal.rules of court,rule b.appellants contended in the trial court that,unlike the time limit set forth in section,there was no requirement that a section motion be filed before entry of judgment.on appeal,appellants argue that the applicable time limitations would appear to exclude the possibility of filing their motions for attorney fees simultaneously.yuba cypress housing partners,area developers th,request for attorney fees filed under former rule b,now b,timely even though prematurely filed before rendition of judgment.they assert for the first time in their supplemental brief that they allowed judgment to be entered before filing their motion pursuant to section,because rule mandates that motions for attorney fees must be made within days after judgment.to the contrary,appellants filed their motion for attorney fees under section on august,more than three months before entry of judgment on november,following the denial of appellants second attorney fees motion.appellants offered no reason to the trial court why it was necessary to file their motions at different times,and both were in fact filed before entry of judgment we agree with the trial court that were appellants second motion for attorney fees considered a motion for a different order,parties could continue to bring motions for attorney fees one at a time on a seriatim basis.
finally,we reject appellants argument,based in standard microsystems,that this court should not apply section here because to do so would result in a forfeiture.standard microsystems,supra,th at.the standard microsystems court noted that section appears to fall squarely within at least one class of statutes that has traditionally been strictly construed,those statutes effecting a procedural forfeiture.standard microsystems,supra,at.to the extent there was a conflict between section and the mandatory relief provisions of section,subdivision b,the court held that the conflict must be resolved in favor of allowing relief under section,subdivision b,which is to be construed liberally to favor adjudication of cases on the merits rather than determined by default.standard microsystems at.here,by contrast,although there were different procedural rules and substantive standards governing appellants two motions for attorney fees under two different statutes,there was no conflict between either of these two statutes and section.
we conclude that appellants motion for attorney fees pursuant to section was a renewed motion for attorney fees governed by section,subdivision b,and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion in the absence of a sufficient explanation why appellants did not rely on the federal statute in their original motion.
