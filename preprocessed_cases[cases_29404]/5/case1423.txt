rudolph technologies,rudolph appeals from the district court judgment that it infringes patent patent.rudolph challenges the court denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law jmol that prosecution history estoppel bars the application of the doctrine of equivalents.rudolph also challenges the award of damages,the court determination that this was an exceptional case under,and that rudolph failed to prove laches.we hold that prosecution history estoppel precludes the application of the doctrine of equivalents and therefore reverse the judgment of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.we also reverse the willfulness finding predicated on that judgment and vacate the corresponding award of enhanced damages we affirm the award of damages for literal infringement.we vacate the award of attorneys fees and costs and remand because we find that the court exceptional case analysis relied in part on the willfulness finding.finally,we hold that the court did not abuse its discretion in finding no laches.
background 
this case relates to inspection equipment for probe cards used to test chips on semiconductor wafers.probe cards contain structures called probes,whose tips make contact with bonding pads located on the periphery of each chip.the probe tips initially pierce the oxide layer atop the conductive layer of the bonding pad.the probe tips are subsequently moved along the pads to a second position to create a reliable electrical contact,leaving a scrub mark on the bonding pad in the process.
integrated technology itc sued rudolph for infringement of the patent.the patent discloses a digital viewing system to assess whether probes have become misaligned relative to each other by predicting the length and location of scrub marks.patent,ll.the system includes a camera under a viewing window that obtains the coordinates of the probe tips in first and second states.id.at ll.asserted claim of the patent is representative emphasis added 
an integrated circuit probe card inspection system comprising 
a window with a flat surface contacted by said probe tip,said viewing system obtaining said digital image through said window in a first state where said probe tip is driven in contact with said window with a first force,and in a second state where said probe tip is driven in contact with said window with a second force,said second force being different from said first force 
itc alleged that two categories of rudolph products infringe the asserted claims.the first includes products in which the probe tips make physical contact with the viewing window before,or at,the moment an image is taken pre products.the second includes three products that obtain a first image when the probe tips are approximately five microns above the viewing window products itc alleges that this design infringes by equivalence.
the district court granted summary judgment of literal infringement as to the pre products.the parties proceeded to trial on three issues whether rudolph literal infringement with the pre products was willful whether the products met the in a first state where said probe tip is driven in contact with said window with a first force limitation of the asserted claims and damages.
the jury returned a verdict of no willfulness as to the pre products and awarded itc lost profits of nearly million.the jury found willful infringement under the doctrine of equivalents by the products and awarded lost profits of nearly million.
following the verdict,the court denied rudolph motion for jmol that prosecution history estoppel bars the application of the doctrine of equivalents.the court determined that rudolph did not prove laches.the court trebled damages for willful infringement.the court also determined that the case was exceptional and awarded itc attorneys fees and costs.rudolph appeals.we have jurisdiction under a.

infringement under the doctrine of equivalents 
applicable law 
prosecution history estoppel prevents a patentee from recapturing through the doctrine of equivalents the subject matter that the applicant surrendered during prosecution.festo shoketsu kinzoku kogyo kabushiki,d.it presumptively applies when the applicant made a narrowing claim amendment related to patentability.id.at.
a patentee bears the burden to rebut the presumptive application of prosecution history estoppel by establishing one of three exceptions by a preponderance of the evidence.first,t he equivalent may have been unforeseeable at the time of the application.id.at.second,the rationale underlying the amendment may bear no more than a tangential relation to the equivalent in question.id.third,there may be some other reason suggesting that the patentee could not reasonably be expected to have described the equivalent.id.at.whether a patentee has rebutted the presumption is a question of law that we review de novo.chimie ppg indus.
application of prosecution history estoppel 
as originally filed,claim recited in relevant part only a window with a flat surface contacted by said probe tip.the examiner rejected the original claim as indefinite under,paragraph,and anticipated under b by patent sato.itc responded by amending the claim to also recite in a first state where said probe tip is driven in contact with said window with a first force.
the district court concluded that prosecution history estoppel does not preclude a finding of infringement by equivalence.it determined that the original and issued claims both required contact between the plate and the probe tip,and therefore held that itc did not make a narrowing amendment.integrated tech.rudolph,cv,ecf,slip op.at.july.
rudolph argues that the court erred as a matter of law by concluding that the amendment was not narrowing.it contends that the equivalent was literally within the scope of the original claim.rudolph argues that the amendment narrowed the scope of the claim by reciting that the probe tip must be driven in contact with said window in both recited states.it argues that prosecution history estoppel presumptively applies because the narrowing amendment was in response to patentability rejections.
rudolph also argues that itc can not satisfy its burden to rebut the presumption of prosecution history estoppel.first,rudolph argues that the equivalent bears a direct as opposed to tangential relationship to the amendment.it contends that,even if itc did not need to distinguish the prior art on the basis of whether the probe tip and window are in physical contact,it chose to do so.rudolph argues that the prosecution history does not provide a discernible tangential rationale for the amendment because itc relied on the difference between the equivalent and the amended limitation to obtain claim allowance.
second,rudolph argues that the equivalent was objectively foreseeable at the time of the amendment because the original claim literally covered the equivalent.rudolph also contends that the equivalent was not technically unforeseeable at the time of the amendment.it argues that the redesign of its pre product involved a straightforward software change to regulate the placement of the probe tip above the viewing window when obtaining the image in a first state.
itc responds that the doctrine of equivalents applies.it argues that the court correctly held that the amendment was not narrowing.itc contends that the original claim implied measuring the probe tip at two different points of actual physical contact with the viewing window.it argues that the amendment merely expressed that implication,and relies on the specification reference to the probe tip first position as the location where the tip would initially contact the video window.patent.
