eight individual plaintiffs allege that defendants,who are individuals and entities associated with the city and county of los angeles,intercepted plaintiffs telephone calls after having obtained wiretap authorizations by using falsified warrant applications.plaintiffs also allege that defendants unconstitutionally concealed the existence of the wiretaps by using a handoff procedure.plaintiffs sued defendants under for declaratory and monetary relief the district court granted summary judgment to plaintiffs on their claim for declaratory relief on the handoff procedure,ruling that the procedure violates the fourth amendment.the district court granted summary judgment to defendants on plaintiffs claims for monetary relief,ruling that heck humphrey,d,barred plaintiffs claim for damages from the alleged warrant falsification and that defendants were entitled to qualified immunity on plaintiffs claim for damages from the handoff procedure.we hold that plaintiff whitaker claim alleging that the wiretap that intercepted his telephone call was obtained using a falsified warrant application may proceed against defendants williams,lewis,garcetti,demerjian,the city of los angeles,and the county of los angeles none of the other claims can survive.
factual and procedural history 
this case involves three sets of plaintiffs and two sets of defendants 
plaintiff jack whitaker,a lawyer 
plaintiffs ramon portillo,avelino avalos,eduardo martinez,virginia delgado,and ricardo carrizoza portillo plaintiffs,who possessed kilograms of cocaine 
plaintiffs lauro gaxiola and antonio gastelum,who possessed kilograms of cocaine 
defendants gil garcetti,curtis hazell,david demerjian,and jason lustig,who worked in the los angeles district attorney office,and the county of los angeles county defendants and 
defendants willie williams,dan harden,horacio marco,chuck livingston,and keith lewis,who worked in the los angeles police department,and the city of los angeles city defendants.
as summarized by the district court 
the events that gave birth to the instant dispute were two separate narcotics wiretap investigations conducted by the los angeles police department lapd.the first investigation revolved around downey communications downey and the downey wiretaps,while the second revolved around the atel cellular and pager company atel and the atel wiretaps.lapd investigators supposedly suspected these companies of facilitating drug deals by providing cellular telephone and digital paging services to narcotics traffickers and money launderers.the defendants then submitted to the los angeles superior court applications for wiretap orders,which included sworn affidavits in order to establish probable cause against downey and atel.in relying on the sworn statements within the affidavits,the superior court issued wiretap orders for the downey and atel wiretaps.thus,the wiretaps were supposedly designed to further investigate the suspected criminal activity of downey communications and atel cellular and pager company,and their respective principals and employees.
the los angeles superior court granted the application to intercept nine telephone lines of downey on november.due to the numerous extensions of the wiretap order and expansions in the number of telephone lines tapped,defendants intercepted over conversations that took place across thirty downey telephone lines for a duration of months.
the los angeles superior court granted the application to intercept telephone lines of atel on may.due to the myriad of extensions sought and obtained,defendants were able to intercept dozens of thousands of conversations over the course of months.
t he downey and atel wiretaps uncovered substantial criminal activity,although none on the part of any of the putatively targeted parties.while intercepting calls pursuant to these broad and enduring wiretaps,defendants became aware of suspicious conduct on the part of plaintiffs,although none of the plaintiffs were so much as named in the wiretap orders or under investigation by the lapd at the time of the orders.in other words,plaintiffs were mere clients of downey or atel,or merely involved in conversations with clients of downey or atel,but as a result of the two wiretaps,were indirectly subjected to electronic surveillance.these electronic surveillances served as the soil out of which the investigations against plaintiffs originally grew.
whitaker garcetti,d,footnotes omitted.
plaintiffs allege that defendants intentionally concealed the existence of the wiretaps from them through the use of a handoff procedure.by defendants own admission,
t he logistics of the procedure are rather simple.an investigative unit applies for and obtains a wiretap order from a judge.pursuant to the wiretap order,the investigative unit conducts electronic surveillance and gathers specific evidence of imminent criminal conduct.rather than arriving at the scene and making arrests after observing the criminal conduct,the investigating unit transmits the information to another unit without expressly stating that the delivering unit obtained the information via a wiretap.the receiving unit is given both the specific information gathered through the wiretap and the critical instruction to investigate the conduct,which,in law enforcement code,signifies that the receiving unit should arrive at the crime scene and,rather than execute an arrest,observe the illicit conduct in order to obtain what law enforcement refers to as independent probable cause.
upon acquiring this independent probable cause,the receiving unit either makes an immediate arrest or obtains a search warrant on the sole basis of the independent probable cause.the criminally accused is then prosecuted without ever knowing that he was subjected to the wiretap surveillance,as no mention of the wiretap is made in any police reports,through any discovery disclosures,or by any testifying detectives at hearings or at trial the testifying detectives,belong to the receiving unit.the conviction follows,yet the very existence of the wiretap is concealed from the criminally accused,in order to permit the survival of any pending investigations revolving around the wiretap.

b.the three sets of plaintiffs 
each set of plaintiffs raises claims about the wiretaps and the handoff procedure from a different perspective.
on may,whitaker,a lawyer,received a telephone call from a client.an lapd detective intercepted the call.during the conversation,whitaker and his client discussed plea bargaining and witness interviews.police never arrested whitaker or charged him with a crime.
portillo plaintiffs 
on june,lapd detectives were told to surveil a location,allegedly based on interceptions of the portillo plaintiffs telephone calls.from the surveilled location,detectives followed a vehicle to a residence.after this surveillance,police obtained a search warrant and seized kilograms of cocaine and in cash.police arrested portillo,avalos,martinez,delgado,and carrizoza.
on october,the portillo plaintiffs pleaded guilty.portillo was sentenced to years imprisonment,avalos was sentenced to years imprisonment,martinez was sentenced to years imprisonment,delgado was sentenced to days imprisonment plus years of probation,and carrizoza was sentenced to years imprisonment.on may,the portillo plaintiffs counsel of record received notice about the existence of the wiretaps,but the notice did not state whether the portillo plaintiffs calls had been intercepted.
gaxiola and gastelum 
on may,an lapd detective was told to surveil a location,allegedly based on interceptions of gaxiola and gastelum telephone calls.from that location,the detective followed gastelum.after this surveillance,police obtained a search warrant for two residences and seized kilograms of cocaine,in cash,an assault rifle,and drug ledgers.police arrested gaxiola and gastelum.
in june,gaxiola and gastelum received notice about the wiretaps and the interception of telephone numbers that they identified as their own.on december,each pleaded guilty and was sentenced to years imprisonment 
procedural background 
on august,plaintiffs filed suit against defendants plaintiffs sued the individual defendants under for unlawfully intercepting their telephone calls and for intentionally concealing the interception.plaintiffs sued the city and county under for maintaining an unlawful policy,custom,practice,and usage,and for failing to instruct,supervise,control,or discipline their employees.plaintiffs also brought claims against all defendants under california law for unlawfully intercepting their telephone calls.
in addition to asking for damages and declaratory relief,plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction against defendants use of the handoff procedure.the district court denied plaintiffs request for a preliminary injunction.in addition,the court dismisse d the claims based on failure to provide notice of the wiretap surveillance asserted by plaintiffs who were unnamed in the wiretap order application and overheard but not charged with the commission of a crime as a result of the surveillance.the district court did not identify whitaker by name,but this ruling applied solely to his handoff claim.the district court never entered judgment on its order.nevertheless,plaintiffs appealed the district court denial of a preliminary injunction.we affirmed the denial.whitaker garcetti,cir unpublished decision.
plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint,renewing their claims,and all parties moved for summary judgment.on november,the district court issued an opinion granting in part and denying in part plaintiffs and defendants motions for summary judgment.whitaker,d.the court analyzed plaintiffs complaint as alleging two cognizable constitutional violations violation of the fourth amendment for obtaining the wiretap warrant through judicial deception judicial deception claim,and violation of the fourth amendment for maintaining the handoff procedure handoff claim.id.at.
the district court granted summary judgment to defendants on plaintiffs judicial deception claim.the court reasoned that a jury after proper witness testimony and could reasonably find for plaintiffs.id.at.however,a jury finding on the judicial deception issue in favor of plaintiffs would necessarily imply the reversal of plaintiffs earlier convictions.id.at.thus,the claim was barred by heck,d.whitaker,d at.in so ruling,the district court referred only to plaintiffs generally,rather than examining the individual claims of each set of plaintiffs.
the district court granted summary judgment to plaintiffs on their claim for declaratory relief on the per se unconstitutionality of the handoff procedure.for purposes of isolating the constitutional permissibility of the wiretap hand off procedure,the c ourt assume d arguendo the legality of the initial wiretap.id.at.the court then ruled that preserving the substance of the fourth amendment,respecting the constitutional principles built into the federal wiretapping statute,and applying a proper understanding of the notion of independence all demand ed holding the wiretapping hand off procedure per se unconstitutional.id.at.heck did not apply because heck repeated,time and time again,that the claims to be barred were specifically restricted to claims for money damages.id.at.
the district court granted summary judgment to defendants on plaintiffs claim for damages from the handoff procedure.the court ruled that defendants are undoubtedly entitled to qualified immunity on this claim,since the district court constitutional holding obviously was not clearly established at the time of the activity.id.at.the district court did not discuss the applicability of heck to the handoff claim for damages.
finally,the district court denied defendants motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs state law claims.the district court never entered judgment on the november,order.
after the district court issued its order,the state law claims of some plaintiffs went to a jury on may,the jury found that no plaintiff had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that any defendant had intercepted his or her telephone call.the district court entered judgment in favor of defendants on plaintiffs state law claims.no party appeals a state law claim.
on december,the county defendants filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment or order regarding plaintiffs claims.on march,the district court denied the motion.the district court never entered judgment on the order.
on april,plaintiffs filed a request for a unified judgment because the district court had not entered judgment on its november,order.on april,the county defendants filed a notice of appeal from the district court grant of declaratory relief on plaintiffs handoff claim.
the next day,plaintiffs filed a motion for attorney fees as prevailing plaintiffs in reliance on the district court grant of declaratory relief.the following day,plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal from the district court grant of declaratory relief and partial grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants.on may,plaintiffs filed a motion to enter a unified judgment the city defendants did not file a notice of appeal.
on june,the district court denied plaintiffs request for attorney fees.the district court never ruled on plaintiffs motion for a unified judgment,nor did it enter judgment on its attorney fees order.plaintiffs did not file a notice of appeal on their claim for attorney fees.

discussion 
although the district court violated federal rule of civil procedure,plaintiffs waived any objection by timely appealing.
as a preliminary matter,plaintiffs argue that the district court erred by failing to enter a single judgment because the judgments entered in this case do not comport with federal rule of civil procedure.plaintiffs contend that the case should be sent back to the district court for a proper entry of judgment.
under rule,with a few exceptions not applicable here,e very judgment and amended judgment must be set forth on a separate document.a.the district court violated rule when it failed to enter a separate judgment on its order denying plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction on may,its order granting and denying in part plaintiffs and defendants motions for summary judgment on november,its order denying the county defendants motion to alter or amend judgment on march,and its order denying plaintiffs request for attorney fees on june.plaintiffs repeatedly brought the lack of separate judgments to the district court attention,and the court never addressed plaintiffs concerns.
but t he sole purpose of the requirement,which was added to rule in,was to clarify when the time for appeal begins to run.bankers trust mallis,d per curiam.a failure to set forth a judgment or order on a separate document when required by federal rule of civil procedure a does not affect the validity of an appeal from that judgment or order.fed.a b.n either the supreme court nor this court views satisfaction of rule as a prerequisite to appeal.a ruling is final if it is a full adjudication of the issues,and clearly evidences the judge intention that it be the court final act in the matter.casey albertson,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.thus,when the parties treat a fully dispositive summary judgment order as if it were a final judgment,the requirement in federal rule of civil procedure that the judgment be set forth on a separate document can be waived.id.at citing bankers trust,at.
in this case,with the exception of plaintiffs later claim for attorney fees,see infra part c,and their state law claims,which proceeded to trial and are not before us on appeal,the district court order on november,disposed of all remaining claims as to all parties.and as they did with the district court order on may,the parties treated it as a final judgment.plaintiffs and the city defendants did dispute the final nature of the order before the district court.nevertheless,plaintiffs and the county defendants appealed to us as if the order were a final judgment,the city defendants defend against plaintiffs as if the order were a final judgment,and no party argues nor do we find that any appeal of the order was untimely.in these circumstances,we hold that plaintiffs waived the rule requirement for separate judgments.
heck bars all plaintiffs except whitaker from bringing suit.
throughout its order of november,the district court referred generally to plaintiffs,without differentiating their claims and circumstances.but the district court previously had denied plaintiffs motion to proceed as a class,a ruling that plaintiffs did not appeal.thus,we must determine the viability of each claim as to each plaintiff.see sacks office of foreign assets control,cir article iii standing requires the plaintiff to establish standing for each challenge he wishes to bring and each form of relief he seeks,cert.denied.ellis city of la mesa,cir e ach plaintiff must show that he personally has suffered some actual or threatened injury as a result of the putatively illegal conduct of the defendant.quoting valley forge christian coll.ams.united for separation of church state,d.
plaintiffs cite watt energy action educational foundation,d,and laub united states department of interior,cir,for the proposition that one plaintiff can create standing for all plaintiffs.however,watt and laub are inapposite.each concerned judicial review of an administrative action where all plaintiffs raised the same questions of fact and law.by contrast,this case does not concern a single administrative action,and the factual circumstances of plaintiffs are not identical.we turn then,to a consideration of each set of plaintiffs.
whitaker has standing,but only on the judicial deception claim.
whitaker alleges that defendants falsified the warrant application for the wiretap that intercepted his telephone call,and he challenges the constitutionality of the handoff procedure.he seeks damages under the judicial deception claim and both declaratory relief and damages under the handoff claim.defendants do not dispute the fact that whitaker call was intercepted.
whitaker judicial deception claim 
a seizure conducted pursuant to a warrant obtained by judicial deception violates the fourth amendment.butler elle,cir per curiam.defendants raise three defenses to whitaker claim of judicial deception,none of which we find persuasive.
first,the county defendants argue that whitaker waived this claim by failing to raise it in plaintiffs opening brief.although the organization of the brief could have been more clear,plaintiffs opening brief explicitly argued 
whitaker still has standing to assert the loss of privacy and seek money damages based on the illegal interception themselves.the district court found whitaker was not entitled to notice of the interception since he was neither named n or criminally charged.this ground,however,does not mean whitaker does not have standing to pursue his other claims.
whitaker judicial deception claim therefore was raised sufficiently in the opening brief.
second,both sets of defendants argue,and the district court held,that heck,d,bars all plaintiffs claims of judicial deception.as discussed in depth in part,heck bars a plaintiff from bringing suit under if a judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence.id.at.but whitaker never was arrested or charged with a crime,much less convicted of one.that being so,heck is inapplicable to his claims 
third,both sets of defendants argue that they are entitled to qualified immunity.qualified immunity is an entitlement not to stand trial or face the other burdens of litigation.the privilege is an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability.saucier katz,d emphasis omitted quoting mitchell forsyth,d.
when an individual sues a government official for violation of a constitutional right,the official is entitled to qualified immunity unless the facts alleged,viewed in the light most favorable to the individual asserting the injury,show that the official violated a constitutional right,and the contours of the right were sufficiently clear so that a reasonable official would understand that his conduct violated that right.id.at.when an individual sues a local government for violation of a constitutional right,the municipality is liable if the individual can establish that the local government had a deliberate policy,custom,or practice that was the moving force behind the constitutional violation he suffered.galen county of,cir quoting monell dep t of soc,d.a municipality can not be held liable under on a respondeat superior theory.monell,at.in this circuit,a claim of municipal liability under is sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss even if the claim is based on nothing more than a bare allegation that the individual officers conduct conformed to official policy,custom,or practice.galbraith county of santa clara,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
here,plaintiffs second amended complaint speaks in generalities regarding actions of defendants.but an individual defendant is stripped of qualified immunity only if he personally violated a plaintiff constitutional rights.baker mccollan,d a public official is liable under only if he causes the plaintiff to be subjected to deprivation of his constitutional rights.emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted.thus,we must examine the allegations against each defendant as they pertain to whitaker.
whitaker call was intercepted as part of the downey wiretap.the allegations in the complaint concerning the downey wiretap are defendant lewis falsified an affidavit for the warrant application defendants williams and garcetti authorized and approved the falsified application defendant demerjian was aware of,monitored,and approved the application the falsification of the application conformed to the official policy,custom,or practice of the city and county and the city and county failed to train these officials adequately.viewing the allegations of judicial deception as true,olsen idaho state bd.of,cir,whitaker alleges facts that show that defendants williams,lewis,garcetti,and demerjian violated his fourth amendment rights,and he alleges that those officials operated pursuant to an official policy,custom,or practice of the city and county of los angeles.
whitaker thus has alleged facts sufficient to make out a claim of judicial deception against defendants williams,lewis,garcetti,demerjian,the city of los angeles,and the county of los angeles.in addition,the contours of the fourth amendment right against judicial deception were clearly established at the time of the events at issue.see butler,at quoting hervey estes,cir,for the elements of a judicial deception claim.therefore,we hold that defendants williams,lewis,garcetti,demerjian,the city of los angeles,and the county of los angeles are not entitled to qualified immunity on whitaker claim of judicial deception.by contrast,the complaint does not implicate the remaining defendants in any way in the judicial deception of the downey wiretap and,consequently,the interception of whitaker telephone call.thus,the district court properly granted summary judgment on whitaker judicial deception claim to defendants harden,marco,livingston,hazell,and lustig.
whitaker handoff claim 
whitaker challenges the constitutionality of the handoff procedure,but the district court dismissed whitaker handoff claim in its order of may.although the court never entered judgment on the dismissal,whitaker proceeded as if he had been dismissed.he acknowledged the dismissal in plaintiffs opening brief,and he failed to dispute or challenge it.instead,he merely stated 
the district court found whitaker was not entitled to notice of the interceptions since he was neither named n or nominally charged.this ground,however,does not mean whitaker does not
