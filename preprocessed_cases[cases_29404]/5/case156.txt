this case calls on us to explore the limits of copyright protection for architectural works.plaintiffs appellants are james zalewski,an architect,and draftics,the company through which he does business collectively zalewski or plaintiff.zalewski asserts that he created and then licensed numerous designs for colonial homes to two construction companies he alleges that these companies and their contractors infringed his copyright in these designs by using them in ways the licenses did not permit and after the licenses had expired.zalewski also asserts that defendants actions violated the digital millennium copyright act dmca.defendants principally contend that their designs do not copy the protected elements of plaintiff designs.
the district court dismissed portions of plaintiff complaint and granted summary judgment to defendants on the remaining claims.the court also granted two defendants motions for attorney fees.plaintiff now challenges the dismissal of his complaint,the grant of summary judgment to defendants,the denial of summary judgment to him,and the award of attorney fees.we affirm the district court,in part,holding that any copying of plaintiff designs extended only to unprotected elements of his works,and plaintiff failed to plead a violation of the dmca.we also vacate,in part,holding that the district court applied the incorrect legal standard in awarding attorney fees,and remand for the district court to apply the correct standard.
background 
in the,plaintiff james zalewski was as an architect doing business through the firm draftics.during this period,he granted defendants builders and cillis builders cillis licenses to use several colonial home designs he had created.according to zalewski,after the licenses expired,hired defendant sofia engineering sofia and defendant deraven design drafting deraven and cillis hired deraven to customize his designs for their customers and continued marketing his designs,or customized versions thereof,without his consent.defendant cicero builders cicero built two houses using deraven designs that were allegedly based on plaintiff originals.
zalewski filed the first of these now consolidated actions in july in the united states district court for the northern district of new york,alleging that defendants infringed the copyright in his original designs.zalewski asserts that,in building the homes and customizing the designs,defendants copied the overall size,shape,and silhouette of his designs as well as the placement of rooms,windows,doors,closets,stairs,and other architectural features.in addition to his copyright infringement claims,zalewski asserts causes of action under the dmca,which prohibits,among other things,intentionally remov ing or alter ing any copyright management information.b.
in his original complaint,zalewski named as defendants the instant appellees,along with numerous other defendants including other builders,engineers,architects,real estate agents,and owners of the purportedly infringing homes.then,between september and december,zalewski voluntarily dismissed the vast majority of these defendants,and in october,he filed a second amended complaint,naming only the instant defendants the district court dismissed this complaint in august but granted leave to file a third amended complaint the operative complaint.
following this final complaint,defendants filed a number of motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment,inter alia,on the ground that the designs they employed or created lacked substantial similarity with zalewski.zalewski for summary judgment.over the next few months the district court sorted through the motions.after allowing some discovery,the court granted judgment to all remaining defendants and denied zalewski for summary judgment.still,the court permitted zalewski to file a fourth amended complaint to more clearly state his dmca claims.zalewski passed on the offer and the district court entered final judgment in july.
finally,in november,the court granted a motion by and cicero for expenses and attorney fees incurred defending against the first three complaints.zalewski now challenges the partial dismissal of his complaint,the grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants,the denial his motion for summary judgment,and the award of attorney fees.
discussion 
the copyright act,et,provides a list of categories of artistic works for which protection is available.the statute lists,for example,sound recordings,pantomimes and choreographic works,pictorial,graphic and sculptural works,and literary works.a.when congress passed the copyright act of,architectural works were not among the listed categories,and it was not clear to what extent buildings or architectural plans could be copyrighted.william patry,patry on copyright.in the,however,congress started the lengthy process of updating the copyright act in order to join the berne convention,an international agreement that governs copyright protection.see generally patry on copyright.among other things,the berne convention requires signatory nations to protect architectural works.see patry on copyright.thus,the act notwithstanding,the united states was compelled to clarify that architectural works are protectable under federal law.id.to this end,congress passed the architectural works copyright protection act of and added architectural works to the list of protectable material.id.
copyright infringement 
in order to make out a claim of copyright infringement for an architectural work or any work a plaintiff must establish three things that his work is protected by a valid copyright,that the defendant copied his work,and that the copying was wrongful.see arnstein porter,cir laureyssens idea,cir.the second and third elements copying and wrongful copying are often confused.this confusion is understandable in many cases any copying of a work is wrongful,and thus there is often no need to draw the distinction nonetheless,the distinction can be important.not every portion or aspect of a copyrighted work is given copyright law protection.copying these aspects of a work is not wrongful,and thus not all copying is wrongful.
an example is helpful.suppose a particular law professor has never met any of my law clerks and has never read any of their numerous law review articles if that professor independently composes a paragraph,which,by coincidence,is very similar to or indeed identical with a paragraph from one of their articles,the professor need not fear copyright liability.even though the works are similar,the professor has not copied,and,therefore,element two of the infringement cause of action actual copying is not satisfied.independent creation is a defense to copyright infringement.folio impressions,byer,cir.
likewise,one of my clerk articles may contain a lengthy quotation from a court opinion.the article is copyrighted,but the court opinion is in the public domain a subsequent author may copy the language from the court opinion directly out of the article without infringing my clerk copyright.this second author will have copied from my clerk,but not wrongfully.he took only what was in the public domain and therefore unprotected.see arnstein at.in this example,element two copying is satisfied,but element three wrongful copying is not.
confusion between elements two and three arises because a close similarity between two works is often relevant to proving both actual copying and wrongful copying.obviously,if two paragraphs are identical,a reasonable inference is that the second paragraph was copied from the first.if the copied paragraph contains only protected material,then this similarity is also strong evidence that the copying was wrongful.thus,in the first example above,the professor independently created a paragraph identical to my clerk,but given the striking similarity between the paragraphs,we might be forgiven for thinking that the professor copied,and copied wrongfully 
when an original work contains many un protected elements,however,a close similarity between it and a copy may prove only copying,not wrongful copying.this is because the similarity may derive only from these unprotected elements.for clarity,the term substantial similarity is properly reserved for similarity that exists between the protected elements of a work and another work.if two works are substantially similar,any copying was wrongful.see laureyssens,at.by contrast,similarity that relates to unprotected elements is probative only of copying not wrongful copying and is referred to as probative similarity.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
in this case,there is no dispute that plaintiff copyrights are valid element one.there is also substantial evidence that defendants copied from plaintiff designs.defendants possessed copies of plaintiff designs,and there are very strong resemblances between those designs and defendants final product probative similarity going to element two.accordingly,granting summary judgment to defendants on these elements would be inappropriate.this case turns on element three,wrongful copying.here,even assuming defendants copied,they took only the unprotected elements of plaintiff work.any copying was not wrongful and the district court correctly granted summary judgment 
substantial similarity and wrongful copying 
to determine whether two works are substantially similar and thus whether any copying was wrongful we usually apply the ordinary observer test and ask whether the ordinary observer,unless he set out to detect the disparities,would be disposed to overlook them,and regard their aesthetic appeal as the same.laureyssens,at internal quotation marks omitted.often,however,a work aesthetic appeal will be due largely to unprotected elements.in these cases,we must be more discerning,and ignor e those aspects of a work that are unprotectable as we apply the test,lest we conflate mere copying with wrongful copying.id.internal quotation marks omitted.here,there is no doubt that plaintiff designs,although copyrightable,are replete with uncopyrightable elements.
what aspects of zalewski designs are protectable a fundamental rule of copyright law is that it protects only original works of authorship,those aspects of the work that originate with the author himself.a.everything else in the work,the history it describes,the facts it mentions,and the ideas it embraces,are in the public domain free for others to draw upon.it is the peculiar expressions of that history,those facts,and those ideas that belong exclusively to their author.see b.thus,any author may draw from the history of peoples,but no one may copy from a history of the englishspeaking peoples any artist may portray the spanish civil war,but no one may paint another guernica and anyone may draw a cartoon mouse,but there can be only one mickey 
numerous doctrines separate protectable expression from elements of the public domain.for example,the doctrine of teaches that elements of a work that are indispensable,or at least standard,in the treatment of a given topic like cowboys,bank robbers,and shootouts in stories of the american west get no protection.hoehling universal city studios,cir.similarly,the merger doctrine instructs that some ideas can only be expressed in a limited number of ways single words or colors for example.when expression is so limited,idea and expression merge.expressions merged with ideas can not be protected,lest one author own the idea itself.morrissey procter gamble,cir.
the central question of this case is how to apply these and related doctrines to separate the protectable from the unprotectable in architectural works.defendants urge us to chart a different course.they view plaintiff designs as a compilation of various architectural features that individually and collectively do not merit copyright protection.they rely on the eleventh circuit case of intervest construction,canterbury estate homes,cir,and the supreme court doctrine governing compilations set out in feist publications,rural telephone service.
in feist,plaintiff asserted a copyright in its telephone book.feist,at.although the book was comprised of individually facts people phone numbers plaintiff argued that the compilation and arrangement of those facts should nonetheless be copyrightable to protect its investment in creating the phonebook.id.if its work could be freely appropriated,plaintiff argued,there would be no incentive to create similar works in the future.id.at.the supreme court rejected this argument and held that a copyright could subsist in an arrangement of individually uncopyrightable elements,but emphasized that the copyright act requires works to be original.id.at see also a.thus,in order for a compilation or arrangement to be worthy of copyright protection,the arrangement itself must be original.the supreme court held that standard compilations,like the feist plaintiff alphabetical listing,get no protection.
in intervest,the eleventh circuit applied this doctrine to architecture.it held that all copyrighted works are either creative,derivative,or compiled,that is original,variations on an original,or compilations of unoriginal material.intervest,at.according to intervest,each kind of work gets varying levels of protection.id.the court then relied on the similarity between the statutory definitions of compilation and architectural work to conclude that architectural works fall into the compiled category,and are thus entitled to only a thin copyright based solely on their arrangement and coordination of unoriginal and uncopyrightable elements.at.on facts similar to those here,the intervest court held that any copying of the plaintiff house designs went only to standard architectural features arranged in standard ways.in other words,any copying was not wrongful.id.
while we agree with the outcome in intervest,we disagree with its reasoning.creative,derivative,and compiled may be useful concepts in some cases,but we reject the idea that works always fall neatly into one of these categories.every kind of work at some level is a compilation,an arrangement of uncopyrightable common elements.id.no individual word is copyrightable,but the arrangement of words into a book is.no color is copyrightable,but the arrangement of colors on canvas is.likewise,doors and walls are not copyrightable,but their arrangement in a building is.some architectural designs,like that of a log cabin,will consist solely of standard features arranged in standard ways others,like the guggenheim,will include standard features,but also present something entirely new.architecture,in this regard,is like every art form.
moreover,we see little support in the statute for intervest use of categories.although the statutory definitions of compilations and architectural works both speak of an arrangement or to arrange and refer to standard features or preexisting material,architectural works and compilations are not the only works that are defined with reference to their discrete and perhaps uncopyrightable elements.for example,the statute defines literary works as words,numbers,or other symbols arranged in books,periodicals or other media sound recordings as a series of musical,spoken,or other sounds a computer program as a set of statements or instructions and motion pictures and audio visual works as series of related images.as we have explained,the merger doctrine will often render these discrete elements.softel dragon med.scientific commc ns,cir explaining that the words that constitute a literary work are not copyrightable,yet a collection of words may be 
labeling architecture a compilation obscures the real issue.every work of art will have some standard elements,which taken in isolation are,but many works will have original elements or original arrangements of elements.the challenge in adjudicating copyright cases is not to determine whether a work is a creative work,a derivative work,or a compilation,but to determine what in it originated with the author and what did not.intervest fails to do this.it compares the floor plans of the two houses,focusing only on the narrow arrangement and coordination of what it deems standard features and intuits that there was no copying of the arrangement.at.but it fails to provide any analysis of what made a feature standard and unprotectable.hence,we find it of little assistance here.
courts should treat architectural copyrights no differently than other copyrights.this is what congress envisioned,and it is an approach we have employed before,reprinted in.in attia society of the new york hospital,cir,for example,the plaintiff had been retained by new york hospital to design an expansion of its facility over fdr drive.the hospital rejected his preliminary sketches,but ultimately went with a similar design by another firm.the plaintiff admitted that his drawings were preliminary and generalized outline s of concepts.id.at.although there were some similarities between the plaintiff and the defendant designs,there were also significant differences.thus,we held that any copying went to unprotected ideas,concepts,rather than concrete expression.id.
in peter gaito architecture,llc simone development,cir,on a similar set of facts,we held that copying of architecture that was light,airy,and transparent,as well as design parameters and generalized notions of where to place functional elements,went only to ideas and not protected expression.finally,in sparaco lawler,matusky,skelly,engineers llp,cir,we held that although a construction site preparation plan was preliminary in the sense that it pertained to the early phases of construction,it was extremely detailed and thus more than a mere idea.
determining the boundaries of copyright protection in areas of creative expression,like architecture,is not something new.a number of our cases have applied copyright doctrines in other unusual contexts.in computer associates international,altai,cir,for example,we had to determine for the first time what elements of a computer program are protectable.to do so,we simply applied the usual copyright doctrines of merger,public domain,and to these new circumstances.id.at.for example,we held that the merger doctrine would apply when efficiency concerns so narrow the practical range of coding options as to make only one or two forms of expression workable id.at.similarly,we applied the doctrine of because in many instances it is virtually impossible to write a program without employing standard techniques.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.consequently,we held that coding dictated by mechanical specifications,industry design standards,market demands,and usual programing practices also did not get copyright protection.id.at.
all of these principles apply equally well to architecture.efficiency is an important architectural concern.any design elements attributable to building codes,topography,structures that already exist on the construction site,or engineering necessity should therefore get no protection.
there are in architecture.neoclassical government buildings,colonial houses,and modern office buildings are all recognized styles from which architects draw.elements taken from these styles should get no protection.likewise,there are certain market expectations for homes or commercial buildings.design features used by all architects,because of consumer demand,also get no protection.
our prior architecture cases support this approach.in sparaco,we held that there can be no copyright in a plan insofar as it merely represents the topography of a building site.at.topography is an fact.in attia we recognized that generalized notions of where to place functional elements,how to route the flow of traffic,and methods of construction are.at.architects can not claim that good engineering is original to them or at least can get no copyright protection for it finally,in gaito architecture,we held that there is no copyright in a building plan design parameters.at.constraints placed on an architect by the way her client plans to use the building do not originate with the architect.
the instant plans 
after considering these principles and reviewing the designs in question,we conclude that even if defendants copied zalewski plans,they copied only the unprotected elements of his designs.plaintiff principal argument is that defendants designs are so close to his that defendants must have infringed.he is correct that the designs are,in many respects,quite close,but this is not enough.it proves at most copying,not wrongful copying.
first,many of the similarities are a function of consumer expectations and standard house design generally.plaintiff can get no credit for putting a closet in every bedroom,a fireplace in the middle of an exterior wall,and kitchen counters against the kitchen walls.furthermore,the overall footprint of the house and the size of the rooms are design parameters dictated by consumer preferences and the lot the house will occupy,not the architect.see gaito,at.
finally,most of the similarities between plaintiff and defendants designs are features of all colonial homes,or houses generally.so long as plaintiff was seeking to design a colonial house,he was bound to certain conventions.he can not claim copyright in those conventions.great artists often express themselves through the vocabulary of existing forms.shakespeare wrote his sonnets brahms composed his hungarian dances and plaintiff designed his colonial houses.because we must preserve these forms for future artists,neither iambic pentameter,nor european folk motifs,nor clapboard siding are copyrightable.
plaintiff makes no attempt to distinguish those aspects of his designs that were original to him from those dictated by the form in which he worked.for example,zalewski claims that the front porches are the same design,size,and in the same location.reply br.but a door centered on the front of the house is typical of many homes,and colonials in particular moreover,there are subtle differences in the paneling,size,and framing of plaintiff and defendants doors.these differences are not great,but given the constraints of a colonial design,they are significant.the same is true of the windows and garage doors that plaintiff claims are identical.they are quite similar in location,size,and general design,but again,the similarities are due primarily to the shared colonial archetype.the window panes,shutters,and paneling all have subtle differences.likewise,the designs shared footprint and general layout are in keeping with the colonial style.there are only so many ways to arrange four bedrooms upstairs and a kitchen,dining room,living room,and study downstairs.beyond these similarities,plaintiff and defendants layouts are different in many ways.the exact placement and sizes of doors,closets,and countertops often differ as do the arrangements of rooms.
although he undoubtedly spent many hours on his designs,and although there is certainly something of plaintiff own expression in his work,as long as plaintiff adhered to a style his original contribution was slight his copyright very thin.only very close copying would have taken whatever actually belonged to plaintiff.see nihon keizai shimbun,comline bus.data,cir.copying that is not so close would and in this case did only capture the generalities of the style in which plaintiff worked and elements common to all homes.defendants houses shared plaintiff general style,but took nothing from his original expression.
plaintiff digital millennium copyright act claim 
in addition to his copyright infringement claim discussed above,plaintiff appears to bring several other claims,the nature of which is not clear.the dmca prohibits,among other things,intentionally remov ing or alter ing any copyright management information,such as the familiar copyright notice.b.in places,plaintiff obliquely suggests that defendants removed the copyright notices from his work,apparently by making photocopies of his drawings and omitting the copyright notices in the process.regardless of whether we construe this vague assertion as a dmca claim or a copyright infringement claim,it was properly dismissed on summary judgment because it had no support in the record and was never adequately alleged,despite the district court offering plaintiff an opportunity to amend his complaint to clearly allege photocopying and removal of copyright management information from supposedly photocopied works.since plaintiff failed to plead his dmca claims or provide any evidentiar
