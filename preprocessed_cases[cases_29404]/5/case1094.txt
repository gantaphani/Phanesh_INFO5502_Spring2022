virginia mason is a acute care hospital in seattle,washington.it employs between and registered nurses,all of whom are represented by wsna.because the elderly and patient population that virginia mason serves is at high risk for contracting the flu if exposed to it and for suffering severe and even fatal consequences if infected,the hospital has long recommended that its employees,including nurses,be vaccinated for influenza to reduce the chance of transmitting the virus from staff to patients.studies have shown that flu transmittal is prevalent in hospitals and other health care facilities because about half of those infected with influenza are asymptomatic and because as many as of health care workers continue to go to work even when experiencing flu symptoms.
virginia mason implemented a voluntary flu immunization program in under which flu vaccines were given free of charge to hospital staff,as a cart made the rounds to nursing stations,the hospital cafeteria,staff meetings,and other locations that employees frequented.although this voluntary program had some success,after six years it had achieved a staff immunization rate of only.as a result,the hospital decided in september of to make its flu immunization program mandatory.virginia mason then circulated a memo to all staff stating that,except in cases of a religious objection or documented vaccine allergy,proof of flu vaccination was going to become a fitness for duty requirement and that anyone who could not show proof of vaccination by january,would face termination unless he or she agreed to take flu prophylaxis medication at his or her own expense.virginia mason board of directors approved a corresponding amendment to the hospital fitness for duty policy in november of,adding the following language as conditions of hire or initial assignment,all prospective workforce members shall undergo annual influenza vaccination.
the hospital deferred implementation of the new mandatory policy to the flu season because of a vaccine shortage,but in the meantime wsna filed a grievance about the proposed policy under the cba,stating that,although receiving influenza vaccine is a good choice for most nurses,it is just choice and that receipt of any medical treatment is up to the individual.the grievance was submitted to an arbitrator who held a hearing on june.although the policy had not yet been enforced because the flu season had not begun,both parties authorized the arbitrator to determine prospectively whether,under the cba that was in place when the policy was first promulgated in september the hospital had the right to impose such a policy unilaterally without bargaining over it with representatives of the union.
in a written decision circulated on august,the arbitrator sustained wsna grievance and ordered that the mandatory flu immunization protocol be rescinded and that the hospital fitness for duty policy be amended to delete the requirement of annual flu vaccination.the arbitrator grounded his decision on his interpretation of the cba preamble and union recognition clause,which he read as requiring the hospital to bargain collectively with wsna representatives over all terms and conditions of employment.he further stated that because it was incorporated into the hospital fitness for duty policy,the flu vaccination requirement was a condition of both initial and continued employment and thus a mandatory subject for bargaining that did not fall within the cba management rights clause,which allowed hospital management to promulgate personnel policies and take other types of actions unilaterally.the arbitrator concluded that this management rights clause covered only operational decisions and did not extend to policies that directly affect ed terms and conditions of employment,as the mandatory immunization policy did.finally,the arbitrator analyzed the cba provision stating that all matters not specifically discussed during cba negotiations or included in the cba were waived as matters of mandatory bargaining,the zipper clause.the arbitrator determined that,even though the subject of flu immunization was not covered in the new cba adopted in november or in the discussions leading to its enactment,wsna filing of a grievance over the immunization policy was sufficient negotiation or discussion of the issue such that it was not waived.
virginia mason filed an application with the united states district court for the western district of washington under section of the national labor relations act,seeking to vacate the arbitral award on the ground that the arbitrator exceeded his authority by failing to apply relevant terms of the cba and by reading additional terms into that agreement that were not part of its plain language,as well as on the ground that the award was irrational and contrary to public policy because it prevented the hospital from protecting patient health and thus performing its core mission.both parties filed motions for summary judgment.the district court granted wsna motion and denied virginia mason motion,holding that the arbitrator did not exceed his authority,that his interpretations of relevant provisions of the cba were plausible,and that virginia mason did not show any explicit,and dominant public policy that was contravened by the arbitrator decision.as part of its motion for summary judgment,wsna also sought an award of attorneys fees as a sanction for virginia mason having brought the federal suit in bad faith,but the district court held that there was no evidence of bad faith and denied this aspect of wsna motion.this appeal and followed.
we recognize virginia mason commendable desire to protect its vulnerable patients from infection with the flu.we also recognize,as the arbitrator did,the impressive list of health authorities and experts who recommend that health care workers be immunized because they are in a highly contagious environment and deal with patients who are at high risk of contracting the flu.at the same time,we recognize that the arbitrator,as the party chosen by the hospital and the union to resolve grievances under their cba,is entitled to considerable deference and that his decision in this matter may be vacated only if it failed to draw its essence from the cba itself,united steelworkers of am.enter.wheel car,d,or if it violated an explicit,well defined,and dominant public policy.associated coal united mine workers of,d internal quotation marks omitted.we conclude that neither of these standards for vacation is met here.
virginia mason points to three provisions in the cba that it claims permitted the hospital to implement its mandatory immunization policy without first bargaining with wsna over it the patient care priority clause,the management rights clause,and the zipper clause.we may vacate the arbitrator award based on its treatment of any of these clauses only if he ignored their plain language even if we were convinced that the arbitrator misread the contract or erred in interpreting it such a conviction would not be a permissible ground
