the florida department of financial services department appeals an order from the circuit court of the fourth judicial circuit granting john freeman motion for payment of attorney fees in excess of the statutory maximum for defense counsel representation of freeman for the filing of a petition for writ of certiorari to the united states supreme court.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.for the reasons explained below,we vacate the trial court order and remand for an evidentiary hearing on the issue of attorney fees pursuant to section,florida statutes.
this case involves the payment of attorney fees to a registry attorney in excess of the amounts provided for by statute.john freeman,a prisoner under a sentence of death,appealed to this court the trial court denial of his motion for postconviction relief.after briefing and oral argument on the appeal by another lawyer,the trial court appointed attorney frank tassone tassone to represent freeman.ten days after this court affirmed the trial court denial of postconviction relief,tassone filed a motion for extension of time to file a motion for rehearing.a motion for rehearing was filed,arguing in substantial part that freeman was entitled to relief based on ring arizona,d.we denied the motion for rehearing,and thereafter tassone filed a petition for writ of certiorari in the united states supreme court based on the ring issue he raised in freeman motion for rehearing.the petition for writ of certiorari was denied.
after certiorari relief was denied,tassone filed a motion in the circuit court for attorney fees and miscellaneous expenses pursuant to section,florida statutes.the motion sought fees and costs for work performed and expenses incurred on and after november,that is,for work on the petition for writ of certiorari.tassone sought a total of in fees and costs.the department argued that the amount requested was unreasonable and should be limited to the statutory amount of plus applicable costs.see g.stat.tassone argued that because he became involved in freeman case after the postconviction motion was denied,he did not have a working knowledge of the case,and therefore had to review forty boxes of record in order to adequately represent freeman.the trial court granted tassone motion and ordered the department to pay the fees and costs.the department filed this appeal,alleging that the circuit court departed from the essential requirements of law by refusing to apply the maximum fee limit prescribed by the statute.
law and analysis 
section,florida statutes,governs the payment of fees to appointed counsel in postconviction capital proceedings,and is the exclusive means of compensating a attorney who represents a capital defendant.id.section outlines the maximum amount an attorney is entitled to be compensated at each stage of the postconviction process.section g is particularly applicable in this case and provides 
at the conclusion of the capital defendant postconviction capital collateral proceedings in state court,the attorney is entitled to per hour,up to a maximum of,after filing a petition for writ of certiorari in the supreme court of the united states.
in addition,the attorney may request up to a maximum of for approved incidental costs,such as investigators.see id.the attorney may also be reimbursed up to for miscellaneous expenses,such as copying and expert witness fees.see id.since,this particular subsection has provided that expenses exceeding that are incurred under extraordinary circumstances may be paid at the court discretion.id.
tassone submitted to the department two invoices for fees and costs associated with the preparation and filing of the petition for writ of certiorari,totaling.the department responded that the statute authorized payment of only for attorney fees.tassone set the issue for hearing,and the matter was heard telephonically.during the hearing,tassone explained to the judge that he had to review the entire record because he did not represent freeman during the trial,appeal,or postconviction process.tassone explained that at that time the retroactive application of ring was a relevant issue and he had to educate himself to assess the applicability of such a claim in freeman case.the judge accepted tassone explanation for incurring excessive time and expenses and concluded that the hours billed were reasonable.the judge granted tassone motion for fees and costs in its entirety.
this court has held that it is within the trial judge discretion to grant fees beyond the statutory maximum to registry counsel in capital collateral cases when extraordinary or unusual circumstances exist.olive maas,so d.in olive,this court held that fees in excess of the statutory cap are not always awarded to registry counsel in capital collateral cases however,registry counsel is not foreclosed from requesting excess compensation should he or she establish that,given the facts and circumstances of a particular case,compensation within the statutory cap would be confiscatory of his or her time,energy and talent and violate the principles outlined in makemson and its progeny.see also makemson martin county,so d.
makemson is the seminal case for determining whether appointed counsel in capital cases is limited to the compensation provided within the statutory schemes set forth by the legislature.at issue in makemson was the constitutionality of a statute that set a fee schedule for compensation to attorneys who represented capital defendants at the trial and during direct appeal stages.this court held that the statute was not unconstitutional on its face,but further indicated the statute could be unconstitutional if applied in such a manner as to curtail the court inherent power to ensure the adequate representation of the criminally accused.makemson,so d at.this court then explained that the trial court may depart from the statutory fee caps and award excess fees in extraordinary and unusual cases to ensure that an attorney who has served the public by defending the accused is not compensated in an amount which is confiscatory of his or her time,energy and talents.id.at.inadequate compensation could create an economic disincentive for appointed counsel to spend more than a minimum amount of time on the case and discourage competent attorneys from agreeing to represent indigent capital defendants.in effect,such a lack of competent attorneys could jeopardize an indigent defendant constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel.while the defendant right to effective representation was the main focus of the makemson decision,this court nonetheless reasoned that counsel right to fair compensation was inextricably intertwined with that right.id.at.
the makemson rationale,that compensation of counsel and the effectiveness of counsel are inextricably intertwined,was applied in the capital collateral context in olive.that rationale is also expressed in the legislative staff analysis to chapter,laws of florida,which clearly articulates the legislature concern with the fee caps in capital collateral cases.the legislative history states specifically that where unusual or extraordinary circumstances exist,the fees caps established by,and increased by the provisions of this bill,do not prevent a court from ordering payment above the maximum authorized.comm.on crim,cs for sc,staff analysis march,on file with the comm.see also olive,so d at arbelaez butterworth,so d,anstead,specially concurring.
in this case,the department does not contest the application of makemson and its progeny to this collateral proceeding.the department argues that tassone did not adequately establish that unusual or extraordinary circumstances sufficiently existed in order to warrant compensation in excess of the statutory cap.the trial court granted tassone request for fees in full after hearing a brief argument by counsel and over the objection by the state.the trial court found that the statutory maximum was not a sufficient amount for attorney fees incurred in the preparation and filing of the petition for writ of certiorari and the reply brief in opposition.the trial court ordered the department to pay tassone the total amount of in fees and miscellaneous expenses and cited to section a d,florida statutes.in addition,the trial judge commented that tassone has an excellent reputation and he was confident that tassone reviewed the documents he said were necessary in order to represent his client competently.however,no experts testified on behalf of counsel regarding such things as the necessity to research and review any particular portion of the record for the preparation of the petition for writ of certiorari,what would have been reasonable in these circumstances,or whether this case presented an extraordinary or unusual situation requiring fees in excess of the statutory amount.
because the trial court decision in a case involving attorney fees is based upon findings of fact,it will not be disturbed if supported by competent,substantial evidence.see,sheppard white,city of jacksonville,so d,finding competent,substantial evidence supported the award of fees by the trial court philip padovano,florida appellate practice,at ed.thus,we consider whether there is competent,substantial evidence to support the trial court decision in this case.
while an attorney assigned to represent a death row inmate for the first time at the federal appeal stage may face extraordinary or unusual circumstances requiring many hours of work to justify payment in excess of the statutory limits,the attorney has the burden of establishing facts in support of such an award.the record in this case,however,provides no evidence upon which the judge could rely to determine if extraordinary or unusual circumstances existed to support an award of excess fees.the record in this case consists of only nine pages comprising the motion for an order of payment of attorney fees,the notice of hearing,the order on the motion for payment of attorney fees,and the notice of appeal.while the transcript of the hearing includes arguments of counsel,no sworn testimony was presented.there is no discussion of what was contained in the boxes of record or how many volumes pertained to postconviction proceedings as opposed to those proceedings on direct appeal.the billings were not verified,there is no testimony regarding the propriety of the time submitted in the billings,and there is no testimony from any expert as to the extraordinary or unusual aspects of tassone representation.
because there is no competent,substantial evidence in the record to support an award of fees in excess of the statutory amounts,we remand this case to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing on this issue.
tassone argues that the statutory scheme for the payment of attorney fees is unconstitutional as applied to him.this argument was never raised below and can not be raised for the first time on appeal.see turner state,so d,dca holding that constitutional challenge to a statute made for the first time on appeal would not warrant reversal of trial court ruling.
tassone also argues that the statutory fee cap under section is unconstitutional on its face because all death cases are extraordinary and unusual and attorney fees should not be capped.see,white bd.of county comm rs of pinellas county,so d,finding that all capital cases by their very nature can be considered extraordinary and unusual and arguably justify an award of attorney fees in excess of the current statutory fee cap see also state johnson,so d,a facial challenge to a statute constitutional validity may be raised for the first time on appeal only if the error is fundamental.however,this court has determined that statutory fee caps are not facially unconstitutional.see olive,so d at makemson,so d at.the mere fact that the case is one where the death penalty could be or has been imposed does not render the statutory limits facially unconstitutional.
conclusion 
while we appreciate the time it takes to effectively prepare for a trial,prepare an appeal,prepare and present a motion for postconviction relief,or prepare a petition for writ of certiorari in capital cases,and while we understand that some cases merit payment in excess of the statutory limits,the justification for exceeding those limits must be demonstrated by competent,substantial evidence in the record.tassone justification in support of exceeding the statutory limits was incomplete.thus,we conclude that the trial court order granting freeman motion for attorney fees in excess of the statutory limit is not supported by competent,substantial evidence.we therefore reverse the trial court order and remand this matter for a full evidentiary hearing.
it is so ordered.
this case demonstrates an unanticipated consequence of the pilot program that eliminates funding for the office of the capital collateral regional counsel for the northern region of florida the costs of replacing counsel at an arbitrary point in the proceedings.
rather than permit former counsel to continue to represent freeman when the office was defunded,the trial court appointed new counsel the new counsel seeks in legal fees and costs for filing a motion for rehearing in this court and a petition for a writ of certiorari on a discrete issue in the united states supreme court.counsel asserts,in explaining the fee request,that this amount is justified because he was unfamiliar with the case when he was appointed and had to review forty boxes of record to adequately represent freeman.majority op.at.had freeman counsel continued to represent him,either as part of that agency or as registry counsel,the state would not now face a demand by new counsel for such exorbitant fees.
the enactment creating the pilot program and eliminating funding for was originally limited to a single fiscal year ending july.see,laws of.the legislature subsequently gave the project an indefinite extension and directed the auditor general to provide a performance review before the legislative session.see,laws of codified in,laws of.the performance review is intended to determine the effectiveness and efficiency of using attorneys from the registry compared to the capital collateral regional counsels,and at a minimum,shall include comparisons of the timeliness and costs of the pilot and the counsels.id.
this case clearly implicates considerations of efficiency,timeliness,and costs.it shows that when a new attorney displaces ccrc,he or she must take time to become familiar with the case,and will likely seek to be compensated accordingly.the change in counsel thus decreases efficiency,increases costs,and may delay proceedings.substitution of private counsel for a state agency can be especially problematic if it occurs at or near the time a death warrant is signed.a related concern is a loss in accountability when a state agency is replaced by private counsel.only one registry attorney,often a solo practitioner,is assigned to each case.see.stat.providing that no more than one attorney may be appointed and compensated to represent a defendant,but allowing counsel to designate an assistant.in contrast,once ccrc is assigned to a capital defendant,the office remains responsible for that individual representation regardless of a turnover in personnel.thus,there is institutional accountability to the court for postconviction representation.
although it will be difficult for an auditor to measure effectiveness,quality of representation is a significant concern in a system staffed solely by counsel who are willing to sign up for the registry,knowing its fee caps.under section,florida statutes,attorneys who join the registry must agree to abide by its terms and conditions,including the ceilings on fees in section,florida statutes.some attorneys regard compensation under these caps to be inadequate under the circumstances of capital postconviction representation.see,state demps,so d,addressing appeal of fee award by attorney who claimed he was entitled to compensation at rate higher than specified in section.further,for the registry to be a viable system for competent postconviction representation,counsel should have a centralized source of support for research,investigation,and pooling of information.this system is already built into the ccrcs.
although there is no constitutional right to effective assistance of postconviction counsel,the credibility of our death penalty system depends in large part on the quality of the attorneys who undertake the representation.in addition,the public has a strong interest in representation by the attorneys provided to indigent capital defendants in postconviction proceedings.i urge the legislature to take the factors discussed herein into consideration in assessing whether the results of the experiment warrant that the pilot program be extended,expanded,or concluded.
i agree to remand this case because the record provides no evidence upon which the judge could rely to determine if extraordinary or unusual circumstances existed to support an award of excess fees.majority op.at.i write separately,however,in an attempt to offer some guidance on remand about what constitutes extraordinary or unusual circumstances.
when we last considered this issue,we held that registry counsel may be awarded excess fees when compensation within the statutory cap would be confiscatory of his or her time,energy and talent.olive maas,so d.unlike the situation in olive,however,in this case counsel signed a contract with the department of financial services in which he agreed to the statutory fee schedule.i do not see how it would be confiscatory to hold him to the foreseeable consequences of his bargain.thus,any compensation above the statutory amount should be for work that was unforeseeable when he signed the contract.moreover,given that the statutory caps at least presumptively apply,even if extraordinary or unusual circumstances justify additional fees,the benchmark for those fees should continue to be the statutory caps,not the market rate for the work performed.
i will first summarize our relevant precedents,up to and including olive.i will then explain how the attorney contract with the department distinguishes this case from olive.finally,i will apply the reasoning in olive to derive an unforeseeability requirement and a rule that awards above the statutory caps should be calculated with the caps,not the market rate,as the benchmark.
a.the precedents 
we first opened the door to compensation in makemson martin county,so d.there,an attorney who represented an indigent criminal defendant in a murder trial sought compensation above the applicable statutory caps.see.stat.we held that the caps,while not facially unconstitutional,could be unconstitutional when applied to cases involving extraordinary circumstances and unusual representation.makemson,so d at.in such cases,we said,the caps threaten to interfere with the defendant sixth amendment right to counsel and with the judiciary inherent power to ensure the adequate representation of the criminally accused.id.at.thus,we concluded that a trial court may depart from the caps when necessary to prevent an attorney from being compensated in an amount which is confiscatory of his or her time,energy and talents.id.at.
three years later,we announced that virtually every capital case fits within makemson standard and justifies the court exercise of its inherent power to award attorney fees in excess of the current statutory fee cap.see white bd.of county comm rs,so d.as we explained,the statutory fees for capital cases were at that time unrealistic,amounting to little more than token compensation.id.at.to protect the sixth amendment rights of capital defendants,we authorized additional fees in most capital cases.
both makemson and white involved the representation of criminal defendants at trial and on direct appeal,where they have a constitutional right to counsel.in remeta state,so d,however,we extended this reasoning to executive clemency proceedings,without reach ing the question of whether an indigent,prisoner has a state or federal constitutional right to counsel in that setting.id.at.we explained that,regardless of whether counsel is constitutionally required,this state has established a right to counsel in clemency proceedings for death penalty cases,and this statutory right necessarily carries with it the right to have effective assistance of counsel.id.at.because the statutory fee cap threatened to undermine that right,see.stat,we held that courts could award extra compensation when necessary to ensure effective representation and to prevent confiscatory compensation of counsel.remeta,so d at.
then,in olive maas,so d at,we went even further.the issue there was whether trial courts may award more than the statutory fee caps to attorneys representing defendants in the postconviction context.of course,we have held many have reiterated only just prisoners enjoy no constitutional right to such counsel.see,zack state,so d,under florida and federal law,a defendant has no constitutional right to effective collateral counsel.that right is purely statutory.nevertheless,by a vote of four to three,this court held that even in such cases attorneys may be awarded fees above the caps where unusual or extraordinary circumstances exist.olive,so d at.
the majority in olive did not base its decision on any constitutional right to postconviction counsel.instead,it interpreted the rather,the legislative history of the allowing for fees exceeding the caps.the statute provided that t he fee and payment schedule in this section is the exclusive means of compensating a attorney who represents a capital defendant in collateral proceedings.stat.supp.yet the majority determined from the legislative history and staff analysis that the legislature intended to accommodate an implied exception.olive,so d at.thus,it held that registry counsel is not forever foreclosed from seeking extra compensation should he or she establish that compensation within the statutory cap would be confiscatory of his or her time,energy and talent.id.
i question this court interpretation of the statute in olive.it appears to elevate the staff analysis over the statute plain text.as i have previously explained,
w here the language is clear,courts need no other aids for determining legislative intent.even if the language were not clear,legislative staff analyses add nothing to an investigation of legislative intent.staff analyses are not written by legislators but,as the name implies,by is unelected employees another problem with relying on a staff analysis is that no evidence exists that any of the legislators who voted for the proposed bill even read the analysis,much less agreed with it the fact is that even if all the legislators read the staff analysis of a bill,they could disagree with it and still vote in favor of the bill itself.the only text with which a legislator must agree is the text of the bill itself.
am.home assurance plaza materials,so d,cantero,concurring in part and dissenting in part citations omitted.
thus,i am not convinced that olive was correct.however,because the parties in this case have not asked us to overrule or recede from it,i do not address that issue.nevertheless,given that olive represents an remedy,and given that the statutory caps should mean something,the award of fees exceeding the cap should be determined with the caps in mind.they should be the benchmark.the exception should be narrow,applied rarely,and exceed the caps only to the extent necessary to prevent confiscat ing the attorney time,energy and talent.olive,so d at.
b.the contract 
this case involves the same legal issue as olive,but is based on different circumstances.in olive,the attorney refused to sign the standard contract for registry counsel,fearing it would handcuff him to the statutory fee schedule.the contract tracks the language in section,and incorporates the entire compensation scheme by reference.olive,so d at.signing the contract is a statutory requirement 
each private attorney who is appointed by the court to represent a capital defendant must enter into a contract with the chief financial officer the chief financial officer shall develop the form of the contract,function as contract manager,and enforce performance of the terms and conditions of the contract.by signing such contract,the attorney certifies that he or she intends to continue the representation under the term
