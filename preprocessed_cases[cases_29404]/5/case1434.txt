this has been a long and arduous journey for the parties in this litigation,but this should be the final curtain of the saga,which commenced in with the filing of the patent application that eventually matured as patent patent.in this patent infringement action,gore associates,gore appeals the united states district court for the district of arizona judgment,after a jury verdict,that found the patent willfully infringed and not invalid for improper inventorship,anticipation,obviousness,or lack of written description,and awarded enhanced damages,attorneys fees and costs,and an ongoing royalty in favor of bard peripheral vascular,and david goldfarb collectively,bard.bard peripheral vascular,gore,final judgment,cv,ecf.because we find that there is substantial evidence to support the jury verdict of no improper inventorship,anticipation,obviousness,or lack of written description and of willful infringement,and the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding enhanced damages,attorneys fees and costs,and an ongoing royalty,we affirm the judgment 
background 
the technology in this case involves prosthetic vascular grafts that are fabricated from polytetrafluoroethylene eptfe.patent ll.the grafts are used to bypass or replace blood vessels to assure adequate and balanced blood flow to particular parts of the body.id.ll.
in the early,when the invention was made,eptfe was produced as tubes that had a structure consisting of solid nodes of ptfe connected by thin ptfe fibrils.the distance between the nodes is referred to as the fibril length or the internodal distance.this distance is important to the suitability of the eptfe material for use as a vascular graft.
cooper goldfarb cooper ii,see also cooper goldfarb cooper i.gore sells eptfe under the brand name gore cooper i,at.
the patent,entitled prosthetic vascular graft,was filed on october,and issued nearly twentyeight years later on august.patent at.the patent discloses a graft formed from a small bore tube of polytetrafluoroethylene which has been heated,expanded and sintered so as to have a microscopic superstructure of uniformly distributed nodes interconnected by fibrils id.ll.a major objective of the claimed invention is providing a homogeneously porous vascular prosthesis with small nodes interconnected by extremely fine fibrils to form an open superstructure which will allow uniform,controlled transmural cellular ingrowth and thereby assure the establishment and maintenance of a thin,viable neointima as well as firm structural integration of the graft into the body.id.ll.
bard asserts that gore infringes claims to of the patent,of which independent claim is representative 
an artificial vascular prosthesis comprising expanded,porous,polytetrafluorocthylene sic having a microstructure consisting of nodes interconnected by fibrils which permits tissue,wherein an average distance between nodes is not less than about microns and is small enough to prevent transrmural sic blood flow.
id.ll emphases added.claims to,which depend from claim,claim an upper limit on the average distance between the nodes from about to about microns.id.ll.independent claims to claim that the average distance between the nodes is about to about microns.claims and also specify a wall thickness greater than about millimeters and less than about millimeters.id.ll.claim further adds the limitation of an average density in the range of between about and grams per millimeter.id.ll.
the prior art at issue in this appeal includes two articles,one by jay volder and one by hiroshi matsumoto.see jay volder et,a v shunts created in new ways,transactions,american society for artificial internal organs,vol.xix,at volder matsumoto et,a new vascular prosthesis for a small caliber artery,surgery,vol,at matsumoto.both publications were considered by the examiner at the united states patent and trademark office pto during the prosecution of the patent and are listed on the first page of the.patent at.
the factual history of this case has been discussed in a previous decision of this court 
peter cooper was the plant manager of gore flagstaff,arizona facility,and primarily was involved in making eptfe tubes.cooper provided the tubes to various researchers,who evaluated their suitability for vascular grafts.during the course of his work,cooper discovered that material from eptfe tubes with fibril lengths of about to microns was suitable for use in vascular grafts.
during the same period,goldfarb was director of research and clinical staff surgeon at the arizona heart institute ahi,and was conducting research on artificial vascular grafts.between february and april of,cooper sent goldfarb a number of eptfe tubes to use in his research.although cooper intended that goldfarb use the tubes for vascular grafts,cooper did not have any right of control over goldfarb research,and goldfarb was not required to use the tubes supplied by cooper or to perform his experiments in any particular way.
goldfarb conducted a series of experiments involving grafts made from the tubes cooper provided.on june,the graft labeled rf,which came from lot provided by cooper,was determined to be a successful implant in a dog.
cooper ii,at.
the patent was previously the subject of an interference proceeding between cooper and goldfarb at the board of patent appeals and interferences board,interference interference.on april,cooper filed patent application claiming the use of eptfe as a vascular graft.cooper i,at.on october,goldfarb filed patent application also claiming the use of eptfe as a vascular graft.id.at.on september,the pto declared an interference between the two patent applications with cooper as the senior party and goldfarb as the junior party.id.the only count,which is the board description of the interfering subject matter that sets the scope of admissible proofs on priority,from the interference relevant to this case states 
an artificial vascular prosthesis comprising expanded,porous,polytetraflouroethylene sic having a microstructure consisting of nodes interconnected by fibrils which permits tissue ingrowth,wherein said fibrils are above about microns up to microns in length.
cooper i,at.the board awarded priority of invention to goldfarb because goldfarb established that he had reduced the invention to practice before cooper.id.at.
this court affirmed the board determination that goldfarb had conceived the invention and reduced it to practice by july of.id.at.this court also,however,determined that the board erred by failing to consider whether goldfarb efforts inure to the benefit of cooper,and remanded the case for the board to consider that issue.id.at.
on appeal for the second time,this court explained that cooper conceived the invention,but only after sending to goldfarb the tubes which goldfarb used to conceive the invention and reduce it to practice.cooper ii,at.cooper could not have known that the tubes sent to goldfarb met the claim limitations when he sent them.id.additionally,cooper neither communicated his finding to goldfarb before goldfarb made the invention nor did he exercise diligence in an attempt to reduce the invention to practice.id.at.therefore,this court found that cooper has not established that he contemporaneously appreciated that the material tested by goldfarb met the fibril length limitation of the interference count,and has not established that goldfarb knowledge of the material fibril lengths inured to his benefit.id.at.accordingly,this court affirmed the board decision that the relationship between cooper and goldfarb was such that goldfarb work did not inure to cooper benefit and priority of invention was awarded to goldfarb.id.at.

gore contends that the jury verdict on the inventorship,anticipation,obviousness,written description,and willful infringement issues was not supported by substantial evidence and the district court abused its discretion regarding the issues of enhanced damages,attorneys fees and costs,and ongoing royalties.for the following reasons,we disagree.
inventorship is a question of law that we review de novo,based on underlying facts which we review for clear error.of pittsburgh of the commonwealth of higher educ.hedrick.when this court reviews the denial of motions for judgment as a matter of law on mixed question s of law and fact given to a jury,we must sustain the jury conclusion unless the jury was not presented with substantial evidence to support any set of implicit findings sufficient under the law to arrive at its conclusion.eli lilly aradigm,citation omitted calling substantial evidence that which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.
section of title of the united states code states that w hen an invention is made by two or more persons jointly,they shall apply for patent jointly.the inventors as named in an issued patent are presumed to be correct.thus,a party alleging non joinder must meet the heavy burden of proving its case by clear and convincing evidence.natron schukra,citations omitted.a person is a joint inventor only if he contributes to the conception of the claimed invention.eli lilly,at citations omitted.conception requires that the inventor appreciate that which he has invented.invitrogen clontech.joint inventorship,therefore,arises only when collaboration or concerted effort occurs that is,when the inventors have some open line of communication during or in temporal proximity to their inventive efforts.eli lilly,at.additionally,a joint inventor must 
contribute in some significant manner to the conception or reduction to practice of the invention,make a contribution to the claimed invention that is not insignificant in quality,when that contribution is measured against the dimension of the full invention,and do more than merely explain to the real inventors concepts the current state of the art.
pannu iolab.therefore,in order to prevail at trial,gore had to prove by clear and convincing evidence that cooper contributed to goldfarb conception of the internodal distances in a significant way.
the jury found that the patent was not invalid for improper inventorship by finding that cooper and goldfarb were not joint inventors of the claimed invention verdict form,at.the district court determined that gore failed to present sufficient evidence to show that a reasonable jury could not have found the patent valid notwithstanding gore claims of improper inventorship and denied gore motion for judgment as a matter of law on the issue.post trial i,d at.on appeal,gore argues that cooper contributions to the conception of the invention were significant and make him a joint inventor.we hold that bard presented substantial evidence for the jury to find that goldfarb and cooper were not joint inventors because cooper did not communicate to goldfarb that the internodal distance was the key to creating successful grafts,and,therefore,the jury could have reasonably concluded that cooper collaboration with goldfarb did not contribute to the conception of the invention in a significant manner.
in an appeal from the interference,this court determined that 
the evidence do es not indicate that cooper expected that the eptfe material that was to be tested by goldfarb had the fibril lengths required by the interference count,or that cooper submitted the material to goldfarb for a determination of its fibril lengths.as noted in cooper i,cooper was focusing on the porosity of the material at that time,not its fibril length.cooper i,at.indeed,cooper admits that,even after he conceived the importance of fibril length,he did not convey that information to goldfarb.he also admits that he did not ask goldfarb to use grafts with fibril lengths required by the interference count,or to determine the fibril lengths of successful grafts.while cooper was not required to communicate his conception to goldfarb,cooper i,at,his failure to convey any information or requests regarding fibril length prevents goldfarb determination of the fibril lengths of the material from inuring to his benefit.
n o evidence of record indicates that cooper knew the fibril lengths of the material tested by goldfarb at the relevant time,prior to goldfarb reduction to practice in.
cooper ii,at.this lack of communication and utter lack of understanding of what would make a successful graft is substantial evidence in support of the jury verdict implicitly finding that cooper contribution was insignificant.
although gore argues that cooper conveyed the internodal distance physically by making and sending the invention embodiment to goldfarb,it admits that cooper did not verbally convey the internodal distance.appellant br.additionally,goldfarb testified at trial that the various tubes gore sent to him looked the same to the naked eye,but each tube was different,and that each individual tube microstructure varied along the length of the tube.goldfarb personally selected the most promising sections for implantation.id.goldfarb also testified that after an initial set of implantations,he gave a gore employee specifications of what might make a more successful graft,including specific internodal distances.therefore,the jury could have reasonably determined that physically conveying the undifferentiated tubes to goldfarb was an insignificant contribution to the conception of the importance of internodal distance when weighed against goldfarb personal selections and directions.
as further evidence of the insignificance of cooper contribution,cooper previously testified in the interference that he did not provide goldfarb information about the gore tex structure in any great detail when they met.he also testified that he later resorted to taking goldfarb slides to learn what variables in the grafts were important in producing good results.also in the interference,former gore employee richard mendenhall testified that there was no discussion of substance at a meeting with cooper and goldfarb,and that it was goldfarb who explained to cooper the characteristics that were ideal for the synthetic artery,not the other way around.finally,in the present case,goldfarb testified that,with the exception of a statistician suggestion to randomize the placement of certain grafts,no one from gore gave him any instruction regarding how to set up his experiments,including what types of grafts to use,what characteristics to look for,and what range of variables would produce a successful graft.notably,gore employee dan detton previous deposition testimony was read into the record stating that cooper never made grafts,never extruded tubing that was used to make grafts,and did not contribute to the design of the structure that goldfarb made.when asked if cooper contributed to the design of the structure made by goldfarb,detton said you could generally count on whatever he said as being probably degrees from what was correct.
in addition to evidence of cooper failure to communicate the internodal distance to goldfarb,or make any contribution to the conception of internodal distance,bard also presented evidence of goldfarb control over his experiments.a gore trip report stated that goldfarb is starting an evaluation of synthetic materials suitable for a bypass graft and is willing to include gore tex in his study.emphasis added a february,letter from cooper to goldfarb explained that enclosed were a variety of sizes of goretex tubes for your animal artery prosthetic experiments.emphasis added.also,goldfarb testified that cooper had very little contact with him,and that it was mendenhall who first contacted him regarding the use of eptfe in medicine.finally,cooper himself wrote letters to another doctor stating that a ny success at this point in time is the direct result of the ahi,goldfarb,efforts,and that the ahi has,in a,productive fashion,described,with a fair degree of accuracy,the specific structure necessary for a viable vascular graft.j.
thus,although gore attempts to recast its argument from inurement in the interference to joint inventorship in the present case,gore argument remains unchanged and there is still no evidence that cooper either recognized or appreciated the critical nature of the internodal distance and communicated that key requirement to goldfarb before goldfarb reduced the invention to practice.accordingly,substantial evidence supports the jury finding that the patent is not invalid for improper inventorship,and the district court did not err in denying gore motion for judgment as a matter of law on the issue.
it is apparent that the dissent reaches its opposite conclusion by ignoring the applicable standard of review and giving insufficient weight to the jury verdict.by citing only to the limited facts that support gore case and relying on a mistaken understanding of the invention at issue,the dissent fails to disregard all evidence favorable to the moving party that the jury is not required to believe and intentionally,but impermissibly,substitute s its view of the evidence for that of the jury.johnson,at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
as to the facts,the dissent states that cooper conceived the invention and gore disclosed it to goldfarb,dissent at,while goldfarb did little more than test the material at cooper direction.dissent at.it states that gore possessed the invention before goldfarb,dissent at,and credits gore argument that cooper was at least a joint inventor.dissent at.the dissent concludes that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence.dissent at.ignoring the problem inherent in the dissent misstatement of the applicable standard of review,we note that this court has previously concluded that goldfarb independently conceived and reduced the invention to practice.cooper i,at.cooper conceived of the invention only after sending the tubes to goldfarb and never communicated that conception to goldfarb.cooper ii,at.
moreover,as to the invention,the dissent states that goldfarb could not be the sole inventor because gore possessed the invention before goldfarb,and cooper suggested eptfe as a vascular graft to goldfarb.dissent at.citing to shatterproof glass libbey owens ford,finding substantial evidence on which a reasonable jury could have found that the inventors were correctly named despite conflicting trial testimony however,this court has explained previously that a person will not be a if he or she does no more than explain to the real inventors concepts that are well known and the current state of the art.fina oil chem.ewen,internal citations omitted.t o be a joint inventor,an individual must make a contribution to the conception of the claimed invention that is not insignificant in quality,when that contribution is measured against the dimension of the full invention.id.in this case,gore did know about eptfe before goldfarb,but the potential use of eptfe as a vascular graft was not a new concept and any suggestion by cooper to use the material was insignificant.
rather than the idea of using eptfe as a graft,the claimed invention in this case is a vascular prosthesis made from eptfe having a very specific range of distances between nodes,which are connected by fibrils.see,patent ll cooper ii,at.before goldfarb made his invention,other doctors had tried to use eptfe as a small bore vascular graft,but none understood why apparently identical grafts would often perform differently when implanted.goldfarb was the first person to discover that a specific internodal distance was the determining factor in graft success and reduce that knowledge to practice.cooper ii,at.
the dissent points to letters detailing the results of the experiments by sharp and kelly,dissent at,which show some patent eptfe grafts,as support for the conclusion that goldfarb could not be the sole inventor however,this court previously considered those letters and found that they have no effect on goldfarb inventorship.as to the sharp experiment,this court previously concluded that the grafts successfully used by sharp were not shown to have the same fibril lengths as those in goldfarb invention.cooper i,at.as to kelly experiment,the dissent neglects to mention that although the grafts used fell within the claim limitations of goldfarb invention,cooper considered kelly results to be a failure id.at.
cooper never shared whatever knowledge he had about internodal distances with goldfarb.instead,cooper contribution to goldfarb invention can be summarized as handing goldfarb an undifferentiated selection of eptfe tubes,some of which turned out to be suitable for use as a graft.because cooper did little more than share with goldfarb what was already well known,the jury had substantial evidence to find that cooper contribution was not significant enough to make him a joint inventor and we must defer to that finding see,hess advanced cardiovascular,stating that doing nothing more than explaining to the inventors what the then state of the art was and supplying a product to them for use in their invention does not automatically make one a joint inventor.
anticipation is a question of fact that we review for substantial evidence when tried to a jury.orion ip,llc hyundai motor,citation omitted.the jury found that claims to of the patent were not invalid for anticipation by matsumoto.verdict form,at.the district court determined that the evidence establishes that the matsumoto article was not enabling,as neither gore nor any of the other doctors with whom gore was working,could determine the structure disclosed in the matsumoto article or replicate matsumoto results.post trial i,d at.the court cited the trial testimony of gore own fact witness,dan detton,who stated that you could figure anything from the matsumoto article because the article itself did not define anything.id.internal citation omitted.thus,the court found that gore failed to establish that a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for bard and denied gore motion for judgment as a matter of law on anticipation.id.
in matsumoto,vascular grafts of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene mm.in internal diameter and to cm.in length,were inserted between the dissected femoral arteries in dogs and the patency rates of the grafts of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene wa s percent from to months following operation.matsumoto at.further,matsumoto also made microscopic findings that showed a fibroplasia in the porous layer and a thin,neointima on the inner surface of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene.id.
a single prior art reference must expressly or inherently disclose each claim limitation to anticipate a claim.additionally,the reference must enable one of ordinary skill in the art to make the invention without undue experimentation.orion,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.further,anticipation must be proved by clear and convincing evidence.id.bard presented substantial evidence to support the jury verdict of no anticipation by matsumoto.
regarding whether matsumoto is enabled,james anderson,bard technical expert,testified that matsumoto did not provide enough information,including the characteristics of the graft material,for a doctor to recreate a working vascular graft.this testimony was in addition to that of detton,who stated that matsumoto would have been enough for me to even do much with.
bard also presented evidence that others were unable to replicate matsumoto work.mendenhall testified that the reaction to matsumoto was that it was k ind of a fluke,really and that n obody was very able to reproduce that.a gore document titled flagstaff visit,dan detton also stated that matsumoto claims success on femoral arteries in dogs but we do not know what tubes we re used.so we start again.in addition to this evidence from gore own employees,other experts in the field also failed to reproduce grafts like matsumoto.on december,glenn kelly wrote to matsumoto and stated that using presumably identical material,he was unable to create grafts that remained unobstructed and did not know how to resolve the apparent conflict in our results.additionally,on february,ben eiseman wrote kensuke esato in japan and stated that while matsumoto detailed continued patency of vessels of mm diameter over prolonged periods,neither h e nor others in the we re having such good luck.finally,charles campbell declared that e fforts in this country to duplicate the results of matsumoto have met with failure.thus,bard presented substantial evidence for the jury to find that matsumoto does not enable a person of ordinary skill in the art to make the invention without undue experimentation and can not be used as anticipatory prior art.
even if matsumoto were a proper prior art reference,there is substantial evidence that matsumoto does not anticipate the claimed invention.the asserted claims require specific average distance s between nodes.patent,ll.jock wheeler,gore own technical expert,testified that matsumoto,however,did not refer to internodal distance,which was really not mentioned in th e article.although he also stated that the internodal distance could be readily calculated from figure of matsumoto,goldfarb testified that there was a fair amount of inconsistency along each graft so the portion of the graft surface depicted in figure was not representative of the entire graft.
in the interference,cooper himself argued that o ne is left to speculate as to whether this small portion of the matsumoto graft is representative of the fibril length throughout the entire graft.further,this court noted that harold green,the individual responsible for manufacturing expanded ptfe tubing for gore in,testified that there was difficulty controlling the uniformity of the ptfe material and that fibril lengths vary along each tube.cooper i,at.the court also noted that goldfarb testified that fibril length varied tremendously within the same graft.id.internal quotation omitted.
finally,matsumoto was already before the pto during prosecution of the patent,and the pto did not find that matsumoto anticipated the patent.see am.hoist derrick sowa sons,abrogated on other grounds by therasense,becton,dickinson,en banc stating that when no prior art other than that which was considered by the pto examiner is relied on by the attacker,he has the added burden of overcoming the deference that is due to a qualified government agency presumed to have properly done its job to issue only valid patents.
the supreme court has recently held that invalidity needs to be proved by clear and convincing evidence.microsoft,d.based on this record,a reasonable jury could find that gore failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that matsumoto anticipated the claimed invention.accordingly,the district court did not err in denying gore motion for judgment as a matter of law on anticipation.
when reviewing the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law,this court reviews a jury conclusions on obviousness,a question of law,without deference,and the underlying findings of fact,whether explicit or implicit within the verdict,for substantial evidence.muniauction,thomson,internal quotations and citations omitted.
the jury found the patent valid under because the subject matter of the patent would not have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art in light of volder alone for claims to and,or volder and matsumoto in combination for claims to.verdict form,at.the district court denied gore motion for judgment as a matter of law on obviousness.obviousness ii,wl,at obviousness i,wl,at.
volder discusses how grafts of gore tex porous polytetrafluoroethylene g ptfe were evaluated and that g ptfe is a material with extremely promising characteristics for a v shunts.volder at.volder found that s hunts of g ptfe have as favorable characteristics that are readily available because the material withstands puncturing,and there is neointima healing with extensive ingrowth of fibroblasts and capillaries.id.at.additionally,while the tissue infiltration is not complete in certain areas,volder believed that by increasing the average pore size of the material,at the moment u,it will be possible to accelerate the process of tissue infiltration and development of capillaries,which would result in a faster healing and more durable neointima.id.
a claim is obvious when the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.to determine whether a patent is obvious,a district court must base its determination on factual inquiries involving the scope and content of the prior art,differences between the prior art and the claims,the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art,and secondary considerations,such as commercial success,satisfaction of a need,and failure of others.graham john deere of kansas city,d 
the asserted claims require specific average distance s between nodes.patent,ll.in light of volder alone,the district court found that the following evidence at trial supported the legal conclusion that claims to and are not obvious 
volder was repeatedly considered by the pto before,during,and after gore interference proceeding,in which gore itself consistently distinguished volder from goldfarb invention 
volder,the author himself,stated under oath in an unrebutted affidavit that he thought that the prosthetic vascular structure conceived and developed by goldfarb was by no means obvious to those actively conducting research on expanded ptfe vascular structures during and 
researchers were unable to invent a successful graft even after volder and matsumoto were published,and cooper testified in that he was compelled to steal goldfarb histology slides to determine why others were not successful 
goldfarb testified that neither volder nor matsumoto taught his invention,and anderson testified that he would not have been able to create a working graft based on volder and matsumoto and 
pore size and internodal distance are not synonymous based on several pieces of record evidence,including wilbert gore,gore founder,declaration that p ore size is not synonymous with fibril length in volder and cooper and goldfarb agreement that pore size bears no relationship to fibril length in the interference.
obviousness ii,wl,at some internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also obviousness i,wl,at.
in light of volder and matsumoto in combination,the court also found,in addition to its above findings on volder alone,that the following evidence at trial supported the legal conclusion that claims to are not obvious 
like volder,matsumoto was repeatedly considered by the pto during the pendency of the goldfarb application and was found not to invalidate the claimed invention 
other doctors,including ones working for gore itself,were unable to solve the problems with graft development after both volder and matsumoto were published,and cooper himself could not determine why other researchers were failing 
other researchers could not determine the structure disclosed in matsumoto or use matsumoto to create a working vascular graft 
goldfarb testimony that volder and matsumoto did not teach his invention,and detton testimony that gore researchers had no idea what type of eptfe vascular graft matsumoto used and 
gore own damaging admissions that matsumoto failed to disclose the key parameter of internodal distance.
id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
the district court exhaustive findings,summarily recited above,delineate the substantial evidence presented at trial to the jury about the scope and contents of volder and matsumoto,their differences from the claimed invention,and the objective indicia of nonobviousness.see obviousness ii,wl,at obviousness i,wl,at.neither volder nor matsumoto disclosed the importance of the internodal distance.thus,the jury verdict that claims to of the patent are not invalid as obvious in light of volder alone,or volder and matsumoto in combination,is clearly supported.the district court did not err in denying gore motion for judgment as a matter of law on obviousness.
the district court determined that for the same reasons that it found volder and matsumoto in combination would not render the patent obvious,there was also no basis for finding claims to of the patent obvious in light of matsumoto alone obviousness ii,wl,at.we agree.for the reasons stated above regarding the nonobviousness of claims to of the patent in light of volder and matsumoto in combination and matsumoto failure to anticipate claims to of the patent,the district court did not err in denying gore motion for judgment as a matter of law that matsumoto alone renders claims to of the patent obvious.
the issue of whether a patent is invalid for failure to meet the written description requirement of,is a question of fact,and we review a jury determinations of facts relating to compliance with the written description requirement for substantial evidence.ariad,eli lilly,en banc internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the written description issue in this case is whether the written description of the patent supports the claims that are not limited to a prosthesis with a wall thickness of to mm,namely claims to and.the jury determined that claims to of the patent were not invalid for lack of adequate written description.verdict form,at.the district court found that substantial evidence demonstrated that wall thickness is not an essential element of goldfarb invention and,thus,denied gore motion for judgment as a matter of law for lack of written description.post trial i,d at.
a patent written description must clearly allow persons of ordinary skill in the art to recognize that the inventor invented what is claimed.ariad,at quoting vas cath mahurkar.the test for sufficiency of written description is whether the disclosure of the application relied upon reasonably conveys to those skilled in the art that the inventor had possession of the claimed subject matter as of the filing date.id.citations omitted.
the patent states that the average internodal distance,as measured along the axis of expansion,must fall within a relatively narrow range of values,between approximately and microns.ll emphasis added.thus,a specific average internodal distance is a requirement of the claimed invention.see id.alternatively,the written description also states that w all thickness is another factor affecting the establishment and maintenance of a viable neointima in grafts.id.ll emphasis added.thus,although g rafts embodying the present invention,having wall thicknesses in the range between and millimeters have exhibited excellent mechanical properties and g rafts falling outside these ranges have been found to be marginal or clinically unacceptable,the language of the patent does not mandate a wall thickness within the stated range for the claimed invention.id.ll,see martek biosciences nutrinova,a patent claim is not necessarily invalid for lack of written description just because it is broader than the specific examples disclosed.citations omitted.
additionally,in the interference,the pto itself proposed a count that did not include a wall thickness limitation.see cooper i,at.even though goldfarb testified that a graft outside the range of to mm was technically harder to handle,he did not say it would work.further,although goldfarb moved to amend the count to include a range for wall thickness,the pto denied the motion because there is evidence that fibril length is the critical variable,and in terms of an interference,the broadest possible patentable claim must be used as the count and an amended count with a wall thickness limitation would be narrower than the present count.j.cooper himself responded that o nce it is known that fibril length is the key to successful tissue growth,however,optimizing the other structural features of the graft is,and was,a matter of routine experimentation and that t he present count is supported by each party application and broadly covers the real invention.emphases added see also cooper argues vigorously that only fibril length is critical to the operability of the claimed device.
finally,at trial,goldfarb testified that his invention did not require a specific wall thickness because wall thicknesses were really dependent on the application of the graft and not one wall thickness for all implantations was appropriate.
accordingly,substantial evidence supports the jury finding that claims to and of the patent are not invalid for lack of written description,and the district court did not err in denying gore motion for judgment as a matter of law on the issue.
determining whether or not infringement is willful is a question of fact that must be established by clear and convincing evidence and is reviewed for substantial evidence.comark commc ns,harris.the jury found that gore infringement of claims to of the patent was willful,despite a november opinion of counsel that the claims of the patent were invalid.verdict form,at.the district court found that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to have found willful infringement by clear and convincing evidence.post trial i,d at.the evidence included an extensive litigation history before the pto where goldfarb was the sole inventor and gore was the losing party,and also included gore reliance on the same references that were before the pto,which the pto found did not invalidate the patent,to support its invalidity defenses.id.

bard presented substantial evidence to satisfy both prongs of the seagate standard and support the jury finding that gore infringement was willful.the jury heard evidence of the interference,in which goldfarb was awarded priority of invention.post trial i,d at see cooper ii,cooper i.based on the interference,gore was aware of both the patent existence and goldfarb research activities at ahi.in addition,gore relied on matsumoto and volder to support its invalidity defenses,even though those references were previously considered and rejected as not invalidating by the pto.see patent at am.hoist,at.further,for example,the district court found that gore ha d no valid evidentiary basis for meritoriously arguing that claims through of the goldfarb patent we re,by clear and convincing evidence,obvious in light of matsumoto and volder,which was not a close call.obviousness ii,wl,at.based on this evidence alone,it would have been reasonable for the jury to find that gore manufactured and sold grafts despite an objectively high likelihood the grafts infringed the valid patent.
additionally,an infringer reliance on favorable advice of counsel is not dispositive of the willfulness inquiry.seagate,at.in cases where willful infringement is found despite the presence of an opinion of counsel,the opinion of counsel was either ignored or found to be incompetent.read portec,superseded on other grounds as recognized by hoechst celanese bp chems.as the district court determined,bard presented substantial evidence that gore opinion of counsel was not based on an objective perspective.damages,slip op.at.in addition to the opinion reliance on matsumoto and volder,which were already rejected by the pto,the bases of alleged invalidity asserted in the opinion were directly contrary to the validity arguments gore presented to the pto when attempting to patent goldfarb invention.damages,slip op.at.with the same law firm representing gore both before and after the patent was issued,the district court viewed the objectivity of the opinion as questionable.id.at.the district court also found that the opinion was not premised on the best evidence available because it excluded certain available evidence that was relevant to gore invalidity defenses.id.thus,there was also substantial evidence presented to the jury that supports the finding that gore knew or should have known of the objectively high likelihood that its grafts infringed the patent.
gore presentation of several defenses at trial does not mean the jury willfulness finding lacks a sufficient evidentiary basis t he jury was free to decide for itself whether gore reasonably believed there were any substantial defenses to a claim of infringement.microsoft,aff,d citations omitted.accordingly,substantial evidence supports the jury finding that gore willfully infringed the patent,and the district court did not err in denying gore motion for judgment as a matter of law on willfulness.

the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding enhanced damages.in addition to the jury finding of willfulness that is supported by substantial evidence,the court conducted a detailed and exhaustive review of all nine read factors to ascertain whether gore acted in bad faith to merit an increase of the jury damages award.damages,slip op.at.the read factors for determining whether an infringer has acted in bad faith include 
whether the infringer deliberately copied the ideas or design of another whether the infringer,when he knew of the other patent protection,investigated the scope of the patent and formed a belief that it was invalid or that it was not infringed the infringer behavior as a party to the litigation defendant size and financial condition closeness of the case duration of defendant misconduct remedial action by the defendant defendant motivation for harm and whether defendant attempted to conceal its misconduct.
liquid dynamics vaughan,citing read,at.the court found that all of the factors,except as to whether gore attempted to conceal its misconduct,weighed in favor of enhanced damages.three of those eight favorable factors,however,were only slightly in favor of enhancement namely,the good faith belief of invalidity or,behavior as a party to the litigation,and closeness of the case.damages,slip op.at.thus,the court exercised its discretion by only doubling the jury damages award,and not tripling as it had the authority to do.id.at.based on the evidence,the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding enhanced damages to bard.
section of title of the united states code states that a court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.whether a case is exceptional and,thus,eligible for an award of attorneys fees requires the district court to first,make a factual determination of whether a case is exceptional and second,exercise its discretion to determine whether attorneys fees are appropriate.cybor,at.
the district court also found that there was sufficient basis for deeming this case exceptional based on the jury verdict of willfulness,the evidence supporting willfulness,and the extensive litigation history between the parties that gore repeatedly lost yet continued to infringe.damages,slip op.at.the court also determined that gore argued contradictory positions on infringement throughout the litigation and relied on testimony that was not credible.id.at.thus,the court concluded that this case was exceptional,justifying the exercise of its discretion in awarding of attorneys fees and costs based on the record,the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding bard attorneys fees and costs.
the district court denied bard request for a permanent injunction finding that it was in the public interest to allow competition in the medical device arena,but in lieu thereof granted bard an ongoing royalty to compensate for gore future infringement.injunction,wl,at see ebay mercexchange,d permitting the denial of a permanent injunction if the public interest would be disserved.the court set a to royalty rate on gore grafts depending on the different types of graft.license,slip op.at.
the award of an ongoing royalty instead of a permanent injunction to compensate for future infringement is appropriate in some cases.paice,at see also shatterproof,at upholding a courtordered royalty based on sales as a remedy for continuing operations.because of the public interest as the court here determined,the district court may wish to allow the parties to negotiate a license amongst themselves regarding future use of a patented invention before imposing an ongoing royalty.paice,at.but if the parties can not reach agreement,the district court could step in to assess a reasonable royalty in light of the ongoing infringement.id.for this court to determine whether the district court abused its discretion in setting the ongoing royalty rate,the district court must explain the reasoning in establishing the appropriate royalty rate.id.citing hensley eckerhart,d it is important for the district court to provide a concise but clear explanation of its reasons for the fee award.
here,bard proposed a royalty rate of for gore surgical graft products and for gore stent graft products,while gore proposed a royalty rate of for all of its infringing products.license,slip op.at.the district court explained its reasons for establishing the various royalty rates at on surgical grafts,on,on the viabahn,and on the propaten surgical graft against gore.id.at.the court reasoned that a different royalty rate was warranted between gore surgical and stent graft products because for surgical graft products,gore competes directly with bard in the more established market,while for stent graft products,a more recently developed market,bard does not presently directly compete with gore.id.at.thus,the court concluded that a license between bard and gore would separate the royalty rates on the two sets of products to account for those differences.id.thus,taking economic market forces into account is a reasonable and valid assumption by the district court.
next,the district court determined that the ongoing royalty on all of gore products should be higher than the reasonable royalty rate set by the jury.id.the court considered the parties changed legal status namely that the jury found the patent enforceable and not invalid and gore had willfully infringed the court deemed this case exceptional so that bard was awarded enhanced damages and attorneys fees and costs and gore voluntarily chose to continue its infringement unabated.id.at see amado microsoft,prior to judgment,liability for infringement,as well as the validity of the patent,is uncertain,and damages are determined in the context of that uncertainty.once a judgment of validity and infringement has been entered,however,the damages calculus is markedly different because different economic factors are involved.citation omitted.the court also considered other economic factors,including that bard and gore compete directly with respect to surgical grafts,gore profits highly from its infringing products,gore potentially faces stiffer losses that include a permanent injunction if bard prevails in a second lawsuit,and bard seeks adequate compensation and lacks incentive to accept a deal.id.at.finally,the court reasoned that the value gore added to its viabahn and propaten grafts that are bonded with heparin warranted lower royalty rates on those products.id.at.based on the district court reasoning,the court did not abuse its discretion in setting a to royalty rate for the ongoing royalty on gore infringing grafts.
accordingly,the district court award of enhanced damages,attorneys fees and costs,and an ongoing royalty as described in thorough and orders was not an abuse of discretion.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the judgment that the patent is valid and willfully infringed because the jury verdict is supported by substantial evidence.we also conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding enhanced damages,attorneys fees and costs,and an ongoing royalty.we commend the district court for its and wellgrounded opinions and its extensive and thoughtful analysis of the case.
the court today holds that a person who performs the requested test of a material that is provided to him for testing for a specified use,can then,when the test is successful,patent the material he was provided,for the use for which it was tested.my colleagues hold that david goldfarb,who was provided with gore tex tubular material for testing as a vascular graft in dogs,can patent as his own the gore tex material that gore employees provided to him,and assert the exclusive right to the use for which the material was provided.my colleagues hold that goldfarb then can enforce this patent against the provider of the gore tex material that he tested.my colleagues on this panel endorse and defend these errors and improprieties,and now rule that gore is the willful infringer of this improperly obtained patent on gore product and use.my colleagues find no blemish in this history of incorrect law,impropriety,questionable advocacy,and confessed perjury.i respectfully dissent.
discussion 
the saga of the patent in this suit starts in february,when employees of gore associates,in connection with an ongoing program led by gore plant manager peter cooper,invited goldfarb at the arizona heart institute to participate in testing the goretex expanded polytetrafluoroethylene eptfe for use as a vascular graft.gore tex eptfe had already been successfully tested as vascular grafts in dogs and sheep,by surgeons at various universities and hospitals.peter cooper and gore employee richard mendenhall visited goldfarb,told him of the material,its properties,and the results obtained and in progress,and invited him to participate in the testing program.goldfarb accepted the invitation,and cooper provided him with several gore tex tubes with the eptfe structures that had been found to be most effective as vascular grafts,in studies by the other researchers.goldfarb then implanted in dog arteries the gore tex tubes that cooper provided,observed that the material was indeed effective,and in october filed a patent application on the effective gore tex graft materials and this use,naming himself as the inventor.
gore had already filed a patent application on the effective gore tex graft materials,with peter cooper as inventor.prosecution continued for years,including a patent interference that lasted for eighteen years,with two appeals to the federal circuit.on august,the patent and trademark office pto issued a patent to goldfarb.in goldfarb and his,the bard company,sued gore for patent infringement.
the record shows gore extensive experience with these gore tex graft materials,experience that preceded goldfarb entry into gore testing program,including various prior art activities of record in the pto.goldfarb acknowledged in the interference proceeding that use of gore tex eptfe as a mammalian graft had been known as early as or,when ben eiseman of the university of colorado began testing gore tex vascular grafts.brief for the junior party david goldfarb,interference,px at,in bard gore,no.cv phx mhm.goldfarb also acknowledged to the pto that a t about the same time,matsumoto in tokyo,japan,obtained a sample of expanded ptfe tubing and implanted it in dogs as a small diameter graft,and matsumoto reported a success rate id.at.matsumoto,of the department of thoracic surgery of the university of tokyo,published several scientific articles on this work,matsumoto et,studies of porous polytetrafluoroethylene as a vascular prosthesis application to peripheral arteries,artificial organs,vol.another matsumoto publication,in surgery,vol,october states that gore tex tubes manufactured by gore associates were implanted in dogs for up to ten months.the surgery article states that after the implant period the internal surface of the grafts were visualized macroscopically and microscopically,and includes photomicrographs of the gore tex tubes showing the fibrous and internodal structure that is claimed in the goldfarb patent.figure of the surgery article is a photomicrograph of an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene prosthesis removed ten months after operation.the neointima is very well developed and firmly adherent to the inner surface properties that the jury and the pto was told were discovered by goldfarb.figure is a microscopic picture of an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene prosthesis removed months after operation.fibroplasis is well formed through pores these are all properties that the jury and the pto were told were discovered by goldfarb.
in,well before goldfarb was first contacted by the gore employees,an internal memorandum written by cooper entitled who is doing what with gore tex veins and arteries and other experiments,dated august,reports experiments conducted by jay volder of the university of utah,using gore tex tubes provided by cooper,for vascular grafts in sheep

several other surgeons had previously tested the gore tex material as vascular grafts in dogs.in november cooper provided gore tex tubes of various fibrous structures to william sharp at the akron city hospital and glenn kelly at the university of colorado medical school.this activity is summarized in cooper goldfarb,cooper i,the court stating that in the spring of,the researchers participating in the experiment began obtaining results.id.at.the court stated that in a letter dated april,sharp informed cooper that two of his grafts had been successful.id.at.sharp described the characteristics of fibroblastic infiltration and the nature of the neointima as viewed by microscope characteristics that goldfarb stated were his discovery.sharp provided his photomicrographs to cooper,and wrote

this court also reviewed kelly studies,at the university of colorado,of various gore tex materials as vascular grafts in dogs,in which kelly identified the structures that were most effective.the court summarized kelly histological studies and microscopic investigation of tissue ingrowth characteristics that goldfarb claimed as his discovery.the federal circuit summarized this work 
on april,kelly sent cooper four histological slides of harvested grafts.cooper testified that he reviewed the slides under a microscope on april,and then photographed the slides,measured the fibril lengths shown,and recorded his conclusions in his laboratory notebook.the first page of cooper notebook contains a photomicrograph of a harvested graft along with a notation indicating that the graft was submitted by kelly.the page also contains a sticker with a micron scale indicated.
the following is written above the photomicrograph 
i want to maximize the amount and rate of tissue ingrowth into gore tex vascular prosthetics.two qualities are necessary.uniform poker chip structure and.a minimal skin at both the and surfaces.
tissue has invaded gore tex where the nodes are approx.microns thick and with most separations between nodes at about microns.photo.other structures having approximately micron node dimensions and spaces from about micron do not appear to allow.
cooper i,at.this court referred to kelly photomicrographs showing tissue ingrowth and internodal separation,yet goldfarb,before the jury,accused cooper of stealing goldfarb photomicrographs showing tissue ingrowth and internodal separation.by the time of trial,cooper had died,leaving goldfarb uncontradicted.
goldfarb had told the pto that it was well known in and before that for tissue ingrowth in a vascular graft,the internodal distance must be at least the size of a fibroblast or red blood cell,that is,in the range of microns,so that the cells can infiltrate the eptfe pores.goldfarb,april,at px,bard gore,no.cv phx mhm.this is the internodal distance that all of the investigators who preceded goldfarb had observed to characterize the effective gore tex graft materials.yet at the infringement trial the jury was told that it was goldfarb who discovered that gore tex eptfe had these properties and performance.
goldfarb conceded at the infringement trial that he knew nothing about gore tex or eptfe before the gore employees suggested that he participate in the test program for these materials 
goldfarb,do you agree that the idea of trying out eptfe tubes as an artificial vascular prosthesis was something that was first suggested to you by two gore employees,peter cooper and richard mendenhall 
before the gore employees told you about trying eptfe as a vascular prosthesis,you did know anything about that material,correct 
that correct.
and the first suggestion from gore came in about february i think you said is that right 
that correct.
trial tr.the record contains the following letter from peter cooper dated february,written after this initial contact 
dear goldfarb,
enclosed are a variety of sizes of gore tex tubes for your animal artery prosthetic experiments.i have also enclosed a short length of tubing with a small flange at each end and wonder if an anastomosis technique where a similar flange if formed on the end of the artery and butted against the gore tex prosthetic might not be a better technique than suturing the butt ends together.
we want to do whatever we can to help you with your project.when additional materials or further information is needed,do not hesitate to let us know.
very truly yours,

on april,cooper sent goldfarb additional gore tex tubes,with a letter stating that these materials represent the latest attempt to achieve satisfactory patency rates in small artery prosthetics,based on the ongoing work of the other surgeons in the project.the federal circuit summarized goldfarb participation 
following a meeting with cooper and mendenhall in early february,goldfarb set up an animal research facility at ahi.over the next several months,cooper periodically sent goldfarb a variety of expanded ptfe tubes to use in his research.using the samples provided by cooper,goldfarb conducted a series of experiments consisting of grafts implanted in the left and right carotid and left and right femoral arteries of seven dogs goldfarb began obtaining results from these experiments towards the end of may of.
cooper i,at.
goldfarb obtained results that conformed to the results that had been achieved by the other surgeons,and then filed a patent application on the gore tex materials that he had received from the gore employees.he claimed,for use as vascular grafts,the materials that he had been provided by gore for this purpose.he claimed these materials by the tubular shape and size and density of the materials that he had been provided,and by the internodal structure of the materials that he had been provided and that he,and others before him,had observed to provide effective tissue ingrowth.
after eighteen years of interference proceedings,the pto granted the patent to goldfarb,although the pto found and the federal circuit affirmed that cooper was the first to conceive of the invention,including the specified internodal structure,and held that goldfarb work inures to cooper benefit 
applying the genentech test to these facts,we hold that goldfarb recognition that the rf graft from the lot material was suitable for use as a vascular implant inures to cooper benefit.
cooper goldfarb,cooper ii.goldfarb had sold his rights to international medical products and research associates impra,a company that had been formed by former gore employees,and that was sued by gore for infringement of trade secrets.goldfarb later recovered his patent rights,and sold them to bard.goldfarb and bard then sued gore for infringement.the jury found infringement by gore entire line of gore tex graft human prostheses.
the infringement trial was fraught with errors of law,misstatements of fact,and confessed perjury by dan detton,a witness in this case to whose testimony my colleagues on this panel give weight.detton admitted to perjury concerning goldfarb activities in testimony that detton gave in the trade secret litigation between gore and impra,and detton admitted that his false affidavits had been filed in the patent office to support goldfarb patent application.at the infringement trial,after detton had been called by gore to testify as to various aspects of the relationship between gore and goldfarb,gore counsel introduced detton affidavits and brought out detton prior false testimony 
counsel is this the second affidavit that you signed in that meeting in january of 
detton.yes,it one of the two.
counsel if you would turn to paragraph,please,of exhibit the second affidavit.and it stated there that prior to the applicant disclosure of the structure defined in the aboveidentified application,affiant,that you,was unaware of any other vascular structure which incorporated a thin wall in the range of thicknesses between and millimeters.do you see that 
detton yes.
counsel is that a factually accurate statement,detton 
detton no,that would be inaccurate.that contradictory to the findings that we were having,and the results.
bard gore,no.phx mhm,examination of detton,trans.bard counsel,in turn,also addressed the falsity of detton prior testimony 
counsel you were asked,as far as i can tell inform me if i correct and tell me if i wrong the specifications for the next graft verification experiments were set forth by goldfarb about of is that about correct 
your answer,correct.
is your testimony there knowingly false or truthful 
detton no,that was inaccurate testimony.
counsel was it knowingly false 
detton yes,it was.
counsel perjury 
detton yes,it was.
bard gore,no.phx mhm,trans.
the panel majority complains about my reference to detton admissions of perjury,stating that it is not our appellate role to determine credibility.i am not determining detton credibility he did that for us.he admitted that he lied in the testimony that he gave in support of the gore who formed the company impra to which goldfarb initially assigned his patent rights,and who were sued by gore for misappropriation of trade secrets.he admitted that he lied in the affidavits that were filed with the patent examiner and that achieved allowance of the goldfarb application.this is not an appellate assessment of credibility there is no credibility to assess.
the panel majority also misstates that the matsumoto and volder articles were fairly considered as prior art in this appeal,for the jury was told that the patent examiner had fully considered these articles and had granted the patent in light thereof.it is now admitted that the detton affidavits,filed in the pto to distinguish these articles,were perjured detton testified that he had told goldfarb and goldfarb counsel that he wanted to withdraw the affidavits,and they refused.
goldfarb counsel used the of detton as a platform for misstating to the jury that the federal circuit and the patent office determined goldfarb had come up with this invention,for both the federal circuit and the patent office had determined that cooper,not goldfarb,had conceived the invention.such misstatements to the jury are typified by this exchange 
counsel the date up there at the top is.do you understand that to be october,
detton i would assume.
counsel and this is,just so we orient ourselves,some four or five months after the federal circuit and the patent office determined goldfarb had come up with this invention.
goldfarb also told the jury that the federal circuit held that the patent office affirmed the patent although neither had done so.
counsel okay.and this is the march opinion that what was the impact of this opinion this is the federal second federal circuit opinion,goldfarb.what the impact of this opinion 
goldfarb it says that judgment that the decision made by the patent office affirmed the patent.
trial tr.in a travesty of flawed proceedings,in which almost all of the witnesses were dead,unwilling,or hostile,misstatements of law and fact abound 
as a matter of law,goldfarb can not deprive gore of the invention gore possessed and that was known to gore and published by others before goldfarb entered the scene.a person who tests a material provided to him for testing,in the test for which the material was provided,does not become the inventor of the material and the use for which he tested it,and does not thereby become the owner of the material with the sole right to the use he was invited to test.as stated in shatterproof glass libbey owens ford,an inventor may use the services,ideas,and aid of others in the process of perfecting his invention without losing his right to a patent.quoting hobbs atomic energy comm n,cir.
the panel majority states that goldfarb invented a homogeneously porous vascular prosthesis with small nodes interconnected by extremely fine fibrils to form an open superstructure which will allow uniform,controlled transmural cellular ingrowth and thereby assure the establishment and maintenance of a thin,viable neointima as well as firm structural integration of the graft into the body.op.at.that is incorrect the product that the panel majority describes is the gore tex product that the gore employees invited goldfarb to test as a vascular prosthesis it was not invented,designed,created,or produced by goldfarb.the gore employees provided goldfarb with known samples having small nodes interconnected with fibrils,of the density and wall thickness and internodal distance of the samples that others had previously successfully tested as graft prostheses.they were not goldfarb invention.
the panel majority also misstates,or misunderstands,the findings of the interference,and the prior federal circuit rulings.this court held that cooper had conceived the entire invention before,not after,goldfarb purported reduction to practice.this court found that cooper had provided goldfarb with the material that he tested,and that by letter to goldfarb accompanying the lot material,cooper described the material as represent ing the latest attempt to achieve satisfactory patency rates in small artery prosthetics,indicating that he expected the material to be suitable as a vascular graft.cooper ii,at.the court h e ld that goldfarb recognition that the rf graft from the lot material was suitable for use as a vascular implant inures to cooper benefit.id.at.the court inquiry into whether cooper can obtain the benefit of goldfarb knowledge of the fibril lengths of the material goldfarb tested was directed to the interference contest between cooper and goldfarb,for it was undisputed that cooper had knowledge of the structure of the successful products before goldfarb tested the successful products.
thus this court held in cooper i that cooper had conceived the invention,including the fibril length limitation,before goldfarb reduced the invention to practice.at.the letter from sharp dated april,related to the lot material,and cooper letter to goldfarb on april,accompanied the lot material and described it as represent ing the latest attempt to achieve satisfactory patency rates in small artery prosthetics.cooper ii,at.this was the material that goldfarb patented as his own,although pictures of the fibrous structure of the gore tex grafts had been made known to cooper by sharp and allen,and had been published by ma
