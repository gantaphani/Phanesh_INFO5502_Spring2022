appellant stanley avgoustis avgoustis applied for attorneys fees as a prevailing party under the equal access to justice act eaja,d.the united states court of appeals for veterans claims veterans court disallowed recovery for certain items involving client communications because the statements did not describe the purpose of the activity sufficiently to determine if the charges were reasonable.see avgoustis shinseki,slip op.at.avgoustis argued that requiring a more detailed description would violate his privilege.the veterans court held that requiring general descriptions of the items would not violate the privilege.we affirm.
background 
at an earlier stage in these proceedings,avgoustis appealed an adverse board of veterans appeals board decision to the veterans court.the board had found that he did not submit new and material evidence sufficient to reopen his claim for service connection for stress disorder.pursuant to an agreement by the parties,the veterans court remanded the case to the board for further proceedings to consider additional evidence discovered by avgoustis.
subsequently,avgoustis submitted an eaja application to the veterans court for attorneys fees and expenses,claiming attorney hours and paralegal hours for a total of.the veterans administration va conceded that avgoustis satisfied most of the requirements for attorneys fees under eaja.he was a prevailing party he had a net worth below and the va position was not substantially justified.the only disputed issue was whether avgoustis had properly provided itemized statement s stating the actual time expended as required by d b.
the va opposed the application in part,arguing that the fees for twenty six of the billing entries should be denied because the descriptions were not sufficiently detailed.the entries in question each stated only that avgoustis lawyer had review ed client correspondence or draft ed client correspondence.avgoustis lawyer billed hours for each of the twenty six disputed entries for a total of hours.avgoustis argued that requiring more detailed billing statements disclosing the subject matter of his communications with his attorney would violate privilege.
the veterans court agreed with the va that the disputed entries fail ed to indicate the purpose of these billed activities and,therefore,are simply inadequate to permit effective review of the appellant application.avgoustis,slip op.at.the veterans court found no violation of the privilege,concluding that 
t he entries in this case could easily have contained sufficient additional detail without disclosing privileged information.for example,the entries do not distinguish between communications updating the client as to the case status,seeking the client input as to the issues raised,discussing the terms of the proposed joint motion,and seeking approval for actions that require the consent of the client.these distinct forms of client contact can easily be described in general terms without disclosing specific details that may be protected by privilege.
id.at.the veterans court accordingly reduced the fee award by hours or.id.at.avgoustis timely appealed to this court.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
under a and c,our review of decisions of the veterans court is limited to a challenge to the validity of any statute or regulation or any interpretation thereof however,applying a dispositive legal standard to undisputed facts is essentially a matter of law,not fact.wood peake.here,the facts are undisputed.on appeal,avgoustis argues only that the veterans court erred in holding that requiring disclosure of the general subject matter of itemized communications does not violate privilege.
the va first argues that eaja supersedes the privilege by requiring itemized statement s.we disagree.the supreme court has established that courts may take it as a given that congress has legislated with an expectation that the common law principle will apply except when the statutory purpose to the contrary is evident.astoria fed.sav.loan ass solimino,d in particular,the supreme court has held that a statute abrogates common law privileges only if the language declaring the legislative will is so clear as to prevent doubt as to its intent and limit.bassett united states.narrowly construing utah statute that created exception to spousal privilege for crimes committed by one spouse against another and refusing to find that it abrogated spousal privilege when husband was charged with polygamy.more recently,in upjohn united states,d,the court stated that a tax summons issued under was subject to traditional privileges and limitations and that the statutory provision and legislative history did not suggest an intent on the part of congress to preclude application of a traditional limitation like the doctrine.citing upjohn,two courts of appeals have recently held that s tatutes requiring disclosure,but silent on the question of privilege,do not override customary privileges.united states forrester,cir united states danovaro,cir both cases hold that a statute which mandates disclosure of a wiretap application if fruits of wiretap are used in court did not abrogate government customary privilege to withhold,redact information critical to informant safety.
the privilege is,of course,a common law privilege.although the federal rules of evidence are not applicable to veterans court proceedings,they do apply to our court.see.a.under the federal rules,the privilege shall be governed by the principles of the common law as they may be interpreted by the courts of the united states in the light of reason and experience,except to the extent the rules governing waiver of the privilege codified at.differ from the common law.
here,there is no statutory language abrogating the privilege.the eaja statute merely provides,in pertinent part 
a party seeking an award of fees and other expenses shall,within thirty days of final judgment in the action,submit to the court an application for fees and other expenses which shows that the party is a prevailing party and is eligible to receive an award under this subsection,and the amount sought,including an itemized statement from any attorney or expert witness representing or appearing in behalf of the party stating the actual time expended and the rate at which fees and other expenses were computed.
d b emphasis added.the statute does not even discuss the nature of any disclosures required in an itemized statement,and it certainly does not speak directly to the privilege.moreover,the legislative history does not suggest that the privilege was being abrogated.the relevant committee reports fail even to discuss the purpose of the itemized statement requirement and do not state or suggest that it was intended to supersede the privilege.see.
given the presumption against abrogating common law privileges absent clear legislative intent,we can not say that the the language declaring a legislative will to revoke the privilege is so clear as to prevent doubt as to its intent and limit.see bassett,at.in fact,we can not see any indication that congress intended to abrogate the privilege,and conclude that eaja does not do so.
alternatively,the va argues that the disclosures of general subject matter required by the veterans court here do not violate the privilege.we agree.in hensley eckerhart,d,the supreme court emphasized that attorneys fee applicants under a comparable attorneys fee statute,should maintain billing time records in a manner that will enable a reviewing court to identify distinct claims.the court elaborated that p laintiff counsel is not required to record in great detail how each minute of his time was expended but at least counsel should identify the general subject matter of his time expenditures.id.at.under numerous statutes,courts of appeals have consistently required that attorneys fee applicants provide the general subject matter of their billing entries although this court has not directly addressed the level of specificity required in subject matter disclosures under eaja,we have stated that time records will satisfy eaja itemized statement requirement when they provi
