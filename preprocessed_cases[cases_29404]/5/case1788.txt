factual and procedural 
richard and rachel peterson the petersons purchased a home constructed by richmond american homes richmond in a planned development community named bridgeport in santa clarita at windward lane,lot the property.the bridgeport community association bca was the homeowners association responsible for managing the common areas and enforcing the master declaration of covenants,conditions,and restrictions for bridgeport the cc rs and rules and regulations the r rs for the community.
pursuant to an arrangement with the petersons,james martin and his wife,raeann the martins,agreed that the martins would live at the property and pay all the costs involved with the property,including the mortgage payments.raeann martin is the petersons daughter.they also agreed that the martins would deal directly with bca on any issues regarding the property.the petersons executed a power of attorney to that effect which was accepted by bca.the petersons agreed to assign all their rights,title,and interest in their causes of action stated in the fac to the martins.
during construction of the home on the property,the petersons and the martins observed that the size of lot where the construction was occurring was smaller than represented in the purchase transaction.richmond agreed to move the northern property line feet to include approximately square feet within the lot lot lines adjustment area.this required two separate lot line adjustments lot line adjustment and lot line adjustment.before either adjustment could be completed,richmond transferred the adjustment area to bca as part of the common area.
as the result of negotiations with bca by the martins on behalf of the petersons,bca agreed to deed the adjustment area to the petersons under certain terms and conditions bca lot line agreement,as shown by a may,letter from nancy on behalf of the bca board of directors and an august,letter from the attorney for bca both letters were addressed to the martins.the martins accepted the terms of the agreement proposed by bca on behalf of themselves and the petersons.both letters represented that the bca board had agreed to completing the lot line adjustment and the transfer of land,subject to the conditions that the homeowners would pay bca attorney fees to prepare and execute the necessary documents and the homeowners would pay for the relocation of the common area sprinklers from the adjustment area.
after receiving notice of bca agreement,the martins invested money for fencing,landscaping and the import of dirt on the adjustment area.the martins also represented that the petersons were not able to landscape and hardscape their front yard because they did not yet have ownership of the adjustment area and thus lost use of the yard for more than four years.
after lengthy delays,the city of santa clarita city approved lot line adjustment.when bca did not thereafter cooperate in order to begin the required process for lot line adjustment,the martins sought specific performance of the bca lot line agreement by filing the instant lawsuit on october.the original complaint named the petersons and the martins as the plaintiffs and bca as the defendant.bca filed a demurrer to the complaint,in part on the ground that the martins lacked standing.
then the martins filed the fac,the operative complaint in this action.the fac named only the martins as the plaintiffs.the first cause of action was for damages for breach of,and the second cause of action was for specific performance of,the bca lot line agreement.as a part of the allegations,the martins requested that the court order bca to transfer title and cooperate in the approval and transfer of title to the property regarding lot line adjustment to plaintiffs the martins.
the third cause of action was for breach of the r rs of,and the fourth cause of action was for breach of the cc rs of,the bridgeport community.the fifth cause of action was for violation of civil code section et 
the sixth cause of action was for intentional infliction of emotional distress.in part,the martins alleged bca took certain actions in order to punish,and retaliate against,the plaintiffs the martins for enforcing their rights with respect to the property.

at the hearing on july,the trial court ruled that the demurrer to the fac was sustained with leave to amend as to the first through the fifth,and the seventh and eighth causes of action,on the ground that the martins lacked standing.with regard to the scope of the leave to amend,the trial court stated i am going to allow plaintiffs counsel leave to amend to bring in the petersons,and i will give counsel one last shot at seeing if there any other claims the martins have that can be pled.as to the sixth cause of action,the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,on the ground that the facts did not support a finding of sufficiently outrageous conduct as is necessary for recovery based upon intentional infliction of emotional distress 
the second amended complaint sac was filed on august.the petersons were the only named plaintiffs.they alleged only four causes of action first cause for breach of the r rs,second cause for breach of the cc rs,third cause for violation of sections and,and fourth cause for negligence per se based on the violation of the same statutes.
bca filed a demurrer to the sac.after hearing on december,the trial court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend as to the first,second and third causes of action on the ground of failure to allege sufficient facts to support the causes of action.the court sustained the demurrer to the sac without leave to amend as to the fourth cause of action.
the petersons filed the third amended complaint on january.only the petersons were named as plaintiffs.
also on january,bca filed a request that the court enter judgment against the martins in favor of bca.the request represented that on july,the trial court granted bca demurrer to the fac without leave to amend,except leave to amend to substitute the petersons,as the real parties in interest,for the martins as plaintiffs,and the petersons filed the sac.

discussion 
the martins contend that trial court erred in sustaining bca demurrer on the ground that they lacked standing to assert the first through fifth,seventh and eighth causes of action.they claim they had standing as to all the causes of action,in that the petersons assigned all of their rights,title,and interest in their causes of action stated in the first amended complaint to the martins.as to individual causes of action,the martins also present other grounds upon which they contend they have standing.the martins further claim that the trial court erred in including in the judgment an award of attorney fees and costs pursuant to section.we disagree and affirm the judgment.
standard of review 
when a demurrer is sustained by the trial court,we review the complaint de novo to determine whether,as a matter of law,the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.zelig county of los angeles cal th,d.reading the complaint as a whole and giving it a reasonable interpretation,we treat all material facts properly pleaded as true.ibid.the plaintiff has the burden of showing that the facts pleaded are sufficient to establish every element of the cause of action and overcoming all of the legal grounds on which the trial court sustained the demurrer,and if the defendant negates any essential element,we will affirm the order sustaining the demurrer as to the cause of action.cantu resolution trust th,d.we will affirm if there is any ground on which the demurrer can properly be sustained,whether or not the trial court relied on proper grounds or the defendant asserted a proper ground in the trial court proceedings.id.at,fn,d.
a trial court has discretion to sustain a demurrer with or without leave to amend.zelig county of los angeles,supra,cal th at,d.if we determine that the plaintiff has met its burden to demonstrate that a reasonable possibility exists that the defect can be cured by amendment of the pleading,then the trial court has abused its discretion in denying leave to amend and we reverse the denial.ibid.otherwise,we affirm the judgment on the basis that the trial court has not abused its discretion.ibid.
standing is the threshold element required to state a cause of action and,thus,lack of standing may be raised by demurrer.buckland threshold enterprises,th,d blumhorst jewish family services of los angeles th,d.to have standing to sue,a person,or those whom he properly represents,must have a real interest in the ultimate adjudication because he has either suffered or is about to suffer any injury of sufficient magnitude reasonably to assure that all of the relevant facts and issues will be adequately presented.citation.schmier supreme court th,d.code of civil procedure section establishes the rule that e very action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest,except as otherwise provided by statute.a real party in interest is one who has an actual and substantial interest in the subject matter of the action and who would be benefited or injured by the judgment in the action.friendly village community,silva hill constr.d.upon review of action on a demurrer,we review the determination of standing de novo.
ii.standing 
the martins causes of action relate to bca actions with regard to,or duties with respect to,the property,that is,lot owned by the petersons,as part of a planned development subject to the act.the causes of action other than the first and second seek either the enforcement of governing documents of the development,including its cc rs and r rs,or redress for violations of the act.the martins did not claim to have,and the record does not show that the martins ever had,any ownership interest in the property.as we explain below,ownership in the property is a prerequisite to standing to assert each of the causes of action as each seeks redress for violations of rights of the owners of the property,for which the causes of action are not assignable to the martins.
the martins contend they have standing on the basis that the petersons assigned to them all the petersons interests in the causes of action pursuant to section which permits an owner of a chose in action to assign it to another person where it arises out of the violation of a right of property,or out of an obligation.such types of choses in action include,for example,breach of contract or damage to personal or real property.curtis kellogg andelson th,d witkin,summary of cal.law ed.contracts.exceptions to the general rule of assignability under section are choses in action for wrongs done to the person,the reputation or the feelings of the injured party,and to contracts of a purely personal nature,like promises of marriage.fireman fund ins.mcdonald,hecht solberg th,d.
assignability under section is limited to a thing of action,a term defined in section as a right to recover money or other personal property by a judicial proceeding.by definition,t he words personal property include money,goods,chattels,things in action,and evidences of debt,and do not include lands,tenements,and hereditaments,which instead are real property.
first and second causes of action 
the first cause of action for breach of the bca lot line agreement and the second cause of action for specific performance of the agreement involve a right to recover an ownership interest in real property and not a right to recover money or other personal property.thus,contrary to the martins contentions,the first and second causes of action were not choses of action assignable under section.they could be brought only by the real parties in interest,the petersons.code civ.
the martins also claim they had standing as parties to,or third party beneficiaries of,the bca lot line agreement they rely on the facts that they negotiated the agreement and lived on the property which was affected,and accepted the terms of the agreement on behalf of themselves and the petersons.also,they claim that the letters from the bca board of directors representative and bca attorney show they were parties,in that the letters were addressed to them and phrased as if they were parties.
in the fac,however,the martins admitted that the petersons were the owners of the property and the parties to be bound by the agreement,and that the martins related actions were on behalf of the petersons.in the first cause of action,the martins state that bca agreed in writing to accept the offer made by the martins on behalf of the petersons at a board meeting,to have bca deed the property contained in lot line adjustment and lot line adjustment,to the petersons collectively,the bca lot line agreement under certain terms and conditions the martins accepted the terms of the agreement on behalf of themselves and the petersons.as a result of bca actions,the petersons were not able to landscape and hardscape their front yard and side yard because they do not yet have their ownership of the adjustment area.as a result they have lost usage of their usable yard for more than four years 
as the quoted material from the fac shows,the martins also admitted that specific performance would require bca to deed the adjustment area to the petersons,not to the martins.thus,they had no standing to assert a cause of action,as they did,seeking specific performance of the agreement to transfer title and cooperate in the approval and transfer of title to the property to plaintiffs,the martins.
the same facts that show that the martins were not parties to the agreement also show that the martins were not intended to be third party beneficiaries of the agreement.in order to qualify as third party beneficiaries,the martins were required to plead and prove that the agreement was made for their benefit.schonfeld city of vallejo d.the test in deciding whether a contract inures to the benefit of a third person is whether an intent to so benefit the third person appears from the terms of the agreement citation.ibid.the fact that a third party is incidentally named in the contract,or that the contract,if carried out according to its terms,would inure to his benefit,is not sufficient to entitle him to enforce it.jones aetna casualty surety th,d.reading the agreement as a whole in light of the circumstances under which it was made,the terms of the agreement must clearly manifest an intent to make the obligation inure to the benefit of the third party.id.at,d schonfeld,supra,at.
the martins did not attach a signed written agreement to the fac.neither did they quote the terms of the agreement in the body of the fac.even if we assume that the facts pleaded were sufficient to allege an enforceable contract,as we previously discussed,the facts pleaded by the martins were that the bca lot line agreement was made in order to require the bca to deed the adjustment area to the petersons,and the martins role was to negotiate the agreement on behalf of the petersons.given their role,there is no significance to the fact that the letters from bca board and attorney were addressed to the martins.see jones aetna casualty surety,supra,th at,d.the letter from bca board stated that the board approved the request for the corner of your lot to be deeded over to you,the petersons on the condition that the homeowners would bear the financial responsibility for costs of legal fees and moving the common area sprinklers fr
