background 
on january,ups delivered four counterfeit money orders to fisher at her belton,missouri home.each money order was made payable to melinda fisher by a christine shaw.fisher does not know a christine shaw and has never met or spoken with a christine shaw.also on january,fisher coincidentally received a money order from clarene banks,the grandmother of fisher nephew,kadeem,who lives with fisher.banks sent the money order to fisher as a birthday gift to kadeem.
fisher was suspicious that someone she did not know sent her four money orders.fisher surmised that christine shaw must have gotten her name and address from an internet website.fisher then decided to go to to cash the legitimate money order from clarene banks and check into the legitimacy of the four suspicious money orders.fisher,her infant son,her boyfriend,her cousin,and kadeem all went to the raymore.when fisher arrived at the store,she immediately went to the customer service counter and spoke with associate kristie keen.fisher first presented keen with the genuine money order,and keen cashed it.fisher then presented the four fraudulent money orders.fisher asserts that she handed the four money orders to keen and asked keen if they were real.fisher states she did not intend to cash them and only wanted to know if they were real or fake.keen was the only associate with whom fisher spoke on january.keen did not accuse fisher of committing a crime.
keen recognized the money orders as likely fraudulent and called asset protection manager,wanda gonzalez.keen then told fisher that she would need to keep the four counterfeit money orders.fisher and her group then decided to leave.keri christeson,another asset protection employee,was called to the front of the store.keen and gonzalez told christeson that a woman was trying to cash fake money orders.christeson called the raymore police department and had the following conversation with the police dispatcher 
dispatcher police department,officer stevie.
christeson oh,hi,it keri at the raymore.hey,i have a girl at the service desk trying to cash some fake money orders and,uh,officers wanted me to call em the next time this happened so they could get a little bit more information.
dispatcher allllll righty,are you guys going to keep her up there til we get there 
christeson we going to try.
dispatcher all right,i let em know.
emphasis added.
officer james junkin was in the walmart parking lot when the call came from the raymore police dispatcher stating that a person was trying to pass fraudulent checks at the service desk.after receiving the call from dispatch,officer junkin waited until people matching the description given by to the police dispatcher exited the store.officer junkin then stopped fisher and her entire group and asked for identification.officer junkin then asked them if they had been at the customer service desk.sergeant dale loney soon arrived and went into the store to investigate while officer junkin remained outside with fisher.sergeant loney testified that he spoke with gonzalez,keen,and christeson.gonzalez and keen told sergeant loney that fisher had attempted to cash counterfeit money orders.christeson confirmed that fisher brought the money orders to the service desk.christeson also gave sergeant loney the fake money orders for his inspection.
sergeant loney had worked with employees in the past and considered them reliable informants as to suspected crimes at the store.based on the purportedly fraudulent money orders and the statements from employees that fisher had attempted to cash them,sergeant loney believed that there was probable cause that fisher had committed a crime.sergeant loney then directed officer junkin to arrest fisher for attempting to commit an offense.
officer junkin arrested fisher without incident.neither nor any of its associates signed a complaint in the underlying criminal matter.the raymore city prosecutor decided to prosecute fisher for attempting to cash the counterfeit money orders.the case was later dismissed without prejudice because keen did not appear in court to testify.immediately after the suit was dismissed,fisher filed this lawsuit.fisher alleged civil claims for false arrest against both the raymore police officers and,as well as slander and intentional infliction of emotional distress and malicious prosecution against.
the district court ruled against fisher on all counts.first,the court found that although fisher was restrained against her will,the police had probable cause to do so and thus was not liable for false imprisonment for calling the police.even assuming the arrest was unlawful,the district court held that would not be liable because,as a matter of law,the employees did nothing more than provide the officers incorrect information and did not give false information knowing to it be false.the district court then concluded qualified immunity barred fisher slander claim against.the court granted summary judgment to on the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim after fisher conceded in her answer that she could not maintain the claim.the court also found that fisher claim for malicious prosecution failed because conduct was not motivated by malice.
the district court also held that fisher could not establish a violation against the police because the police had probable cause to arrest fisher.the district court awarded attorneys fees to sergeant loney and officer junkin because it found that fisher continued prosecution of her false arrest claim when there was clear probable cause was unreasonable.the court agreed that the police officers request of fees in the amount of was reasonable,but it reduced the award to due to fisher financial condition.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,fisher argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the officers on her claim abused its discretion in awarding the officers attorneys fees and erred in granting summary judgment to on her false arrest defamation and malicious prosecution claims.
section claims 
fisher first argues that the police violated her fourth amendment rights against unreasonable seizure by falsely arresting her.fisher contends that factual disputes remain as to exactly what information the police had at the time of making the arrest.fisher contends that when the evidence is viewed most favorably to her,sergeant loney did not investigate the facts before ordering officer junkin to arrest fisher and that officer junkin did not have probable cause to arrest fisher.
sergeant loney and officer junkin respond that summary judgment was appropriate because,after viewing the facts in the light most favorable to fisher,the police had probable cause to arrest fisher.the officers maintain that employees reported to raymore police that fisher was attempting to cash fake money orders sergeant loney was told by one or more employees that fisher had tried to cash the fake money orders the employees had been reliable informants about criminal activity at the store in the past and the police are not required to believe fisher claim of innocence.
fisher claim,like the three claims against that will follow,must be reviewed de novo,construing the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.johnson v.at t,cir.summary judgment is proper if the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,demonstrates that no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.thomas union pac,cir.this court may affirm the district court on any basis supported by the record.id.
a warrantless arrest is consistent with the fourth amendment if it is supported by probable cause.amrine brooks,cir.whether the police had probable cause at the time of fisher arrest is a question of law for a court to decide.peterson city of plymouth,cir.an officer has probable cause to make a warrantless arrest when the facts and circumstances are sufficient to lead a reasonable person to believe that the defendant has committed or is committing an offense.united states,cir.to determine the existence of probable cause,we look at the totality of the circumstances as set forth in the information available to the officers at the time of arrest.united states kelly,cir.as probable cause is determined at the moment the arrest was made,any later developed facts are irrelevant to the probable cause analysis for an arrest.amrine,at internal quotations and citation omitted.o fficers are generally entitled to rely on the veracity of information supplied by the victim of a crime peterson,at.
fisher argues that the evidence exculpates her and that had sergeant loney properly investigated upon arrival whether fisher attempted to cash the fake money orders,she would not have been arrested.however,o fficers are not required to conduct a before arrest amrine,at citation omitted.we consider the pertinent question to be whether,viewing the evidence in fisher favor,the raymore police and specifically sergeant loney,who instructed officer junkin to make the arrest had probable cause at the time of the arrest that is,whether the facts and circumstances would have led to a reasonable conclusion that a crime had been committed.under these facts,we find that probable cause existed to arrest her.
undisputed facts show that christeson called the raymore police and told them that a girl at the service desk is trying to cash some fake money orders.the raymore police viewed these employees as credible based upon previous experiences.christeson confidently identified fisher to sergeant loney as the person at the front desk who had brought the fake money orders.sergeant loney verified that the money orders were counterfeit.given these undisputed facts,probable cause supported the warrantless arrest.
however,we do note that a factual dispute exists as to whether sergeant loney spoke with keen and gonzalez before the arrest.sergeant loney testified that he spoke with keen,gonzalez,and christeson regarding fisher attempted passing of the fraudulent money orders.but,keen testified that she did not speak with sergeant loney 
question did you speak to sergeant loney at any time on january 
keen no sir.the only person i talked to was detective fedric.gonzalez similarly testified that she did not speak to sergeant loney 
question did you have any conversations with any of the police officers that came to the store from the raymore police department on january 
gonzalez not that i recall.
sergeant loney stated that he spoke with all three and dealt primarily with gonzalez when forming the decision to arrest fisher.we must view the facts most favorably to fisher and assume that he did not speak with either keen or gonzalez.even assuming that fact to be true,sufficient evidence still supports probable cause.in conducting a probable cause review,we determine from the totality of the circumstances whether a prudent person would believe fisher had committed or was committing a crime,giving sergeant loney substantial latitude in interpreting and drawing inferences from factual circumstances.united states.washington,cir internal quotations and citation omitted.additionally,fisher appears to concede in her complaint that sergeant loney spoke with employees regarding fisher attempted cashing of the money orders.paragraph of her first amended complaint states 
on january,employee keri christeson of store in raymore stated to employees of the raymore,missouri police department concerning the plaintiff,i have a girl at the service desk that trying to pass or cash some fake money orders,we are going to try to keep her at the service desk until the officers arrive.additionally,on that date employees keri christeson,wanda gonzalez,kristie keen stated to raymore police officers with reference to the plaintiff that she attempted to cash fake money orders or words of similar effect.
fisher argues that,under pearson callahan,we must first consider whether the police are entitled to qualified immunity before determining whether there was probable cause.we disagree.the pearson court did not review a finding of actual probable cause.id.at.rather,pearson only reviewed the denial of a claim of qualified immunity and is thus inapposite.id.here,because there is actual probable cause,we need not determine whether qualified immunity shields the officers.see foster metro.airports comm n,cir if probable cause was indeed present,it is not necessary to consider an immunity defense.analysis of the probable cause issue involves two steps.the first inquiry is whether the officers actually had probable cause to arrest fisher.peterson,at.if the officers had probable cause,the arrests did not violate the fourth amendment and the officers are not liable.id.because we conclude that the officers had probable cause,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment.
attorneys fees 
fisher appeals the district court award of attorneys fees to sergeant loney and officer junkin,arguing that because her claim was not frivolous,no award should have been given to the police officers.the officers respond that the district court did not abuse its discretion and properly awarded the attorneys fees because fisher continued to pursue a groundless and unreasonable claim.
the district court found that when fisher filed the lawsuit she sincerely believed the officers lacked probable cause to arrest her.the court did not take issue with her lack of proof to support her belief at the time she filed.however,the court found that before filing suit fisher obviously knew,or should have known that in order to prevail on an unlawful arrest claim fisher would have to prove the police arrested her without probable cause.the court went on to find textbook probable cause and held that fisher continued prosecution of her false arrest claim against the officers in the face of this evidence upon discovery was unquestionably groundless and unreasonable.
we review the district court award of fees under b for an abuse of discretion.dillon brown county,cir.an abuse of discretion occurs if the district court rests its conclusion on clearly erroneous factual findings or if its decision relies on erroneous legal conclusions.vonage holdings.pub.serv.comm n,cir.we will not disturb a district court discretionary decision if it remains within the range of choices available,accounts for all relevant factors,does not rely on any irrelevant factors,and does not constitute a clear error of judgment.id.
pursuant to,a district court may award attorney s fees to a prevailing party in a lawsuit brought to enforce a provision of.a prevailing defendant,however,is entitled to attorney s fees only in very narrow circumstances.a plaintiff should not be assessed his opponent attorneys fees unless the district court finds that his claim was frivolous,unreasonable,or groundless,or that the plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became so.even allegations that,upon careful examination,prove legally insufficient to require a trial are not,for that reason alone,groundless or without foundation rather,so long as the plaintiff has some basis for her claim,a prevailing defendant may not recover attorneys fees.
