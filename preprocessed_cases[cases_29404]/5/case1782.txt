plaintiffs and appellants steven choi and christina shea,in their capacities as directors of defendant orange county great park corporation,appeal an order denying them attorney fees under code of civil procedure section section and corporations code section,claiming the evidence showed they met each of the criteria necessary to recover such fees.we agree they were entitled to attorney fees under section and remand for the trial court to determine the amount.
facts and procedural history 
defendant is a public benefit nonprofit corporation formed in to develop the former united states marine corps air station property.it will manage over million dollars in connection with development of the great park on that property.defendant board consists of nine members,the five members of the irvine city council and four other directors chosen by the other board members.plaintiffs are minority members of the board.the three other irvine city council members,led by larry agran,are the majority in opposition to plaintiffs,and,according to an orange county grand jury report,control defendant.
for the first three years after defendant formation defendant had three ceo,each of whom was an irvine city employee.after the third ceo,marty bryant,resigned in,defendant agreed to conduct a nationwide search for a replacement.shea and a previous director of defendant,richard sim,who had been an executive with the irvine company,had recommended such a search since.
defendant formed a search committee consisting of four of the directors,including agran but not plaintiffs,and two employees of the city of irvine.the committee hired a santa recruiting firm,the mills group,to conduct a nationwide search.mills ran advertisements and obtained some names from members of the search committee to find candidates and reported it received about resumes.mills narrowed potential candidates to the top twelve and with the search committee interviewed five of them.from those five they proposed one candidate,kurt haunfelner,a of the chicago museum of science and industry,to be interviewed by the full board.before the board voted shea asked mills for copies of the resumes of the five candidates but was refused.defendant offered the position to haunfelner but he declined.
mills then notified shea that the search committee recommended the second choice candidate,rod cooper,the great park then operations manager,be offered the position.shea asked for a copy of cooper resume and for the full board to interview him but was refused.cooper withdrew his name from consideration before he was offered the position.
shortly thereafter a story in the los angeles times revealed that haunfelner was a longtime friend of agran and his late brother had been an aide to agran.this information had not been disclosed to the board prior to the vote offering haunfelner the position.the same story also reported that the most recent ceo,bryant,a irvine city employee,had an conviction for embezzling funds from the city of san juan capistrano to purchase cocaine.a subsequent story reported agran as saying it was not defendant responsibility to screen the ceo background but that it should have been done by the irvine city manager.
plaintiffs again asked to see all resumes mills had obtained during the search process.defendant refused to provide the documents because,according to agran,it had the duty to protect the privacy of the candidates and feared plaintiffs might publicly disclose the names.plaintiffs made at least two additional written demands to inspect the documents,one to which they never received a direct answer and one to which they received no reply.documents were never provided.
plaintiffs then filed a petition for writ of mandate under corporations code section and code of civil procedure section to compel defendant to produce the documents.in response the board voted seven to one to have the search committee keep the identity and resumes of the candidates confidential except for a candidate the search committee recommended be hired.defendant answered and demurred to the petition,arguing that the city of irvine was an indispensable party because it owned the documents.both the demurrer and the petition itself were set for hearing.
the day before the hearing,the parties entered into a stipulation to settle the controversy.defendant agreed to provide plaintiffs with complete copies of all materials collected or prepared by mills the s earch c ommittee in conjunction with the efforts to recruit a new ceo for the great park at a properly convened meeting of the great park board of directors authorized pursuant to government code section et brown act the parties also agreed that all information disclosed at such meeting,including without limitation the identity of the candidates,shall be treated in accordance with the brown act.the stipulation also stated defendant would provide plaintiffs with additional documents related to recruitment of the ceo as they were received or created.the city of irvine was not a party to the stipulation.
plaintiffs filed a motion to recover attorney fees under section and corporations code section.in denying the award the court stated it did not know who plaintiffs prevailed over.they certainly have not prevailed in the traditional sense of a lawsuit because there is no judgment.there is nothing of a character that would represent that there was adjudication of the case.i do think it was adjudicated.it was settled it was probably a reasonable solution to the problem,but handing out for a settlement of this sort just strikes me as being a radical of what the concept of prevailing parties means under the circumstances of this case.the court also described the settlement as a meeting in a closed door room where a lot of people went through a lot of documents that were disclosed to the public and stated it could not identify any vast public benefit resulting from it.it reiterated,basically two people went into a room which no one else was allowed to go into and they spent some time doing this and that.that does strike me as a public benefit which can be quantified,publicized.the court did not rule on the argument that fees should be awarded under corporations code section.
discussion 
section introduction 
section provides that a prevailing party may recover attorney fees when its action has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest a significant benefit has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement make the award appropriate and the interest of justice dictates the fees should not be paid out of the recovery.
whether the applicant for attorney fees has proved section elements is a matter primarily vested in the trial court.citation.we review the entire record,attentive to the trial court stated reasons in denying the fees and to whether it applied the proper standards of law in reaching its decision.citation.we will reverse the trial court decision only if there has been a prejudicial abuse of discretion,when there has been a manifest miscarriage of justice or where no reasonable basis for the action is shown.citation.real estate business trust city council of city of san marcos th,d.in our review we must determine whether the grounds given by the court for its denial of an award are consistent with the substantive law of section and,if so,whether their application to the facts of th e case is within the range of discretion conferred upon the trial courts under section,read in light of the purposes and policy of the statute.citation.families unafraid to uphold rural el dorado county board of supervisors th,d.
plaintiffs contend the court erred in failing to award them attorney fees under section and we agree.each of the factors has been satisfied.
prevailing party 
plaintiffs assert they prevailed because they obtained the result they sought in the petition,access to the documents.they are correct.the stipulation provided plaintiffs would be given complete copies of all material used in the selection process and set out a detailed list of those documents,
