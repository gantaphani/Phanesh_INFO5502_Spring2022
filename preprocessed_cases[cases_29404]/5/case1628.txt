after prevailing in its action against wellmike to recover unpaid attorney fees,the soni firm sought to recover attorney fees as the prevailing party,pursuant to the attorney fee provision in the retainer agreement.soni contended he was a sole practitioner who retained other attorneys to represent his interests.the trial court denied recovery on the ground attorney fees were not recoverable because soni operated as a law firm which was represented in this litigation by employees or associates of the firm,rather than by outside counsel.trope katz cal th trope carpenter zuckerman,llp cohen th carpenter.
substantial evidence supports the trial court determination soni operated as a law firm and that the attorneys who represented the law firm in this action were its employees.because the law firm was represented by its own employees or associates,the trial court properly held attorney fees were not recoverable by soni.the order is affirmed.
factual and procedural background 
soni performed legal services for wellmike.soni later sued wellmike to recover unpaid legal fees,and sought damages of.soni fully prevailed.following a nonjury trial,the trial court awarded soni damages for breach of contract in the amount of.the judgment entered february,provided attorney fees and costs were to be requested by formal motion.
on or about march,soni filed a motion for attorney fees,seeking as the fees it allegedly incurred in connection with this case.soni invoked paragraph of its attorney client agreement,which states in relevant part collection expenses collections expenses legal fees incurred in the collection of overdue balances including fees for the soni law firm attorney,law clerk and paralegal time,to the extent authorized by law will be paid by the delinquent client.such expenses and fees shall include those of our personnel as well as those of any outside agency which we may employ.italics added.
soni moving papers acknowledged the general rule that a party can not recover fees for.however,soni contended soni is a sole proprietorship and did not represent himself.rather,he was represented by other attorneys and he is entitled to recover the fees for their work.
in opposition,wellmike argued that soni attorney fee provision limited recovery of the fees of its own personnel to the extent authorized by law.here,soni,the law firm plaintiff,represented itself through its personnel,and therefore was prohibited from recovering attorney fees incurred in prosecuting its lawsuit.wellmike contended soni was trying to circumvent the prohibition on recovery of attorney fees for by claiming that as a sole proprietorship,the soni law firm was not a law firm but merely a dba of soni,and therefore any fees paid to attorneys richardson,lundberg and perez were fees attributable to the representation of soni rather than the soni firm.
wellmike cited the deposition testimony of soni to show that attorneys richardson,lundberg and perez were employees of the soni firm and that they worked on this case for the interest of the firm.wellmike further argued that in any event,the amount of the fee request was excessive.
on april,the matter came on for hearing and was taken under submission.later,the trial court entered an order denying soni motion for attorney fees,stating although the soni law firm is identified as the fictitious business name for soni,there is ample evidence that it operates as a law firm and that the attorneys who represented the law firm in this action are its employees.citation.therefore,based on the rule set forth in trope katz cal th and carpenter zuckerman cohen th,attorney fees are not recoverable because the law firm was represented by an employee or associate of the firm.
this appeal followed.

soni contends he was not and therefore was entitled to an award of attorney fees as the prevailing party.soni basic contention is that the trial court erroneously viewed soni as a firm,rather than as an individual doing business under a fictitious name,and treated the fiction of a dba as it if were a separate entity.

overview of pertinent case law.
no recovery of attorney fees by pro se attorney litigants.
the issue presented on appeal involves a line of cases dealing with attorney fee awards to attorney litigants,beginning with the supreme court decision in trope,supra,cal th.
in that case,a law firm acting in propria persona successfully sued the firm former client to recover unpaid fees.id.at.following entry of judgment in their favor,the attorney plaintiffs moved for an award of attorney fees under the attorney fees provision in the retainer agreement.ibid.the trial court denied the motion on the ground the law firm had represented itself in the litigation,and the court of appeal affirmed.ibid.
on review,the supreme court framed the issue as whether an attorney who chooses to represent himself and therefore does not pay or become liable to pay any sum out of pocket for such representation can nevertheless recover reasonable attorney fees under civil code section as compensation for the time and effort expended and the professional business opportunities lost as a result.trope,supra,cal th at.
trope concluded that to allow pro se attorney litigants to recover fees to compensate them for their time would result in disparate treatment of attorney and nonattorney pro se litigants,and reasoned as follows let us assume for the sake of discussion that an attorney litigant devotes as much time and effort to litigating a matter on his own behalf as he does to litigating a case on behalf of a client,and that his time is equally valuable whether he is acting on behalf of himself or of a client.it does not necessarily follow from this premise,however,that he is entitled to receive compensation from his opponent simply because the time he devotes to litigating a matter on his own behalf has value.the time that a doctor,for example,spends litigating a case on his own behalf also has value,both to the doctor himself and to society generally,for that time could otherwise be spent treating the sick or pursuing medical research for the benefit of all an architect time could otherwise be spent designing or building houses a painter time could be spent creating works of art for future generations to enjoy.however,it is clear that when it enacted civil code section the legislature did not intend to allow doctors,architects,painters,or any other nonattorneys to receive compensation for the valuable time they spend litigating a contract matter on their own behalf.citations.there is no support in either the language or legislative history of civil code section for disparate treatment of pro se litigants on the basis of their occupations.id.at.
trope explained the system would be,and would be viewed by the public as unfair,if one party a lawyer litigant could qualify for a fee award without incurring the potential obligation that the opposing party a nonlawyer ordinarily must bear in order to qualify for a similar award,without paying or becoming liable to pay consideration in exchange for legal representation.moreover,if both parties opt to litigate pro se,it would be palpably unjust for one of them the lawyer litigant to remain eligible for an attorney fee award,while the other becomes ineligible in our view,the public perception of fairness in the legal system is of greater moment than a lawyer litigant claim to an attorney fee award if he elects to represent himself.citations.trope,supra,cal th at.
trope rule does not preclude corporate litigant from recovering for services of counsel.
the supreme court in plcm group,drexler cal th plcm decided an issue unresolved by trope whether a corporate litigant represented by counsel,counsel who is an employee of the party,can recover attorney fees under civil code section based on the services of that counsel.in plcm,a claims administrator plcm for an insured attorney malpractice carriers sued the attorney to recover amounts advanced on his behalf to his defense attorneys in the underlying malpractice action.plcm,supra,cal th at.plcm contended the amounts it had advanced were within the malpractice policy deductible.ibid.plcm was represented in the collection action by counsel.id.at.following a verdict in its favor,plcm moved for a fee award based upon the services rendered by its counsel.id.at.the attorney defendant moved to tax costs on the ground,inter alia,attorney fees could not be awarded for those services.ibid.the trial court awarded plcm the requested fees,and the court of appeal affirmed.ibid.
in affirming the award of attorney fees,the supreme court in plcm,supra,cal th,concluded that none of the factors that supported the denial of the fee award to the pro se attorney litigant in trope,supra,cal th,was present in the case before it.there is no problem in this case of disparate treatment attorneys,like private counsel but unlike pro se litigants,do not represent their own personal interests and are not seeking remuneration simply for lost opportunity costs that could not be recouped by a nonlawyer.a corporation represented by counsel is in an agency relationship,it has hired an attorney to provide professional legal services on its behalf.nor is there any impediment to the effective and successful prosecution of meritorious claims because of possible ethical conflict or emotional investment in the outcome.the fact that counsel is employed by the corporation does not alter the fact of representation by an independent third party.instead,the payment of a salary to attorneys is analogous to hiring a private firm on a retainer.plcm,supra,cal th at.
attorney litigant represented by other members of his or her firm in a personal matter may recover fees.
in gilbert master washer stamping th gilbert,a case which soni contends is directly on point,the court held a lawyer represented by other members of his law firm is entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees where the representation involved the lawyer personal interests and not those of the firm.id.at,italics added.in gilbert,the tenant in a consolidated case sued his landlord and the landlord attorney,gernsbacher,alleging,inter alia,that gernsbacher had wrongfully prevented the tenant from recovering its property from the leased premises.ibid.gernsbacher alleged misconduct involved gernsbacher personal interests and not those of his firm.ibid.gernsbacher obtained a judgment in his favor and filed a motion for an order fixing attorney fees as costs.id.at.the trial court,citing trope,supra,cal th,denied gernsbacher attorney fees motion on the ground he was represented by his own law firm.ibid.
the appellate court reversed,concluding trope did not support the trial court denial of attorney fees to gernsbacher,who had been represented by other attorneys in his firm.having examined the policy considerations leading to the trope and plcm group decisions,we apply those considerations to the case before us.we hold gernsbacher,as an attorney litigant represented by other attorneys in his firm,is not a litigant in propria persona and thus trope does not bar his recovery of reasonable attorney fees under civil code section.gilbert,supra,th at.
in reaching this conclusion,the court in gilbert reasoned that an attorney who is represented by other attorneys in his firm incurs fees within the meaning of civil code section.either the represented attorney will experience a reduced draw from the partnership or a reduced salary from the professional corporation to account for the amount of time his or her partners or colleagues have specifically devoted to his or her representation,or absorb a share of the reduction in other income the firm experiences because of the time spent on the case.this is different from the opportunity costs the attorney loses while he or she is personally involved in the same case,because the economic detriment is caused not by the expenditure of his or her own time,but by other attorneys working on his or her behalf.gilbert,supra,th at carpenter,supra,th at.
a similar case on which soni relies is gorman tassajara development th gorman.gorman held that trope did not bar an attorney litigant from recovering fees incurred for the services of other attorneys and paralegals hired by the attorney to represent him,even if those other attorneys and paralegals worked for the attorney litigant law firm.id.at.in that case,two homeowners,attorney gorman and his wife,sued a contractor and numerous others alleging defective construction of the plaintiffs residence.gorman,supra,th at.attorney gorman and his firm represented the plaintiffs.id.at.during the course of the litigation,the gorman firm associated in the law firm of bowman and brooke.the plaintiffs also retained attorney alwaya to render opinions about insurance coverage.in addition,attorney janke appeared at several depositions on behalf of plaintiffs.id.at.certain defendants,including the contractor,entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs that included a provision that the plaintiffs were entitled to apply for an award of attorney fees and costs.id.at.
the gorman court ruled the plaintiffs could not recover fees for the time attorney gorman personally spent representing himself and his wife.id.at.but,relying on gilbert,supra,th,the gorman court held the plaintiffs could recover attorney fees for the time expended by other attorneys the plaintiffs hired to represent them,including attorneys and paralegals in gorman law firm.id.at.we do not understand contractor on appeal to renew its efforts to distinguish gilbert.it argues only that nothing in the gilbert case supports the view that plaintiffs in this case are entitled to recover fees for the work performed personally by appellant gorman.we believe that trope supra,cal th does not preclude the recovery of fees for other attorneys and paralegals hired by attorney gorman to represent him,even if they work in his law firm.citations.gorman,supra,th at.
no recovery of attorney fees where law firm is represented by members of the firm.
witte kaufman th witte,reversed an award of attorney fees to a law firm,kla,whose attorneys represented the firm on a successful special motion to strike.witte reasoned here,unlike plcm group and gilbert,but like trope,there is no relationship between kla and its individual attorneys.the individual kla attorneys are not comparable to counsel for a corporation,hired solely for the purpose of representing the corporation.the attorneys of kla are the law firm product.when they represent the law firm,they are representing their own interests.as such,they are comparable to a sole practitioner representing himself or herself.where,as in gilbert,an attorney is sued in his or her individual capacity and he obtains representation from other members of his or her law firm,those other members have no personal stake in the matter and may,in fact,charge for their work.not so with a law firm that is sued in its own right and appears through various members.id.at,italics added.
thus,witte is consistent with the basic rule in trope,disallowing recovery by a law firm which represents itself in litigation.
no right to attorney fees where law firm and its partners are represented by an associate in a matter involving the interests of their firm.
we conclude our survey of pertinent case law with carpenter,supra,th.there,the trial court held a law firm and its two partners,who had been represented in litigation by an associate of the firm,had in effect represented t
