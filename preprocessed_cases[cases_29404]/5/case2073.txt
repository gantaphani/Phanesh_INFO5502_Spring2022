ii.background 
defendant special motion to strike was directed at the complaint filed by peggy soukup,plaintiff,alleging abuse of process and malicious prosecution.in an underlying action,herbert hafif,cynthia hafif,greg hafif the hafifs,and the law offices of herbert hafif the hafif firm sued plaintiff.defendant was one of the attorneys who represented the hafifs and the hafif firm in the underlying action against plaintiff.the underlying lawsuit involved allegations that plaintiff here,soukup,a former employee of the hafif firm,had disclosed to a third party confidential information obtained during her employment.the disclosure was purportedly made in furtherance of a conspiracy to defame the hafif firm.the underlying lawsuit was dismissed in response to a section special motion to strike.
our colleagues in the fourth appellate district,division three,affirmed the order granting the special motion to strike.law offices of herbert hafif et soukup et april,nonpub.opn.in an unpublished opinion,the court of appeal held the trial court erred in considering the plaintiffs subjective motives for bringing the action,but the error was harmless the allegedly actionable conduct consisted of soukup complaints to the department of labor,which statements were within the protective purview of section and the plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of establishing a probability of succeeding on their claims against soukup.ibid.the complaint in the present suit alleged that the underlying lawsuit was brought in order to obtain collateral advantage so that plaintiff would withdraw a complaint she had made to the united states department of labor and not pursue an erisa action.further,it was alleged the underlying lawsuit was brought to destroy plaintiff credibility in other disputes without probable cause and maliciously.
in response to plaintiff complaint,defendant filed a special motion to strike.the trial court denied the special motion to strike.the trial court concluded that the special motion to strike procedure did not apply to an attorney representing a party in another lawsuit.
iii.discussion 
applicable legal principles and standard of review 
a special motion to strike may be filed in response to a meritless suit filed primarily to chill the defendant exercise of first amendment rights.dove audio,rosenfeld,meyer susman th,d,quoting wilcox superior court th,fn,d,disapproved on another point in equilon enterprises,llc consumer cause,cal th,fn,d.enacted in,section,authorizes a court to summarily dismiss such meritless suits.stats,ch.the purpose of the statute was set forth in section,subdivision a as follows the legislature finds and declares that there has been a disturbing increase in lawsuits brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances.the legislature finds and declares that it is in the public interest to encourage continued participation in matters of public significance,and that this participation should not be chilled through abuse of the judicial process 
under section,any cause of action against a person arising from any act in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue must be stricken unless the court finds a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on whatever claim is involved,subd.b equilon enterprises,llc consumer cause,supra,cal th at,d,dowling zimmerman th,d.section,subdivision e provides as used in this section,act in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue includes any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative,executive,or judicial proceeding,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive,or judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest or any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.in order to protect the constitutional rights of petition and free speech,the statute is to be construed broadly,subd.a briggs eden council for hope opportunity cal th,d,averill superior court th,d.
when a special motion to strike is filed,the trial court must consider two components.first,the court must consider whether the moving defendant has sustained its burden of showing that the lawsuit falls within the purview of section,arises from protected activity.the moving defendant has the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case that plaintiff cause of action arises out of actions in the furtherance of the rights of petition or free speech,subd.b equilon enterprises,llc consumer cause,supra,cal th at,d,mission oaks ranch,county of santa barbara th,d,disapproved on another point in briggs eden council for hope opportunity,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
second,once the defendant meets this burden,the obligation then shifts to the plaintiff to establish a probability that she or he will prevail on the merits,subd.b equilon enterprises,llc consumer cause,supra,cal th at,d,briggs eden council for hope opportunity,supra,cal th at,d.the moving defendant has no obligation to demonstrate that the plaintiff subjective intent was to chill the exercise of constitutional speech or petition rights.navellier sletten cal th,d,equilon enterprises,llc consumer cause,supra,cal th at,d.nor must a moving defendant show that the action had the effect of chilling free speech or petition rights.navellier sletten,supra,cal th at,d,city of cotati cashman cal th,d.as to the second step of the special motion to strike process,the supreme court in jarrow formulas,lamarche cal th,d,described the trial judge duties as follows i f a court ruling on a special motion to strike concludes the challenged cause of action arises from protected petitioning,it then determines whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.equilon,supra,cal th at d.to satisfy this prong,the plaintiff must state and substantiate a legally sufficient claim.rosenthal great western fin.securities cal th,d.put another way,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.wilson parker,covert chidester cal th,d.we conduct independent review of the trial court decision.paul for council hanyecz th,d,disapproved on another point in equilon enterprises,llc consumer cause,supra,cal th at,fn,d,mission oaks ranch,county of santa barbara,supra,th at,d.
b.the order denying the special motion to strike should have been granted 
plaintiff argues the special motion to strike was correctly denied because the underlying lawsuit did not arise out of an act in furtherance of defendant petition or free expression rights,subd.b.we disagree.all of plaintiff claims arise out of the underlying lawsuit which was dismissed pursuant to section.plaintiff was counsel for the hafifs and the hafif firm in the underlying lawsuit.as we will explain,the present action arises out of defendant exercise of free expression rights on behalf of clients,the hafifs and the hafif firm.
no doubt the present lawsuit against the hafifs and the hafif firm arises out of the exercise of their petition rights.jarrow formulas lamarche,supra,cal th at,d,navellier sletten,supra,cal th at,d.the issue as to defendant is slightly different.rather,defendant was not a party in the underlying lawsuit,he is alleged to have been counsel for the hafifs and the hafif firm.in shekhter financial indemnity th,d,we discussed the situation where a plaintiff sues both the lawyer and client for litigation related conduct in an underlying lawsuit.we recognized that the application of a section special motion to strike a complaint naming an attorney and a client may not be the same.we noted as to whether kass and the manning law firm,as the lawyers for financial and allstate,had standing to bring the special motion to strike,this issue is resolved by the language of section subdivision b which states in pertinent part a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike italics added.as can be noted,the italicized language requires that the defendant be the individual who is or was being sued for exercise of that person right of petition or free expression.shekhter financial indemnity,supra,th at,d.in shekhter,we held that the attorney and his law firm were entitled to specially move to strike pursuant to section.in shekhter,in addition to representing several clients,insurance companies,in another lawsuit,the attorney and his law firm exercised free expression rights independent of their representation in the underlying litigation.in shekhter,we noted that the alleged tort claims based upon contact by the attorney and the law firm with broadcasting outlets and a nationally syndicated journalist.id.at,d.in shekhter,we concluded that the lawyer and his law firm were exercising their own free expression rights when communicating with journalists outside of the courtroom.but we did not resolve the question of whether an attorney could secure the benefit of section while merely representing a client interests in litigation.
the present case poses the issue we did not conclusively decide in shekhter whether an attorney may rely upon his or her exercise of free expression rights while providing legal representation in an underlying lawsuit as a basis for a special motion to strike in subsequent litigation.under the facts of the present case,we conclude that defendant can secure the benefit of the special motion to strike remedy.as in shekhter,our conclusion is premised upon the express language of section,subdivision b,which restricts the application of a special motion to strike to a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of free speech.italics added.when defendant,acting as an advocate,filed papers and presented arguments in the underlying litigation,his advocacy activities arose out of the exercise of the right of free expression.the constitutional right of free expression arises in a variety of situations.ward rock against racism,d music buckley valeo,d political contributions doran salem inn,d dancing spence state of washington,d placing an symbol on an american flag.the supreme court has held that the right of free expression arising in the context of litigation should be given the widest range compatible with the essential requirement of the fair and orderly administration of justice.pennekamp florida.further,other first amendment rights including those of free press and assembly exist in the courtroom,albeit they are qualified.richmond newspapers,virginia,d lead opinion of burger,subject to the traditional time,place,and manner restrictions,citations streets,sidewalks,and parks are places traditionally open,where first amendment rights may be exercised,citation a trial courtroom also is a public place where the people representatives of the a right to be present see state,public and the press have fewer speech restrictions than lawyers participating in judicial proceedings.finally,the first amendment applies to lawyers communications with clients in determining what challenges to raise inside the courtroom.legal services velazquez,d congressional limitations on issues that may permissibly be raised by legal services lawyers constitutes a serious and fundamental restriction on advocacy of attorneys thereby violating the first amendment.
we need not decide whether the first amendment applied to all of defendant actions as an advocate on behalf of the hafifs and the hafif firm.rather,the question is whether,in the words of section,subdivision b,defendant advocacy actions can be categorized as arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of free speech as noted in the immediately preceding paragraph,subject to restrictions not necessarily present elsewhere,the right of free expression applies to conduct by a lawyer.a lawyer advocates on behalf of a client and against an adversary.the lawyer advocates orally and in writing.all of the courtroom advocacy involves activities in a public place before a governmental body.as noted previously,section,subdivision e states in pertinent part that the term act in furtherance of a person right of free speech includes the following any written or oral statement or writing made before a judicial proceeding any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest or any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.the california supreme court has construed this language in section,subdivision e as follows,p lainly read,section encompasses any cause of action against a person arising from any statement or writing made in,or in connection with an issue under consideration or review by,an official proceeding or body.citation.jarrow formulas,lamarche,supra,cal th at,d,citing briggs eden council for hope opportunity,supra,cal th at,d.defendant written and oral advocacy on behalf of the hafifs and the hafif firm arose from this form of conduct delineated in briggs.
the foregoing language in briggs is fully supported by the facts in that case.the defendant in briggs was described by the supreme court thusly,defendant eden council for hope and opportunity,a nonprofit corporation partly funded by city and county grants,counsels tenants and mediates disputes.briggs eden council for hope opportunity,supra,cal th at,d.in briggs,the supreme court recognize such when it held according to plaintiffs,section protects only statements or writings that defend the speaker or writer own free speech or petition rights or that are otherwise vital to allow citizens to make informed decisions within a government office.plaintiffs insist tenant counseling activities like defendant are not protected by section because they neither promoted defendant own constitutional right of free speech nor informed the public about possible wrongdoing.even assuming,for purposes of argument,that plaintiffs accurately have characterized defendant activities as constituting neither nor general political speech,we can not conclude such activities thereby necessarily fall outside the protection of the statute.contrary to plaintiffs implied suggestion,the statute does not require that a defendant moving to strike under section demonstrate that its protected statements or writings were made on its own behalf rather than,for example,on behalf of its clients or the general public.briggs eden council for hope opportunity,supra,cal th at,d,italics original and added.
we acknowledge that the question directly before the supreme court in briggs was whether for purposes of section a statement made before or in connection with an issue under consideration in a legally authorized official proceeding must be one of public significance.briggs eden council for hope opportunity,supra,cal th at,d.the issue here,the availability of the special motion to strike procedure to a lawyer sued for conduct in an underlying lawsuit,is different.but our colleague presiding justice arthur gilbert has explained the language in briggs set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph requires that section be available to a malicious prosecution defendant who acted as counsel in an underlying lawsuit.white lieberman th,d.we are persuaded by presiding justice gilbert analysis.further,as we noted in shekhter financial indemnity,supra,th at page,d,the special motion to strike was available to a lawyer and a law firm representing clients who exercised free speech rights while speaking to journalists.no sound justification exists for limiting the availability of a section special motion to strike to a lawyer speaking only outside of the courtroom to a journalist.this is particularly true because the first amendment,subject to restrictions not present elsewhere,applies to advocacy conduct in and out of a courtroom.because defendant demonstrated that the claims against him arose out of the exercise of his own first amendment free expression rights,his conduct as an advocate while speaking and writing on behalf of the hafifs and the hafif firm,he has sustained his initial burden pursuant to section,subdivision b when the statute is broadly construed.hence,the burden of proof shifted to plaintiff to show the probability she will prevail on her malicious prosecution and legal malpractice claims.
attorney fees 
plaintiff argues that defendant is not entitled to an award of attorney fees pursuant to section,subdivision c because he represented himself on appeal and in the trial court.section,subdivision c states in any action subject to subdivision b,a prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike shall be entitled to recover his or her attorney fees and costs.if the court finds that a special motion to strike is frivolous or is solely intended to cause unnecessary delay,the court shall award costs and reasonable attorney fees to a plaintiff prevailing on the motion,pursuant to section.we agree with plaintiff that defendant may not recover attorney fees for the time he spent working on this matter.but if defendant secured legal assistance from another lawyer,plaintiff may be liable for those fees.
our analysis in this regard largely parallels that used by the california supreme court in trope katz cal th,d,a decision holding that a lawyer who represented himself in a lawsuit could not recover his attorney fees pursuant to civil code section,subdivision a.as was principally the case in trope,whether an attorney successfully litigating a special motion to strike in pro se may recover section,subdivision c attorney fees is an issue of statutory interpretation.the pertinent rules of statutory interpretation were specified in trope as follows we begin as always with the fundamental premise that the objective of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.burden snowden cal th,d.to discover that intent we first look to the words of the statute,giving them their usual and ordinary meaning.granberry islay investments cal th,d,dafonte,cal th,d.where the words of the statute are clear,we may not add to or alter them to accomplish a purpose that does not appear on the face of the statute or from its legislative history.burden snowden,supra,cal th,d.trope katz,supra,cal th at,d.additionally,in trope,the supreme court relied on the general rule that when a law contains judicially construed terms,it is presumed the legislature intended those words to have their established legal meanings.id.at,d,western states petroleum superior court cal th,d.
in trope,the supreme court explained the ordinary meaning of the term attorney fees as follows black law dictionary defines the word fee generally as a recompense for an official or professional service or a charge or emolument or compensation for a particular act or service.a fixed charge or perquisite charged as recompense for labor reward,compensation,or wage given to a person for performance of services or something done or to be done.black law dict.ed.it goes on to define the phrase attorney fees as a charge to client for services performed hourly fee,flat fee,contingency fee.ibid.similarly,webster defines the word fee as compensation often in the form of a fixed charge for professional service or for special and requested exercise of talent or of skill.webster new internat,ed see also oxford english dict.ed fee denotes a payment,such as the remuneration paid or due to a lawyer,a physician,or in recent use any professional man,a director of a public company,for an occasional service.accordingly,the usual and ordinary meaning of the words attorney fees,both in legal and in general usage,is the consideration that a litigant actually pays or becomes liable to pay in exchange for legal representation.an attorney litigating in propria persona pays no such compensation.trope katz,supra,cal th at,d.
additionally,in trope,the supreme court examined its own jurisprudence and that of the courts of appeal commencing with carriere minturn cal.these decisions consistently held in varying contexts that a lawyer appearing in pro se could not recover attorney fees.in trope,the supreme court noted that california courts had refused to award lawyers appearing in pro se their attorney fees in the context of mortgage agreements patterson donner cal,bank of woodland treadwell cal,inverse condemnation city of long beach sten cal,and an interpleader action.zimmerman d.
given in part of the foregoing analysis in trope,the supreme court concluded these cases are significant for two reasons.first,they support our conclusion that the usual and ordinary meaning of the words reasonable attorney fees is the consideration that a litigant pays or becomes liable to pay in exchange for legal representation.second,they demonstrate that the words attorney fees and counsel fees,whether used in a contract or in a statute,had an established legal meaning at the time the legislature enacted section.in the absence of some indication either on the face of that statute or in its legislative history that the legislature intended its words to convey something other than their established legal definition,the presumption is almost irresistible that the legislature intended them to have that meaning.western states petroleum superior court,supra,cal th at,d,people weidert cal d.trope katz,supra,cal th at,d.
trope is directly pertinent to the issue of whether a pro se lawyer who is a defendant may recover section,subdivision c attorney fees.trope addressed the state of the law concerning the statutory and contract rights to attorney fees of a pro se litigant who is a lawyer prior to the adoption of civil code section.stats,ch,the right of a prevailing defendant to section,subdivision c attorney fees was enacted in when the special motion to strike remedy was first adopted.nothing of substance changed in terms of a pro se lawyer right to recover attorney fees between when civil code section was adopted and when section,subdivision c was enacted.the logical force of the analysis concerning a pro se attorney statutory right to recover legal fees in trope applies equally to the present case.therefore,in,when the legislature adopted section,subdivision c,the usual and ordinary meaning of the term attorney fees excluded an pro se litigant who was also a lawyer attempting to recoup legal fees.trope katz,supra,cal th at,d.further,commencing in in carriere minturn,supra,cal.at page,california courts had consistently developed a body of jurisprudence that barred a pro se lawyer from recovering attorney fees.trope katz,supra,cal th at,d.under these circumstances,in the absence of an expressed different intent,it is presumed the legislature intended that the term attorney fees in section,subdivision c be given this meaning as in trope.id.at,d,western states petroleum superior court,supra,cal th at,d.we have carefully reviewe
