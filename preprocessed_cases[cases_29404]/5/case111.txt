companies,and the companies,together successfully defended themselves against a lawsuit brought by plaintiffs invessys,invessys,and peter hodges.one of the claims in the complaint was for copyright infringement and,at the end of the case,the district court awarded attorney fees and costs to under the copyright act.plaintiffs now appeal,contesting the award.
the background facts are as follows.during the spring of,became interested in selling a subsidiary called micropal accounting portfolio services,mapsi.mapsi primary business was the licensing and support of a software program called maps.hodges,who was an employee of the subsidiary that owned mapsi standard poor fund services,s p expressed interest in purchasing mapsi.
negotiations between hodges and for the sale of mapsi began in the fall of.the lead negotiator for was kevin thornton,then the managing director of s p.at some point in the negotiations,hodges requested that maps predecessor programs be included in the deal.thornton agreed,and,because the additional programs hodges sought were considered obsolete,directed that they be added to the terms of a draft sales agreement for no additional consideration.
when lawyer susan winter added the predecessor programs to the draft agreement,she also included a program called aim,which was not obsolete,was not a part of the maps line of programs,and in fact generated millions of dollars in revenue for hodges had expressed interest in the aim program to manager adrian manning,who had referred hodges to thornton.hodges would later claim that he spoke with thornton about aim and obtained his agreement to include the program in the deal thornton would deny that hodges ever approached him about aim.
the draft its reference to the aim reviewed several times by thornton and other officials before it was executed by the parties on may.the final purchase price was,and no official raised any objection to the specification of the aim program as among those being transferred.after the sale was completed,hodges conveyed his rights to mapsi and aim to invessys.hodges is invessys sole shareholder,sole officer,sole director,and sole employee.
on august,hodges called thornton to arrange a meeting for the following day.at the meeting,hodges asked thornton for access to data feeds that were necessary to market the aim software.thornton claimed that he had not been aware that aim had been included in the terms of the sales agreement.after examination of the document,took the position that,under new york law,inclusion of aim was a scrivener error and maintained that it still owned the rights to aim.
on november,hodges and invessys filed suit against in the federal district court for the district of massachusetts.the suit alleged copyright federal claim under the copyright well as breach of contract and a medley of other state law claims fraud,conversion,and claims under.laws ch.because the parties agreed that the scrivener error issue was central,the district court directed that only the state law claims proceed to trial,the copyright claim being held in abeyance.
at trial,the principal witnesses were hodges,winter,manning,and thornton.the gist of plaintiffs case was that there had been a knowing sale of aim by defendants position was that inclusion of aim was patently a scrivener error by winter and that the parties true intentions required reform of the contract to exclude aim under well established legal doctrine.see george backer mgmt.acme quilting,corbin on contracts ed.
after the close of evidence,the court presented the jury with a single initial question 
have the defendants proven by clear and convincing evidence,that the inclusion of aim in the share purchase agreement was a scrivener error that did not reflect the actual agreement of the parties 
the jury answered yes,and the district court entered judgment for on all claims,including the claim of copyright infringement.thereafter,the court awarded in attorney fees and in costs under section,finding that plaintiffs claim of copyright infringement was objectively unreasonable and improperly motivated.
in its award,the district court declined to make any reduction despite plaintiffs claim and defendants admission that much,if not all,of the legal work performed in the case had application to the state law claims as well as the copyright claim.the district court included in its award payments by defense counsel for legal research.the court also made the award run against hodges personally as well as invessys.plaintiffs now appeal,challenging the award itself and each of the ancillary rulings.
section provides 
in any civil action under this title,the court in its discretion may allow the recovery of full costs by or against any party other than the united states or an officer thereof.except as otherwise provided by this title,the court may also award a reasonable attorney fee to the prevailing party as part of the costs.
unlike most statutes,section allows attorney fees to be awarded to defendants on an basis with plaintiffs.fogerty fantasy,d lotus dev.borland int l,cir.fogerty said that the award rested in the trial court discretion and that there was no formula,but that factors that could be taken into consideration included inter alia the objective unreasonableness of the losing side position.at.
although fee awards are nominally reviewed on appeal for abuse of discretion,matthews freedman,cir,an award can also depend on legal issues that are reviewed de novo.see united states,cir.plaintiffs broadest position,which falls in the latter category,is that no award was permitted because the trial was directed only to state law claims and turned on a state law issue at the very least,say plaintiffs,the costs had to be allocated and that most concerned the ownership issue rather than anything peculiar to copyright.
the statute,drafted with claims under the copyright act in mind,does not expressly address the problem of a case with a mix of claims.however,here a federal copyright claim was asserted in the complaint,so this is literally a civil action under this title the copyright act,and the case law has used common sense to carry out congress underlying intent to provide for attorney fees in copyright enforcement or like matters but not for other civil claims that do not involve copyright.see entm t research group,genesis creative group,cir,cert.denied,d.
implementing that intent presents the recurring problem of form versus substance.the only claims posed for trial were state law claims most importantly,a contract claim and the only issue decided was ownership of aim,turning on state law rules as to contract and reformation.ownership of a copyright is a predicate to a federal copyright claim,see b feist publ ns,rural.serv,d,but the rules governing contractual transfer of ownership have been left for the most part to state law 
yet the question of ownership of aim was common to both the plaintiffs claim under the copyright act and their claims under state law.if plaintiffs lost as to ownership,all claims failed.the fact that the district court chose to extract this common issue and try it first,nominally deferring the copyright claim,does not alter the fact that the copyright claim was in the case and depended on the ownership issue being tried.had plaintiffs complaint set forth only the copyright claim,exactly the same contractual issue would have had to be tried.
had plaintiffs never asserted a copyright claim but only claims under state law,it would be hard to describe this as a civil action under that statute.but here a copyright claim was made,thereby permitting copyright act remedies,and the issue actually litigated was necessary to the assertion of that claim.so it serves congress purpose to compensate the winning side for attorney fees and costs.maljack,goodtimes home video,cir.
plaintiffs argue that because the ownership issue is governed by state law,it can not carry out the purposes of the copyright act to award attorney fees and costs.we think this is too cramped a reading of the statute.on the contrary,in section congress aimed to provide a potential incentive to the winner who asserts a successful copyright claim or defends against an unworthy one.this practical concern is present whether the case happens to decide a landmark issue of copyright law or,in the end,turns on matters that have nothing to do with the statute.
consider that a copyright case may turn solely on a question of fact such as whether the defendant copied a protected work or stumbled on the same jingle by chance.or a copyright case might be won because the defendant failed to answer the complaint or be lost because of a discovery violation by the procedure questions in which copyright law plays no part.yet in both sets of cases,surely the winner could claim attorney fees and costs subject as always to the trial court discretionary judgment.see mcgaughey twentieth century fox film,cir.
plaintiffs also argue that,at a minimum,there should have been an allocation of fees and costs between the copyright and state law claims.if there were any indication that significant extra moneys were expended by the defense because of the presence of state law claims,we would agree that allocation was required.see entm t research group,at.that could easily be so if,for example,independent issues were raised and litigated as to fraud that were unnecessary to resolving the ownership issue.
plaintiffs claim that such unrelated issues were raised in the district court and that the district court erred by failing to reduce the award to reflect work done on them.specifically,plaintiffs say that the parties disagreed as to whether the plaintiffs would be able to establish benefit of the bargain damages on their contract claim and whether such damages were limited to the amount of the purchase price by the terms of the contract.all indications are that these were minor points but,in any event,the plaintiffs did not make this argument before the district court so it is forfeited.daigle maine med,cir.
plaintiffs next say that the ownership claim was a reasonable one and that the district court should therefore have not awarded attorney fees.section,quoted in full above,says that the district court in its discretion may allow the recovery of full costs including an attorney fee.under the case law,dishonesty is not required for an award even a case that is merely objectively quite weak can warrant such an award.matthews,at.
this case is perhaps unusual because at first blush it might appear as if the plaintiffs had a colorable claim that hodges had purchased,and invessys now owned,the aim copyright.the clear language of the written contract,presumed to reflect the parties intent,explicitly included aim,and obviously exhibited remarkable negligence in failing to detect the apparent error despite its officials review of the written contract.further,under the applicable new york law,had a heightened burden to prove the error by clear and convincing evidence.
nevertheless,the closer one looks at the circumstances,the more dubious plaintiffs ownership claim appears.most important is the underlying transaction related to maps,which was purchased for a quite modest sum just under.the predecessor programs were added at hodges request after the original bargaining and at no additional cost.aim was not a predecessor program,was not part of maps generating about million per year.even though there was evidence that was planning to replace aim reasonably soon,the idea that it deliberately intended to transfer a program then generating millions for nothing is perverse.
still,it might well have made the case arguable if there had been substantial negotiations about the transfer of the aim program.yet,while admitted that hodges had approached manning about the subject and had been told to take it up with thornton,thornton testified at trial that he had not offered aim to hodges hodges said that there was discussion and a deal.it is a fair inference,from both the result and the surrounding circumstances,that the jury and the trial judge both credited thornton version of events over hodges.
there were other circumstances supporting position.the evidence did not show that a launch date for supposed successor system was so clearly imminent that aim was going to be obsolete in hands at the time of hodges alleged purchase of aim,nor did the contract contain any provision by which hodges licensed aim back to so that it could continue,for the present,to service its current aim clients.it is difficult to believe that would have sold an essential component of a dollar business without such a license back.
of course,in determining whether to award attorney fees,the district court judgment as to the reasonableness of the original claim had to rest on what hodges knew when he made and pressed his claim and not merely on the unfavorable outcome.tang state of,dep t of elderly affairs,cir.but in this case,hodges certainly knew at the outset of the raw facts supporting position,the disparity between price and value and also knew in fact whether he had had any detailed negotiations with thornton about whether aim should be included in the deal.
so long as the district court correctly stated the legal standard or criteria,review of the award is only for abuse of discretion.matthews,at lotus dev,at.plaintiffs complain that the district court did not seriously consider the plaintiffs own evidence in support of the claim but the district court,having sat through the trial,was fully familiar with the background and the direct testimony of hodges and thornton.we have no basis for overturning the district court decision that an award was appropriate.
we turn next to one disputed item in the award.the district court allowed recovery under section of the costs of legal research done using one of the standard services westlaw lexis.plaintiffs have not preserved any claim that the amount was excessive or that research was not needed.rather,they urge as they did unsuccessfully in the district court that such a cost should be treated as part of law firm overhead covered by the firm hourly fee rather than as a separately reimbursable item.
this is an issue on which the courts have been divided and,given the ubiquity of research in law practice,the issue deserves our full attention.section,taken alone,is not illuminating it says only that the court may allow the prevailing party full costs and may award a reasonable attorney fee to the prevailing party as part of the costs.there is no reason to think that congress gave any particular thought to research.
although section full costs language could be distinguished from more familiar and slightly narrower wording in other fee shifting statutes,the court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney fee as part of the costs,the tendency of the courts has been to treat most statutes similarly whether in allowing or disallowing particular items.the starting point in many the ending point in that another federal statute specifies various taxable costs,f ees of the clerk and marshal and f ees and disbursements for printing and witnesses,but the list does not include research.yasui maui,d.
nevertheless,the supreme court has endorsed the view that disbursements made by an attorney and ordinarily billed directly to the client that is,separately from the hourly or fixed fee can properly be encompassed within the phrase attorney fee,see,casey,d and it is not uncommon for courts to allow such costs as travel,long distance calls,and parking on top of the hourly fee,downes volkswagen of,cir data grumman.support.
in our view,research should be treated similarly and reimbursed under attorney fee statutes like section,so long as the research cost is in fact paid by the firm to a provider and is customarily charged by the firm to its clients as a separate disbursement.if it saves attorney time to do research this way,probably the hours billed are fewer,haroco,am.bank trust,cir and in any event westlaw and lexis are now as much part of legal service as a lawyer taxi to the courthouse.
courts that have resisted reimbursement of research as part of attorney fees have asked why that cost should be distinguished from the law firm cost of maintaining its law book cost that is cus
