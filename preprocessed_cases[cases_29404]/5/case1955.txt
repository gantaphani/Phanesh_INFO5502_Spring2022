introduction 
plaintiff,the registry,and defendants,the state of california and attorney general bill lockyer,appeal from a september,judgment.defendants separately appeal from an april,order awarding plaintiff attorney fees.plaintiff is a credit reporting agency that provides consumer credit reports to landowners who rent and lease apartments and to property managers.plaintiff sought declaratory relief and to enjoin enforcement of california civil code section on federal and state constitutional free speech grounds.section is known as the security freeze law it allows california consumers to prevent the dissemination of their credit reports.plaintiff argues section violates its first amendment right to disseminate consumer credit reports containing truthful,lawfully obtained information much of it secured from federal and state court records.the trial court ruled the security freeze law was unconstitutional with respect to information included in the consumer credit reports that is culled from public records.the trial court injunction only enjoined defendants from enforcing section as to information contained in obtained from matters of public record.otherwise,apart from public record information,section remained in full force and effect.we conclude that section is unconstitutional as applied to plaintiff who,the agreed facts prove,provides credit reports drawn in material part from public records including court documents.and we find section can not be judicially reformed.in this regard,plaintiff is entitled to prevail on its constitutional claims on an basis.but we do not believe section is invalid in its entirety and thus part company with plaintiff in this regard.we reverse the judgment and direct entry of an injunction against defendants insofar as they attempt to enforce section against plaintiff.we also reverse the judgment insofar as it barred enforcement of section against any other party.in the unpublished portion of the opinion,we affirm the attorney fee award.
ii.background 
plaintiff declaratory and injunctive relief action 
plaintiff is a credit reporting agency that issues consumer credit reports within the meaning of section,subdivisions c and d of the california consumer credit reporting agencies act the act.et plaintiff collects public record information about individuals including unlawful detainer,foreclosure,bankruptcy,and tax lien data.plaintiff sells consumer credit reports to its,property managers,and others.plaintiff members consider the reports in deciding whether to lease real property to prospective tenants.the members agree in advance not to use the reports for any other purpose nor to disclose the information contained therein to others.plaintiff database includes records on tens of millions of prospective tenants in california and several other states.plaintiff also resells credit reports from the three major credit reporting agencies in the united union,experian,and equifax those reports include identifying information and employment and credit histories.the stipulated facts stated in order to assist landlords,property managers and others determining the eligibility of a consumer for hiring real property,plaintiff maintains a database of various real estate related public records.these public records consist of unlawful detainer court cases,judicial foreclosure cases,foreclosures,federal bankruptcy cases,federal and state tax liens from the county recorder office,criminal court matters and other federal and state civil court cases related to real estate issues.plaintiff maintains these public records on tens of millions of prospective tenants throughout the state of california and several other states.the stipulated facts also state in addition,such reports also include identification information a record of inquiries all who have asked for the consumer report in the last year,or last two years if for employment purposes a summary of the information contained in credit reports obtained by plaintiff from trans union,experian,equifax and an unabridged report on all reported credit activity.credit reports obtained from trans union,experian,equifax typically include identification and employment information and credit history,including creditor name,payment history and nature and limit of credit.
plaintiff website advertised that customers were provided an report which contains an eviction case search a foreclosure search which includes judicial foreclosure of mortgages and liens and trustee and bank foreclosures a bankruptcy search which consists of bankruptcy petitions filed in federal court information as to whether the applicant has been an arrieta claimant or previously involved with one a residence history which involves a person who has been evicted tenant history supplied by prior landlords existing arrest warrants whether an applicant has a history as a vexatious litigant a full unabridged report of all reported credit history compilation of all reported civil judgments a complete list of all tax liens reported collection agency activity and out of state credit history.also,the website explains a detailed demographic profile presumably for rental applicants will be prepared which includes addresses past addresses social security numbers verification of social security numbers employers wage and occupation age and birth dates.according to the stipulated facts,in order to change its computer system so as to comply with section,plaintiff would incur in excess of in costs.
plaintiff commenced this declaratory and injunctive relief action against defendants on december.plaintiff sought an injunction against enforcement of section.plaintiff also requested a declaration that section violates the first and fourteenth amendments of the united states constitution and article,sections free speech and equal protection of the california constitution and is,therefore,null and void plaintiff is not required to comply with its terms and provisions and the state of california,and attorney general,bill lockyer,be enjoined from enforcing section against p laintiff and others similarly situated.as can be noted,the complaint seeks a generalized determination section is unconstitutional a facial challenge and a request defendants be enjoined from enforcing section against plaintiff an challenge.
after the trial based on the foregoing stipulated facts,the trial court ruled.the operation of california civil code section freeze statute is permanently enjoined to the extent that the freeze statute seeks to prevent the dissemination and reporting by consumer credit reporting agencies of any information contained in obtained from matters of public record,and to the extent that it seeks to preclude p laintiff from disseminating and reporting information contained in the public record.defendants and all persons in active concert and participation with them be,and hereby are,permanently enjoined from enforcing the freeze statute to the extent that the freeze statute seeks to prevent the dissemination and reporting by consumer credit reporting agencies of any information contained in obtained from matters of public record,and to the extent that the freeze statute seeks to preclude p laintiff from disseminating and reporting information contained in the public record.the freeze statute violates both the first amendment to the united states constitution and article i section of the california constitution and is generally overbroad and violates equal protection to the extent that the freeze statute seeks to prevent the dissemination and reporting by consumer credit reporting agencies of information contained in obtained from matters of public record,and to the extent that the freeze statute seeks to preclude p laintiff from reporting information contained in the public record.plaintiff is not required to comply with the freeze statute to the extent that the freeze statute seeks to preclude p laintiff from reporting any information contained in obtained from matters of public record.objections overruled.as can be noted,the trial court made two determinations.the trial court ordered defendants not to enforce section.but the judgment also enjoined enforcement of section against plaintiff.as will be noted,we uphold the injunction against the enforcement of section as to plaintiff.but as to the generalized injunction against enforcement of section as to anybody else,we reverse the injunctive order.
b.the security freeze law,section 
section is part of the act.et the stated intent of the act is to regulate credit reporting agencies in order to protect california consumers.the legislature declared the purpose of the act as follows a an elaborate mechanism has been developed for investigating and evaluating the credit worthiness,credit standing,credit capacity,and general reputation of consumers.b consumer credit reporting agencies have assumed a vital role in assembling and evaluating consumer credit and other information on consumers.c there is a need to insure that consumer credit reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness,impartiality,and a respect for the consumer right to privacy.d it is the purpose of this title to require that consumer credit reporting agencies adopt reasonable procedures for meeting the needs of commerce for consumer credit,personnel,insurance,hiring of a dwelling unit,and other information in a manner which is fair and equitable to the consumer,with regard to the confidentiality,accuracy,relevancy,and proper utilization of such information in accordance with the requirements of this title.e the legislature hereby intends to regulate consumer credit reporting agencies pursuant to this title in a manner which will best protect the interests of the people of the state of california.
section provides in part a a consumer may elect to place a security freeze on his or her credit report by making a request in writing by certified mail to a consumer credit reporting agency.security freeze means a notice placed in a consumer credit report,at the request of the consumer and subject to certain exceptions,that prohibits the consumer credit reporting agency from releasing the consumer credit report or any information from it without the express authorization of the consumer.if a security freeze is in place,information from a consumer credit report may not be released to a third party without prior express authorization from the consumer.this subdivision does not prevent a consumer credit reporting agency from advising a third party that a security freeze is in effect with respect to the consumer credit report.
section was enacted as part of legislation intended to protect consumers from identity theft.judiciary,on bill reg.sess,as amended april,rules,off.of floor analyses,on bill reg.sess.as amended.section was intended to address the identity theft problem in three principal ways allowing consumers to place fraud alerts on their credit reports permitting them to prevent or control the release of their credit reports and prohibiting specified government and business uses of social security numbers.rules,off.of senate floor analyses,on bill reg.sess.as amended.
the bill author,senator debra bowen,argued that identity theft,including the unauthorized use of social security numbers,was on the rise.the assembly committee on judiciary reported according to consumer advocates,criminals assume the identity of about people a year.the term identity theft refers to the practice of scam artists who fraudulently obtain credit,loans,long distance phone service,in another person name.this is accomplished through a variety of means including,assumption of identification,theft of identifying information such as social security numbers,personal identification number pin codes,and through fraudulent changes of address.often the innocent party does not know that he or she has been the victim of fraud,until he or she applies for,and is denied,credit.application fraud,as it is known to the credit and banking industry,is a growing problem for businesses as well.the american bankers association reports that in,application fraud accounted for percent of all fraud.mastercard reports that in,it lost million to application fraud.this is up almost percent from just the year before,and the trend is growing.according to the united states general accounting office,credit card application fraud losses totaled million in.in california,law enforcement agencies report this crime is exacting an increasing toll on police resources.according to the author office,the los angeles police department lapd receives between and identity theft cases per month,and the lapd identity theft caseload has doubled from in to more than in.and,in,the telephone hotline at the social security administration received reports of almost incidents of misuse of social security numbers.the author office also notes that the social security administration conducted social security number misuse investigations in compared to only in.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended july,reading analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended september.a senate analysis observed,it can take identity theft victims several years to clear their credit records,during which time many victims have trouble establishing new credit,renting apartments and getting jobs because many applications require a credit check as part of the approval process.reading analysis on bill reg.sess.as amended.
consumers union,which supported the legislation,explained the need for and effect of the security freeze provision as follows while california has taken important steps over the past several years to aid victims of identity theft,prevention is the most effective way to stop this problem.senate bill no.does this by helping to ensure that people obtaining credit are who they say they are.this bill would allow a consumer to put a freeze on any release of credit information unless the consumer affirmatively allows its release.when issuing new credit,a credit grantor checks the credit history of the consumer.if a consumer believes that he or she is the victim of identity theft,the consumer can prevent the release of the credit information.if the information is not released,the identity thief will not be able to establish credit in the consumer name.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended july.
the legislative reports reflect concern about the use of social security numbers in credit reports.analyses of the bill noted that social security numbers are included in a credit report header information,along with a consumer name and address.according to a senate judiciary committee report,the header information,which involves social security numbers,can be sold by credit bureaus.judiciary,on bill reg.sess.as amended april.the senate judiciary committee report stated that existing laws governing credit reporting agencies did not address the issue of access to social security numbers.id.at.according to the senate judiciary committee report the author states that,although state and federal credit reporting laws place limits on a credit reporting agency ability to share or sell personal information from credit reports,the laws do not prohibit the sale of header information from a report,including a consumer name,address,telephone number,and social security number.due to the widespread use and perceived reliability of social security numbers,their unauthorized use is the most common and successful means by which identity thieves establish credit in someone else name.id.at see also,rules,off.of floor analyses,on bill reg.sess.as amended.
senate bill reg.sess.was also intended in part to shift some of the identity theft burden from consumers to credit reporting agencies and other entities.the california public interest research group argued in support of the bill right now the burden is completely on consumers to both protect their personal information and clean up their damaged credit reports once they have become victims of identity theft.unfortunately,a consumer has little control over who has access to his social security number and credit report,so his actions will not necessarily prevent identity theft from occurring.it is the responsibility of the business or other entity that profits from the distribution of a consumer personal information to keep that information from falling into the wrong hands.senate bill no.will help place the responsibility where it belongs.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended july.the senate judiciary committee report discussed,who should bear the cost of privacy protection the existence and widespread use of credit reports,as well as government reliance on social security numbers for many purposes,are facts of modern life that consumers can not prevent.if these unavoidable facts of life pose threats to individual privacy and financial security,the question becomes how best to protect individual privacy,and who should pay for such protection.this bill security alert and freeze provisions,and the provisions restricting social security number use,appear to keep the costs of privacy protection off of consumers,who have little choice in the matter,and to assign them to the entities who either benefit from their access to private information credit reporting agencies or those whose use of social security numbers is convenient but not necessary companies using social security numbers as identifiers for recordkeeping purposes.judiciary,on bill reg.sess.as amended april.in a similar vein,the assembly committee on banking and finance commented this bill is a matter of equity and protection of one good name and reputation this bill attempts to address the issue of the risk of financial loss being inadequately shared by those who benefit from the collection and dissemination of personal information,financial and otherwise.the issues involve the balancing of rights and obligations between business and consumers in credit transactions after identity theft occurs the victim consumer is faced with a mountain of difficulties and expense on the path to restoration of credit reputation.in proportion to assets the expenses faced by the victim are far greater than those faced by credit agency or credit grantor.assem.com.on banking and finance,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended june.
it is also evident a consumer right to control the use of his or her personal and financial information was a legislative concern.the assembly committee on banking and finance noted that credit reporting agencies gather and transmit personal information about can result in disastrous consequences for the individual when an identity thief strikes outside of the purview of the affected person.assem.com on banking and finance,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended june.the assembly committee on the judiciary identified as a key issue whether consumers should be permitted to assert control over the use of their personal and financial information.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended july.the assembly committee on the judiciary synopsis of the bill explained the parameters of the permitted control the bill also permits a consumer to place a security freeze on his or her credit report which would prohibit the credit reporting agency from releasing the consumer credit report or any information from it without the express authorization of the consumer.a consumer,using a personal identification number assigned to him or her by the credit reporting agency,would be able to lift the freeze and allow his or her credit report to be accessed for a specific purpose,party or period of time,provided that specified information is presented to the credit bureau.id.at.proponents of the legislation expressed a desire to place control of credit reports in the hands of the consumer supporters of the bill argue that the bill security alert and security freeze provisions are necessary to give the consumer,rather than the credit grantor or credit bureau,control over the use of his or her credit history.id.at.consumers union,a supporter,asserted in part,senate bill no.gives the consumer,rather than the credit grantor or credit bureau,control over the use of his or her credit history.because information in credit reports is about a consumer,the consumer right to control distribution of that report should be a fundamental one.id.at.
iii.discussion 
a.the constitutionality of the security freeze law under the first amendment as applied to.basic principles 
plaintiff argues its dissemination of public record facts and other information is speech that is protected by the federal and state constitutions,and section is a regulation that violates plaintiff first amendment free speech right.plaintiff relies on the free speech provisions of both the federal and state constitutions.the first amendment to the united states constitution which is applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment due process clause guarantees congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech mcintyre ohio elections comm,fn,d kasky nike,cal th,d.the united states supreme court has extended first amendment protection to commercial speech.bolger youngs drug prods,d bolger virginia state bd.of pharmacy virginia citizens consumer council,d bigelow virginia,d.but the first amendment protection extends only to commercial speech that is truthful,concerns lawful activity,and is not misleading.cent.hudson gas public serv.comm,d central hudson virginia state bd.of pharmacy virginia citizens consumer council,supra,at.untruthful speech,commercial or otherwise,has never been protected for its own sake.article i,section,subdivision a of the california constitutions states every person may freely speak,write and publish his or her sentiments on all subjects,being responsible for the abuse of this right.a law may not restrain or abridge liberty of speech or press.this state constitutional free speech provision is at least as broad as the federal constitution first amendment.kasky nike,supra,cal th at,d,gerawan farming,lyons cal th,d.truthful,nonmisleading speech about lawful products and services is protected under the california constitution.kasky nike,supra,cal th at,d,gerawan farming,lyons,supra,cal th at,d.the line between commercial and noncommercial speech under the state constitution is the same as that drawn under the federal constitution.kasky nike,supra,cal th at,d,see leoni state bar cal d,fn,arp pharmacy services,gallagher bassett services,th,d.there is no separate test for commercial speech under the state constitution.kasky nike,supra,cal th at,d,see leoni state bar,supra,cal d at fn.
the burden is on the state to demonstrate the constitutionality of section.united states playboy entm t group,d greater new orleans broad.ass united states,d.the united states supreme court has held when the government restricts speech,the government bears the burden of proving the constitutionality of its actions.citations.when the government seeks to restrict speech based on its content,the usual presumption of constitutionality afforded congressional enactments is reversed.regulations are presumptively invalid,paul,d,and the government bears the burden to rebut that presumption.united states playboy entm t group,supra,at.whether section is unconstitutional is a question of law and our review is de novo.valov department of motor vehicles th,d people health laboratories of north america,th,d.
before proceeding to an analysis of the first amendment issues,it is appropriate to review the two types of applicable constitutional and attacks on a statute.our supreme court delineated the scope of an challenge thusly an as applied challenge may seek relief from a specific application of a facially valid statute or ordinance to an individual or class of individuals who are under allegedly impermissible present restraint or disability as a result of the manner or circumstances in which the statute or ordinance has been applied,or an injunction against future application of the statute or ordinance in the allegedly impermissible manner it is shown to have been applied in the past.it contemplates analysis of the facts of a particular case or cases to determine the circumstances in which the statute or ordinance has been applied and to consider whether in those particular circumstances the application deprived the individual to whom it was applied of a protected right.citations.tobe city of santa ana cal th,d,see california of private special education schools california department of education th,d.challenges are evaluated on a basis.tobe city of santa ana,supra,cal th at,d,hale morgan cal d.finally,an challenge requires evidence that the statute is or has been applied in an unconstitutional manner in the past.bowen kendrick,d tobe city of santa ana,supra,cal th at,d.as part of the agreed facts,the parties do not dispute that section requires plaintiff to freeze the release of information derived from public documents.
by contrast,a facial challenge is conducted as follows a facial challenge to the constitutional validity of a statute or ordinance considers only the text of the measure itself,not its application to the particular circumstances of an individual.citation.to support a determination of facial unconstitutionality,voiding the statute as a whole,petitioners can not prevail by suggesting that in some future hypothetical situation constitutional problems may possibly arise as to the particular application of the statute rather,petitioners must demonstrate that the act provisions inevitably pose a present total and fatal conflict with applicable constitutional prohibitions.arcadia unified school dist.state of education cal th,d,quoting pacific legal foundation brown cal d.tobe city of santa ana,supra,cal th at,d,original italics.
the applicable level of constitutional scrutiny commercial versus noncommercial speech 
the first question we must consider is what type of speech is at issue.plaintiff asserts the expression at issue is noncommercial speech and relies on registry,state of california th,d,a decision of our colleagues in division four of this appellate district.in registry,our division four colleagues evaluated the constitutionality of former section,subdivision a which stated a except as authorized under subdivision b,no consumer credit reporting agency shall make any consumer credit report containing any of the following items of information unlawful detainer actions,unless the lessor was the prevailing party.for purposes of this paragraph,the lessor shall be deemed to be the prevailing party only if a final judgment was awarded to the lessor i upon entry of the tenant default,ii upon the granting of the lessor motion for summary judgment,or iii following trial,or b the action was resolved by a written settlement agreement between the parties which states that the unlawful detainer action may be reported.in any other instance in which the action is resolved by settlement agreement,the lessor shall not be deemed to be the prevailing party for purposes of this paragraph.stats,ch.our division four colleagues held former section,subdivision a did not involve an issue of commercial speech.our colleagues addressed the commercial speech issue as follows the test for identifying commercial speech is whether the expression at issue proposes a commercial transaction.pharmacy bd.consumer council,supra,d spiritual psychic science church city of azusa cal d,disapproved on another point in kasky nike,supra,cal th at,d.applying this settled definition,it is clear that the expression in this case,truthful information taken from public records regarding unlawful detainer defendants,does not propose a commercial transaction,and hence is not commercial speech.the fact that udr sells the information does not transform it to commercial speech any more than the fact that a magazine or newspaper is sold makes its contents commercial speech.some of our most valued forms of fully protected speech are uttered for a profit.board of trustees,state of fox,d.registry,state of california,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted.
defendants argue though that the foregoing bright line commercial speech is only that which proposes a registry,state of california,supra,th at page,d,has been superseded by subsequent authority.we agree with defendants the speech proposing a commercial transaction test is no longer the sole test for determining the purposes.the controlling discussion in this regard is the analysis of our supreme court in kasky nike,supra,cal th at page,d,an opinion issued after registry.in kasky,our supreme court explained the united states supreme court has held that the propose a commercial transaction test for commercial speech is not the sole standard of first amendment review.in kasky,the california supreme court explained that in board of trustees,state of fox,supra,at pages,the united states supreme court held that speech proposing a commercial transaction was the test for identifying commercial speech.but as our supreme court explained in kasky,i n other decisions the united states supreme c ourt has indicated that the category of commercial speech is not limited to this core segment.for example,the united states supreme c ourt has accepted as commercial speech a statement of alcohol content on the label of a beer bottle rubin coors brewing,supra,at,as well as statements on an attorney letterhead and business cards identifying the attorney as a cpa certified public accountant and cfp certified financial planner ibanez florida of business and professional regulation,bd.of accountancy,d.kasky nike,supra,cal th at,d,see intel hamidi cal th,d,there is no distinction between commercial and noncommercial speech.
later in kasky,our supreme court identified various tests applied in the advertising context by the united states supreme court.yet,as our supreme court explained in kasky,those standards are not the exclusive test for identifying commercial speech thus,although the court in bolger youngs drug products,d,identified three format,product references,and commercial in combination supported a characterization of commercial speech in that case,the court not only rejected the notion that any of these factors is sufficient by itself,but it also declined to hold that all of these factors in combination,or any one of them individually,is necessary to support a commercial speech characterization.kasky nike,supra,cal th at,d,orig.italics.
finally,in kasky,our supreme court cited united states supreme court decisional language which acknowledged ambiguities exist at the margins of what may be categorized as commercial speech.kasky nike,supra,cal th at,d,citing edenfield fane,d cincinnati discovery network,d zauderer office of disciplinary counsel of supreme court,d.therefore,we agree with defendants the analysis in registry,state of california,supra,th at page,d that t he test for defining commercial speech is whether the expression proposes a commercial transaction is no longer the sole standard of first amendment review.as our supreme court has noted,there is no single bright line test for defining commercial speech.intel hamidi,supra,cal th at,d,kasky nike,supra,cal th at,d.
commercial speech is entitled to less first amendment protection than other forms of expression.bolger youngs drug prods,supra,at.kasky nike,supra,cal th at,d.as to noncommercial speech,regulation is valid only when it is narrowly tailored,the least restrictive means is used to promote a compelling government interest.united states playboy entm t group,supra,at.kasky nike,supra,cal th at,d.other forms of speech receive no first amendment protection at example,fighting words or extortion.bigelow virginia,supra,at.fighting words flatley mauro cal th,d,extortion.commercial speech though is subject to an intermediate standard of review first set forth in cent.hudson gas public serv.comm n,supra,at page.at the outset,we must determine whether the expression is protected by the first amendment.for commercial speech to come within that provision,it at least must concern lawful activity and not be misleading.next,we ask whether the asserted governmental interest is substantial.if both inquiries yield positive answers,we must determine whether the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted,and whether it is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.see kasky nike,supra,cal th at,d.we will assume for purposes of discussion that that plaintiff credit reports are commercial speech and apply the central hudson test.we recognize a strong argument can be made that the applicable rule is the speech proposing a commercial transaction test utilized by our division four colleagues in registry,state of california,supra,th at pages,d.but the aspect of this case is resolvable with appropriate judicial certainty utilizing the central hudson test.if the constitutionality of section can be decided on the least controversial central hudson is more judicious to resolve the issue on that basis so that plaintiff can exercise its free expression and free press rights and the legislature can address the identity theft issue with a more precisely drafted statute.additionally,we note other courts have treated credit reports as commercial speech.trans union,millstone reports,cir,hood dun bradstreet,cir,individual reference servs.group,d.
the central hudson test applicable to commercial speech 
the united states supreme court set forth the intermediate scrutiny analysis applicable to regulation of commercial speech in central hudson,supra,at page.the central hudson test at the outset,we must determine whether the expression is protected by the first amendment.for commercial speech to come within that provision,it at least must concern lawful activity and not be misleading.next,we ask whether the asserted governmental interest is substantial.if both inquiries yield positive answers,we must determine whether the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted,and whether it is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.accord,lorillard tobacco reilly,d refusing to reject central hudson analysis.
our conclusions concerning the central hudson test are as follows.first,we must determine whether the speech concerns lawful activity and is not misleading.cent.hudson gas public serv.comm n,supra,at.arp pharmacy services,gallagher bassett services,supra,th at,d.it is undisputed plaintiff consumer credit reports neither relate to unlawful activity nor are misleading.plaintiff reports contain credit related information about individuals culled from public sources including unlawful detainer,foreclosure,bankruptcy,and tax lien records.of material consequence is that court records of the type utilized by plaintiff are presumptively open for public examination.nbc subsidiary,superior court cal th,d,in re marriage of burkle th,d.in addition,plaintiff republishes information in credit reports obtained from trans union,experian,and equifax.these reports benefit consumers by facilitating the extension of credit.they benefit lessors by identifying potential lessees who are bad credit risks.therefore,although plaintiff interest in disseminating the reports is pecuniary,consumers also benefit.plaintiff truthful credit reports lawfully obtained from public records,thus are controlled by the first prong of the central hudson analysis.
second,we must consider whether the asserted government interest is substantial.cent.hudson gas public serv.comm n,supra,at.arp pharmacy services,gallagher bassett services,supra,th at,d.here,the legislature stated goals were to protect consumers from identity theft give the public a tool to prevent identity theft and in general prevent further identity theft.in support of their assertion this interest is substantial,defendants point to statistics cited in the legislative committee reports evidencing the rise in identity theft.law enforcement and other agencies reported increases in the numbers of identity theft inquiries,complaints,and investigations.plaintiff does not dispute that protecting consumers from identity theft is a substantial government interest.indeed,in the trial court and here,the parties conceded protecting consumers from identity theft is a compelling state interest.this court previously has observed,nor can it be seriously doubled that our state has a compelling interest in protecting its citizens against fraud and identity theft.citation.valov department of motor vehicles,supra,th at,d.similarly,the united states supreme court has recognized a substantial state interest in preventing fraud and protecting privacy.edenfield fane,supra,at.schaumburg citizens for better env t,d.we conclude the government interest is substantial and compelling.
third,we turn to the question whether section directly and materially advances the government asserted interest in protecting consumers from identity theft.greater new orleans broad.ass united states,supra,at.cent.hudson gas public serv.comm n,supra,at.the supreme court has described this third aspect of the central hudson test thusly the third part of the central hudson test asks whether the speech restriction directly and materially advances the asserted governmental interest.this burden is not satisfied by mere speculation or conjecture rather,a governmental body seeking to sustain a restriction on commercial speech must demonstrate that the harms it recites are real and that its restriction will in fact alleviate them to a material degree.edenfield fane,supra,at pp.consequently,the regulation may not be sustained if it provides only ineffective or remote support for the government purpose.central hudson,at.we have observed that this requirement is critical otherwise,a state could with ease restrict commercial speech in the service of other objectives that could not themselves justify a burden on commercial expression.rubin coors brewing,d,quoting edenfield,at.greater new orleans broad.ass united states,supra,at.the legislative committee reports include statements to the effect that an identity thief may be less likely to obtain credit in the victim name when the creditor can not access a credit report therefore,a consumer may be able to thwart identity theft by freezing dissemination of his or her credit report.defendants did not present any specific evidence to that effect in the trial court.more precisely,there is no evidence a single credit report prepared by plaintiff has led to a single case of identity theft.nevertheless,we will assume,for purposes of discussion,that section directly advances the government interest in protecting consumers from identity theft by allowing them to stop the distribution of their credit reports.
fourth,the restriction must not be excessive.cent.hudson gas public serv.comm n,supra,at.kasky nike,supra,cal th at,d.the united states supreme court has held,i f the governmental interest could be served as well by a more limited restriction on commercial speech,the excessive restrictions can not survive.cent.hudson gas public serv.comm n,supra,at.see board of trustees,state of fox,supra,at.section contains excessive restrictions within the meaning of the central hudson test.section includes plaintiff truthful reporting of lawfully available and obtained public record information.section prevents disclosure of data contained in court records which are constitutionally presumptively available to journalists and the public.nbc subsidiary,superior court,supra,cal th at,d,huffy superior court th,d.defendants do not dispute that section prevents plaintiff from disseminating information about unlawful detainer,bankruptcy,tax lien,foreclosure,and other public proceedings against individuals all of it secured from public records.the bulk of the sources of records referred to on plaintiff web site are publicly produced documents.nor do defendants dispute the public nature of that information it is available to members of the public without resort to plaintiff reports.moreover,preventing plaintiff from disseminating all of the public record information does not serve the asserted state interest.the knowledge that an individual has been the subject of an unlawful detainer action by a lessor,a tax lien imposed by the government,or a foreclosure action by a lender does not facilitate identity theft.even if that information could be of some use to a potential identity thief,it would be available without resort to plaintiff credit reports.nor is it likely the absence of such records,without more,would result in an extension of consumer credit to a thief.we conclude section sweeps more broadly than is necessary to serve the government interest in protecting consumers from identity theft therefore,the excessive restriction can not survive.cent.hudson gas public serv.comm n,supra,at.the state has not demonstrated that as applied to plaintiff consumer credit reports containing public record information,the ban on dissemination advances its asserted interest in preventing identity theft.
as discussed above,section does not survive the intermediate scrutiny applicable to commercial speech as applied to plaintiff.therefore,section does not,if the expression at issue is noncommercial speech,survive the strict scrutiny standard applicable to noncommercial speech.hence,even if plaintiff consumer credit reports are noncommercial speech because they do not propose a commercial transaction city of cincinnati discovery network,supra,at.board of trustees of state university of fox,supra,at.bolger youngs drug prods,supra,at.as our division four colleagues held in registry,state of california,supra,th at page,d unconstitutionally violates plaintiff first amendment rights.as discussed above,section is more extensive than is necessary to serve the state asserted interest.it follows,as pertinent to a strict scrutiny analysis,that section is not narrowly tailored to promote that interest it is not the least restrictive means to that end.united states playboy entm t group,supra,at.kasky nike,supra,cal th at,d.under any relevant first amendment analysis,section is unconstitutional as applied to plaintiff.

as noted above,the trial court enjoined the operation and enforcement of section to the extent it prevents dissemination and reporting of any information contained in obtained from matters of public record as to plaintiff but otherwise allowed the statute to stand.plaintiff argues that section can not be judicially reformed.the california supreme court has set forth the applicable rule as follows this court has refused to undertake wholesale judicial amendment of legislation.citations.however,a reviewing court may,in appropriate circumstances,and consistently with the separation of powers doctrine,reform a statute to conform it to constitutional requirements in lieu of simply declaring it unconstitutional and unenforceable.citation.w herever possible,this court will interpret a statute as consistent with applicable constitutional provisions,seeking to harmonize constitution and statute.citations.citation.this is because this court is bound,if possible,to construe a statute in a fashion that renders it constitutional.citation.prof l eng rs dep t of transp.cal th,d,see kopp fair pol.practices com.cal th,d,plur.opn.of lucas.relying on former chief justice lucas plurality opinion in kopp,our colleague,associate justice paul boland of division eight of this appellate district,explained a court may,rewrite a statute in order to preserve it against invalidation under the constitution,when we can say with confidence that i it is possible to reform the statute in a manner that closely effectuates policy judgments clearly articulated by the enacting body,and ii the enacting body would have preferred the reformed construction to invalidation of the statute.in re marriage of burkle,supra,th at,d,citing kopp fair pol.practices,supra,cal th at,d.
in metromedia,city of san diego,d plur.opn.of white,the united states supreme court reversed the decision of the california supreme court in metromedia,san diego cal d,concerning the validity under the first amendment on restrictions on off site advertising signs.the united states supreme court remanded the case to our supreme court in order to determine whether the ordinance could be reformed.metromedia,san diego,supra,at fn.upon remand,in metromedia,city of san diego cal d,our supreme court declined to reform an ordinance restricting advertising signs.our supreme court held that the ordinance could not be reformed because it was doubtful whether the purpose of the original ordinance could be served by a reformed version as reformed,the language of the ordinance was inconsistent with that of the original enactment there was insufficient evidence there would be a material reduction in the number of billboards as reformed,the city would be left with an ordinance less effective in achieving the goal of reducing the number of billboards and there would be constitutional problems discerning what was commercial as distinguished from noncommercial speech.metromedia,city of san diego,supra,cal d at.
similarly,in the case of in re marriage of burkle,supra,th at pages,d,division eight of this appellate district held family code section was invalid on its face and could not be reformed.our division eight colleagues held that family code section was invalid because the first amendment provides a qualified right of access to court records in marital dissolution litigation the privacy interests protected by family code section could justify sealing of marital dissolution litigation documents but the statute was not narrowly tailored to serve such a potentially overriding interest and therefore,family code section operated as an undue burden on the first amendment right of access to documents filed in court proceedings.id.at,d.one of the litigants sought to rewrite that portion of family code section,subdivision a which states the court shall order a pleading that lists the parties financial assets and liabilities and provides the location or identifying information about those assets and liabilities sealed to say the court shall order that part of a pleading sealed which refers to assets and liabilities.id.at,d.associate justice boland explained in some detail why family code section,subdivision a could not be reformed because the sine qua non of the statute envisioned streamlined proceedings,sealing of an entire document,not merely specified financial information the proposed sealing of specified financial information would redact not only the identity of the asset,to prevent theft,but would also shield from public view its value to only modify the statute to seal specified information would preserve the improper burden on journalists and the public to show good cause to unseal the financial data which contravenes the constitutional qualified right of access and to place the burden of justifying redaction on the litigant would contravene the legislature intention to put that responsibility on journalists and the public.id.at,d.
in a like vein,section can not be judicially reformed so as to permit the statute to apply to plaintiff.the text of section and the legislative committee reports that preceded its adoption are such that we can not say with confidence that the trial court proposed of the statute,or any other,would closely effectuat e policy judgments clearly articulated by the legislature.kopp fair pol.practices,supra,cal th at,d.the trial court construction that prevents a consumer from freezing information contained in obtained from public records permits the disclosure to plaintiff customers of the very information the legislature sought to keep,social security numbers,addresses,tax information,rental records,and judgments.the legislature intended to allow consumers to prevent disclosure of any information in a credit reporting agency report not merely that contained in obtained from public records as the trial court reformation order permits.there is no evidence the legislature intended to enact a statute that permitted a consumer to freeze disclosure of everything except information contained in obtained from public records.no committee reports suggest if a consumer can freeze only information not contained in obtained from public records,there will be the comparable protections against identity theft section was designed to provide.moreover,the legislature intended to require a credit reporting agency,upon receiving the consumer written request,to freeze the release of all of her or his information,subd.a.once the written notification is received,no information may be released and the only information that may be provided by the credit reporting agency is that a security freeze is in effect.the legislature never intended,much less even contemplated,that once the consumer written notice was received
