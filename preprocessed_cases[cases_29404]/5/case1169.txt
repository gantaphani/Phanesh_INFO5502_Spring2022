because the parties disagreed about the proper placement for dori,a due process hearing was held the hearing officer,harold merkow,concluded that pvusd program complied with the idea but that pvusd had to reimburse the shapiros for the costs of educating dori.pvusd appealed,and the appellate hearing officer concluded that pvusd had offered a free and appropriate public education and that the shapiros were not entitled to a reimbursement.the shapiros then filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of arizona,which held that pvusd had violated several procedural requirements of the idea,resulting in the loss of educational opportunity to dori.the court also found that the shapiros were entitled to reimbursement for the school year if cid had offered an appropriate education for dori.it remanded to the hearing officer for a determination of whether cid was an appropriate educational program and terminated the action.on appeal,we vacated the order terminating the action and remanded for the entry of a stay pending a final determination by the hearing officer.shapiro ex rel.shapiro paradise valley unified sch.dist,cir per curiam.
on remand,the arizona department of education referred the matter to administrative law judge alj eric bryant,who raised the issue of the authority of the shapiros counsel,stephen walker,who was not admitted to the practice of law in arizona,to represent the shapiros.following briefing on the issue,alj bryant concluded,on july,that walker was not authorized to represent the shapiros at the administrative hearing because walker was not a member of the state bar of arizona.walker then petitioned the maricopa county superior court to be admitted pro hac vice and,on february,the superior court issued an order authorizing walker to proceed pro hac vice and ordering alj bryant to admit walker to represent the shapiros in the matter.on april,alj bryant ordered that walker could appear pro hac vice.alj bryant held hearings in august and,in november,found that cid provided an appropriate educational program.the district court affirmed and awarded the shapiros as reimbursement for the school year.this court affirmed the judgment of the district court.shapiro ii,at.
after judgment was entered,the shapiros moved in the district court for attorney fees.although walker was not admitted to practice pro hac vice in arizona until february,walker argued that the oral consent of merkow,the hearing officer in the original administrative hearing,and the failure of pvusd to object to his appearance entitled the shapiros to attorney fees prior to his admission to practice pro hac vice.the district court rejected the argument that merkow consent was sufficient to authorize walker to practice law in arizona.reasoning that walker had failed to comply with the prescribed rules for admission to practice pro hac vice in arizona,the district court concluded that the time walker spent prior to february,was not compensable 
the district court further concluded that the shapiros were the prevailing parties for purposes of i b and that the fees requested by walker were reasonable.on august,the district court entered judgment for the shapiros for,as attorney fees.

discussion 
i.the shapiros appeal 
the idea provides that the district court,in its discretion,may award reasonable attorneys fees as part of the costs to the parents of a child with a disability who is the prevailing party.i b.the shapiros contend that the district court erred in disallowing attorney fees prior to the date that walker was admitted to practice pro hac vice in arizona.they argue that the administrative hearing officer had the authority to waive the pro hac vice requirements orally and that he did so by approving of walker representation of the shapiros.
the district court relied on san bruno park sch,cir,in deciding that the shapiros were not entitled to fees prior to february.in,the issue was whether a party,represented by an attorney who is admitted to the united states district court for the northern district of california but is not admitted to the california state bar,may be awarded attorneys fees for a state administrative proceeding under the idea.id.at.relying on california caselaw holding that no person may recover compensation for services as an attorney in california unless he or she was a member of the state bar at the time the services were rendered,reasoned that a person is or is not licensed to practice law in a particular forum.there is no halfway.id.at citing birbrower,montalbano,condon frank superior court,cal th,d.because the attorney in was not licensed to practice in california,he was not entitled to collect attorney fees.id.at.
