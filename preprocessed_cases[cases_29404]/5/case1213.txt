appellant david braunstein braunstein appeals the district court order denying his motion for attorney fees pursuant to the hyde amendment.braunstein asserts that he incurred approximately in attorney fees defending against sixteen federal criminal charges of wire fraud,interstate transportation of goods obtained by fraud,and money laundering.he claims that under the hyde amendment,the government is required to pay his attorney fees because the prosecution was vexatious,frivolous,or in bad faith.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and,as we find the prosecution was frivolous,we now reverse.
facts and procedural historya.braunstein business dealings with apple latin america 
braunstein is a businessman who bought and sold computers,often through two companies he owned,pacific rim technologies corporation and almacen.braunstein maintained a computer distribution company in california and a computer retail store and refurbishing plant in tijuana,mexico.from september through april,braunstein bought computers from the apple latin america company alac.alac is a subdivision of apple computer,apple,an international computer manufacturer and sales company headquartered in the united states.alac is responsible for the sale of apple products to mexico,central america,south america,and the caribbean.
braunstein business relationship with alac consisted primarily of buying excess or obsolete apple computers at greatly reduced prices alac would ship the computers from apple warehouses in chicago,california,and canada to braunstein warehouse in san diego.although braunstein was known as an alac distributor whose sales territory was mexico,braunstein sold most of his alac inventory within the united states,to an arizona businessman named alan kaplan kaplan kaplan,in turn,sold the alac computers to other apple resellers and wholesalers in the united states at prices substantially below apple listed wholesale price for such products.alac former sales director referred to distributors like braunstein and kaplan as the marshalls or the maxx of the computer industry.
when purchasing apple products,braunstein dealt directly with lopez and carlos valladeros valladeros,alac regional sales representative for northern latin america.in addition,braunstein business ventures with alac were overseen by rubio.
braunstein always paid alac up front,in cash.in exchange,he received an additional one percent discount.lopez estimated that braunstein purchases brought alac about a million dollars a month,which could be about five percent of the sales for apple latin america.it could have gone as high as percent of the overall sales of apple latin america.braunstein dealings with alac were not,however,formalized by written contract instead,the parties reached an oral understanding for each deal as to quantity and price lopez testified that it was unusual to conduct business with a distributor without a contract,but that i t was done sometimes.
according to internal and external reports,alac was under pressure to generate high sales volume,and deals such as the one with braunstein facilitated that goal.some of this pressure appears to stem from the fact that alac employees worked on commission.according to the postal inspector report,if alac employees made their gross margin,unit mix,and revenue,a bonus would be given.braunstein business was particularly important because he could afford to buy large quantities of product from alac.a fter the currency devaluation,most all of the distributors in mexico were virtually bankrupt,so that they really had no credit or cash to purchase any product.
gray marketing at alac the kroll report 
alac deals with braunstein benefitted alac in the short term by increasing the sales volume of products for which there were few,if any,other buyers.but the deals hurt apple in the by undercutting its ability to generate profitable sales in the united states.alac business dealings effectively put alac own distributors whose sales area was limited to latin america and the carribean into direct competition with apple united states distributors.moreover,braunstein and kaplan were selling their apple inventory within the united states at a much cheaper price than the other united states distributors were offering,which hurt the sales of those distributors and caused confusion and resentment in the market.
in august,apple management became concerned about the systemic underselling of apple united states distributors by alac distributors.specifically,apple was concerned that alac distributors were engaging in gray marketing,which involves the sale of apple products outside the territory for which they are intended,and at a lower price than apple would have authorized.apple hired kroll associates kroll,an international private investigation firm,to look into alac business practices.
kroll issued its findings in a written report,on january.the report concluded that,a potentially significant gray market problem existed at alac and that t here also appear to be a number of issues internal to alac which were contributing to the gray market problem.kroll based this conclusion on its preliminary findings,which consisted of specialized audits,interviewing selected persons,and reviewing pertinent documentation.
the following excerpts from the kroll report summarize its findings and conclusions 
alac employees were under tremendous pressure to sell large numbers of product,termed flushing.although not specifically stated,the emphasis appear s to be on achieving sales volume rather than profit margins.
during the last year or so,alac has aggressively sought out new clients changes in alac policies have now put alac in direct competition with u nited s tates e xporters,as both now sell to i n c ountry d istributors.
there was no accountability or penalties related to the gray market.alac was under pressure to generate high sales volume,and delivered most of its product f ree o n b oard miami.once the product left the alac warehouse there was little if any effort to ensure it was exported as claimed by the customer.
alac does not obtain any of the reporting required under the terms of the signed agreements which are currently expired with its customers.
there may also be apple employees involved in gray marketing activities.
c.the united states attorney office in arizona 
for reasons that are somewhat unclear from the record,the united states attorney office in arizona began investigating alac business deals with braunstein in the fall of in august,the assistant united states attorney ausa assigned to the alac case alerted braunstein that he had become a target of a federal criminal investigation,and braunstein retained michael lipman lipman as counsel.
d.the ausa investigation 
in august,september,and october,the ausa conducted telephone interviews of several alac employees who had dealt directly with braunstein,including valladeros.the ausa also interviewed lopez.
the valladeros interview 
the ausa interviewed valladeros on august,and summarized the contents of the interview in a memorandum.according to the memorandum,valladeros stated that alac business dealings with braunstein began in,when alac had some product on hand which they wanted to get rid of and braunstein agreed to take the product.the ausa memorandum continues 
it was valladeros understanding that braunstein could sell in his area of san diego and sell to other companies who had dealings with apple and exported products.valladeros spoke extensively with braunstein regarding the concept and he also gave his report to apple.
lipman letter to the ausa 
on september,lipman wrote the ausa a page letter,in which he set forth in detail the legal and factual bases for his belief that braunstein had done nothing illegal.lipman wrote 
we believe that our client did not have a valid contract with apple latin america at any time during these transaction s that apple latin america was aware that there were no legal restrictions on my client resale of product and that apple latin america knew,or should have known,that my client was selling the bulk of the product to a reseller in the furthermore,apple latin america was more than happy to have these transactions occur because they created a material increase in their revenues.
lipman continued,t o the degree that particular employees or former employees of apple latin america contend that they thought braunstein was selling his product in mexico,we submit that apple own financial documents will disprove these contentions.lipman then detailed alac financial woes and its efforts to rebuild its distribution network,including its development of the alternate channel concept.he explained 
t he alternate channel concept called for apple latin america to recruit united states distributors in the border states primarily california,texas and florida.these distributors would be offered lower prices than distributors with the expectation that they could recapture the latin american reseller market for alac this program was established so the distributors could not undercut the latin american distributors and take away sales from the apple latin america division and effectively gray market product into latin america.under the alternate channel concept,these distributors could sell to,among others,united states businesses with operations in latin america.thus,the program itself provided for sales of computers inside the united states.additionally,it was anticipated by alac,and alac was willing to accept,that some gray marketing would occur into united states markets.
lipman informed the ausa that she could find confirmation of the alternative channel concept in pricing studies performed by apple latin america,memos between alac and other apple divisions,and internal documentation and memoranda within alac.lipman also explained in detail braunstein relationship with alac and told the ausa that internal alac documents would confirm that braunstein was an alternate channel distributor who generated over million in revenue for alac and that alac had braunstein existing entirely outside its normal distribution network for two years.
in a separate section of the letter,entitled apple knowledge regarding braunstein sales,lipman listed numerous sources of information and documentation in apple possession that he believed would demonstrate that alac knew that braunstein was selling its product in the united states.the list included registration and warranty cards for the computers sold by braunstein to united states distributors that were returned to apple tracking records documenting the return of those registration and warranty cards serial number lists for all computer sales to braunstein damage claims submitted by united states dealers who bought from braunstein and warranty claims and requests for technical services from braunstein united states buyers.
lipman also described in detail one particular deal in which braunstein purchased powerbook from alac in the winter of at and per unit,which was significantly lower than the standard price for the powerbooks.lipman stated that the low price at which braunstein obtained the powerbook sales caused the united states attorney office to believe that braunstein had promised alac to sell them only in mexico.lipman then explained why this conclusion was incorrect.lipman advised the ausa that she could find marketing reports and technical analyses at apple revealing that the powerbooks had sold poorly and that alac was interested in dumping the powerbooks wherever it could.lipman continued 
the leaders of apple latin america at the time namely luis rubio,neil montilla,and al lopez knew they could quietly dump the powerbooks which were already excess inventory for apple usa with braunstein,and be heroes.accordingly,apple latin america did not care where braunstein sold the computers,or even if he sold them.
lipman stated in his letter that t he issue of gray marketing was so prevalent at apple,in fact,that the company engaged both its internal security and an outside firm to investigate the problem.lipman stated that an investigation of apple files would reveal reports from apple director of security documenting the gray market problem and similar documentation from the miami branch of the kroll group,which was retained by apple to investigate how the gray marketing of apple products was able to persist on such a widespread basis.
lipman concluded his letter by telling the ausa you invited us to provide you evidence to support our theories unfortunately,this documentation is at apple,and only you can gain access to it.emphasis added 
montilla and lopez interviews 
on september,three months before braunstein was indicted,the ausa spoke with montilla.according to the ausa memorandum of the interview,montilla stated that i t was anticipated that braunstein companies would take alac product and sell to resellers in mexico.montilla also stated,however,that h e never dealt with braunstein.dealings would have always been between carlos valladeros,al lopez and braunstein.
the ausa interviewed lopez on october.according to the ausa memorandum of the interview,lopez stated that h e is not familiar with the term alternate channel concept.lopez also stated that braunstein territory was mexico and that braunstein was not supposed to sell apple products in the united states.according to the ausa memorandum of the interview 
lopez wrote a series of memos regarding what he anticipated as a problem for apple.this related to the gr a y marketing.he reported this problem in approximately april there were pages and pages of hard copy documents sent between himself and luis rubio regarding this problem.as a result of this conflict,he was placed on a do better plan.during late august,there was a management meeting.management informed lopez that it was hiring an outside firm to look at the grey marketing problem.it also told him to report any of his suspicions to this third party.in january,he was taken off the do better plan.
emphasis added.
e.the grand jury 
the ausa convened a grand jury in the district of arizona to present her case against braunstein.on august,the same day that the ausa interviewed valladeros by telephone,valladeros appeared as a witness before the grand jury and testified about his business dealings with braunstein.valladeros testified that,as an alac sales representative,he sold computers to braunstein from until valladeros left the company in.responding to repeated questions from the ausa as to whether braunstein was told that he could only sell apple products in mexico,valladeros stated that he did not recall.the ausa then asked if braunstein told you that the apple product was going to stay in the united states and be shipped to nebraska,for example,would you have sold him the product valladeros replied no.several transcript pages later,the following exchange occurred 
ausa and did you explain to braunstein he could not sell apple products inside the united states 
valladeros again,when i explained to him the concept,i do not recall if i was explicit to him telling him that he could not sell in the united states and to be honest with you,having dealt in latin america for eight,nine years,it never crossed my mind the fact that,you know,illegally selling product into the,because it did make sense.
ausa so you assumed when you were negotiating with braunstein that because you apple latin america,this is all going to be exported to latin america 
valladeros correct.
the ausa later asked valladeros,do you know of anyone at apple,either apple latin america or apple america,who told braunstein he could sell the product within the and not export it valladeros replied,not to my knowledge.
this grand jury testimony by valladeros flatly contradicted his answers to the ausa questions during the telephone conversation they had earlier that same day.in the telephone interview,valladeros told the ausa that braunstein could sell in his area of san diego and sell to other companies who had dealings with apple and exported products.valladeros also told the ausa that he and braunstein spoke extensively about braunstein united states sales and that valladeros gave a report to apple about these conversations.
the ausa also called rubio and lopez as grand jury witnesses.both lopez and rubio testified that they were laid off by apple in and that braunstein was only authorized to sell apple products within latin america.on december,the grand jury returned an indictment charging braunstein with multiple counts of wire fraud,in violation of interstate transportation of goods obtained by fraud,in violation of and money laundering,in violation of.the district court summarized the indictment as follows 
the government alleges that defendant entered into a conspiracy with alan kaplan to defraud apple computer by inducing apple to sell them apple products at prices substantially below what they could be purchased for in the united states.defendant would purchase computers through his mexican business entities ostensibly for sale in mexico.however,instead of distributing and selling the products in mexico,defendant would instead sell the products in the united states through kaplan.kaplan would then resell the apple products to other apple reseller s and wholesalers in the united states at prices substantially below apple listed wholesale price for such items.
braunstein moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that it did not allege a crime.the court denied the motion.
on february,philip stillman,stillman who had replaced lipman as braunstein counsel,subpoenaed various documents and records from apple.apple,represented by john steele,steele moved to quash the subpoena as overly broad,and the government joined in the motion.on february,the district court granted the motion to quash and ordered stillman to meet with steele to narrow down the number of areas of documents that you seek.the court also ordered steele to turn over the kroll report unredacted.the court continued 
the following things are clear apple is a complaining witness.apple complaining party,i should say.and the defendant is entitled to discovery on items relevant to the charges in the indictment.and lest it come as a surprise to anyone,the area of concern and dispute is that the defendant contends that apple was both knowledgeable about and content with and indeed supportive of the notion that product directed to apple latin america was going to be sold at wholesale retail in the united states.it is the defendant contention that he was aware of that and participated in that what has been called from time to time,an alternative channel of distribution,unquote with the knowledge of apple,with the knowledge of apple latin america,and that accordingly,his conduct could not be unlawful since it would negate intent and indeed if it was consistent with apple distribution practice,it would be simply a commercial interaction between the defendant company and apple.now,you people can argue all day long about that.and that what the jury will decide.if they believe braunstein defense,he will be acquitted.
emphasis added.
on march,the parties were back in court arguing over the subpoenas,and the district court was getting impatient with apple 
steele as i understand the question is why has the kroll report not been turned over to stillman.
court that exactly right.
steele okay.as i explained to stillman 
court i mean just why.just why has it not been do you have it or not have it 
steele i myself do not have it.
court well,i mean you say i myself.i myself do have it either.but,by golly,i myself can get it in a hurry if i need it.now,do you have it or control over it and can you get it to stillman by five today along with all of the exhibits 
court all right.now what i want,steele,within the hour,is to have someone order kroll,if there is one,to send to stillman a copy of that report with a copy of every exhibit so that is no later than five today or there will be enormous economic sanctions imposed against apple computer corporation.is that clear 
on march,apple still had not turned over the kroll report or any of the other subpoenaed documents.on march,stillman moved for a continuance of the trial.on march,the court granted the motion and reset the trial date for may.on the same day,the court told apple to turn over the subpoenaed documents to the chambers of this court no later than april.apple did not comply with the order.
after joining in the first motion filed by apple to quash the subpoena,the united states attorney office was not involved in the discovery battle.instead,as the ausa later told the district court,w e remained silent.
on april,less than a month before the trial date,apple turned over the subpoenaed documents to braunstein.among the documents that apple turned over were memos written by lopez and rubio in which they openly acknowledged the existence of gray market practices among alac distributors.specifically,in a january,memo,rubio stated that o ur concept of capturing the gray market is not a new idea,and t he gray market is a fact of life.in a memo to rubio dated august,lopez stated 
we have met on several occasions to discuss the issue of gray market practices.in most,if not all,of these occasions you personally have acknowledged the fact that a significant number of our distributor sales are channeled to others and to party sources that feed the gray market in the.this is why i advocated so strongly to change our pricing structure,to reduce the gap and advantages that some of our customers have,that enable them to sell large volumes in the gray market.you have specifically mentioned to me in several conversations that we must move away cautiously from it,but we can not eliminate this practice overnight because our business will be affected severely.
emphasis added.
on april,the ausa moved for a continuance of the trial date.the court denied the motion.on may,the ausa moved to dismiss the indictment without prejudice.the court granted the motion.
hyde amendment motion and hearing 
on july,braunstein filed a motion for attorney fees pursuant to the hyde amendment.the government filed an opposition,and a hearing was held on april.at the hearing,stillman argued that the ausa knew about the memos detailing alac knowledge of the gray market practices of its distributors.specifically,stillman pointed out that lipman,told the ausa about the memos in his september,letter lopez told the ausa about the memos during their telephone interview on october,and the kroll report referred to the memos.stillman stated 
this was not a needle in a haystack.these documents came from lopez and rubio personnel files.there was a personnel file.it would have taken one phone call from the ausa.the ausa got stacks and stacks of documents,all sales invoices and so forth she could have made one phone call to apple,who was cooperating with the ausa for three years,providing logistic support,document support,and factual support,could have called them on the telephone and said,i want to see lopez personnel file.
the ausa responded by stating that the government never alleged this as a gray market case.this is a fraud case she continued 
now the documents may help the defendant put on his theory of the case which is that gray marketing was a problem at apple.but they certainly do not constitute brady material under the government theory of the case which is represented in the indictment,and that is that the defendant engaged in fraudulent activity.he made misrepresentations to apple repeatedly about where this product was going,and therein lie s the fraud.
the ausa then stated that she received the documents that stillman subpoenaed from apple on april,the same day that stillman did.she continued,did we know about a gray marketing issue well,obviously,we did,because we had the kroll report.but since gray marketing has nothing to do with wire fraud,mail fraud,interstate transportation of goods taken by fraud and money laundering,it not exculpatory.
stillman responded t he concept that gray marketing was not an issue in this case is simply gas.i mean it it the core of the case.if apple condoning sales outside the territory,that it.it the end of the story.
on october,the district court entered its order denying braunstein motion for attorney fees.the court concluded that the government case was not contrary to established law on fraud and based on the facts as they evolved,was not frivolous.this appeal followed.
standard of review 
the district court ruling on a hyde amendment motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion.united states lindberg,cir.under that standard,this court can not reverse unless it has a definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment.united states tucor int l,cir.
discussiona.braunstein notice of appeal was timely filed 
as an initial matter,the government contends that the panel lacks jurisdiction over braunstein appeal because it is untimely.the issue concerning which statute of limitations applies to hyde amendment appeals is one of first impression in the ninth circuit.among the circuits that have addressed this issue,there is a split of authority.the fourth,fifth,and circuits have held that hyde amendment appeals are civil matters governed by federal rule of appellate procedure a.in re grand jury,cir united states truesdale,cir united states wade.pursuant to rule a,a notice of appeal must be filed within days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered.fed.a a.if the united states is a party,the time is extended to days.fed.a b.
the tenth circuit has held that hyde amendment appeals are criminal matters governed by federal rule of appellate procedure b.united states robbins,cir.rule b a i provides that,i n a criminal case,a defendant notice of appeal must be filed in the district court within days after the entry of either the judgment or the order being appealed.fed.b a.
in truesdale,at,the fifth circuit rejected the argument that hyde amendment appeals are criminal matters for three reasons.first,the court explained,the statute of limitations to file an appeal in a criminal case is short because of the significant liberty interest at stake,and a motion under the hyde amendment does not implicate the movant liberty interest.truesdale,at see also in re grand jury,at in hyde amendment motions the criminal action itself is complete and all that remains is to determine whether the prevailing party can recover fees and expenses.
second,the fifth circuit noted that the hyde amendment adopted substantially all of the procedures and limitations of the equal access to justice act eaja,which provides for the recovery of attorney fees in unjustified civil actions brought by the federal government.see.the statute of limitations for the filing of a notice of appeal of an eaja claim is governed by rule a.truesdale,at.the court explained 
here,a motion under the hyde amendment is equivalent to a motion under the eaja.in each case,the movant is seeking an award of attorney fees based upon a litigating strategy employed by the government that,the movant claims,conflicts with statutorily defined notions of fair play.it makes little sense that the time period during which the movant may file an n otice o f a ppeal from the denial of such a motion should differ depending upon whether the government potentially offensive litigation strategy was employed in a civil case or a criminal case.
finally,the court in truesdale noted that a practical problem might arise from characterizing a hyde amendment appeal as a criminal matter namely that,generally,the government can not,without statutory authority,appeal from a decision in a criminal case.id.at.thus,if hyde amendment motions were declared criminal matters,the movant would be entitled to appeal from an adverse ruling by the district court,but the government would not.id.the court concluded w e can not imagine that the congress intended such a result and are unwilling,absent clearer statutory direction,to establish precedent in this circuit lending support to such an outcome.id.
the tenth circuit explanation in robbins for characterizing a hyde amendment motion as a criminal matter is less convincing.see at.the court simply states that b ecause an appeal under the hyde amendment arises out of a criminal case,fed.b applies and litigants must file a notice of appeal within the days after the order appealed from is entered.id.as the fourth circuit stated in rejecting this reasoning,robbins relies upon a conclusory rationale.in re grand jury,at.
because we are persuaded by the reasoning of the fifth circuit in truesdale,we join the fourth and circuits in holding that hyde amendment appeals are governed by federal rule of appellate procedure a.braunstein appeal is therefore timely because he filed his notice of appeal on october,thirteen days after entry of the order denying his hyde amendment motion.
b.the district court abused its discretion in denying braunstein motion for attorney fees under the hyde amendment because the government prosecution was frivolous 
the hyde amendment provisions,legislative history,and subsequent interpretation by the courts 
the hyde amendment was enacted by congress as part of a appropriations bill and is located in a statutory note to.united states gilbert,cir.it provides,in relevant part,that courts may award attorney fees and other litigation expenses to prevailing criminal defendants where the court finds that the position of the united states was vexatious,frivolous,or in bad faith,unless the court finds that special circumstances make the award unjust.stat,reprinted in,historical and statutory notes emphasis added the defendant bears the burden of proof,as well as establishing that he is otherwise qualified for the award under the law.united states adkinson,cir citation omitted 
in tucor,we held that t he plain meaning of the hyde amendment text indicates that the test is of any one of the three criteria vexatiousness,frivolousness,or bad faith should suffice by itself to justify an award.at emphasis added.the key terms of the hyde amendment,vexatious,frivolous,or in bad faith,are not defined in the statute.
because the district court based its ruling on a finding that the prosecution was not frivolous in instituting the criminal proceeding against braunstein,our analysis will focus on that prong of the hyde amendment.united states sherburne,cir stated in a footnote that frivolous has only an objective component.id.at.no further guidance was given.therefore,the hyde amendment legislative history and authority will be considered to provide helpful guidance in deciphering the meaning of frivolous.united states representative henry hyde,who wrote the original version of the amendment,explained that successful claimants under the hyde amendment must show that the prosecutors are not just wrong,they are willfully wrong,they are frivolously wrong.they keep information from you that the law says they must disclose.they hide information.they do not disclose exculpatory information to which you are entitled.cong.rec,statement of hyde thus,it is clear that,e ven in its earliest form,the hyde amendment was targeted at prosecutorial misconduct,not prosecutorial mistake.gilbert,at.
in gilbert,the eleventh circuit interpreted frivolous using the ordinary meaning of the word as provided in black law dictionary.id.at citing chapman united states,d.the court determined that frivolous means groundless with little prospect of success often brought to embarrass or annoy the defendant.id.at citing black law dictionary ed.
the fourth circuit has adopted the eleventh circuit approach to defining frivolous.in re grand jury,at citing gilbert interpretation with approval.in addition,in lindberg,this court stated that the gilbert court approach to defining these terms was sensible enough,but found it unnecessary to reach the issue.lindberg,at.because the eleventh circuit approach to defining frivolous and bad faith is clear and,we join the fourth circuit in adopting it.
application of the frivolous standard to the facts of this case 
to show that the criminal prosecution was frivolous,braunstein must demonstrate that the government position was foreclosed by binding precedent or so obviously wrong as to be frivolous.gilbert,at.
the ausa obtained an indictment against braunstein for the federal crimes of wire fraud,interstate transportation of goods obtained by fraud,and money laundering,and.
a defendant is guilty of wire fraud when he engages in a scheme to defraud uses the wires to further that scheme and has
