background 
this case arises out of gcmad longstanding use of pesticides to control mosquitoes in gem county,idaho.among other measures,gcmad has applied used to kill adult spraying from airplanes and fogging from trucks.dill sent gcmad a notice of intent to sue pursuant to b,alleging that gcmad was required to obtain an npdes permit from the environmental protection agency epa for its discharge of pesticides not limited to adulticides into the waters of the united states.gcmad then applied to the epa for an npdes permit.the epa responded that an npdes permit was unnecessary and therefore unavailable under an epa interim interpretive guidance.
after the epa refused to grant a permit to gcmad,the parties engaged in preliminary settlement talks.before a settlement was reached,however,gcmad brought suit against the epa and dill in federal district court for the district of columbia.gcmad sought a declaratory judgment that either it was not required to obtain a permit or that the epa was required to issue it a permit.however,gcmad consistently contended in that court that a permit was not required.dill responded by filing suit in federal district court in idaho.as he had alleged in his letter,dill again alleged that gcmad was violating the cwa by discharging pesticides not limited to adulticides into the waters of the united states without an npdes permit.the district court in idaho stayed proceedings pending resolution of the suit in district court.
the district court dismissed gcmad suit in january.gem county mosquito abatement dist.epa,d.it held that there was no case or controversy between gcmad and the epa because both parties took the position that no permit was required.id.at.it further held that venue in was improper for gcmad claim against dill.id.at.gcmad appealed this decision to the circuit,but then dismissed its own appeal.gem county mosquito abatement dist.epa,wl.
the idaho district court lifted its stay in march.in july,the parties filed a settlement agreement settlement agreement or agreement with the district court.the agreement requires gcmad to make a concerted effort to substantially reduce over five years its use of adulticides by attempting to meet yearly targets for reduced use not to engage in aerial spraying of adulticides except in the event of a declared health emergency not to engage in truck fogging of adulticides within feet of the payette river on the payette river wildlife management area or within feet of a section of that area or on or within feet of any irrigation canal in the county to conduct surveillance monitoring and upgrade surveillance activities for mosquitoes and apply mosquito threshold standards before fogging to contribute funds annually to the gem county soil and water conservation district to help improve drainage in order to facilitate reduction of mosquito habitat to participate in a state planning committee on the west nile virus to work with landowners to eliminate mosquito habitat and to apply reasonable standards,take reasonable steps,and consider all relevant factors when complying with requests from property owners that their property not be sprayed.
the agreement requires dill to release all claims against gcmad under the cwa and dismiss his suit with prejudice to work with gcmad to notify dill neighbors about the agreement and the mosquito control methods to be used around his land to introduce additional mosquito predators on his property and to agree not to sue under the cwa as long as gcmad complies with the agreement.
the agreement provides that the district court should retain jurisdiction to enforce its terms.finally,the agreement provides,the parties have not agreed on the issues of attorney fees and costs.the parties agree that the court will retain jurisdiction to decide any applications for attorney fees and costs pursuant to d submitted by any party.
dill applied to the district court for attorney fees.the district court denied dill application under d,holding that dill was not a prevailing or substantially prevailing party and,in the alternative,that an award was not appropriate.dill timely appealed.
ii.standard of review 
we review the district court award or denial of attorney fees for abuse of discretion.fischer,cir.under this standard,we review the district court factual findings for clear error and review de novo its legal analysis.id.
iii.discussion 
section d of the cwa provides 
the court,in issuing any final order in any action brought pursuant to this section,may award costs of litigation including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees to any prevailing or substantially prevailing party,whenever the court determines such award is appropriate.
d.in order to award attorney fees under d,a district court must make two findings.first,it must find that the fee applicant is a prevailing or substantially prevailing party.second,it must find that an award of attorney fees is appropriate.we address each in turn.
prevailing or substantially prevailing party 
dill contends that he is a prevailing party within the meaning of d.he makes two arguments.first,he argues that he received actual relief on the merits of his claim that materially alter ed the legal relationship between him and gcmad by modifying gcmad behavior in a way that directly benefits dill.richard dep t of dev.servs.of,cir internal quotation marks omitted.second,in the alternative,he argues that he is entitled to recover fees on the catalyst theory.for the reasons that follow,we agree with dill first argument.we do not reach his second argument.
a litigant qualifies as a prevailing party if it has obtained a chang e in the legal relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant.buckhannon bd.care home.dep t of health human,d alterations in original citation omitted.t he plaintiff must be able to point to a resolution of the dispute which changes the legal relationship between itself and the defendant.state teachers ass garland indep.sch,d.following buckhannon and texas state teachers,we have held that parties must have obtained judicially enforceable actual relief on the merits of their claim that materially alter ed the legal relationship between the parties.richard,at alterations in original internal quotation marks omitted.
we divide our application of richard to the settlement agreement into three parts judicial enforcement material alteration of the legal relationship between the parties and actual relief on the merits of dill claim.
first,we conclude that the terms of the agreement are judicially enforceable.the agreement specifically provided that its terms would be enforceable by the district court.pursuant to the agreement,the district court order dismissing dill complaint provided,the court expressly retains jurisdiction over the matter for the purposes of i enforcing the settlement agreement entered into between the parties and the terms of the settlement agreement are incorporated herein by reference,and ii deciding any applications for attorney fees and costs pursuant to d.binding settlement agreements over which the district court retains jurisdiction to enforce are judicially enforceable.richard,at.
second,we conclude that the agreement effected a material alteration in the legal relationship between the parties.dill and gcmad did not agree in the district court on whether,or how much,gcmad behavior was changed as a result of the agreement.dill contended that the agreement required gcmad to change the manner in which it had been applying,and would apply,adulticides.however,gcmad contended that the agreement required it to do only what it was already doing and would continue to do.the district court declined to resolve this dispute.but the court noted that even if the agreement required gcmad to do only what it was already doing,it was undisputed that gcmad behavior became legally required rather than voluntary as a result of the agreement.
third,for the reasons that follow,we conclude that dill achieved actual relief on the merits of his claim.to achieve such relief,a plaintiff must receive some actual relief that serves the goals of the claim in his or her complaint.as explained below,the relief achieved need not be of precisely the same character as the relief sought in the complaint,but it must require defendants to do something they otherwise would not have been required to do.
the threshold for sufficient relief to confer prevailing party status is not high.if the plaintiff has succeeded on any significant issue in litigation which achieve d some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing suit,the plaintiff has crossed the threshold to a fee award of some kind.state teachers,at.alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.in farrar hobby,d,the supreme court made clear how little actual relief is necessary.plaintiffs had received only nominal damages at trial,even though in the complaint they had sought substantial actual damages.the court nonetheless held that the plaintiffs were eligible for attorney fees as prevailing parties,explaining that a plaintiff who wins nominal damages is a prevailing party because a judgment for damages in any amount,whether compensatory or nominal,modifies the defendant behavior for the plaintiff benefit by forcing the defendant to pay an amount of money he otherwise would not pay.id.at.thus,while the nature and quality of relief may affect the amount of the fees awarded,an extremely small amount of relief is sufficient to confer prevailing party status.see id.at.
in fischer,at,we applied farrar to hold not only that the amount of relief obtained may be much smaller than the amount sought,but also that it need not be identical in form.the plaintiff in fischer had sought injunctive relief under the americans with disabilities act against an inn that had refused to allow him to enter with his service dog.id.at.the parties entered into a settlement under which the inn agreed to print a statement explaining its policy of nondiscrimination against people with disabilities.
id.the district court denied a grant of attorney fees,but we reversed,holding that b ecause fischer has an enforceable settlement that requires the inn to do something it otherwise would not be required to do,fischer is a prevailing party.id.at.we stated,according to fischer complaint,the goal of his ada claim was to obtain an injunction that would force the inn to change its alleged policy and practice of denying access to people who use service dogs.in the end that is exactly what he achieved.id.at.
in this case,dill sought to require gcmad to cease discharging pesticides into the waters of the united states unless it could obtain a npdes permit.specifically,the complaint asked the district court,inter alia,to grant the following relief enjoin defendants from applying pollutants in the payette river,its tributaries,and all other surface waters in such a manner as will result in further violations of the act.in particular,plaintiffs seek an order enjoining defendants from discharging pollutants without a npdes permit.
the epa refused to issue a permit to gcmad on the ground that under its interim interpretive guidance no permit was necessary for gcmad to engage in discharge of pesticides for purposes of mosquito control.this guidance was incorporated into a formal regulation providing that mosquito abatement programs that comply with the federal insecticide,fungicide,and rodenticide act fifra do not result in the discharge of pollutants under the cwa and therefore do not require a npdes permit.h.the regulation was eventually held invalid in national cotton council of america epa,cir,a multidistrict litigation decision that is binding in this circuit.under national cotton council,gcmad is now required to obtain a npdes permit for its pesticide aerial spraying and truck fogging that results in pesticide residue and excess pesticide being discharged into the waters of the united states.id.at.
dill did not succeed in obtaining the precise legal ruling and relief that he sought in his complaint.perhaps if he had had enough money,he could have continued his suit and joined in the multidistrict litigation that culminated in the sixth circuit decision in national cotton council.but he settled instead.in practical terms,the remedy dill achieved in the settlement agreement was an important part of what he sought in his suit under the cwa.in his complaint,dill asked for an injunction against unpermitted discharges of all pesticides not limited to adulticides into specified waters of the united states.in his judicially enforceable agreement,dill got the equivalent of an injunction against discharges of adulticides into those waters.that is,gcmad entered into a judicially enforceable agreement not to engage in any aerial spraying of adulticides except in a declared health emergency,and not to engage in any truck fogging within either or yards of specifically described waterways,including the payette river.
the relief achieved by dill in the agreement clearly promoted the goals of the cwa.the purpose of an award of costs and fees is to encourage the achievement of statutory goals.ruckelshaus sierra club,d see also.state teachers,at.holding that a prevailing party alters the legal relationship between the parties in a manner which congress sought to promote in the fee statute.the goal of the cwa is to restore and maintain the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of the nation waters by eliminating pollution.a.the cwa achieves this goal by forbidding or minimizing pollution through the npdes permitting process.dill achieved this goal by forbidding or minimizing adulticide pollution directly through the settlement agreement.
based on the epa construction of the cwa in its guidance under which gcmad was not required to obtain a npdes permit,the district court concluded that dill relief did not promote the goals of the cwa.however,the interim guidance later,the formal regulation on which epa relied has now been held invalid in national cotton council as inconsistent with the cwa,in a decision rendered after the district court ruled on dill application for attorney fees.the sixth circuit decision in that case vindicates dill litigation position that gcmad actions violated the cwa,and shows that the terms of the agreement reducing discharges of pesticides into the waters of the united states serve the goal of the cwa.
we therefore hold that the agreement meets the three con
