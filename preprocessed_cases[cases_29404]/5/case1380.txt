background 
is a small,corporation that sells hospital supplies throughout the united states in the early,began importing surgical,scissors and the suppliers in pakistan.the surgical instruments entered the united states at the port of detroit,where engaged the services of a licensed customs broker,lep international,lep,to complete the required customs entry forms.the forms require the importer to list the price actually paid or payable for goods entering the country.b.
although in fact paid the invoice price for the imported goods,it subsequently received rebates from its pakistani suppliers.from to,consulted with lep regarding the manner in which it should declare the price actually paid or payable for the surgical instruments it imported from pakistan.lep advised to declare the price that was reflected on the invoices accompanying the imported supplies.as a result,declared a higher price on the customs entry forms than the price it ultimately paid for the supplies after deducting the subsequent rebates.because the goods imported from pakistan were,however,the united states customs service customs suffered no loss of revenue as a result of this practice the customs entry forms do not require disclosure of any price rebate.see id.
beginning in early,became the subject of civil and criminal investigations for allegedly falsifying the forms it submitted to customs.on march,customs officials executed a search warrant at headquarters,seizing evidence relating to the value of surgical instruments imported from pakistan.over the next year,customs sought the indictment of and two of its executives for criminal customs fraud.these efforts ultimately proved unsuccessful,however,as both the united states attorney for the eastern district of michigan and the united states attorney for the eastern district of virginia declined to prosecute.
notwithstanding the federal prosecutors decision not to indict for criminal customs fraud,customs began to issue a series of civil penalty notices against in based upon allegations that it had fraudulently overstated the prices it had paid for imported surgical instruments and that it had engaged in an international money laundering scheme.undaunted,steadfastly refused to pay any of the amounts alleged in the various penalty notices.in november,customs referred its case to the department of justice doj for the collection of civil penalties.doj then brought suit against,on behalf of customs,in the united states court of international trade cit on april.
on numerous occasions before and during the enforcement trial,counsel explained to both doj and customs that had relied on lep advice in reporting the prices of the surgical supplies it had imported from pakistan.evidence likewise emerged both before and during trial that indicated that had not in fact engaged in any fraudulent scheme.after the government rested its case,moved for judgment as a matter of law on two of the three counts.doj then decided to dismiss its fraud claim against.the cit subsequently granted motion for judgment as a matter of law on the gross negligence count,finding no evidence which rises to the level of willful or wanton conduct.complaint at.at the close of trial,the jury deliberated on the sole remaining negligence count and returned a verdict in favor.
filed the instant lawsuit under the ftca on june,to recover the million in attorney fees it had incurred defending itself against the government.count i of the complaint alleged that the government engaged in a malicious prosecution because it lacked probable cause to issue the penalty notices against or to sue for collection of those penalties in the cit.it also claimed that customs officials knowingly violated their own regulations by seeking to impose civil penalties on.count ii alleged that the government engaged in an abuse of process in connection with the penalty notices and enforcement trial.
the government then moved to dismiss complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,arguing that claims were jurisdictionally barred because the united states had not waived its sovereign immunity from suit.granting the government motion to dismiss in part the district court held that because the ftca does not contain an express waiver of sovereign immunity for the recovery of attorney fees,it lacked authority to award as damages the attorney fees expended defending itself against the government alleged tortious conduct,d at.
although the district court recognized the unique posture of sought attorney fees qua damages,not attorney fees incurred in pursuing the ftca district court concluded that the result must be the same as that obtained in the myriad appellate court decisions holding that attorney fees are not recoverable under the ftca.id.at.stating that parties can not use artful pleading to circumvent the limitations of a statute,the district court rejected characterization of the million in attorney fees as money damages for injury or loss of property.id.quoting b.the district court further observed that had failed to cite a single case in which a court had awarded attorney fees in an abuse of process or malicious prosecution action brought under the ftca.id.at.because it also was unaware of any such cases itself,save a single district court decision overturned by the ninth circuit on other jurisdictional grounds,the district court declined to be the first.id.
in addition,the district court reasoned that its analysis is further supported by the fact that congress established the equal access to justice act eaja as a separate statutory scheme that specifically waives the government sovereign immunity for awards of attorney fees.id.noting that a precisely drawn,detailed statute more general remedies,the district court declined to imply the availability of attorney fees under the more general ftca,when the drawn eaja appears to express congress clear mandate concerning the issue.id.because,as conceded,it did not meet certain procedural requirements of eaja,the district court refused to allow to seek the same relief under a different,more general statute.id.at.
nevertheless,the district court observed that all may not be lost for,given that its complaint asserts that it incurred special injury including but not limited to in damages.id.emphasis in original.the district court thus gave the opportunity to move to amend its complaint to clarify what other special injury it suffered as a result of the government actions.id.declined to do so,however,choosing instead to file a motion for reconsideration,which the district court denied.soon thereafter,on january,the district court entered final judgment in the government favor.now appeals.

sovereign immunity and the federal tort claims act 
absent waiver,the doctrine of sovereign immunity shields the federal government from suit.fdic meyer,d see also united states sherwood.because sovereign immunity is jurisdictional in nature,meyer,at,the terms of the government consent to be sued in any court define that court jurisdiction to entertain the suit,sherwood,at.as the supreme court has often observed,waiver of sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed in the statutory text and strictly construed,in terms of its scope,in favor of the sovereign.dep t of army blue fox,d internal quotations omitted.a party bringing suit against the united states bears the burden of proving that the government has unequivocally waived its immunity.see,graham fed.emergency mgmt.agency,cir james united states,cir reynolds army air force exch.
the ftca represents a limited waiver of the government sovereign immunity,united states orleans,d,grant ing the federal district courts jurisdiction over a certain category of claims for which the united states has render ed itself liable,meyer,at.quoting richards united states,d.specifically,section b of the ftca confers exclusive jurisdiction to the district courts over 
civil actions on claims against the united states,for money damages for injury or loss of property,or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment,under circumstances where the united states,if a private person,would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.
b.in meyer the supreme court recognized that this language establishes six elements a claim must encompass to be actionable under section b,namely,the claim must be 
against the united states,for money damages,for injury or loss of property,or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment,under circumstances where the united states,if a private person,would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.
meyer at.quoting b.claim plainly satisfies four of the six elements,it is against the united states which is the named defendant,seeks in damages,which were caused by the wrongful conduct malicious prosecution and abuse of practice of employees of the united states justice department and commerce department acting within the scope of their official enforcement duties.for the following reasons,we conclude that the claim also satisfies the third and sixth elements and therefore the district court possessed jurisdiction over the claim under section b.
first,the money damages for the roughly million expended defending itself in the prior proceedings may be properly characterized as damages for injury or loss of property within the meaning of the third statutory element of section b whether they be considered as damages for injury actionable injury other than personal injury here,for example,being subjected to indictment,trial,penalties,or viewed as damages for loss of property that is,of the funds necessarily expended to defend against the wrongful legal proceedings.in fact,expenditures for legal defense traditionally make up a major component of the damages recoverable for malicious prosecution and abuse of process.see restatement second of torts,b damages for unjustifiable criminal litigation,c damages for unjustifiable civil litigation for abuse of process page keaton et,prosser and keeton on torts,at criminal malicious prosecution damages,at civil malicious prosecution damages ed.it is therefore unlikely that the congress intended to foreclose such damages in actions against the government under the ftca which expressly authorizes actions for malicious prosecution and abuse of process.see h provisions of section b of this title shall apply to any claim arising,on or after the date of the enactment of this proviso,out of assault,battery,false imprisonment,false arrest,abuse of process,or malicious prosecution emphasis added see also smith united states,d we should also have in mind that the ftca waives the immunity of the united states and that we should not take it upon ourselves to extend the waiver beyond that which congress intended.neither,however,should we assume the authority to narrow the waiver that congress intended.quoting united states kubrick,d.when the congress wished to except a class of damages from the ftc,it had no difficulty doing so specifically and unambiguously.see excepting government liability for interest or punitive damages discussed infra.
even if an ftca claim satisfies section b third requirement it may yet fail the sixth requirement and jurisdiction be therefore lacking.the section sixth element requires that the alleged wrong have been done under circumstances where the united states,if a private person,would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.in meyer,the supreme court made clear that section b reference to the law of the place means law of the source of substantive liability under the ftca.meyer,at.thus,under the sixth element,state law establishes the elements of a particular tort that is otherwise actionable under the ftca.while the choice of law issue is not before us,we note that the district of columbia is not alone in allowing attorney fees to be recovered as damages in a malicious prosecution suit.our examination of state tort law reveals that many states permit the recovery of attorney fees qua damages in malicious prosecution,to our knowledge,not a single state forbids the practice assuming,then,without deciding,that district of columbia tort law applies in this case,will be able to seek such damages here.
to be sure,several appellate courts have held that attorney fees are not recoverable under the ftca.see,anderson united states,cir congress has not waived the government sovereign immunity for attorney fees and expenses under the ftca,cert.denied,d joe united states,cir the ftca does not contain the express waiver of sovereign immunity necessary to permit a court to award attorney fees against the united states directly under that act.however,is not seeking the attorney fees it incurred in bringing its ftca action but rather damages in the form of attorney fees already expended in defending itself against the underlying tortious conduct.br.for appellant at.because anderson,joe and similar cases stand only for the proposition that a prevailing party may not recover the attorney fees incurred in prosecuting an ftca action,they provide no basis for denying recovery of its measured in the form of attorney.anderson,at joe,at.
moreover,as correctly observes,a pat reliance upon cases such as anderson and joe effectively reads a waiver requirement into the ftca,absent the express waiver of a specific category of example,pain and category of damages may not be recovered under the ftca.in our view,at least two rationales counsel against such a reading.first,the ftca expressly precludes the recovery of prejudgment interest and punitive damages only.the inclusion of this provision suggests that other categories of damages should not be precluded.see,meissner,a n item which is omitted from a list of exclusions is presumed not to be excluded.detweiler pena,where a statute contains explicit exceptions,the courts are reluctant to find other implicit exceptions.second,given the absence of any waiver in the ftca itself,reading such a requirement into the statute could preclude the recovery of any category of damages,including pain and suffering,lost wages and medical expenses.by adhering to the ordinary meaning of section b,however,we avoid such an illogical result.see united states wilson.absurd results are strongly disfavored in construing statute quoting griffin oceanic contractors,d,cert.denied,d 
we note that the government finds some support for its position in a series of ninth circuit decisions holding that the ftca does not confer subject matter jurisdiction upon the district court for claims seeking expenses incurred by states in fighting forest fires negligently set in forests.see idaho ex rel.trombley dep t of army corps of engineers,cir,cert.denied,d california united states,cir,cert.denied,d oregon united states,cir,cert.denied,d.such expenses,the ninth circuit reasoned,simply do not constitute money damages for injury or loss of property under the ftca.idaho,at.because it concluded that the had sought the recovery of firefighting expenses and not damages to person or property,the ninth circuit thrice held that section b does not confer jurisdiction upon the district court to hear such claims.see id.at see also california,at oregon,at 
attempts to distinguish the ninth circuit firefighting expenses decisions on two distinct bases.first,argues that the ninth circuit decisions are inapposite because,unlike the in idaho,california and oregon,it has alleged the commission of intentional of process and malicious than negligence.this argument fails to withstand close scrutiny,however,as none of the ninth circuit decisions appears to turn on the nature of the cause of action alleged.see idaho,at california,at oregon,at.
citing new york united states,next argues that the ninth circuit decisions are inapplicable because,unlike the in idaho,california and oregon,it has in fact alleged injury to property.this argument has some appeal.in new york united states,the district court held that the ninth circuit firefighting expenses cases did not control new york claim for money damages under the ftca for the costs it incurred in removing jet fuel contaminants from a former air force base.id.at.rejecting the government argument that the state damages claim was really an equitable restitution claim seeking compensation for the alleged costs of cleaning up the polluted areas,the district court agreed with new york that the cost of removing the contaminants is simply the suggested measure of damages to its property.id.at.similarly,argues here that the attorney fees it incurred defending itself represent the measure of the damage to its property,its financial assets.reply br.at.although the new york decision arguably involved a more conventional loss of underlying the former air force base was argument carries a certain degree of force.new york.at.
to the extent that the ninth circuit firefighting expenses decisions require a physical injury to recover money damages under the ftca,we decline to follow them.no such requirement appears on the face of section b and we decline to engraft one.we thus conclude that has adequately stated a claim for money damages for injury or loss of property within section b to the extent that the state law governing tort claims allows the recovery of attorney fees qua damages for abuse of process and malicious prosecution.b.
b.the equal access to justice act 
the district court declined to sanction the availability of attorney fees under the more general ftca,when the drawn eaja appears to express congress clear mandate concerning the issue,d at.on appeal,contends that the district court reliance upon eaja was misplaced because the statute does not preclude recovery of attorney fees qua damages for injury or loss of property under the ftca.once again,we agree with.
s overeign immunity protects the united states from attorney fees liability except to the extent the government has waived its immunity from suit.united states wade,quoting ruckelshaus sierra club,d.as we recognized in american hospital association sullivan,eaja expressly waives the government sovereign immunity for the recovery of attorney fees in two distinct manners.under d a,a prevailing party may recover reasonable attorney fees against the united states if the government takes a substantially unjustified position in the underlying civil litigation.in order to recover attorney fees under section d a,however,a party must satisfy certain threshold eligibility requirements.d b corporate claimant must have net worth not in excess of or more than employees at time civil action filed.alternatively,under b,a court may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party in any civil action brought by or against the united states to the same extent that any other party would be liable under the common law or under the terms of any statute which specifically provides for such an award.
the government relies upon our decision in american postal workers union,united states postal service,to argue that eaja effectively precludes from recovering attorney fees under the ftca.in american postal workers,four former probationary employees of the postal service sought to use the ftca to press claims for retaliatory discharge pursuant to state law.id.at.reasoning that the postal reorganization act pra is the type of narrowly tailored employee compensation scheme that the supreme court has held the more general tort recovery statutes,we ruled that the ftca did not provide a basis for the asserted claim for relief.id.quoting brown servs,d.because the pra incorporated an elaborate remedial system that has been constructed step by step,with careful attention to conflicting policy considerations,we concluded that we have no warrant to permit the appellants to use the ftca as a means of circumventing it.id.quoting bush lucas,d from the government perspective,ftca action is no less an attempt to circumvent the procedures,limitations,and conditions set forth in eaja,specifically,the eligibility criteria of section d b.br.for appellee at.
views matters differently.because eaja explicitly provides that n othing in section d alters,modifies,repeals,invalidates,or supersedes any other provision of federal law which authorizes an award of such fees,eaja,stat,argues that eaja has no effect upon its right to recover attorney money damages for injury or loss of property under the ftca.it thus contends that eaja no preclusion provision renders the government reliance upon american postal workers inapposite because the ftca waiver of sovereign immunity for claims of abuse of process and malicious prosecution is an other provision of federal law which authorizes the award of attorney fees.see h.
although the government correctly observes that the ftca lacks an express waiver for the recovery of attorney fees,its argument under eaja ignores the critical feature of this case does not seek to recover attorney fees per se,but rather attorney fees qua the torts of abuse of process and malicious prosecution.because the ftca waives sovereign immunity for claims of abuse of process and malicious prosecution,h,and in light of the fact that the statutory waiver preceded the enactment of eaja by six years,compare act of,stat.amending section h,with eaja,stat,we have little trouble agreeing with that eaja does not alter,modif y,repeal,invalidate,or supersede the remedies afforded by the ftca.the government reliance on eaja is therefore misplaced.
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that the ftca provides jurisdiction over an action to recover attorney fees qua damages against the united states for the torts of abuse of process and malicious prosecution under the ftca if the law of the place where the tort occurred so provides.b.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
so ordered.
the court hold s that attorney fees qua damages are recoverable against the united states for abuse of process and malicious prosecution if the laws of the place where the tort occurs so provides.op.at.as i interpret the court opinion,the terms injury or loss of property under the federal tort claims act ftca,b,are defined as a matter of federal law in determining whether claim is outside the intended scope of the ftca,and not defined solely by state law.this follows in my view from the following analysis.
in smith united states,d,the supreme court acknowledged that its decisions interpreting the ftca contain varying statements as to how it should be construed.id.at.it announced,however,that it was embracing the approach that we should not take it upon ourselves to extend the waiver beyond that which congress intended.neither,however,should we assume the authority to narrow the waiver that congress intended.id.quoting united states kubrick,d.department of the army blue fox,d,on which the court relies in describing a more stringent standard of review,op.at,involved the administrative procedure act,not the ftca.
the following year,in fdic meyer,d,the supreme court described b as establishing a waiver of sovereign immunity and a cause of action against the federal government if six elements are met.id.at.thus,a claim must be 
against the united states,for money damages,for injury or loss of property,or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment,under circumstances where the united states,if a private person,would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.
id.quoting b alterations in original.the court concluded that a federal due process constitutional claim was not cognizable under the ftca,holding that the claim failed to meet the sixth element because it could not contain an allegation that the united states would be liable to the claimant as a private person in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.id.at.quoting b.as the court noted,it had consistently held that b reference to the law of the place means law of the source of substantive liability under the ftca.id.at.because,b y definition,federal law,not state law,provides the source of liability for a claim alleging the deprivation of a federal constitutional right,a federal constitutional claim could not meet the sixth element of b as it raised no claim under state law,and the united states simply has not rendered itself liable under b for constitutional tort claims.id.at.in other words,the court reference in meyer to the importance of state tort law for defining the scope of the ftca is directed solely at the sixth and last element of b,but a ftca claim,as the government notes,can only be established by meeting all six elements.
in analyzing the fourth element of b,whether the harm complained of by the plaintiff has been caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government,the supreme court has emphasized that federal law controls the definition of the relevant terms.in laird nelms,d,the plaintiffs sought recovery for property damage allegedly resulting from a sonic boom caused by united states military planes flying over north carolina on a training mission.the fourth circuit,relying on a theory of strict or absolute liability for ultrahazardous activities,had reversed the district court grant of summary judgment for the government based on the absence of negligence.id.at.the supreme court reversed,noting that it had previously rejected a claim based on strict liability in dalehite united states,and characterized its holding in dalehite as 
not turn ing on the question of whether the law of texas or of some other state did or did not recognize strict liability for the conduct of ultrahazardous activities.it turned instead on the question of whether the language of the federal tort claims act permitted under any circumstances the imposition of liability upon the government where there had been neither negligence nor wrongful act.the necessary consequence of the court holding in dalehite is that the statutory language negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government,is a uniform federal limitation on the types of acts committed by its employees for which the united states has consented to be sued.regardless of state law characterization,the federal tort claims act itself precludes the imposition of liability if there has been no negligence or other form of malfeasance or nonfeasance.
laird,at.quoting dalehite,at.emphasis added.the supreme court has taken a similar approach in construing other provisions of the ftca,such as the independent contractor exception in,see united states orleans,d logue united states,d,and the intentional torts exception in h,see united states neustadt,d.as the court has said with respect to another section of the ftca prohibiting the award of punitive damages against the government,the meaning of the term punitive damages as used in,a federal statute,is by definition a federal question.molzof united states,d.indian towing united states.
the court notes that it is that under state law whether or not the district of columbia provides the correct substantive law to apply in this case attorney fees may be collected as damages.op.at.hence,the requirement of the sixth element is met by claim.the question remains whether claim is an injury or loss of property under a theory of malicious prosecution.the only supreme court case to discuss the terms injury or loss of property is unhelpful for the court declined,in the course of resolving the scope of the exception under c to t he act broad wavier of sovereign immunity,to resolve the scope of b.see kosak united states,d.
contention that its claim falls within the scope of what congress intended in the ftca by allowing the recovery of damages for injury or loss of property is persuasive.see op.at.it relies on new york united states,where,in,addressing a claim for the costs of removing contaminants placed in the soil by united states air force,new york.at,the district court cited rayonier,united states,d,which held that negligence by the forest service was actionable under the ftca for recovery of property damage,see new york.at.the district court in new york proceeded to accept new york position that its costs were simply the suggested measure of damages to its property,rejecting the united states position that new york claim was in the nature of a claim for equitable restitution for the costs of the clean up.id.so too here,attorneys fees are a measure of the damages it suffered as a result of the government malicious prosecution and abuse of process.cases imposing a physical injury requirement,such as california united states,cir,are distinguishable,and hence the court has no need to hold that it declines to follow them,op.at,because in a malicious prosecution cause of action,it is the litigation itself that is the injury and hence the court need go no further in rejecting that line of authority.the interest in freedom from unjustifiable litigation is protected by actions for malicious prosecution and abuse of process.page keeton,et,prosser and keeton on torts,at ed.hornbook series lawyer ed.thus,the money spent on attorney fees is money spent rectifying or correcting that injury and is recoverable.new york.at.as the court notes,is not seeking to recover its attorney fees for bringing its claim under the ftca.op.at.
contrary to congress endorsement of recovery for malicious prosecution,h,the government proposed restriction of recovery of damages for injury or loss of property or personal injury or death in malicious prosecution claims to claims involving physical damage or injury to the plaintiff property could mean that no recovery would be possible,for example,for civil prosecutions against private corporations involving no imprisonment or other physical intrusion on the plaintiff,nor any loss of a property right by the plaintiff who will by definition have won the prior lawsuit.there is no reason to think that congress was unaware of the traditional meanings of various tort terms when it added malicious prosecution by law enforcement officers to h,and that tort has traditionally allowed for recovery of attorneys fees.see restatement second of torts c prosser and keaton,at id.at,azores,annotation,attorney fees as element of damages in action for false imprisonment or arrest,or for malicious prosecution.the legislative history indicates that in allowing recovery for malicious prosecution or abuse of process and other intentional torts congress intended to reach any case in which a federal law enforcement agent committed the tort while acting
