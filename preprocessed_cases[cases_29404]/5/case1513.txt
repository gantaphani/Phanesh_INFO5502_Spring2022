this case presents a question as to the nature and extent to which district courts are required to give jury instructions in patent cases in which claim construction rulings on disputed claim terms are made prior to trial and followed by the parties during the course of the trial.we hold that it is the duty of trial courts in such cases to inform jurors both of the court claim construction rulings on all disputed claim terms and of the jury obligation to adopt and apply the court determined meanings of disputed claim terms in the jury deliberations of the facts.
sulzer textil and sulzer textile,collectively,sulzer,appeal from an order of the united states district court for the eastern district of texas denying their motion for a new trial based on erroneous jury instructions,following a jury verdict in favor of picanol picanol.sulzer textil picanol,order.sulzer also appeals an order of the district court granting picanol motion in limine to preclude sulzer from introducing evidence pertaining to infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.sulzer textil picanol,in limine order.on,picanol appeals an order of the district court denying its motion for attorneys fees pursuant to.sulzer textil picanol,fee order.as to the jury instructions,we conclude that the district court erred.but because sulzer has failed to show prejudice resulting from such error,we affirm the district court denial of sulzer motion for a new trial.further,because the district court applied the appropriate legal standard in determining the case was not exceptional and did not clearly err in its factual findings supporting that determination,we affirm the district court fee order as well.
a petition for panel rehearing was filed by picanol,contending that the determination in our original opinion that sulzer had not waived recourse to the doctrine of equivalents was not based on the correct record before the district court.sulzer opposed based on its view of the record.both parties were granted leave to file and did file additional materials from the trial court record.from these materials and the arguments presented on picanol petition for panel rehearing,it has become clear that counsel for both parties were not completely forthcoming in the initial briefing of this case with respect to the events surrounding the disposition of picanol motion in limine.we are disappointed that neither party alerted the court that a copy of the district court pretrial order that differed in material respects from the final pretrial order,as entered,was included in the joint appendix.we are also disappointed that neither party attempted to correct the court misconceptions when questioned at oral argument.the record,as now correctly presented,raises questions on sulzer possible waiver that can only be answered by the district court on remand.we therefore grant picanol motion for panel rehearing to the extent of vacating this court original decision on the issue of waiver by sulzer of resort to infringement under the doctrine of equivalents and remand that issue to the district court for determination.this court opinion is modified accordingly.the remaining portions of the opinion are unchanged.
background 
this case concerns weaving machines for weaving threads or yarns into fabric.woven fabric generally consists of perpendicular,interlaced threads or yarns.there are two categories of threads in a woven threads,extending longitudinally in the fabric,and weft threads,extending perpendicularly to the warp threads.before weaving,a large number of parallel warp threads are arranged adjacent to each other.the fabric is then woven by inserting a weft thread,perpendicular to the warp threads,where the weft thread goes alternatively over or under each successive warp thread.
although weaving is an ancient art,technology advances have made weaving more efficient.it would be impractical to weave any significant amount of fabric by inserting each weft over or under each warp therefore,a weaving machine is used.a weaving machine may lift every other warp thread,relative to the remaining warp threads,forming two sets of upper set and a lower set,with a space in between,known as a shed.a weft thread can then be inserted quickly through the shed,using one of a variety of techniques.for example,weaving machines attach the leading edge of a weft thread to a projectile that carries the weft through the shed.rapier weaving machines employ long mechanical arms to carry the weft through the shed.weaving machines use bursts of air to blow the weft thread through the shed.after the weft thread has been inserted through the shed,the upper and lower warp thread sets can then be exchanged,capturing the weft thread in a woven fashion.this process is repeated over and over to create fabric of a desired length.
with any of these types of weaving machines,the timing of the shed operation is critical.the shed must remain open from the beginning of weft insertion until the weft has reached the other side of the machine.if it closes prematurely,before the weft arrives at the other side of the fabric,a weaving fault occurs,leading to degraded fabric and potential machine stoppages.on the other hand,to optimize the rate of fabric production,the shed openings and closings must occur as rapidly as possible to increase the number of weft insertions per minute,and thus,the amount of fabric that can be produced.
historically,the number of weft insertions per minute was limited by how rapidly the carrier of the weft could be transported through the shed.projectile and rapier weaving machines,for example,have maximum weft insertion rates of approximately insertions per minute.sulzer predecessor,the dutch company strake,introduced the first weaving machine in the.these machines promised a greater number of weft insertions per minute however,they were not commercially successful because there was insufficient control over the weft insertion process.in response,strake developed what is known as a time controller,a system that coordinates and controls weft insertion in an weaving machine to ensure that the shed remains open until each weft is properly and fully inserted.the time controller system is the subject of patent the patent,owned by sulzer.the time controller system permits the shed to close as soon as the weft has been fully inserted,without allowing for extra time as a safety margin,and thereby significantly increasing the number of weft insertions per minute.
the time controller of the patent works by coordinating the insertion of the weft with the operational speed of the machine and making necessary adjustments to ensure operation while maintaining optimal machine speed.one embodiment disclosed in the patent makes adjustments by varying the speed of the weft thread during insertion another embodiment adjusts the speed of the machine.claim,the only asserted independent claim of the patent,recites 
in a method of controlling the operation of a weaving machine in which each weft thread is moved through a shed by means of a flowing fluid,the step of correlating the speed of the movement of each weft thread through the shed with the speed of operation of the weaving machine by 
a measuring the time occupied by movement of a weft thread through the shed 
b generating a first electrical signal which is a measure of such time 
c generating a second electrical signal which is a measure of a predetermined fraction of the time occupied by a weaving cycle of the machine 
d comparing said electrical signals and generating a third electrical signal which is a measure of the discrepancy between said first and second signals and 
e using said third signal to control one of said speeds in order to eliminate the discrepancy between first and second signals.
another problem peculiar to weaving machines is caused by the manner in which weft threads are supplied.thousands of yards of weft are typically wound onto a spool,from which thread is withdrawn by the as individual wefts are inserted through the shed.when the spool is nearing its end,the tail end of the yarn from that spool is tied to the leading edge of the thread on a fresh spool.the result is that thread from a fresh spool flies slower than thread from an old spool.without adjusting for this change in speed,fabric faults may occur.strake,at the same time it developed the time controller system,also invented a system whereby an weaving machine will temporarily blow more air when weft thread from a new spool is inserted to ensure that the weft arrives at the other end of the shed before it closes.this system is known as the invention,and is the subject of patent the patent,also owned by sulzer.claim,the only asserted independent claim of the patent,recites 
a method for weaving on a weaving machine operating with a blowing nozzle for a flowing transport fluid,in which weft threads are measured and withdrawn from successive yarn packets,characterized in that the switching to a next yarn packet is combined with a temporary change in the feed pressure of the blowing nozzle.
sulzer textil ag,a swiss company,acquired strake as well as ownership of the and patents,and is one of the industry leaders in the manufacture of weaving machines.sulzer textile,sells and services sulzer weaving machines and spare parts in the united states.sulzer brought the first commercially viable weaving machine to market in the early.picanol,a belgian company,is also a manufacturer of weaving machines and a competitor of sulzer.picanol introduced its delta,omni,and models of weaving machines to the united states market beginning in the.these machines incorporate a system and adaptive insertion control systems,known as and,to ensure that the weft thread maintains a constant arrival time.
as early as,sulzer accused picanol of infringing its patents.while picanol denied infringement,the two parties discussed possible of a number of different patents,including the and patents.in,the parties reached an agreement for,but the agreement was never formalized due to objections by a partner of sulzer.
in may,sulzer filed suit against picanol,alleging infringement of the and patents.on november,a special master was appointed to aid the district court with construction of disputed claim terms in accordance with markman.on february,the special master issued a report construing twelve disputed claim terms.the report was adopted in its entirety by the district court on february.on june,picanol filed a motion in limine,based on festo shoketsu kinzoku kogyo kabushiki,en banc festo i,to preclude sulzer from introducing evidence of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents due to prosecution history estoppel.on september,a jury trial commenced.prior to the conclusion of the jury trial,the district court issued an order granting picanol motion in limine.the court also entertained requests for jury instructions and made rulings on those requests.in one of the jury instructions,the district court incorrectly referred to the manufacture,not the operation,of picanol machines.the jury instructions contained no discussion of the district court claim construction rulings.on september,the jury was charged,deliberated,and returned a verdict of in favor of picanol as to both.on october,sulzer filed a motion for a new trial based on the two asserted errors in the jury instructions.sulzer motion was denied on april.sulzer preserved its right to appeal the jury instruction issues,and picanol does not challenge that right.at the conclusion of the proceedings before the district court,picanol moved for attorneys fees under.the district court denied picanol fee motion.

standard of review 
in this appeal,we are faced with the question of whether to apply federal circuit or fifth circuit law to a number of the issues raised by the parties.we answer this question on an issue by issue basis and will apply the law of the regional circuit to which district court appeals normally lie,unless the issue pertains to or is unique to patent law,molins plc quigg,citations omitted,in which case,we will apply our own law to both substantive and procedural issues intimately involved in the substance of enforcement of the patent right.viam iowa.trading.
the denial of a motion for a new trial is a procedural issue not unique to patent law,and thus,we apply the law of the regional the fifth circuit.see wms gaming int l game.in the fifth circuit,the decision to grant or deny a motion for a new trial is within the discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion or a misapprehension of the law.prytania park hotel star indem,cir citations omitted.

ii.motion for a new trial 
in contesting the district court denial of its motion for a new trial,sulzer takes issue with two aspects of the district court jury instructions.first,sulzer contends that the district court instruction regarding the standard for infringement was legally erroneous.in instructing the jury,the district court stated that sulzer must show that picanol has manufactured its weaving machines using a process which includes all steps of the claims.emphasis added.sulzer argues that this instruction is wrong because the claims of the are not directed to the manufacture of weaving machines but to the methods of operation of the weaving machines.second,sulzer asserts that the district court committed legal error by failing to give the jury any instruction on claim construction.we address each of these arguments in turn.
a.the incorrect instruction 
sulzer first argues that the district court instruction requiring sulzer to show that picanol manufactured its weaving machines according to the claims was incorrect.sulzer also argues that the incorrect instruction was prejudicial,because sulzer could not have anticipated that it would have to prove how picanol manufactured its weaving machines and,therefore,only presented evidence on how the machines operated.because no evidence was submitted on how the machines were manufactured,and because the claims recite methods of operation of the machines and not methods of manufacturing,sulzer asserts that the jury was confused by the erroneous instruction.it offers as proof the fact that the jury returned a verdict in picanol favor after only a short period of deliberation.picanol argues that the jury instructions,when considered as a whole and in the context of the trial,were not prejudicially erroneous,because the jury would have understood that the incorrect reference in the instruction to the manufacture,rather than the operation,of the accused machine,was apparent from the trial and from the rest of the instructions.we agree with picanol.
the parties agree that the claims of the are not directed to the process of manufacturing machines.however,it is not enough to merely show that a jury instruction is erroneous sulzer also must show that the erroneous jury instruction was prejudicial.advanced display,at.when the error in a jury instruction could not have changed the result,the erroneous instruction is harmless.environ,furon,weinar rollform,defining prejudicial error in context of jury instruction as one that is not harmless.to determine whether the erroneous jury instruction was prejudicial,the entirety of the proceedings,including the jury instructions as a whole,must be considered.see baker hughes prod.tools.
the burden of establishing prejudice falls on sulzer.see ecolab,at.sulzer offers only the statement that it is virtually certain that the jury arrived at the verdict of because it heard no evidence of picanol manufacturing and concluded that sulzer failed to meet its burden.in reaching this conclusion,sulzer places heavy reliance on the fact that the jury deliberated for only three hours.but sulzer argument ignores the entirety of the trial proceedings.the testimony at trial,as well as all of the jury instructions on infringement but the one erroneous instruction in question,were directed to the method of operation of picanol machines and the extent to which sulzer patent claims read on that method of operation,applying the correct standard for infringement.specifically,the district court jury charge correctly recited that sulzer contends that picanol supplies,operates,and causes the operation of delta,omni,and weaving machines incorporating the methods that are covered by the patents.further,the jury was instructed correctly that t o determine infringement,you must compare the process carried out by the methods used in picanol machines to each claim that sulzer asserts is infringed.the jury also was instructed correctly to examine the process carried out in these machines accused of infringement to consider that p rocess claims are not infringed by the mere existence of a device and to understand that a person is said to be infringing the process claim of a patent when he,without permission from the patent owner,uses the patented process as defined by the claims.sulzer and picanol submitted evidence throughout trial relating solely to the operation of picanol machines,not their manufacture.
we conclude that the single mistaken reference in the jury instructions to the manufacture of picanol machines was an error that was apparent and not prejudicial.the jury instructions,viewed in their entirety and considered in the context of the trial as a whole,presented the correct legal standard for infringement to the jury.sulzer speculative and conclusory argument is not sufficient to establish that,had the one misstatement not been part of the instructions,the result of the case would have been different.therefore,we conclude that,to the extent the noted jury instruction was erroneous,the error was harmless.
b.the missing instruction 
in this case,the district court did not read the court claim constructions to the jury or instruct the jury that the claims,as construed,were to be applied against the alleged infringing machines.sulzer argues that because the district court failed to give the jury any guidance about the district court claim constructions,the jury was free to adopt any interpretation of the claim language.sulzer thus contends that the absence of these instructions was prejudicial.
picanol argues that the district court is not required to recite every claim construction or engage in an exercise in redundancy,citing united states surgical ethicon.picanol argues that the claim constructions rendered by the district court before the trial began shaped the testimony throughout trial.according to picanol,any confusion by the jury as to the appropriate meaning of the claim terms was invited by sulzer.picanol also contends that sulzer has failed to set forth any evidence of prejudice.we conclude that the district court erred in omitting from its jury charge any instructions on claim construction,but we find that such error,in this case,was harmless.
this court has long joined other circuits in holding that one duty of a trial court in any jury trial is to give instructions which are meaningful,not in terms of some abstract case,but which can be understood and given effect by the jury once it resolves the issues of fact which are in dispute.structural rubber prods.park rubber,citing choy bouchelle,cir marshall isthmian lines,cir.jury instructions are reviewed not only for accuracy,but for clarity,objectivity,and adequacy,taken as a whole.see surgical,at brooktree advanced micro devices,the correctness of a jury instruction is reviewed on appeal to determine whether,on the whole,the jury instructions were adequate to ensure that the jury fully understood the legal issues for each element of the case.the meaning and scope of patent claim terms,as determined by a district court claim construction rulings,are legal issues central to most patent cases.thus,the district court normally will need to provide the jury in a patent case with instructions adequate to ensure that the jury fully understands the court claim construction rulings and what the patentee covered by the claims.
the markman decisions,in ruling that claim construction is a matter of law for the court,do not hold that the trial judge in a patent case must repeat or restate every claim term in the court jury instructions.surgical,at.the district court simply must give the jury guidance that can be understood and given effect by the jury once it resolves the issues of fact which are in dispute.structural rubber,at.this means that,as to claim coverage,the district court must instruct the jury on the meanings to be attributed to all disputed terms used in the claims in suit so that the jury will be able to intelligently determine the questions presented.shad dean witter reynolds,cir.
although the particular form and precise nature of jury instructions are matters within the sound discretion of the district court,see ballard medical products allegiance healthcare,the trial court in a patent case must at minimum take steps to assure that the jury understands that it is not free to consider its own meanings for disputed claim terms and that the district court claim construction,determined as a matter of law,is adopted and applied by the jury in its deliberation of the facts.it is not enough that the testimony and argument at trial is consistent with the district court construction of disputed claim terms.the jury must be told that the court has made a claim construction ruling that the jury must follow and can not be left free to apply its own reading of disputed terms to the facts of the case.an instruction should be given to the jury on every material issue.wright miller,federal practice and procedure,at citing gillentine mckeand,cir.accordingly,we hold that it is the duty of trial courts in patent cases in which claim construction rulings on disputed claim terms are made prior to trial and followed by the parties during the course of the trial to inform jurors both of the court claim construction rulings on all disputed claim terms and of the jury obligation to adopt and apply the court determined meanings of disputed claim terms to the jury deliberations of the facts.
in the present case,the district court remarked that i n this suit,the constructed terms were not in dispute at trial.the district court cited surgical,at,for the proposition that w e doubt that markman requires the trial judge to instruct as to an undisputed claim construction for every term.order at.as such,the district court found no error and denied sulzer motion for a new trial.id.in so holding,the district court made two err
