the issue in this case is whether a unilateral attorney fee clause included in an indemnity agreement between a general contractor and a subcontractor is subject to the reciprocity principles set forth in civil code section,subdivision a section a.we conclude that where,as here,the contractual provision is not included as an item of loss or expense under the indemnity agreement,but instead separately provides for the recovery of attorney fees incurred in enforcing the indemnity agreement,section applies and authorizes a prevailing to recover attorney fees so incurred.we also hold that where the is required to prove its lack of fault in defending against a claim under the indemnity,it is entitled to recover the fees incurred therefor.
factual and procedural background 
baldwin builders baldwin was the developer of paloma,a,community in san marcos.coast plastering corporation coast and t m framing,t m entered into subcontracts with baldwin to perform certain construction work in the tierra subdivision of the paloma development.although the subcontracts included general indemnity provisions,coast and t m each executed a indemnity agreement with baldwin,agreeing in relevant part 
the undersigned subcontractor hereby agrees to indemnify baldwin against any claim,loss,damage,expense or liability arising out of acts or omissions of subcontractor in any way connected with the performance of the subcontract unless due solely to baldwin negligence subcontractor shall,on request of baldwin but at subcontractor own expense,defend any suit asserting a claim covered by this indemnity.subcontractor shall pay all costs,including attorney fees,incurred in enforcing this indemnity agreement.
in november,the paloma homeowners filed this action against baldwin for construction defects in the homes.baldwin requested that coast and t m defend and indemnify it against the claims,but after they refused,it against them for express contractual indemnity,implied indemnity,equitable indemnity,contribution,breach of contract,breach of implied warranty,breach of express warranty,negligence and declaratory relief.prior to trial,the court entered an order bifurcating the trial so that the claims of the homeowners in the tierra subdivision,and baldwin related against its subcontractors,would be conducted first.the parties stipulated that the issue of attorney fees and costs between baldwin and its subcontractors would proceed in a bench trial.at trial,the jury returned special verdicts finding that baldwin was negligent,but neither coast nor t m was negligent,in performing their work in the subdivision.
thereafter,coast and t m filed motions and cost memoranda seeking to recover in part attorney fees and nonstatutory costs based on the indemnity agreements.they also sought statutory costs,which are not at issue on this appeal.in support of their requests,coast and t m argued that the indemnity agreements attorney fee provisions were subject to the reciprocity principles of section a,thus entitling them to recover fees and nonstatutory costs notwithstanding the unilateral language of the agreements.they sought to recover all of their costs and fees incurred in defending against baldwin claims.baldwin opposed these arguments,vigorously contending that attorney fee provisions in the indemnity agreements were not subject to section a.
after oral argument,the court issued an order awarding coast in attorney fees and in nonstatutory costs and t m in attorney fees and nonstatutory costs.the court held that although the attorney fee provisions were contained in the indemnity agreements,they authorized recovery of attorney fees and costs incurred to enforce the indemnity agreement,as opposed to fees and costs incurred to defend or indemnify against claims asserted against baldwin and thus were subject to reciprocity under section a.baldwin moved for reconsideration,reiterating its earlier arguments and arguing alternatively that,to the extent section a applied,coast and t m were only entitled to recover fees and nonstatutory costs incurred in enforcing the indemnity provision.the court denied the reconsideration motion based on baldwin failure to establish new or different facts or law,although it also indicated that it would have rejected baldwin arguments on the merits as well.the court awarded coast an additional,and t m an additional,in attorney fees and thereafter entered judgment,from which baldwin now appeals.in the proceedings below,the parties and the trial court implicitly assumed that the recoverability of nonstatutory costs pursuant to the attorney fee clauses was with the recoverability of attorney fees.the parties appellate briefs are based on the same implicit assumption.because the parties have not raised any separate issue regarding the recoverability of nonstatutory costs,we will assume,without deciding,that the parties assumption is correct.

recoverability of fees 
a party who prevails in a civil action is entitled to recover its costs as a matter of right unless otherwise provided by statute.code civ,subd.b see lincoln schurgin th,d.however,california law generally requires that a party to a lawsuit pay its own attorney fees,regardless of whether it prevailed in the action.code civ,trope katz cal th,d.an exception to this general rule is recognized where a contract,statute or other law specifically authorizes the prevailing party to recover attorney fees.code civ,subd.a see also santisas goodin cal th,d.where the recovery of attorney fees is authorized by a contract,the agreement will generally be subject to section a,which provides in part in any action on a contract,where the contract specifically provides that attorney fees and costs,which are incurred to enforce that contract,shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party,then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract,whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or not,shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees in addition to other costs.italics added.
this rule of reciprocity is itself subject to an exception where the recovery of attorney fees is authorized as an item of loss or expense in an indemnity agreement or provision.campbell scripps bank th,d myers building industries,interface technology,th,d myers appalachian ins.mcdonnell douglas d.because an indemnity agreement is intended by the parties to unilaterally benefit the indemnitee,holding it harmless against liabilities and expenses incurred in defending against third party tort claims see,application of reciprocity principles would defeat the very purpose of the agreement.myers,supra,th at,d.in requiring reciprocity of only those provisions that authorize the recovery of attorney fees in an action on the contract,section a expressly excludes indemnity provisions that allow the recovery of attorney fees as an element of loss within the scope of the indemnity.myers,at,d.
here,the attorney fee provisions are set forth in the parties indemnity agreements and thus the paramount issue in this case is whether those provisions are attorney fee clauses that section a requires to be reciprocal or are instead an element of loss within the scope of the indemnity agreements,thus rendering the statute inapplicable.there is no question that if baldwin had been entitled to recover attorney fees incurred in defending against the homeowners claims pursuant to the indemnity agreements see,subd,section a would not have applied to create a reciprocal right on the part of coast and t m to recover attorney fees incurred in defending claims against them arising out of their work under the subcontracts.see campbell scripps bank,supra,th at,d myers,supra,th at,d appalachian ins.mcdonnell douglas,supra,d at.meininger california,d.however,the indemnity agreements here not only provide baldwin with a right to indemnity for liabilities to third parties and expenses including attorney fees arising out of the subcontract work,but they also specify that coast and t m are required to pay baldwin all costs,including attorney fees,incurred in enforcing this indemnity agreement.italics added.
