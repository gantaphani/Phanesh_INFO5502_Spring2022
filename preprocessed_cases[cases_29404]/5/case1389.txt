in,the national science foundation nsf,the sole appellant before this court,and network solutions,nsi,a private contractor,entered into an agreement which permitted nsi to collect fees for internet registration services.nsi and nsf divided the fees,with nsf share deposited into an intellectual infrastructure fund fund for future government use on internet projects.in,william thomas and other parties collectively,appellees,filed a suit in district court seeking to enjoin nsf and nsi from spending monies in the fund and claiming restitution of fees collected from domain name registrants on the internet.the district court issued a preliminary injunction temporarily barring nsf and nsi from spending any money in the fund.see thomas network solutions,injunction order,reprinted in appendix app.subsequently,the district court dismissed all counts of the amended complaint except count one and dismissed nsi from the lawsuit because count one concerned only nsf.see thomas network solutions,d,sj decision.the sj decision also granted partial summary judgment for appellees,holding that the portion of the registration fees deposited in the fund emanated from a tax that was neither imposed nor ratified by congress as required by article i,section of the constitution.although the district court found the tax unconstitutional,it awarded no money relief to appellees.
before the district court was able to render final judgment or issue an order for specific relief in the case,the president signed into law,the fiscal year supplemental appropriations and rescissions act.section of the statute legalized and ratified the registration fee and the monies held by nsf in the fund,thus rendering moot appellees claim before the district court.the district court then vacated the preliminary injunction and dismissed the case.thomas network solutions,dismissal order,reprinted in app.the district court judgment was affirmed by this court in thomas network solutions,thomas ii.
appellees then filed a motion for attorney fees and costs against nsf under the equal access to justice act eaja,d a.the district court,held that,because they had succeeded in securing a preliminary injunction and a partial summary judgment,appellees were prevailing parties under eaja and,thus,entitled to fees and costs.thomas network solutions,fee award,reprinted in app.thomas network solutions,fee decision,reprinted in app.nsf appeals from these judgments.
in buckhannon board care home,west virginia department of health and human resources,d buckhannon,the supreme court denied fees to a party whose claim was mooted by intervening legislation.the court held that a plaintiff is not a prevailing party under a statute simply by virtue of having acquired a judicial pronouncement that the defendant has violated the constitution unaccompanied by judicial relief.id.at.at see also hewitt helms,d.in our view,the court judgment and reasoning in buckhannon make it clear that appellees are not prevailing parties under eaja.we therefore reverse the judgments of the district court.

in october,appellees,various parties who had paid the internet registration fees,filed a civil lawsuit against nsf and nsi in the district court.they claimed that nsf share of the registration fees the preservation assessment was an unconstitutional tax,because congress never authorized the agency to collect and deposit monies into the fund.appellees sought an injunction barring nsf from collecting any further fees or spending any monies in the fund and a refund of the money that had been deposited in the fund.shortly after appellees filed suit,the district court issued a limited preliminary injunction preventing nsf from crediting,spending,obligating or using any of the money collected for,placed into,or taken from the fund pending final adjudication of the case.injunction order,app.
on april,the district court dismissed all counts of the amended complaint,except count one granted a partial summary judgment in favor of appellees against nsf on count one of the amended complaint and dismissed nsi from the case.sj decision,d at dismissal order at,app.the district court held that there is no dispute that the preservation assessment exists to generate revenue for public projects and goals,or that it is a fee imposed independent of and above the cost of domain name registration.sj decision,d at.since the amendment to the cooperative agreement had neither been reviewed nor ratified by congress,the district court reasoned,nsf collection of the assessment was an unapproved tax in violation of article i,section of the constitution.id.at.

ratification of internet intellectual infrastructure fee.a the percent portion of the fee charged by network solutions,between september,and march,for registration and renewal of an internet domain name,which portion was to be expended for the preservation and enhancement of the intellectual infrastructure of the internet under a cooperative agreement with the national science foundation is hereby legalized and ratified and confirmed fully as to all intents and purpose as if the same had,by prior act of congress,been specifically authorized and directed.
pub,stat.this statutory provision had the clear purpose and effect of legalizing and ratifying nsf preservation assessment scheme.

on february,appellees filed a motion in district court seeking an award of attorney fees and costs under eaja.see plaintiffs application in support of motion for award of attorney fees and costs fee motion,reprinted in app.eaja provides that 
except as otherwise specifically provided by statute,a court shall award to a prevailing party other than the united states fees and other expenses incurred by that party in any civil action brought by or against the united states unless the court finds that the position of the united states was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.
