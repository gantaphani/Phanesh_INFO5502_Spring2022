primary residential mortgage,prmi appeals from the district court order awarding yvonne flitton in attorney fees as a prevailing party in a title vii lawsuit.flitton from the same order,challenging the district court conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction to award her appellate attorney fees because she failed to first request such fees in this court.we have jurisdiction under and affirm.
background 
in,flitton filed suit against prmi alleging,inter alia,discriminatory and retaliatory discharge in violation of title vii,and seeking both compensatory and punitive damages for these alleged violations.at the close of flitton case,the district court partially granted prmi motion for judgment as a matter of law jmol and dismissed flitton discrimination and punitive damages claims.the court,however,allowed flitton retaliation claim to go to the jury,which returned a verdict in her favor and awarded her in emotional distress damages.the district court then granted prmi renewed motion for jmol,vacated the jury verdict,and entered judgment in prmi favor on the retaliation claim.
on appeal,this court reversed the district court decisions,remanded the case for a new trial on flitton discrimination and punitive damages claims,and reinstated the jury verdict on flitton retaliation claim.flitton did not ask,and has never asked,this court to award her appellate attorney fees.
on remand,the second trial was divided into a jury trial portion for flitton discrimination and punitive damages claims and a bench trial portion to determine whether she was entitled to,and the amount of,front pay and back pay damages on her retaliation claim.the jury found in favor of prmi on flitton discrimination and punitive damages claims,and the district court awarded her in back pay based on the first jury verdict in her favor.
flitton then sought attorney fees for her counsel work in the first trial,the appeal to this court,and the second trial.after conducting a thorough review of the parties submissions and arguments relating to flitton fees,the district court ultimately awarded her in fees.in explaining the fee amount,the district court rejected prmi contention that flitton was not entitled to any fees related to the second trial,or,in the alternative,that the fee amount should be reduced to reflect flitton limited success on her claims.the court also rejected flitton argument that she was entitled to appellate fees,instead concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to order such an award because flitton had never requested fees from this court.finally,in calculating the precise amount of the fee,the court refused to include fees that it found were unreasonably high or excessive,or were for clerical work,background research,or were supported by vague billing descriptions.prmi now appeals the amount of the award and flitton,claiming the district court erroneously concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to award her appellate fees.
ii.discussion 
in title vii cases,a district court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney fee.k.thus,to obtain attorney fees,a claimant must prove two elements that the claimant was the prevailing party in the proceeding and that the claimant fee request is reasonable.robinson city of edmond,cir.here,prmi does not contest flitton status as a prevailing party rather,it only challenges the reasonableness of the district court fee award.because the district court is in a better position than an appellate court to determine the amount of effort expended and the value of the attorney services,we review an attorney fee award for abuse of discretion.starrett wadley,cir.
the most useful starting point for determining the amount of a reasonable fee is the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.hensley eckerhart,see also robinson,at a court must begin by calculating the lodestar amount of a fee,which is the product of the number of attorney hours reasonably expended and a reasonable hourly rate.this calculation,however,does not end the district court inquiry when,as in this case,the prevailing party succeeds on only some of her claims.hensley,at.indeed,the supreme court has instructed that in such cases,two additional questions must be considered whether the plaintiff successful and unsuccessful claims were related and whether the plaintiff overall level of success justifies a fee award based on the hours expended by plaintiff counsel.id.
a.the district court did not abuse its discretion by awarding flitton fees for the second jury trial 
prmi first argues that the district court should not have awarded flitton any fees associated with her counsel work on the second jury trial because that trial resulted in a complete defense verdict,and the discrimination and punitive damages claims litigated therein are completely unrelated to flitton successful retaliation claim.where the plaintiff has failed to prevail on a claim that is distinct in all respects from his successful claims,the hours spent on the unsuccessful claim should be excluded in considering the amount of a reasonable fee.id.at.if,however,a plaintiff presents multiple related claims,failure on some claims should not preclude full recovery of attorney fees if the plaintiff achieves success on a significant,interrelated claim.jane bangerter,cir.indeed,w here a lawsuit consists of related claims,a plaintiff who has won substantial relief should not have his attorney fee reduced simply because the district court did not adopt each contention raised.hensley,at see also robinson,at recognizing that many civil rights suits involve related claims and holding that i n such cases,it is inappropriate for a district court to evaluate the individual claims as though they were discrete and severable.in the context of fee awards,we have held that claims are related if they are based on a common core of facts or are based on related legal theories.jane,at.
the district court concluded that flitton successful retaliation claim and her unsuccessful discrimination and punitive damages claims were interrelated.we agree.as the district court pointed out,in the second jury trial flitton pursued punitive damages for the retaliation claim on which she had obtained a jury verdict in the first trial.in these circumstances,it is difficult to distinguish between the time flitton attorneys spent on the retaliation claim generally and the time they spent on her claim for punitive damages based on prmi unlawful retaliation.see hensley,at much of counsel time will be devoted generally to the litigation as a whole,making it difficult to divide the hours expended on a basis.furthermore,during the second jury trial,flitton alleged that her termination was discriminatory.this claim concerns a crucial underlying fact that was also addressed in flitton successful retaliation reason for her termination.thus,the unsuccessful claims raised by flitton in the second jury trial were not distinct in all respects from the successful claims she pursued in the first jury trial,and the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to exclude the fees accrued during the second jury trial from flitton ultimate fee award.
b.the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to reduce flitton fee award based on her degree of success 
prmi also contends that the district court erred by not reducing flitton fee award based on her degree of overall success in this lawsuit.the supreme court has instructed that in calculating a reasonable fee award,the most critical factor is the degree of success obtained.id.at.although t here is no precise rule or formula for assessing the plaintiff degree of success,a reduced fee award is appropriate if the relief,however significant,is limited in comparison to the scope of the litigation as a whole.id.at.
prmi contends that because flitton succeeded on only one out of five causes of action listed in her initial complaint and received only in total damages out of the she sought,she obtained a limited degree of overall success and her fee award should have been reduced accordingly.indeed,prmi repeatedly emphasizes that flitton ultimately received only about one percent of the total damages she sought.
we have rejected the mechanical approach to assessing a plaintiff degree of overall success that prmi endorses.in jane,we reversed a district court decision to reduce the lodestar by percent based on the plaintiff success on only two out of eight claims.jane,at see also hensley,at we agree with the district court rejection of a mathematical approach comparing the total number of issues in the case with those actually prevailed upon.quotations omitted.there,we held that the district court must make a qualitative assessment to determine what results are excellent,justifying full recovery,or to what extent plaintiffs limited success should effect a reduction in the lodestar.jane,at.
here,the district court rejected prmi request for a reduction of the fee award based on flitton level of success,concluding that flitton obtained substantial success from the first jury trial,and that she obtained a substantial amount of damages.flitton primary residential mortgage,wl,at,may.although flitton ultimate award did not approach the amount of damages she sought,her award of over in this title vii suit was not inconsequential.see hensley,at nor is it necessarily significant that a prevailing plaintiff did not receive all the relief requested.accordingly,the district court assessment of her overall level of success was not an abuse of discretion.
c.the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to reduce flitton fee award based on her attorneys billing entries 
prmi next argues that the district court erred by not reducing flitton fee award based on her attorneys allegedly vague and nondescript billing entries.plaintiffs burden in an application for attorneys fees is to prove and establish the reasonableness of each dollar,each hour,above zero.jane,at quoting mares credit bureau of raton,cir.plaintiff counsel,of course,is not required to record in great detail how each minute of his time was expended.but at least counsel should identify the general subject matter of his time expenditures.hensley,at.when examining the adequacy of an attorney billing entries,we are primarily concerned with the district court ability to evaluate the propriety of the fee request based on the specific billing entries.see crumpacker.dep t of human,cir the law does not require the district court to reduce its fee award where it finds no difficulty in evaluating the propriety of an attorney billing.indeed,in crumpacker,we affirmed the district court fee award,which included fees for six billing entries that were entirely blacked out and unreadable,because the district court specifically found that the blacked out entries cause no problems in determining the validity or propriety of the work performed.id.quotations and alterations omitted.
here,the district court conducted a thorough review of flitton attorneys billing entries and reduced the fee award based on the inadequacy of eleven specific entries.furthermore,the district court stated,w hile the court does not believe that the entries of plaintiff counsel are ideal,it finds most of the entries adequately descriptive for purposes of reviewing the fee application.flitton,wl,at.accordingly,the district court concluded that it was able to make a fair assessment of the reasonableness of flitton claimed fees based on the majority of the billing entries she submitted,and it refused to award her fees based on specific inadequate entries.after examining the allegedly vague and nondescript entries emphasized by prmi,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to further reduce flitton fee award based on her attorneys billing entries.
d.the district court correctly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to award flitton fees 
in her,flitton argues that the district court erred by concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to award her fees because she failed to first request those fees in this court.in hoyt robson,cir,we recognized that an appellate court has discretion to award attorney fees on appeal.accordingly,we established the general rule that in order for a prevailing party to obtain fees,an application for such fees must first be made to our court.id.indeed,we concluded that a district court generally lacks jurisdiction to consider the propriety of fees if the prevailing party does not first seek such fees on appeal id.
in crumpacker,we reaffirmed the hoyt rule,stating that fees must generally be awarded by us.at.nevertheless,we recognized a narrow exception for interlocutory fees in cases brought under title vii or other statutes.id.under these limited circumstances,we held that parties who prevail on interlocutory review in this court,and who subsequently become prevailing parties under title vii or another provision at the conclusion of merits proceedings,are implicitly entitled to reasonable attorneys fees related to the interlocutory appeal.id.
flitton asks us to extend crumpacker beyond interlocutory appeals.she contends that,after crumpacker,all prevailing parties under title vii are entitled,as a matter of law,to all fees therefore,requesting such fees from this court in the first instance is not necessary.we reject this broad reading of crumpacker.first,this extension of crumpacker is inconsistent with the narrow language used in that case.nowhere in crumpacker did we state or suggest that its rule applies to cases other than those in which a party succeeds on interlocutory appeal and subsequently becomes a prevailing party.those are not the circumstances of flitton case.second,flitton reading of crumpacker would effectively strip this court of its discretion to award fees in all title vii cases.that discretion,however,was the fundamental premise on which the hoyt rule was based,see hoyt,at i n order for us to properly exercise our discretion,an application for attorneys fees must first be made to our court,and crumpacker did not and could not eviscerate it.see crumpacker,at recognizing that hoyt is the law of this circuit,and that the rule of hoyt binds us see also united states walling,cir one panel of the court can not overrule circuit precedent.accordingly,as we stated in crumpacker,i t is the law of this circuit that absent an explicit statutory provision,in order for us to properly exercise our discretion,an application for attorneys fees must first be made to our court.crumpacker,at quoting hoyt,at alterations omitted.flitton never requested fees from this court during her prior appeal and she has not requested them at any point during this appeal.therefore,the district court correctly concluded that it was without authority to grant such fees in the first instance.
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the decision of the district court.
i respectfully dissent from section of the majority opinion,in which the court holds that flitton was appropriately awarded fees for the unsuccessful claims she raised in the second jury trial because these claims were interrelated to the successful claims she had pursued in the first jury trial.i disagree with this analysis and therefore would reverse and remand for the district court to impose an award excluding fees accrued during flitton entirely unsuccessful second jury trial.
a fee award in a title vii case is anchored in prevailing party status,k,which means that a plaintiff must succeed on at least some significant claim for relief to be entitled to attorney fees.see hensley eckerhart.where a plaintiff does not obtain success on all of her claims,t he extent of a plaintiff success is a crucial factor that the district courts should consider carefully in determining the amount of fees to be awarded,id.at,and no fee may be awarded for services on an unsuccessful claim that is distinctly different from the successful claims for relief,id.at.however,when a plaintiff achieves only partial success on interrelated claims,it would be unmanageable or unworkable to separate the hours spent on successful and unsuccessful claims.see id.holding that it may be inappropriate to limit a fee award where claims are interrelated because in such ca
