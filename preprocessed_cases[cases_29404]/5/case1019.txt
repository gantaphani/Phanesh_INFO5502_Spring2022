claimant united medical caregivers clinic umcc prevailed in a civil forfeiture proceeding initiated by the united states.see united states in currency,cir.the civil asset forfeiture reform act cafra provides that in any civil proceeding to forfeit property under any provision of federal law in which the claimant substantially prevails,the united states shall be liable for reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred by the claimant.b a.
umcc has moved for an award of attorney fees pursuant to cafra and has specifically requested that the fee award be paid directly to its counsel rather than to umcc itself,as the claimant.the government does not contest umcc entitlement to fees as a substantially prevailing party but has objected to the amount sought by the motion and has opposed the request that the fee award be paid directly to umcc attorney.
we refer the matter to the appellate commissioner to calculate the amount of an appropriate fee award.we instruct the appellate commissioner to use the lodestar method,and conclude that the actual fee agreement between umcc and its attorney may be taken into account but is not by itself determinative in calculating the appropriate amount of the fee award.as for the payee of the fee award,we conclude that attorney fees awarded under cafra are payable to the claimant,not to claimant attorney,so the fee awarded here will be payable to umcc.
the amount of the fee award 
cafra does not specify precisely how fee awards should be calculated.the statute simply provides that the government is liable for reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred by the claimant.b a.
this court has not yet addressed the proper method of determining a fee award under cafra.other courts have used the lodestar method to determine the amount to be awarded under cafra.see v.one star class sloop sailboat,cir in currency,d.in this case umcc proposes that its fees be determined that way,but the government argues that the lodestar approach should not be used and that the fee should primarily be based on the actual agreement between umcc and its attorney.umcc has declined to make its fee agreement available,and the government asks that its production be ordered.
the lodestar approach is the method customarily used to determine attorney fees under statutes.see blanchard bergeron,the lodestar method determines the statutory fee award under nadarajah holder,cir eaja.we see no reason to depart from that approach under cafra and conclude that the lodestar method should be used in calculating fees in this case.
that does not mean that the actual fee agreement can not be relevant to the fee determination.under and eaja,the actual fee agreement does not act as a cap on the amount of statutory attorney fees awarded.see blanchard,at corder gates,cir nadarajah.at.however,the agreement can be considered when determining a reasonable fee under the lodestar approach.see blanchard,at corder,at.we see no reason to depart from this practice in the cafra context,either.umcc is required to disclose its agreement with its attorney.
this matter is referred to the appellate commissioner for the purpose of determining the amount of reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred by umcc,consistent with this order.the appellate commissioner may issue an order awarding fees and other litigation costs.any such order is subject to a motion for reconsideration by this panel.see circuit rule.
the cafra fee award should be paid to the claimant 
cafra does not explicitly identify to whom an award for fees and costs under that statute are to be paid.it simply says that the united states shall be liable for reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred by the claimant.b a.
prior to cafra enactment in,attorney fees could be sought by successful claimants in forfeiture actions under the equal access to justice act eaja,d.see currency,d at.eaja provides that a court shall award to a prevailing party other than the united states fees and other expenses in specified circumstances.d a.the language used in cafra and eaja is somewhat different.eaja specifically assigns fee awards to the prevailing party,but cafra does not,stating only that the united states shall be liable for reasonable attorney fees.b a.
umcc reads this difference to mean that cafra fees should go directly to attorneys instead of the prevailing litigant.following the supreme court recent decision in astrue ratliff,we conclude otherwise.
ratliff resolved a longstanding circuit split on the question of whether fee awards under eaja were payable to the party or the attorney by holding that eaja awards are to be paid to the prevailing litigant.id.at.in part,the court based its decision on the specific language in eaja,noted above,directing payments to the prevailing party.
p revailing party is a term of art that refers to the prevailing litigant.id.at.cafra does not contain similar language directing fees to the prevailing party.
the court decision in ratliff did not stop there,however.it went on to highlight the absence of language in eaja explicitly directing fees to attorneys.comparing eaja with a provision in the social security act making fee awards payable to such attorney,see b a,the court concluded that given the stark contrast between the ssa express authorization of direct payments to attorneys and the absence of such language in eaja,it would not interpret eaja to contain a direct fee requirement absent clear textual evidence supporting such an interpretation.ratliff.at.as the court noted,congress knows how to make fees awards payable directly to attorneys where it desires to do so.id.at.
ratliff counsels that in the absence of explicit instructions from congress awarding fees to the attorney,direct payment to the attorney should not be presumed.id.there is no such explicit instruction in cafra.
direct payment to the attorney is the exception,not the rule.the supreme court has made it clear that,in general,statutes bestow fees on parties,not upon attorneys.united states ex rel.virani jerry lewis truck parts equipment,cir.for example,attorney fee awards under or under the antitrust laws are payable to parties.see evans jeff,gilbrook.city of westminster,cir in the absence of a contractual assignment to counsel,requires that attorney fee awards be made directly to the prevailing party image technical service,eastman kodak,cir any fee award in an antitrust case goes to the successful plaintiff,not to plaintiff counsel.unless the statute specifies payment to the litigant attorney,payment to the attorney is not assumed.
umcc argues that by not including eaja language mandating fee awards to the prevailing party in cafra,congress signaled its intent to reject eaja method of awarding attorney fees.without further evidence,the use of the passive phrase the united states shall be liable for reasonable attorney fees in cafra,rather than shall award to a prevailing party in eaja,can not be read as a clear expression of congressional intent to create a direct fee award to counsel.if,as umcc argues,congress intended to liberalize fee awards in forfeiture cases with cafra,it did so by eliminating eaja language exempting the government for payment of fees where the position of the united states was substantially justified,not by providing for fee awards to be paid directly to attorneys.b a.neither legislative history nor clear textual evidence,ratliff.at,supports umcc contention that direct fee payment to counsel was one of the reforms envisioned by congress in cafra 
umcc attempts to extract a direct fee requirement from two phrases in b a that the government is liable for attorney fees incurred by the claimant emphasis added.this effort is not persuasive.the word liable,as umcc agrees,means to be legally obligated.see black law dictionary ed.it does not indicate to whom the liability is owed.umcc is right that under statutes,fees may be considered to be incurred by the client even though the client was represented free of charge.see nadarajah.at eaja phillips general services,civil service reform act.but a statute that makes the government liable for fees incurred by a party does not necessarily entitle counsel to a direct fee award.
umcc and amicus curiae national association of criminal defense lawyers nacdl,appearing in support of umcc position,offer policy justifications in support of awarding the fees and costs to the claimant attorney directly rather than to the client.if fee awards are paid to the claimant,they argue,attorneys may not be paid for their work,thus reducing the likelihood of competent representation and defeating congressional intent.it is pointed out that cafra fees due to be paid to the client may be offset in part or in full by the client preexisting debts to the government,leaving nothing to be paid to the attorney that argument did not persuade the supreme court in ratliff,however.the court explicitly noted that eaja fees are subject to offset where a litigant has outstanding federal debts.ratliff.at.the government in that case actually asserted the right to offset a debt owed by the claimant to the federal government against the fee award,producing exactly the result projected by umcc argument,but that did not lead the court to conclude that payment of eaja fees should be made directly to counsel.there is nothing in the background,text,or purpose of cafra that suggests that the same result should not apply to cafra fees.umcc policy arguments must be made to congress,which could draft the fee award statute to specify payment to counsel.cafra was not written that way.
we decline to order direct payment to counsel.the attorney fees and litigation costs awarded in this case are payable to umcc as the successful claimant.
the motion is referred to the appellate commissioner for further proceedings consistent with this order.
referred to the appellate commissioner 
i respectfully dissent.
i agree with the majority conclusion that fees awarded under the civil asset forfeiture reform act cafra should be determined using the lodestar approach.i do not agree,however,that the cafra attorney fees provision requires that attorney fees be paid directly to the client,rather than to the attorney.i would hold that the statutory provision leaves the question whether fees are paid to the attorney or to the client to the discretion of the district court,to be determined on a basis.
astrue ratliff 
the majority relies heavily for its interpretation of the cafra attorney fees provision on astrue ratliff.ratliff held that attorney fees under a particular statute,the equal access to justice act eaja,d,are paid directly to the client.although i agree that ratliff is helpful as an interpretive guide,its guidance leads,in my view,down quite a different path than the one the majority follows.
the interpretative method used in ratliff is heavily textual,concentrating on the precise wording of eaja.there is no mention in ratliff of any presumption that fees are usually awarded to the attorney or to the client.instead,the only presumption is that the terms,structure,and history of each statute should govern.
on examination,none of the factors that the court found persuasive in ratliff as to why eaja directs fees to the client are present in cafra.and some of the factors relied on in ratliff support the conclusion that fees awarded under cafra need not always be paid to the client.
first,and most importantly,the text of eaja directs that courts shall award to a prevailing party fees and other expenses incurred by that party d a emphasis added.the court in ratliff held that prevailing party refers to the prevailing litigant,and so concluded that the text of eaja,literally read,directs that fees must be paid to the litigant,meaning the client.at.
cafra contains no such express direction.the cafra attorney fees provision states only that the united states shall be liable for reasonable attorney fees b.it does say to whom the united states must pay the fees.given the substantial weight that the court in ratliff placed on the phrase to a prevailing party,the absence of a parallel phrase in cafra is sufficient to subvert any comparison to eaja or reliance on ratliff in this case 
second,other textual differences between eaja and cafra further undermine the majority reliance on ratliff interpretation of eaja.the court interpretation was buttressed by subsections of eaja that distinguish the party who receives the fees award the litigant from the attorney who performed the work that generated the fees.id.at.for instance,eaja requires a prevailing party to submit an itemized statement from any attorney,id.at,implying that the term prevailing party is not a reference to the attorney.in contrast,no subsection of cafra differentiates between the claimant and the claimant attorney.
similarly,the text of eaja award s to a prevailing party the reasonable expenses of expert witnesses and any study,analysis,engineering report,test,or project,yet no party in ratliff suggested that those costs were payable directly to the vendors who provide d the relevant services.id.at quoting d a.in other words,the term prevailing party in eaja could not be read as including the prevailing litigant attorney without creating the anomaly that prevailing party would also include other vendors involved in the litigation.thus,the court held that the term prevailing party referred to the prevailing litigant,and that the text of eaja treats attorneys on par with other service providers they all must recover their fees from the litigant.id.
cafra,unlike eaja,does not use language awarding expert expenses to a prevailing party or to the claimant.instead,cafra simply provides that the united states shall be liable for attorney fees and other litigation costs b a.so the anomaly identified in ratliff that would arise if eaja were interpreted to award fees directly to the attorney does arise in cafra.
third,the court contrasted the language of eaja to that of the social security act ssa,which expressly authorizes payment of fee awards directly to attorneys.id.at citing.b a allowing for the payment to such attorney of attorney fees.the court took this statutory difference to suggest that congress knows how to make fees awards payable directly to attorneys where it desires to do so.id.that comparison is consistent with the notion that a provision including statutory text different from both eaja and ssa connotes different results.in other words,congress has made fees payable directly to attorneys ssa and directly to prevailing parties eaja,but cafra does neither,so neither course should follow.
finally,the textual differences between cafra and eaja are especially pertinent given that,prior to the passage of cafra,forfeiture claimants had to rely on eaja to seek fee awards in forfeiture cases.see,united states dolorosa,cir.as congress was presumably aware of the text of eaja,the textual divergence in cafra should be given some import.see,corley united states,applying presumption that meaning should be ascribed to differences in statutory texts.
in sum,the court analysis in ratliff was a textual one,a mode of analysis that points to a different result under cafra than under eaja.the court made no mention of a presumption that fees are ordinarily awarded to either the party or the attorney.
nor is any such presumption discernible in other caselaw.the majority observation that statutes ordinarily bestow fees on parties not attorneys might be correct as a descriptive matter,see op.at,but the text of the statutes identified by the majority specifically direct payment to parties,and so cases interpreting those provisions provide no guidance here.
for example,the majority relies on a statement in united states ex rel.virani jerry lewis truck parts equipment,cir that t he supreme court has made it clear that,in general,statutes bestow fees upon parties,not upon attorneys.id.at.to support that proposition,the virani court cited cases that interpreted the attorney fees provision in.id.citing evans jeff,venegas mitchell,willard city of los angeles,cir.the text of,unlike cafra,directs fees to the prevailing party.see b t he court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney fee.emphasis added likewise,the majority points to cases holding that fee awards in antitrust cases go to successful plaintiffs,not plaintiffs counsel.see op.at citing image technical,eastman kodak,cir.but the text of the fees provisions pertinent to antitrust cases direct fees to the person who shall be injured by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws,meaning the plaintiff,not the plaintiff attorney.a id.t he court shall award the cost of suit,including a reasonable attorney fee,to such plaintiff.
in other words,the cases identified by the majority simply interpret provisions that expressly direct fees to plaintiffs rather than to plaintiffs attorneys they apply no presumption of such a result.and,in fact,virani itself in which we observed that statutes generally bestow fees on parties did not apply any such presumption.instead,it held that the payment of fees under the false claims act must be made directly to the plaintiff counsel,even though the text of the provision at issue could be read as directing that fees be paid to the client.see at interpreting d,which provides that qui tam plaintiff s shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the court finds to have been necessarily incurred,plus reasonable attorneys fees and costs.i therefore can not agree with the majority that after ratliff,a clear expression of congressional intent to create a direct fee award to counsel is necessary.op.at.instead,ratliff counsels a approach to the question,devoid of any universal rule,presumption,or clear statement requirement.
b.the statutory text of cafra 
proceeding in that fashion,and so without the presumption or clear statement requirement applied by the majority,i am not persuaded that there are reasons for concluding that fees under cafra must always be paid directly to the client.
to support its argument that cafra fees should be universally awarded to litigants,not attorneys,the government first points out that the subsection containing cafra attorney fee provision,b,provides for the award of three things attorney fees and litigation costs interest and either actual interest paid to the government resulting from investment of the disputed property or an imputed amount of interest where no interest was actually earned.the government argues that,because interest would almost certainly be paid directly to the claimant,payment of attorney fees should not be treated differently.
but the statutory text of cafra does not require that conclusion.there is no reason to think that all payments provided for by subsection b should be payable to the same person.subsection b provides that the united states shall be liable for those three payments,but it does not indicate to whom they are to be paid.the neutral language,applicable to all three kinds of payments,most sensibly contemplates payment to whomever is appropriate for interest,to the claimant,and for attorney fees,to the attorney or the client,depending on circumstances such as whether the client has already paid the fees.
because there is nothing in subsection b requiring that fees be paid to the claimant,the government advances a different argument premised on another subsection of cafra.the government points out that subsection b a provides that t he united states shall not be required to disgorge the value of any intangible benefits nor make any other payments to the claimant not specifically authorized by this subsection.b a emphasis added.the government maintains that the reference to other payments to the claimant in b a is a to the three payments listed in subsection b,mentioned above.therefore,the argument goes,attorney fees are payments to the claimant,not the attorney.
the government suggestion that subsection b a b is,in my view,incorrect.again,subsection b a reads the united states shall not be required to disgorge the value of any intangible benefits nor make any other payments to the claimant not specifically authorized by this subsection.b a emphasis added.the other payments to the claimant acknowledged in b a is most naturally read as a reference to the other payments to the claimant that are mentioned in that same sentence the value of any intangible benefits.id.in contrast,with regard to the liability created by subsection b,no payments to the claimant are specifically authorized.rather,subsection b establishes liability,but,as we have seen,that subsection does not indicate the person to whom the payment is to be directed.so if one reads subsection b a as a to subsection b,the net effect seems to be the opposite of the one for which the government argues as subsection b does not specifically authorize payments to the claimant,it must be that the payments specified in subsection b are not to be made to the claimant,but to someone else.that result,however,would be an odd and unlikely way of dictating that fee awards are not made to claimants.the more sensible interpretation is that subsection b a is and does not affect subsection b at all.
the government next emphasizes that subsection b a reads reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred by the claimant.b a emphasis added.according to the government,the statutory scheme is compensatory and contemplates making a claimant whole.the government maintains that ordering payment to the claimant for those costs he agreed to pay would be consistent with this compensatory scheme,whereas payment directly to the attorney without regard to the actual payment agreement would not further the statute compensatory goals 
this argument is no more successful than the converse argument that the phrase incurred by the claimant indicates that fees are to be paid to the attorney correctly rejected by the majority.as noted by the majority,eaja,like cafra,requires that recoverable fees be incurred by the client,yet prevailing parties are entitled to fees under eaja even if they were represented free of charge.see nadarajah holder,cir.just as a statute that makes the government liable for fees incurred by a party does not necessarily entitle counsel to a direct fee award,op.at emphasis added,that language likewise does not necessarily mean that the fees are payable to the claimant rather than the lawyer.
instead,the consideration that fees can be incurred by a client who did not agree to or actually pay any fees indicates to me that the choice of the neutral is liable for terminology was deliberate,and connotes similar flexibility in determining to whom the fees are to be paid.paying fees directly to the client in instances where the client did not pay the attorney,or paid an amount less than market rates,could lead to a windfall to the client,or to the client creditors.the majority position does not account for this windfall possibility at all.
cafra permits district courts to direct fee awards to litigants or their attorneys 
the sum of the matter is that the statutory text of cafra does expressly direct fees to the client or to the attorney,and the textual arguments advanced by the government do mandate a particular result.in other words,cafra is directly analogous either to eaja directing fees to the client or to ssa directing fees to the lawyer.
what eaja and the ssa do show,as already noted,is that congress is perfectly capable of making clear to whom the court is to order payment of fees,yet chose in cafra to use passive,neutral language.compare d eaja and b a ssa with b cafra.it did so even though fees were until then being awarded in forfeiture circumstances under eaja,so there was a readily applicable model had congress intended for fees to be universally paid to claimants.see,dolorosa,at discussing application of eaja in forfeiture action.
this choice,it seems to me,is best implemented by permitting district courts to direct fees to either the claimant or the attorney,depending on the circumstances.district courts faced with such a determination might consider the particulars of the agreement between the attorney and the client the likelihood that the attorney would be adequately compensated if fees were paid to the client and whether payment to the client or to the attorney would best further
