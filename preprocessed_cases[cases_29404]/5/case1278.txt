royal maccabees life insurance company royal appeals from a judgment on a jury verdict in favor of stephen choren on a bad faith breach of insurance contract counterclaim.the jury awarded in damages.our jurisdiction arises under,and we affirm.
background 
prior to the incidents giving rise to this suit,choren engaged in the general practice of dentistry in colorado.beginning in,he experienced hand numbness and other symptoms that were diagnosed as consistent with nerve abnormalities.over time,these symptoms worsened.in february,choren lacerated his left index finger to the bone while removing packing materials from a chair,necessitating surgery to reattach a severed nerve.during subsequent examination,he was diagnosed as suffering from bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome,tremors,and neck and shoulder pain.although he attempted to return to his practice,by april choren reached the conclusion,after consultation with his physician,that he was no longer able to practice dentistry.
prior to the onset of his disability,choren purchased an own occupation disability income insurance policy from royal.he subsequently exercised an option in the contract to purchase additional coverage on four occasions between and.choren also purchased a business overhead policy from royal.royal policies provided that,if the insured could not perform the material and substantial duties of his profession,benefits would be payable over the insured lifetime.
choren submitted a claim under the policies for total disability in april,dating back to february.a neurologist subsequently certified choren as disabled from practicing dentistry because his condition prevented him from safely performing fine motor work in a patient mouth.in july,royal began making total disability payments of per month to choren.
in august,the colorado division of insurance forwarded to royal an anonymous letter written by choren office manager and dental assistant alleging that choren was engaged in insurance fraud.receipt of the letter prompted a covert investigation of choren claims that culminated in the filing of this diversity suit in june.during the course of its investigation,royal assembled evidence,including video surveillance of choren windsurfing in venezuela,that the insurer viewed as inconsistent with a claim of total disability.while engaging in this lengthy and expansive investigation,royal at no time informed choren that his claim was under investigation and continued to pay benefits under the policies.
in its complaint,royal alleged that choren had submitted a fraudulent insurance claim for total disability on the basis that he continued to practice dentistry after filing the claim and that he engaged in recreational activities that were inconsistent with his claim.choren counterclaimed for breach of contract,bad faith breach of contract,outrageous conduct,violation of the colorado consumer protection act ccpa,and institution of a vexatious action.the district court granted summary judgment to royal on choren outrageous conduct and breach of contract counterclaims.the case was later tried in january and submitted to the jury on royal fraud claim and choren bad faith and ccpa counterclaims.
through a series of special verdicts,the jury found that choren was totally disabled under the terms of the policies and had not sought to defraud royal.the jury further found that royal acted in bad faith in the investigation and handling of choren claim and awarded him in unspecified economic damages and in unspecified damages.the jury rejected choren ccpa claim,finding that royal did not engage in a deceptive trade practice.following the jury verdict,both parties filed several motions.the district court disposed of the motions in its order on motions of march,denying royal motion for a new trial on the issue of bad faith and dismissing choren counterclaim that the lawsuit was vexatious.the district court also denied choren motion to alter or amend the judgment to award him tort damages for the present value of future disability benefits.on march,the district court entered judgment on the jury verdicts and this appeal followed.
discussion 
on appeal,royal asserts that the district court erred in giving three bad faith jury instructions and committed plain error in failing to instruct the jury that a attorney fees were not compensable damages for bad faith breach of insurance contract,and b in the absence of other economic damages the jury could not award the insured damages for bad faith.choren argues on that the district court erred in treating the recovery of future benefits as a contract remedy rather than as a remedy for bad faith breach of insurance contract,and in excluding evidence on the ccpa claim of representations made at the time of sale of the insurance policies and by failing to instruct that claims handling could properly be considered as deceptive trade practices.we discuss each of these arguments in turn.
bad faith jury instructions

coverage investigation and notification of the insured of coverage issues 
this case was tried in january.under the then existing rule,n o party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless that party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict,stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.the current rule retains the dual requirements of objecting on the record with sufficient specificity.see.c.to preserve the objection,a party must proffer the same grounds raised on appeal,reed landstar ligon,cir quoting comcoa,nec,cir,with sufficient clarity to render the grounds obvious,plain,or unmistakable.comcoa,at quoting aspen highlands skiing aspen skiing,cir.absent a proper objection,a party argument is deemed waved.hardeman,at.
choren originally proffered instruction,which read 
proceeding with a coverage investigation covertly to gain advantage over an insured is improper.when the interests of the insurer and the insured conflict as a result of the discovery of coverage issues,the insurer may not covertly build a case against its insured,but should promptly take steps to see that the insured is made fully aware of and understands the problem.
app.vol.iv at.at the jury instruction conference,royal objected to this proposed instruction,stating it not colorado law.it does state colorado law.it should be given.app.vol.xi at.however,royal conceded during the ensuing colloquy that proceeding with a coverage investigation to gain advantage over an insured is improper and that the insurer has a duty to notify the insured once a problem is discovered by it as to coverage.app.vol.xi at.these two concessions provide the substantive basis for instruction as tendered by the court.while it is true that the court noted a continuing objection to giving instruction at all,app.vol.xi at,we believe royal has waived its legal argument,having conceded the validity of the duties encompassed by instruction.accordingly,we review royal challenge to instruction for plain error.hardeman,at.
to succeed on a plain error review,the challenging party must demonstrate an error that is plain,meaning clear or obvious under current law,and affecting substantial rights.id.if these elements are satisfied,we may exercise discretion to correct the error if it seriously affect s the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.quoting united states,cir.under this standard,we will not disturb a district court action absent exceptional circumstances.no such circumstances are demonstrated here.
royal challenge to instruction necessarily depends on the assertion that the colorado supreme court would not impose requirements on insurers to promptly notify insureds of coverage disputes and abstain from engaging in investigations to gain an advantage over the insured.both parties concede that the colorado supreme court has yet to pronounce such rules.aplt.opening br.at aplee.br.at.in a diversity suit,the content of substantive jury instructions is derived from controlling state law.elliot,at citing blanke alexander,cir.a federal court sitting in diversity must apply state law as propounded by the forum highest court.rancho lobo,devargas,cir.absent controlling precedent,the federal court must attempt to predict how the state highest court would resolve the issue schuchmann,cir.
while we realize that uncertainty inheres in every erie prediction made in federal court,we do not believe that the district court resolution of this issue arises to a clear or obvious error under current law,especially since royal specifically agreed that each sentence of the instruction was correct.royal has neither pointed us to,nor have we found,contradictory colorado law specifically barring the duties enunciated in instruction.under our limited review,we will not disturb the district court determination under these circumstances.the district court did not commit plain error in tendering instruction to the jury.
duties of ime physicians and presumption that injuries are not 
royal next argues that instructions and,while properly stating colorado law,prejudicially bolstered choren case because the jury did not have to decide the issues raised by the instructions.aplt.opening br.at.royal further argues that instruction conflicted with instructions,and,telling the jurors that they are the sole arbiters of witness credibility and of the weight of the testimony.aplt.opening br.at.instruction stated 
the physician who conducts an independent medical examination an ime does not owe the insured a duty of care to diagnose his condition correctly.
on the other hand,a treating physician owes a duty of care in diagnosing a patient condition and may be liable to the patient for an incorrect diagnosis.
app.vol.vi at.instruction stated the law presumes that injuries are not intentionally.app.vol.vi at.
as a preliminary matter,choren argues that royal failed to preserve the issues noted above for appeal.aple.br.at.having reviewed the record,we find that royal preserved the issues for appeal.choren misconstrues royal argument regarding the instructions,characterizing it as asserting that the instructions unduly dignified what should have been mere factual arguments.aple.br.at.in so doing,choren converts the argued effect of the instructions into royal principal grounds on appeal.royal clearly objected during the instruction conference on the grounds that the issues raised by the instructions were not properly before the jury,app.vol.xi at,and that instruction would lead to confusion in the jury,app.vol.xi at.these are precisely the issues before us.the language employed by royal was sufficiently clear to raise the issue before the district court and permit it to alter the instructions accordingly.see rogers rio arriba,cir.
returning to the principal argument before us,the jury in this case heard conflicting evidence concerning the existence and extent of choren disability,offered by both treating physicians and independent medical experts.it also heard evidence about royal suspicion that choren finger laceration was.the parties agree that the statements of law are correct.we think it was within the district court discretion to inform the jury of factors that might be considered in evaluating this evidence.contrary to royal argument,these instructions do not amount to an endorsement of choren theory of bad faith.they in no way contravene or diminish the court general instructions that the jurors are the sole arbiters of credibility and decide what weight to accord witness testimony.we find no reversible error.the instructions taken as a whole adequately instructed the jury.see hardeman,at.
damage instructions 
royal final argument is that the district court committed plain error in failing to instruct the jury that attorney fees could not be construed as economic damages under choren bad faith counterclaim and that damages could not be awarded in the absence of economic damages.aplt.opening br.at.royal concedes that it did not request such instructions,and therefore did not preserve the error below.aplt.opening br.at.
a court may consider a plain error in the instructions affecting substantial rights that has not been preserved.d.we have consistently noted that the plain error standard in civil cases is limited to errors that seriously affect the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.phillips hillcrest med,cir quoting polys airlines,cir.plain error review presents an extraordinary,nearly insurmountable burden.id.to mount a successful plain error challenge,a party must demonstrate an error,that is plain or obvious under existing law,and that affects substantial rights.beaudry corr.of,cir.finally,we view instructions as a whole to determine whether the jury might have been misled.id.we will uphold the verdict in the absence of substantial doubt that the jury was fairly guided.id.quoting united states wiktor,cir.
attorneys fees as economic damages 
royal first asserts that the district court failure to instruct the jury that attorneys fees could not be considered economic damages under colorado law constituted plain error.royal relies on bernhard farmers insurance exchange.in bernhard,the plaintiff brought a bad faith breach of insurance contract claim against her insurer for failing to settle a claim within her insurance limits.id.at.the colorado court of appeals had previously set aside the trial court award of attorneys fees in the action.id.at.in affirming the decision,the colorado supreme court propounded an unequivocal rule u nless specifically provided for in the insurance contract,attorney fees are not recoverable upon successful litigation of a bad faith breach of insurance contract claim.allstate ins.huizar.
royal contends that failing to give the instruction was highly prejudicial in that the only evidence choren presented concerning economic damage was personal testimony that he had paid his attorneys in excess of.aplt.opening br.at.the jury subsequently returned an award of in unspecified economic damages.choren counters that the jury heard evidence that he suffered economic loss from royal failure to make timely payment of business overhead expenses total payment on that policy was with a maximum of possible,app.vol.ix at and that he suffered further economic damage from the loss of use of policy benefits.aple.br.at.
royal admits that it did not object to the testimony about attorney fees at trial.aplt.opening br.at.nor did it request either a limiting instruction or an interrogatory,the latter as contemplated by federal rule of civil procedure b whereby issues of fact necessary to a decision could be recorded by the jury and compared to the verdict.on direct,royal claims investigator testified why royal decided to file this action against choren and in the process stated we decided that we could continue to make payment so as not to harm him so he had the funds to live,but we decided to present the matter to the court and let the court decide.app.vol.ix at.choren counsel asked choren whether he had been able to use the monthly benefits to live on.choren responded no because he had to pay over in attorney fees to defend.app.vol.x at.on cross examination,royal counsel pursued the matter,bringing out that part of those attorney fees were for counterclaims.app.vol.x at.
after examining royal role in inducing the testimony,and the presence of some evidence suggesting economic damages,we conclude that royal can not demo
