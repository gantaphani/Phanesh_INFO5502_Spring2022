title authorizes courts to award a reasonable attorney fee for prevailing parties in civil rights actions.half of respondents million fee request was based on their calculation of the lodestar,the number of hours the attorneys and their employees worked multiplied by the hourly rates prevailing in the community.the other half represented a fee enhancement for superior work and results,supported by affidavits claiming that the lodestar would be insufficient to induce lawyers of comparable skill and experience to litigate this case.awarding fees of about million,the district court found that the proposed hourly rates were fair and reasonable,but that some of the entries on counsel billing records were vague and that the hours claimed for many categories were excessive.the court therefore cut the lodestar to approximately million,but enhanced that award by,or an additional million.the eleventh circuit affirmed in reliance on its precedent.
the calculation of an attorney fee based on the lodestar may be increased due to superior performance,but only in extraordinary circumstances.
a the lodestar approach has achieved dominance in the federal courts.gisbrecht barnhart.although imperfect,it has several important virtues it produces an award that approximates the fee the prevailing attorney would have received for representing a paying client who was billed by the hour in a comparable case and it is readily administrable,see,burlington dague,and objective,hensley eckerhart,thereby cabining trial judges discretion,permitting meaningful judicial review,and producing reasonably predictable results.
b this court has established six important rules that lead to today decision.first,a reasonable fee is one that is sufficient to induce a capable attorney to undertake the representation of a meritorious civil rights case,see pennsylvania delaware valley citizens council for clean air,but that does not provide a form of economic relief to improve the financial lot of attorneys,ibid.second,there is a strong presumption that the lodestar method yields a sufficient fee.see,at.third,the court has never sustained an enhancement of a lodestar amount for performance,but has repeatedly said that an enhancement may be awarded in rare and exceptional circumstances,at.fourth,the lodestar includes most,if not all,of the relevant factors constituting a reasonable attorney fee.at.an enhancement may not be based on a factor that is subsumed in the lodestar calculation,such as the case novelty and complexity,see,blum stenson,or the quality of an attorney performance,delaware valley,supra,at.fifth,the burden of proving that an enhancement is necessary must be borne by the fee applicant,blum,at.sixth,an applicant seeking an enhancement must produce specific evidence supporting the award,at,to assure that the calculation is objective and capable of being reviewed on appeal.
c the court rejects any contention that a fee determined by the lodestar method may not be enhanced in any situation.the strong presumption that the lodestar is reasonable may be overcome in those rare circumstances in which the lodestar does not adequately account for a factor that may properly be considered in determining a reasonable fee.
d the court treats the quality of an attorney performance and the results obtained as one factor,since superior results are relevant only to the extent it can be shown that they stem from superior attorney performance and not another factor,such as inferior performance by opposing counsel.the circumstances in which superior attorney performance is not adequately taken into account in the lodestar calculation are rare and exceptional.enhancements should not be awarded without specific evidence that the lodestar fee would not have been adequate to attract competent counsel.blum,supra,at.first,an enhancement may be appropriate where the method used to determine the hourly rate does not adequately measure the attorney true market value,as demonstrated in part during the litigation.this may occur if the hourly rate formula takes into account only a single factor such as years since admission to the bar or perhaps only a few similar factors.in such a case,the trial judge should adjust the hourly rate in accordance with specific proof linking the attorney ability to a prevailing market rate.second,an enhancement may be appropriate if the attorney performance includes an extraordinary outlay of expenses and the litigation is exceptionally protracted.in such cases,the enhancement amount must be calculated using a method that is reasonable,objective,and capable of being reviewed on appeal,such as by applying a standard interest rate to the qualifying expense outlays.third,an enhancement may be appropriate where an attorney performance involves exceptional delay in the payment of fees.in such a case,the enhancement should be calculated by a method similar to that used for an exceptional delay in expense reimbursement.enhancements are not appropriate on the ground that departures from hourly billing are becoming more common.nor can they be based on a flawed analogy to the increasingly popular practice of paying attorneys a reduced hourly rate with a bonus for obtaining specified results.
the district court did not provide proper justification for the fee enhancement it awarded in this case.it commented that the enhancement was necessary to compensate counsel at the appropriate hourly rate,but the effect was to raise the top rate from to more than per hour,while nothing in the record shows that this is an appropriate figure for the relevant market.the court also emphasized that counsel had to make extraordinary outlays for expenses and wait for reimbursement,but did not calculate the amount of the enhancement attributable to this factor.similarly,the court noted that counsel did not receive fees on an ongoing basis during the case,but did not sufficiently link this to proof that the delay was outside the normal range expected by attorneys who rely on for fees.nor did the court calculate the cost to counsel of any extraordinary and unwarranted delay.and its reliance on the contingency of the outcome contravenes dague,supra,at.finally,insofar as the court relied on a comparison of counsel performance in this case with that of counsel in unnamed prior cases,it did not employ a methodology that permitted meaningful appellate review.while determining a reasonable attorney fee is within the trial judge sound discretion under,that discretion is not unlimited.the judge must provide a reasonably specific explanation for all aspects of a fee determination,including any enhancement.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit 
justice alito delivered the opinion of the court.
this case presents the question whether the calculation of an attorney fee,under federal statutes,based on the lodestar,the number of hours worked multiplied by the prevailing hourly rates,may be increased due to superior performance and results we have stated in previous cases that such an increase is permitted in extraordinary circumstances,and we reaffirm that rule.but as we have also said in prior cases,there is a strong presumption that the lodestar is sufficient factors subsumed in the lodestar calculation can not be used as a ground for increasing an award above the lodestar and a party seeking fees has the burden of identifying a factor that the lodestar does not adequately take into account and proving with specificity that an enhanced fee is justified.because the district court did not apply these standards,we reverse the decision below and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
respondents plaintiffs below are children in the georgia system and their next friends.they filed this class action on behalf of children in foster care and named as defendants the governor of georgia and various state officials petitioners in this case.claiming that deficiencies in the system in two counties near atlanta violated their federal and state constitutional and statutory rights,respondents sought injunctive and declaratory relief,as well as attorney fees and expenses.
the united states district court for the northern district of georgia eventually referred the case to mediation,where the parties entered into a consent decree,which the district court approved.the consent decree resolved all pending issues other than the fees that respondents attorneys were entitled to receive under 
respondents submitted a request for more than million in attorney fees.half of that amount was based on their calculation of the lodestar roughly hours multiplied by hourly rates of to for attorneys and to for.in support of their fee request,respondents submitted affidavits asserting that these rates were within the range of prevailing market rates for legal services in the relevant market.
the other half of the amount that respondents sought represented a fee enhancement for superior work and results.affidavits submitted in support of this request claimed that the lodestar amount would be generally insufficient to induce lawyers of comparable skill,judgment,professional representation and experience to litigate this case.see,app.petitioners objected to the fee request,contending that some of the proposed hourly rates were too high,that the hours claimed were excessive,and that the enhancement would duplicate factors that were reflected in the lodestar amount.
the district court awarded fees of approximately million.see supp,nd.the district court found that the hourly rates proposed by respondents were fair and reasonable,at,but that some of the entries on counsel billing records were vague and that the hours claimed for many of the billing categories were excessive.the court therefore cut the hours by and halved the hourly rate for travel hours.this resulted in a lodestar calculation of approximately million.
the court then enhanced this award by,concluding that the lodestar calculation did not take into account the fact that class counsel were required to advance case expenses of million over a period with no on going reimbursement,the fact that class counsel were not paid on an basis as the work was being performed,and the fact that class counsel ability to recover a fee and expense reimbursement were completely contingent on the outcome of the case.at.the court stated that respondents attorneys had exhibited a higher degree of skill,commitment,dedication,and professionalism than the court has seen displayed by the attorneys in any other case during its years on the bench.at.the court also commented that the results obtained were extraordinary and added that a fter years as a practicing attorney and federal judge,the court is unaware of any other case in which a plaintiff class has achieved such a favorable result on such a comprehensive scale.at.the enhancement resulted in an additional million fee award.
relying on prior circuit precedent,a panel of the eleventh circuit affirmed.the panel held that the district court had not abused its discretion by failing to make a larger reduction in the number of hours for which respondents attorneys sought reimbursement,but the panel commented that it would have cut the billable hours more if we were deciding the matter in the first instance and added that the hourly rates approved by the district court also appear ed to be on the generous side.at,and.on the question of the enhancement,however,the panel splintered,with each judge writing a separate opinion.
judge carnes concluded that binding eleventh circuit precedent required that the decision of the district court be affirmed,but he opined that the reasoning in our opinions suggested that no enhancement should be allowed in this case.he concluded that the quality of the attorneys performance was adequately accounted for either in determining the reasonable number of hours expended on the litigation or in setting the reasonable hourly rates.at quoting pennsylvania delaware valley citizens council for clean air,delaware valley i.he found that an enhancement could not be justified based on delay in the recovery of attorney fees and reimbursable expenses because such delay is a routine feature of cases brought under.and he reasoned that the district court had contravened our holding in burlington dague,when it relied on the fact that class counsel compensation was totally contingent upon prevailing in this action.at,quoting affidavit in support of fee request.
judge wilson concurred in the judgment but disagreed with judge carnes view that eleventh circuit precedent is inconsistent with our decisions.judge hill also concurred in the judgment but expressed no view about the correctness of the prior circuit precedent.
the eleventh circuit denied rehearing en banc over the dissent of three judges.see.judge wilson filed an opinion concurring in the denial of rehearing judge carnes,joined by judges tjoflat and dubina,filed an opinion dissenting from the denial of rehearing and judge tjoflat filed a separate dissent,contending,among other things,that the district court,by basing the enhancement in large part on a comparison of the performance of respondents attorneys with all of the unnamed attorneys whose work he had observed during his professional career,had improperly rendered a decision that was effectively unreviewable on appeal and had essentially served as a witness in support of the enhancement,at.
we granted certiorari.
the general rule in our legal system is that each party must pay its own attorney fees and expenses,see hensley eckerhart,but congress enacted in order to ensure that federal rights are adequately enforced.section provides that a prevailing party in certain civil rights actions may recover a reasonable attorney fee as part of the costs.unfortunately,the statute does not explain what congress meant by a reasonable fee,and therefore the task of identifying an appropriate methodology for determining a reasonable fee was left for the courts.
one possible method was set out in johnson georgia highway express,which listed factors that a court should consider in determining a reasonable fee this method,however,gave very little actual guidance to district courts.setting attorney fees by reference to a series of sometimes subjective factors placed unlimited discretion in trial judges and produced disparate results.delaware valley i,supra,at.
an alternative,the lodestar approach,was pioneered by the third circuit in lindy.builders,of philadelphia american radiator standard sanitary,appeal after remand,and achieved dominance in the federal courts after our decision in hensley.gisbrecht barnhart.since that time,t he lodestar figure has,as its name suggests,become the guiding light of our jurisprudence.ibid.quoting dague,supra,at.
although the lodestar method is not perfect,it has several important virtues.first,in accordance with our understanding of the aim of statutes,the lodestar looks to the prevailing market rates in the relevant community.blum stenson.developed after the practice of hourly billing had become widespread,see gisbrecht,supra,at,the lodestar method produces an award that roughly approximates the fee that the prevailing attorney would have received if he or she had been representing a paying client who was billed by the hour in a comparable case.second,the lodestar method is readily administrable,see dague,at see also buckhannon board care home,west virginia of health and human resources,and unlike the johnson approach,the lodestar calculation is objective,hensley,supra,at,and thus cabins the discretion of trial judges,permits meaningful judicial review,and produces reasonably predictable results.
our prior decisions concerning the federal statutes have established six important rules that lead to our decision in this case.
first,a reasonable fee is a fee that is sufficient to induce a capable attorney to undertake the representation of a meritorious civil rights case.see delaware valley i,at i f plaintiffs find it possible to engage a lawyer based on the statutory assurance that he will be paid a reasonable fee,the purpose behind the statute has been satisfied blum,supra,at a reasonable attorney fee is one that is adequate to attract competent counsel,but that does not produce windfalls to attorneys ellipsis,brackets,and internal quotation marks omitted.section aim is to enforce the covered civil rights statutes,not to provide a form of economic relief to improve the financial lot of attorneys.delaware valley i,supra,at.
second,the lodestar method yields a fee that is presumptively sufficient to achieve this objective.see dague,supra,at delaware valley i,supra,at blum,supra,at see also gisbrecht,supra,at.indeed,we have said that the presumption is a strong one.dague,supra,at delaware valley i,supra,at.
third,although we have never sustained an enhancement of a lodestar amount for performance,see brief for united states as amicus curiae,we have repeatedly said that enhancements may be awarded in rare and exceptional circumstances.delaware valley i,supra,at blum,supra,at hensley,at.
fourth,we have noted that the lodestar figure includes most,if not all,of the relevant factors constituting a reasonable attorney fee,delaware valley i,supra,at,and have held that an enhancement may not be awarded based on a factor that is subsumed in the lodestar calculation,see dague,supra,at pennsylvania delaware valley citizens council for clean air,delaware valley ii plurality opinion blum,at.we have thus held that the novelty and complexity of a case generally may not be used as a ground for an enhancement because these factors presumably are fully reflected in the number of billable hours recorded by counsel.ibid.we have also held that the quality of an attorney performance generally should not be used to adjust the lodestar b ecause considerations concerning the quality of a prevailing party counsel representation normally are reflected in the reasonable hourly rate.delaware valley i,supra,at.
fifth,the burden of proving that an enhancement is necessary must be borne by the fee applicant.dague,supra,at blum,at.
finally,a fee applicant seeking an enhancement must produce specific evidence that supports the award,at,an enhancement must be based on evidence that enhancement was necessary to provide fair and reasonable compensation this requirement is essential if the lodestar method is to realize one of its chief virtues,providing a calculation that is objective and capable of being reviewed on appeal.
in light of what we have said in prior cases,we reject any contention that a fee determined by the lodestar method may not be enhanced in any situation.the lodestar method was never intended to be conclusive in all circumstances.instead,there is a strong presumption that the lodestar figure is reasonable,but that presumption may be overcome in those rare circumstances in which the lodestar does not adequately take into account a factor that may properly be considered in determining a reasonable fee.
in this case,we are asked to decide whether either the quality of an attorney performance or the results obtained are factors that may properly provide a basis for an enhancement.we treat these two factors as one.when a plaintiff attorney achieves results that are more favorable than would have been predicted based on the governing law and the available evidence,the outcome may be attributable to superior performance and commitment of resources by plaintiff counsel.or the outcome may result from inferior performance by defense counsel,unanticipated defense concessions,unexpectedly favorable rulings by the court,an unexpectedly sympathetic jury,or simple luck.since none of these latter causes can justify an enhanced award,superior results are relevant only to the extent it can be shown that they are the result of superior attorney performance.thus,we need only consider whether superior attorney performance can justify an enhancement.and in light of the principles derived from our prior cases,we inquire whether there are circumstances in which superior attorney performance is not adequately taken into account in the lodestar calculation.we conclude that there are a few such circumstances but that these circumstances are indeed rare and exceptional,and require specific evidence that the lodestar fee would not have been adequate to attract competent counsel,blum,supra,at internal quotation marks omitted.
first,an enhancement may be appropriate where the method used in determining the hourly rate employed in the lodestar calculation does not adequately measure the attorney true market value,as demonstrated in part during the litigation this may occur if the hourly rate is determined by a formula that takes into account only a single factor such as years since admission to the bar or perhaps only a few similar factors.in such a case,an enhancement may be appropriate so that an attorney is compensated at the rate that the attorney would receive in cases not governed by the federal statutes.but in order to provide a calculation that is objective and reviewable,the trial judge should adjust the attorney hourly rate in accordance with specific proof linking the attorney ability to a prevailing market rate.
second,an enhancement may be appropriate if the attorney performance includes an extraordinary outlay of expenses and the litigation is exceptionally protracted.as judge carnes noted below,when an attorney agrees to represent a civil rights plaintiff who can not afford to pay the attorney,the attorney presumably understands that no reimbursement is likely to be received until the successful resolution of the case,at,and therefore enhancements to compensate for delay in reimbursement for expenses must be reserved for unusual cases.in such exceptional cases,however,an enhancement may be allowed,but the amount of the enhancement must be calculated using a method that is reasonable,objective,and capable of being reviewed on appeal,such as by applying a standard rate of interest to the qualifying outlays of expenses.
third,there may be extraordinary circumstances in which an attorney performance involves exceptional delay in the payment of fees.an attorney who expects to be compensated under presumably understands that payment of fees will generally not come until the end of the case,if at all.see,at opinion of carnes.compensation for this delay is generally made either by basing the award on current rates or by adjusting the fee based on historical rates to reflect its present value.missouri jenkins,internal quotation marks omitted.but we do not rule out the possibility that an enhancement may be appropriate where an attorney assumes these costs in the face of unanticipated delay,particularly where the delay is unjustifiably caused by the defense.in such a case,however,the enhancement should be calculated by applying a method similar to that described above in connection with exceptional delay in obtaining reimbursement for expenses.
we reject the suggestion that it is appropriate to grant performance enhancements on the ground that departures from hourly billing are becoming more common.as we have noted,the lodestar was adopted in part because it provides a rough approximation of general billing practices,and accordingly,if hourly billing becomes unusual,an alternative to the lodestar method may have to be found.however,neither respondents nor their amici contend that that day has arrived.nor have they shown that permitting the award of enhancements on top of the lodestar figure corresponds to prevailing practice in the general run of cases.
we are told that,under an increasingly popular arrangement,attorneys are paid at a reduced hourly rate but receive a bonus if certain specified results are obtained,and this practice is analogized to the award of an enhancement such as the one in this case.brief for respondents.the analogy,however,is flawed.an attorney who agrees,at the outset of the representation,to a reduced hourly rate in exchange for the opportunity to earn a performance bonus is in a position far different from an attorney in a case who is compensated at the full prevailing rate and then seeks a performance enhancement in addition to the lodestar amount after the litigation has concluded.reliance on these comparisons for the purposes of administering enhancements,therefore,is not appropriate.
in the present case,the district court did not provide proper justification for the large enhancement that it awarded.the court increased the lodestar award by but,as far as the court opinion reveals,this figure appears to have been essentially arbitrary.why,for example,did the court grant a enhancement instead of the increase that respondents sought and why rather than or or 
the district court commented that the enhancement was the minimum enhancement of the lodestar necessary to reasonably compensate respondents counsel.supp,at.but the effect of the enhancement was to increase the top rate for the attorneys to more than per hour and the district court did not point to anything in the record that shows that this is an appropriate figure for the relevant market.
the district court pointed to the fact that respondents counsel had to make extraordinary outlays for expenses and had to wait for reimbursement,at,but the court did not calculate the amount of the enhancement that is attributable to this factor.similarly,the district court noted that respondents counsel did not receive fees on an ongoing basis while the case was pending,but the court did not sufficiently link this factor to proof in the record that the delay here was outside the normal range expected by attorneys who rely on for the payment of their fees or quantify the disparity.nor did the court provide a calculation of the cost to counsel of any extraordinary and unwarranted delay.and the court reliance on the contingency of the outcome contravenes our holding in dague.see,at.
finally,insofar as the district court relied on a comparison of the performance of counsel in this case with the performance of counsel in unnamed prior cases,the district court did not employ a methodology that permitted meaningful appellate review.needless to say,we do not question the sincerity of the district court observations,and we are in no position to assess their accuracy.but when a trial judge awards an enhancement on an impressionistic basis,a major purpose of the lodestar method providing an objective and reviewable basis for fees,see,at is undermined.
determining a reasonable attorney fee is a matter that is committed to the sound discretion of a trial judge,see permitting court,in its discretion,to award fees,but the judge discretion is not unlimited.it is essential that the judge provide a reasonably specific explanation for all aspects of a fee determination,including any award of an enhancement.unless such an explanation is given,adequate appellate review is not feasible,and without such review,widely disparate awards may be made,and awards may be influenced or at least,may appear to be influenced by a judge subjective opinion regarding particular attorneys or the importance of the case.in addition,in future cases,defendants contemplating the possibility of settlement will have no way to estimate the likelihood of having to pay a potentially huge enhancement.see marek chesny,m any a defendant would be unwilling to make a binding settlement offer on terms that left it exposed to liability for attorney fees in whatever amount the court might fix on motion of the plaintiff 
section serves an important public purpose by making it possible for persons without means to bring suit to vindicate their rights.but unjustified enhancements that serve only to enrich attorneys are not consistent with the statute aim in many cases,attorney fees awarded under are not paid by the individuals responsible for the constitutional or statutory violations on which the judgment is based.instead,the fees are paid in effect by state and local taxpayers,and because state and local governments have limited budgets,money that is used to pay attorney fees is money that can not be used for programs that provide vital public services.horne flores,slip,at,payment of money pursuant to a order diverts funds from other state or local programs.
for all these reasons,the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed,and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

if one were to ask an attorney or a judge to name the significant cases of his or her career,it would be unsurprising to find the list includes a case then being argued or just decided.when immersed in a case,lawyers and judges find within it a fascination,an intricacy,an importance that transcends what the detached observer sees.so the pending or just completed case will often seem extraordinary to its participants.that is the dynamic of the adversary system,the system that so well serves the law.
it is proper for the court today to reject the proposition that all enhancements are barred still,it must be understood that extraordinary cases are presented only in the rarest circumstances.

nearly years ago,a group of attorneys sought a fee award under after achiev ing only limited success litigating their clients constitutional claims.hensley eckerhart.this court opinion resolving their claim for fees observed that in some cases of exceptional success an enhanced award of attorney fees under may be justified.at emphasis added.that observation plainly was dicta,but one year later this court relied on it to reject the argument that an upward adjustment to the lodestar calculation is never permissible.blum stenson.yet we have never sustained an enhancement of a lodestar amount for performance,ante,at,and our jurisprudence since blum has charted a decisional arc that bends decidedly against enhancements,carnes.see also ante,at.
today the court holds,consistent with hensley and blum,that a lodestar fee award under may be enhanced for attorney performance in a few circumstances that are indeed rare and exceptional.ante,at.but careful readers will observe the precise limitations that the court imposes on the availability of such enhancements.see ante,at see also ante,at kennedy,concurring i t must be understood that extraordinary cases are presented only in the rarest circumstances these limitations preserve our prior cases and advance our attorney fees jurisprudence further along the decisional arc that judge carnes described.i agree with the court approach and its conclusion because,as the court emphasizes,see ante,at,the lodestar calculation will in virtually every case already reflect all indicia of attorney performance relevant to a fee award.

justice breyer,with whom justice stevens,justice ginsburg,and justice sotomayor join,concurring in part and dissenting in part.
we granted certiorari in this case to consider whether the calculation of an attorney fee that is based on the lodestar,ante,at opinion of the court,can ever be enhanced based solely on the quality of the lawyers performance and the results obtained,pet.for cert.i emphasis added.the court answers that question in the affirmative.see ante,at we have stated in previous cases that such an increase is permitted in extraordinary circumstances,and we reaffirm that rule see also ante,kennedy,concurring.as our prior precedents make clear,the lodestar calculation does not end the fee inquiry because there remain other considerations that may lead the district court to adjust the fee upward.hensley eckerhart.for that reason,t he lodestar method was never intended to be conclusive in all circumstances.ante,at.instead,as the court today reaffirms,when superior attorney performance,leads to exceptional success an enhanced award may be justified,hensley supra,at see also pennsylvania delaware valley citizens council for clean air,blum stenson.i agree with that conclusion.
where the majority and i part ways is with respect to a question that is not presented,but that the court obliquely,and in my view inappropriately,appears to consider nonetheless namely,whether the lower courts correctly determined in this case that exceptional circumstances justify a lodestar enhancement.see parts,ante see also ante,kennedy,concurring.i would not reach that issue,which lies beyond the narrow question that we agreed to consider.see limiting review to the first question presented pet.for cert.i stating question see also glover united states,as a general rule we do not decide issues outside the questions presented nor do i believe that this court,which is twice removed from the litigation underlying the fee determination,is properly suited to resolve the inquiry that demands.but even were i to engage in that inquiry,i would hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding an enhancement.and i would therefore affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.
as the court explains,the basic question that must be resolved when considering an enhancement to the lodestar is whether the lodestar calculation adequately measure s an attorney value,as demonstrated by his performance during the litigation.ante,at.while i understand the need for answering that question through the application of standards,i also believe that the answer inevitably involves an element of judgment.moreover,when reviewing a district court answer to that question,an appellate court must inevitably give weight to the fact that a district court is better situated to provide that answer.for it is the district judge,and only the district judge,who will have read all of the motions filed in the case,witnessed the proceedings,and been able to evaluate the attorneys overall performance in light of the objectives,context,legal difficulty,and practical obstacles present in the case.in a word,the district judge will have observed the attorney true value,as demonstrated during the litigation.ibid.emphasis added.by contrast,a court of appeals,faced with a cold and perhaps lengthy record,will inevitably have less time and opportunity to determine whether the lawyers have done an exceptionally fine job.and this court is yet less suited to performing that inquiry.accordingly,determining whether a fee enhancement is warranted in a given case is a matter that is committed to the sound discretion of a trial judge,ante,at,and the function of appellate courts is to review that judge determination for an abuse of such discretion.see pierce underwood,see also general joiner,d eference is the hallmark of review 
this case well illustrates why our tiered and functionally specialized judicial system places the task of determining an attorney fee award primarily in the district court hands.the plaintiffs lawyers spent eight years investigating the underlying facts,developing the initial complaint,conducting court proceedings,and working out final relief.the district court docket,with over entries,consists of more than pages.transcripts of hearings and depositions,along with other documents,have produced a record that fills large boxes.neither we,nor an appellate panel,can easily read that entire record.nor should we attempt to a district judge who is aware of the many intangible matters that the written page can not reflect.
my own review of this expansive record can not possibly be exhaustive.but those portions of the record i have reviewed lead me to conclude,like the court of appeals,that the district judge did not abuse his discretion when awarding an enhanced fee.i reach this conclusion based on four considerations.
first,the record indicates that the lawyers objective in this case was unusually important and fully consistent with the central objectives of the basic federal statute.moreover,the problem the attorneys faced demanded an exceptionally high degree of skill and effort.specifically,these lawyers and their clients sought to have the state of georgia reform its entire system a system that much in the record describes as well below the level of minimal constitutional acceptability.the record contains investigative reports,mostly prepared by georgia own office of the child advocate,which show,for example,the following 
the state system was unable to provide essential medical and mental health services children consequently and unnecessarily suffered illness and life long medical disabilities,such as permanent hearing loss,due to failures on the part of the state to administer basic care and antibiotics.see,doc,exh.
understaffing and improper staffing placed children in the care of individuals with dangerous criminal records children were physically assaulted by the staff,locked outside of the shelters at night as punishment,and abused in other ways.see,doc,doc,exh,doc,exh,doc,exh.
the shelters themselves were unsanitary and dilapidated,unclean,infested with rats,overcrowded,unsafe,and out of control.see,doc,exh,at doc,exh,doc,at.
due to improper supervision and other deficiencies at the shelters,of the children abused drugs some also became victims of child prostitution.see,at doc,exh,at.
systemic failures also caused vulnerable children to suffer regular beatings and sexual abuse,including rape,at the hands of more aggressive shelter residents.see,doc,at,doc,exh,at,doc,exh,at a child was beaten so badly by eight other children that he suffered severe internal bleeding at describing violent sexual assault and rape.
not surprisingly,many children upwards of per day and over per year tried to escape these conditions others tried to commit suicide.see,doc,at,doc,exh,under seal at least of children run away from shelters doc,exh,under seal daily logs see also doc,exh,at,describing suicide attempts all docket entries above and hereinafter refer to nd case below.
the state office of the child advocate,whose reports provide much of the basis for the foregoing description,concluded that the system was operating in crisis mode and that any private operator who ran such a system would never be licensed to care for children.office of the child advocate for the protection of children ann,record,doc,exh.hereinafter oca report accord,exh,at.the advocate noted that neither her investigative reports nor national news publicity including a television program that highlighted a foster child death from beatings had prompted corrective action by the state.oca report.
the advocate further stated that litigation was necessary to force reform,at.and she repeatedly asked the state to give her office the authority to conduct that litigation.see office of the child advocate advisory committee,ann.effectiveness,online at all internet materials as visited,and available in clerk of court case file f or the office to be truly effective,it must possess the authority to compel change and to initiate litigation on behalf of children.such authority is widely considered by other states child advocates as crucial to effecting meaningful change for children office of the child advocate advisory committee,ann.effectiveness same,online at.doc office of the child advocate advisory committee,ann.effectiveness same,online at.but the state did not grant the child advocate office the litigating authority she sought.see.laws,as codified.code ann.
the upshot is that the plaintiffs attorneys did what the child advocate could not do they initiated this lawsuit.they thereby assumed the role of a private attorney general by filling an enforcement void in the state own legal system,a function that congress considered of the highest priority,newman piggie park enterprises,per curiam,and meant to promote in enacting,texas state teachers garland independent school.
second,the course of the lawsuit was lengthy and arduous.the plaintiffs and their lawyers began with factual investigati
