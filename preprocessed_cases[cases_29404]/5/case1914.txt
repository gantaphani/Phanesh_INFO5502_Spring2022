the principal issue in this case is simple and a motion for attorney fees and costs by the prevailing plaintiff on a special motion to strike under code of civil procedure section,subdivision c was timely filed under california rules of court,rules and resolution of this issue,however,proved to be neither simple nor straightforward.
rule imposes time limits for filing a motion for prejudgment statutory attorney fees in civil cases.ambiguity in the language of the rule makes it uncertain whether those time limits commence to run upon entry of a prejudgment appealable order,such as the one at issue here,or upon entry of final judgment in the litigation.we interpret rule so that the time limits imposed by the rule commence to run upon entry of judgment at the conclusion of a lawsuit.those time limits do not commence to run upon entry of a prejudgment appealable order,such as an order granting or denying a special motion to strike under section.plaintiff motion for attorney fees in this case was filed before entry of final judgment and was timely under rule.
background 
plaintiff and respondent tyrone carpenter plaintiff sued defendant and appellant jack in the box corporation jack in the box and defendant and appellant angelle chapman chapman jack in the box and chapman are collectively referred to as defendants after plaintiff employment with jack in the box was terminated in june.plaintiff complaint alleged causes of action against jack in the box for wrongful termination,employment discrimination,breach of contract,and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing against chapman for interference with contract and against both defendants for defamation and intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress.
defendants filed a special motion to strike pursuant to section,claiming that all of plaintiff causes of action alleged injury arising from protected first amendment activities,namely,jack in the box investigation of allegations that plaintiff had sexually harassed chapman,a fellow employee.plaintiff opposed the special motion to strike,and after hearing argument from the parties on september,the trial court denied the motion.the trial court denial of the special motion to strike was entered in the court permanent minutes on september.on september,plaintiff served on defendant a document captioned notice of ruling on defendant special motion to strike portions of the complaint.

contentions and conclusions 
defendants appeal from the trial court order awarding plaintiff attorney fees and costs pursuant to section,subdivision c.they contend the order must be reversed because plaintiff motion for attorney fees and costs was untimely under rules and the trial court lacked jurisdiction to determine plaintiff entitlement to attorney fees and to award him attorney fees on appeal the trial court erred by concluding that the special motion to strike and appeal of the order denying that motion were frivolous and the trial court failed to state with particularity its reasons for awarding attorney fees and costs.plaintiff asks that we find defendants appeal to be frivolous,and that we award him his attorney fees in responding to this appeal.
we affirm the trial court order.plaintiff motion for attorney fees and costs was timely under rule.the trial court had jurisdiction to consider plaintiff request for attorney fees,did not abuse its discretion by finding that defendants special motion to strike and appeal of the order denying that motion were frivolous,and stated with sufficient particularity its reasons for awarding plaintiff attorney fees and costs.we deny plaintiff request for attorney fees on appeal.
discussion 
standard of review 
although a trial court ruling on the propriety of an attorney fees award is generally reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard,the determination of whether the trial court had the statutory authority to make such an award is a question of law that we review de novo.duale usa,llc th,d.
jurisdiction 
defendants argue that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to determine plaintiff entitlement to attorney fees because plaintiff did not seek an attorney fee award in this court when defendants appealed the order denying the special motion to strike,and because our remittitur affirming the trial court order did not direct the trial court to determine plaintiff entitlement to attorney fees.
section,subdivision c,authorizes a trial court to award costs and reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing plaintiff in an unsuccessful special motion to strike i f the court finds that a special motion to strike is frivolous or is solely intended to cause unnecessary delay.such an award is made pursuant to section,which states in relevant part every trial court may order a party,the party attorney,or both to pay any reasonable expenses,including attorney fees,incurred by another party as a result of actions or tactics that are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay.actions or tactics include,but are not limited to,the making or opposing of motions frivolous means a totally and completely without merit or b for the sole purpose of harassing an opposing party,subds.a,b,subd.c.the trial court had both authority and jurisdiction under section,subdivision c,to determine plaintiff entitlement to attorney fees in opposing the special motion to strike.
plaintiff decision to seek his attorney fees in a separate noticed motion rather than as part of his opposition to defendants special motion to strike did not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction to consider the issue.the party prevailing on a special motion to strike may seek an attorney fee award through three different avenues simultaneously with litigating the special motion to strike by a subsequent noticed motion,as was the case here or as part of a cost memorandum.american humane los angeles times communications th,d american humane,subd.c a c wegner,et,cal.practice guide civil trials and evidence the rutter group.
defendants appeal of the order denying the special motion to strike did not divest the trial court of jurisdiction to consider plaintiff motion for attorney fees and costs.even if the order granting the special motion to strike has been appealed,the trial court retains jurisdiction to entertain a motion for attorney fees.doe luster th,d.
the absence of direction from this court concerning plaintiff entitlement to attorney fees on appeal in our remittitur affirming the order denying the special motion to strike did not preclude the trial court from awarding plaintiff his attorney fees incurred in responding to defendants prior appeal.the trial court authority to award fees and costs under section,subdivision c,includes authority to award fees incurred in responding to an appeal of an order granting or denying a special motion to strike,or of an order awarding attorney fees in connection with such motion.see wilkerson sullivan th,d.a statute authorizing an attorney fee award at the trial court level includes appellate attorney fees unless the statute specifically provides otherwise.citations.evans unkow th,d.section,subdivision c,does not preclude recovery of appellate attorney fees hence attorney fees recoverable under the statute include appellate fees.see also dove audio,rosenfeld,meyer susman th,d.
hampton superior court cal d,and hanna city of los angeles d,overruled on another ground by pasadena police officers city of pasadena cal d,on which defendants rely in support of their jurisdictional argument,are inapposite.neither of those cases addressed a trial court jurisdiction to award attorney fees to a prevailing plaintiff under section,subdivision c.
timeliness of plaintiff motion 
defendants contend that plaintiff motion for attorney fees was not timely filed under california rules of court,rules and.our determination of this issue requires us to interpret and apply those rules.t he interpretation of a rule of court is governed by the same precepts that apply to statutory interpretation.kahn lasorda dugout,th,d.our objective is to determine the drafter intent using the words of the rule as our starting point.citation.if the language of the rule is clear and unambiguous,it is unnecessary to probe the rule drafting history in order to ascertain its meaning.citation.if possible,we attribute significance to every word,phrase,sentence and part of a court rule.citation.we accord a challenged rule a reasonable and commonsense interpretation consistent with its apparent purpose,practical rather than technical in nature,which upon application will result in wise policy rather than mischief or absurdity.citation.crespin shewry th,d crespin.
rule governs claims for statutory attorney fees in civil cases.it provides in relevant part except as otherwise provided by statute,this rule applies in civil cases to claims for statutory attorney fees.rule a.rule imposes time limits for filing a motion to claim statutory attorney fees,by the time limits prescribed by rules and for filing a notice of appeal a notice of motion to claim attorney fees for services up to and including the rendition of judgment in the trial attorney fees on an appeal before the rendition of judgment in the trial be served and filed within the time for filing a notice of appeal under rules and.rule b.
rule a imposes the following time limits for filing a notice of appeal unless a statute or rule provides otherwise,a notice of appeal must be filed on or before the earliest of days after the superior court clerk mails the party filing the notice of appeal a document entitled notice of entry of judgment or a copy of the judgment,showing the date either was mailed days after the party filing the notice of appeal serves or is served by a party with a document entitled notice of entry of judgment or a copy of the judgment,accompanied by a proof of service or days after entry of judgment.rule makes these same time limits applicable to an appeal from an appealable order.subsection f of the rule states that the term judgment,as used in subdivision a,includes an appealable order if the appeal is from an appealable order.subsection d of rule defines what constitutes the entry date of a judgment or appealable order.subsection d provides that t he entry date of a judgment is the date the judgment is filed under code of civil procedure section,or the date it is entered in the judgment book.for an appealable order,subsection d and of the rule provide the entry date of an appealable order that is entered in the minutes is the date it is entered in the permanent minutes.but if the minute order directs that a written order be prepared,the entry date is the date the signed order is filed a written order prepared under rule or similar local rule is not such an order prepared by direction of a minute order.the entry date of an appealable order that is not entered in the minutes is the date the signed order is filed.
the trial court order denying defendants special motion to strike was an appealable order,subd.i,entered in the court permanent minutes on september.plaintiff filed his motion for attorney fees more than two years october.plaintiff maintains that he could not bring his attorney fee motion sooner because defendants appeal of the trial court order denying the special motion to strike stayed further proceedings in the trial court pursuant to section,subdivision a the perfecting of defendants appeal,however,did not automatically stay proceedings in the trial court to award fees and costs under section,subdivision c.see dowling zimmerman th,d.defendants argue that plaintiff motion was untimely because rules and require plaintiff motion to have been filed within days after september.there is some support for this argument in the language of the two rules.subsection a of rule states that a notice of motion to claim attorney fees for services up to and including the rendition of judgment in the trial court must be served and filed within the time for filing a notice of appeal under rules and.subsections a,d and f of rule require a notice of appeal from an appealable order to be filed within days after entry in the court permanent minutes 
a closer inspection of rules and,however,reveals a discrepancy between the language of the two rules that makes their application to plaintiff motion uncertain.rule b prescribes time limits for filing a notice of motion to claim attorney fees for services up to and including the rendition of judgment in the trial court.italics added.the term rendition of judgment has a particular meaning.in the context of a court trial,it means the signing and filing of the court findings,conclusions,and final judgment in a case.see ehrler ehrler d.witkin,cal.procedure ed.attack on judgment.the language preceding the term rendition of judgment,as used in rule,is worded in the conjunctive,encompassing claims for attorney fees for services up to and including the rendition of judgment.rule b,italics bold added.the language of the rule thus applies only to a motion to recover all prejudgment attorney fees incurred in an action,and contemplates the filing of such a motion at the conclusion of the lawsuit.
a motion for attorney fees incurred in connection with a prejudgment appealable order,such as an order granting or denying a special motion to strike,is a claim for services rendered before the rendition of judgment.it is not a claim for services up to and including the rendition of judgment,and therefore does not fit within the plain language of rule.
the term appealable order does not appear in rule.the issue concerning the rule applicability to appealable orders arises because subsection b of rule refers to other and define the term judgment to include appealable orders under certain circumstances.the reference in rule b to rules and gives rise to an ambiguity in the meaning and application of rule that requires us to consider the rule drafting history,as well as its purpose and intent.
the first district court of appeal,in crespin,supra,th,d,considered the relationship between former rule now rule and former rules and now rules and in determining whether the time limits imposed by those rules apply to a postjudgment motion to obtain statutory attorney fees incurred in modifying a permanent injunction.the court in crespin considered the language of rule,as well as the drafting history and policy behind the rule,and concluded that it made little sense to apply the time limits prescribed by rule to motions for statutory fees incurred in connection with either prejudgment or postjudgment orders.crespin,at,d.
the crespin court noted that the reference in rule to rules and does not incorporate the special definitions of judgment used in rules and.as noted,former rules and define judgment to include appealable orders in certain circumstances.the court in crespin observed that rule b by its express terms,merely borrows the time limits for filing a notice of appeal set forth in rules and.crespin,supra,th at,d.the court stated that the special definitions of judgment are specific to the subject matter of rules and setting a readily determinable time limit for filing a notice of appeal.it makes perfect sense in that context to have a single time limit applicable to both judgments and appealable orders.in fact rule f states expressly that its definition of judgment to include an appealable order only applies if the appeal is from an appealable order rather than a judgment.rule addresses an entirely different subject setting a time limit for seeking attorney fees.for that purpose,there is no obvious reason to impose the same time limit for bringing fee motions after entry of appealable orders and judgments.if anything such an equation would promote piecemeal litigation over fees,which the drafters of rule wanted to avoid.ibid.
the court in crespin further noted,an intent to borrow rule special definition of judgment is therefore anything but clear or unambiguous in the text of rule w e have also examined the rule drafting history for evidence of such an intent we have found no sign in the drafting history of rule that the effect of incorporating or not incorporating that specific definition into the rule by reference was ever considered or discussed.crespin,supra,th at,d.
the court in crespin went on to state that interpreting rule to apply to fee motions for services rendered in connection with a prejudgment appealable order is not practical or consistent with wise policy crespin,supra,th at,d,particularly in the context of public interest litigation.reasonably construed,subdivision b of rule,former rule permits a public interest litigant to file a single fee motion covering all services rendered in litigating the case to a judgment in the trial court.it does so by setting a time limit for bringing a fee motion for services up to and including the rendition of judgment in the trial court.citation.an interpretation that focuses narrowly on the word judgment and entirely ignores the italicized words that immediately precede it leads to an absurdity.each time an appealable order was entered,the public interest plaintiff would be compelled to promptly apply for fees for all services up to and including the rendition of the appealable order.such a reading would compel premature and piecemeal litigation over fees.crespin,at,d.the court in crespin thus concluded that applying former rule to motions for statutory fees incurred in connection with prejudgment appealable orders does not seem sensible,practical,or consistent with either the language of the rule or the dictates of wise policy.ibid.
we agree with the court in crespin that interpreting rule to require litigants to apply for attorney fees incurred in connection with a prejudgment appealable order within or days after entry of the order would be inconsistent with the language of the rule and its underlying policy the history of rule supports this conclusion a concise summary of the rule history may be found in sanabria embrey th,d sanabria in that case,division five of this court recounted the history of rule as follows in,the supreme court asked the administrative office of the courts to review the timing of claims for attorney fees under code of civil procedure section private attorney general fees.the supreme court was concerned that case law arguably permitted claims for such fees to be pursued at any time.a time limit appeared desirable.jud.council of,admin.off.of,on time to claim attorney fees rule.rather than address only attorney fees under code of civil procedure section,an amendment to california rules of court,rule was proposed that would address the procedure for all claims for attorney fees under statute or contract.jud.council of,admin.off.of cts.request for comment specifying time to claim attorney fees by rule.sanabria,supra,at,d.
the judicial council request for comments indicates the drafters intent to set an outer time limit after judgment within which statutory attorney fee claims could be made.in that document,the judicial council states that the proposed amendments would eliminate any possible implication that an attorney fee claim could be presented in an unlimited time after entry of judgment or issuance of a remittitur on appeal.jud.council of,admin.off.of cts.request for comment specifying time to claim attorney fees by rule,italics added.as initially proposed,the draft rule provided that a notice of motion to claim prejudgment attorney fees shall be served and filed before or at the same time the memorandum of costs is served and filed.ibid.under the rules in effect at the time,a prevailing party who claimed costs was required to serve and file a memorandum of costs within days after the date of mailing the notice of entry of judgment or dismissal by the clerk or the date of service of written notice of entry of judgment or dismissal,or within days after entry of judgment,whichever was sooner.sanabria,supra,th at,fn,d.
a substantial number of comments were submitted in response to the judicial council proposal.as summarized by the court in sanabria comments opposed the proposed amendment on the basis that the time suggested for claiming attorney fees would be inadequate for the more complex attorney fee issues that could arise under code of civil procedure section.sanabria,supra,th at,d.instead of using the time period for filing a memorandum of costs,many commenters,including the state bar of california,suggested that days would be a more reasonable time period in which to bring a motion for attorney fees.jud.council of,admin.off.of cts.on time to claim attorney fees rule,supra,at.the state bar response to the request for comments was considered significant and was attached as an exhibit to the administrative office of the courts report on the proposal.in its response,the state bar offered its own proposed language for california rules of court,rule,which provided,in pertinent part,as follows a notice of motion to claim prejudgment attorney fees shall be served and filed within days after the date of mailing of the notice of entry of judgment or dismissal by the clerk under code of civil procedure section or the date of service of written notice of entry of judgment or dismissal,or within days after entry of judgment,whichever is first.jud.council of,admin.off.of cts.on time to claim attorney fees rule,supra,at.this language tracked the language of california rules of court,rule a,setting forth the time limit for claiming costs.the administrative office of the courts interpreted this proposal as a requirement that the notice of motion for fees be filed within what is,in effect,the time for filing a notice of appeal.jud.council of,admin.off.of cts.on time to claim attorney fees rule,supra,at.sanabria,supra,th at,d.the administrative office of the courts also received comments from attorneys who handled complex public benefit cases,and who urged that there be optional deferral of a litigant entitlement to attorney fees until after a possible appeal.jud.council of,admin.off.of cts.on time to claim attorney fees rule.
based on these comments,the administrative office of the courts prepared another draft of rule,incorporating the time periods for filing a notice of appeal.to address concerns that the proposed or time period after notice of entry or entry of judgment might not be sufficient,the rule was further amended to allow the parties to stipulate to extend the time until days after the deadline to file an appeal,or,in the event an appeal was filed,until the deadline for claiming costs on appeal.the rule was also amended to authorize the trial court to grant further extensions of time for good cause.the new draft was circulated and the language of the current rule was adopted.sanabria,supra,th at,d.
it is evident from the history of rule that neither the drafters of the rule nor the parties commenting on the proposed rule contemplated that entry of a prejudgment appealable order might trigger the deadlines for claiming prejudgment attorney fees.the drafters noted that the proposed rule does not prevent attorneys from claiming such fees quite promptly rather,it sets an outside time within which claims must be made.jud.council of,admin.off.of cts.memorandum from members of civil and small claims,time to claim attorney fees,rule.the history of rule indicates that the outside time limit for claiming prejudgment statutory attorney fees was intended to be entry of a final entry of a prejudgment appealable order.
applying these principles to the instant case,we hold that the time limits imposed by rules and for filing a motion for attorney fees under section,subdivision c do not commence to run until entry of judgment at the conclusion of the litigation.this interpretation of rule is consistent not only with the rule history and underlying policy,but also with existing law and practice.a
