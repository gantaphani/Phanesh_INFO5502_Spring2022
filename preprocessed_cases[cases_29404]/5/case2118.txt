appellant tuchscher development enterprises,tde sued the san diego unified port district and one of its then commissioners david malcolm hereafter the port district and malcolm,or collectively,respondents for inducing breach of contract,intentional and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage,and violation of the unfair competition law bus,et stemming from respondents conduct alleged to have interfered with an exclusive negotiating agreement between tde and other entities relating to the commercial development of certain property.respondents moved to strike tde complaint under code of civil procedure section commonly referred to as the statute asserting the lawsuit arose from respondents exercise of their rights of petition and free speech in connection with a public issue.the trial court granted the motion to strike,denied tde reconsideration motion,awarded respondents attorney fees,and entered judgment in respondents favor.on appeal,tde contends section does not apply to its causes of action because there was no public issue that warranted malcolm or the port district involvement and there was no pending public,hearings before the port district or california environmental quality act ceqa which respondents statements or writings occurred.tde further contends that even assuming the statute applied,it established a probability of success on the merits of its claims against respondents.finally,tde contends the court erred by denying reconsideration and the opportunity to conduct further discovery,and awarding respondents in attorney fees.we reject these contentions and affirm the judgment 
factual and procedural background 
in november,after several public notices and hearings,tde entered into an exclusive negotiating agreement the negotiating agreement with the city of chula vista and the chula vista redevelopment agency collectively the city under which the city and tde would take preliminary steps and negotiate towards a development agreement for the creation of a mixed use real estate project the project or crystal bay on certain bayfront property within the city.the negotiating agreement contained an exclusivity clause providing that during the agreement term,the city agree d not to negotiate with any other person or entity regarding the acquisition and development of the project except for those owners or tenants of the property to whom the city is obligated to extend owner participation rights.as part of its preliminary steps toward the project,tde obtained an option to purchase land from the primary landowner within the project area,chula vista capital cvc,a private company.that option was to expire on february.cvc waived its owner participation rights in connection with that option.in october,the city agreed to extend the negotiating agreement expiration date to may.
both the february,option deadline,and the may,negotiating agreement deadline passed without tde and the city reaching terms of a development agreement for crystal bay.
tde eventually sued respondents,the city and several entities referred to as the lennar defendants for inducing breach of contract,intentional and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage,and violation of the unfair competition law.the gist of tde complaint was that respondents conspired with lennar to deprive tde of the benefits of the negotiating agreement by disrupting the city staff from negotiating the development agreement and inducing the city to cease negotiations.tde alleged respondents furthered the conspiracy by communicating with the mayor and other agents and employees of the city of chula vista,and facilitating communications and meetings between lennar and a cvc representative,and that respondents objective was to secure the rights to develop both the crystal bay project and the port district own commercial property located south of the project site.
respondents moved to strike tde complaint under section.they argued all of the causes of action against them fell within the statute because their alleged oral and written statements were made in connection with governmental review of plans for the commercial development of the crystal bay project and port district properties,which was also an issue of public interest.respondents further argued tde could not defeat the motion by proving a probability of prevailing on its claims because government code section et immunized their actions the official duty privilege of civil code section,subdivision a protected their statements and the unfair competition law did not apply to governmental entities.
in opposition,tde argued respondents did not meet their threshold burden of demonstrating section applied because the development of crystal bay was not yet an issue of public interest,and respondents actions were not taken in connection with a public issue because no formal public,hearings before the port district or california environmental quality act ceqa been initiated.tde further asserted respondents conduct was not protected by any immunity or privilege afforded to the government or its officials.tde finally argued it readily established prima facie tort causes of action against respondents,submitting the declaration of tde president and chief executive officer,william tuchscher,as well as several documents it argued exemplified respondents interfering communications.tuchscher averred that in february of,a few months before the negotiating agreement was to expire,he learned malcolm had been communicating with lennar and various city representatives in closed door meetings,telephone calls and concerning the proposed crystal bay project.he listed examples of such communications as follows 
a a january,electronic mail communication between two lennar representatives,bob santos and jim moxham,in which moxham reported a message from the director of chula vista community development department,chris salomone,in which salomone told him malcolm felt port district staff was leaning toward giving lennar an exclusive 
b a february electronic mail communication from santos to cstephen reporting that malcolm was putting the question of authorization for staff to negotiate with lennar on a february meeting agenda 
c a february electronic mail communication from santos to curt stephenson,jim moxham and riley johnson reporting what malcolm told santos about the february meeting 
d a february telephone call in which malcolm told tuchscher the mayor wants one project and one project team and 
e a march letter from santos to malcolm in which santos reiterated lennar strong interest in developing the port district chula vista property,and indicated interest in malcolm proposal that lennar enter into a joint development agreement with the city and port district.in part,santos letter states this agreement would place a firm obligation on lennar to construct h marina view parkway and demolish the existing structures on port property.lennar would lose this investment only if an acceptable commercial agreement did not occur.in exchange,lennar would be allowed to develop residential housing on the adjacent fee owned property and commercial on port property.
further,tuchscher related his understanding of conversations among city representatives and recounted conversations he had with port district staff and city representatives in which those persons largely related malcolm conduct to him tuchscher stated he had contacted a lennar representative in the winter of,who looked into lennar computer database and confirmed crystal bay was being pursued by lennar and that the contact person,procuring cause,or broker was david malcolm.finally,tuchscher referred to a document received in discovery reflecting what he said were santos handwritten notes of a january,meeting among lennar representatives,malcolm and salomone in which santos noted malcolm said tde was up against deadlines and out of money.
after sustaining numerous evidentiary objections lodged by respondents challenging the admissibility of portions of tde declaration and several of the supporting documents,the court tentatively granted the motion as to all four of tde causes of action.it found respondents acts were made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative body or other official proceeding authorized by law under section,subdivision e.it further ruled,in light of its evidentiary rulings,that tde failed to meet its burden of establishing a probability of prevailing on the merits of its causes of action.the court ruled respondents were entitled to attorney fees under section,subdivision c.
at oral argument on the matter,the court affirmed its telephonic ruling.it also denied tde verbal request,made by its counsel at the hearing,for an order shortening time to hear a motion for certain discovery.tde moved for reconsideration and a stay of entry of judgment,and shortly thereafter filed a written motion for specified discovery under section,subdivision g,claiming new information and circumstances had arisen in the intervening month since the court prior discovery ruling.the court denied the discovery motion on the ground it sought information to support tde reconsideration motion and was therefore untimely under section,subdivision g.as for tde motion for,the court granted reconsideration as to certain exhibits,but nevertheless affirmed its order granting respondents section motion.it denied tde request for a stay of entry of judgment and on august,entered judgment in respondents favor.
the court awarded respondents in costs and in attorney fees,which included fees incurred by respondents in opposing one of tde discovery requests as well as its reconsideration motion the court found those fees sufficiently connected to the motion to strike and thus recoverable under the statute.tde appeals from the august judgment as well as the postjudgment attorney fees and costs order.
discussion 
section burdens and standard of review 
section permits a court to dismiss certain types of nonmeritorious claims early in the litigation by means of a special motion to strike.chavez mendoza th,d damon ocean hills journalism club th,d damon.section,subd.b provides in part a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.
in subdivision e of section,the legislature set out the types of first amendment activity from which a cause of action may arise to fall within the meaning of subdivision b.as pertinent here,the subdivision provides as used in this section,act in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue includes any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive,or judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest,subd.e.
section,subdivision b requires the court to engage in a process.first,the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity.the moving defendant burden is to demonstrate that the act or acts of which the plaintiff complains were taken in furtherance of the defendant right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue,as defined in the statute,subd.b.if the court finds such a showing has been made,it then determines whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.under section,subdivision b,the trial court in making these determinations considers the pleadings,and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based.equilon enterprises,llc consumer cause,cal th,d,equilon.these determinations are legal questions subject to our de novo review.damon,supra,th at,d computerxpress,jackson th,d paul for council hanyecz th,d,disapproved on other grounds in equilon,at,fn,d.
ii.application of section to tde causes of action 
we begin with the first inquiry in the section analysis,which tde only briefly addresses whether it has made a threshold showing that the challenged causes of action aris e from protected activity,subd.b city of cotati cashman cal th,d,city of cotati equilon,supra,cal th at,d.in the context,the critical consideration for the defendant initial burden is whether the cause of action is based on the defendant protected free speech or petitioning activity.navellier sletten cal th,d,navellier.the statute definitional focus is not on the form of the plaintiff cause of action but rather the defendant activity giving rise to his or her asserted liability and whether that activity constitutes protected speech or petitioning.id.at,d.to decide whether this initial arising from requirement is met,we consider not only the pleadings,but also the supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts on which the liability or defense is based.id.at,d,city of cotati,at,d.
tde contends its lawsuit was not intended to chill respondents lawful right to free speech it was intended to obtain monetary redress for respondents unlawful speech and conduct that caused it financial damage.tde also contends the matter was not the subject of any formal public process,although it concedes the development itself is an issue of public interest.it argues w hile the development of crystal bay was an issue of public interest,no issue was before the port district concerning the project.the only public issue at stake was whether or not tde could negotiate a development agreement with the city.that issue did not,and should not,have involved the port district and malcolm in any manner,and certainly did not give rise or authority to sic malcolm under any law to bring lennar to the city to develop the property.
respondents maintain any communication by them to the chula vista mayor,chula vista city manager,and other chula vista agents and employees was rationally connected to the city and port district review of plans for the commercial development of the crystal bay and port district parcels and was therefore made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive or judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law under section,subdivision e.they argue their communications to lennar are likewise protected under this subdivision,which does not require that the writing or speech be promulgated directly to the official body.ludwig superior court th,d ludwig.as an independent basis for their motion,respondents further argue the communications were made in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest so as to fall under subdivision e of the statute that this prong does not require the communications be made publicly or in connection with issues before an official proceeding.
we need not consider whether respondents communications were made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive or judicial body,because there appears to be no dispute that the proposed development of crystal bay is a matter of public interest,and thus respondents statements and writings fall within subdivision e of section.the definition of public interest within the meaning of the statute has been broadly construed to include not only governmental matters,but also private conduct that impacts a broad segment of society that affects a community in a manner similar to that of a governmental entity.damon,supra,th at,d.
here,the activity underlying each of tde causes of action against respondents is malcolm communications to either the city or lennar involving the proposed development of crystal bay and other bayfront property.the declaration of tde president and chief executive officer contains statements demonstrating the crystal bay development was a matter of public concern,having broad effects on the community.he averred chula vista mayor and chula vista staff encouraged tde to pursue the development of a large scale,project on the in chula vista that the chula vista city council approved the exclusive negotiating agreement with tde after being publicly noticed and agendized on four separate occasions and that,in planning the project,tde conducted numerous public forums with government agencies,local community groups,and individuals,as well as organized meetings with various environmental and habitat organizations,including the fish and wildlife service and the california department of fish and game the prospect of commercial and residential development of a substantial parcel of bayfront property,with its potential environmental impacts,is plainly a matter of public interest,ludwig,supra,th at,d development of a discount mall with potential environmental effects such as increased traffic and impact s on natural drainage,was clearly a matter of public interest.
tde argument that it did not intend to chill free speech rights by its lawsuit is irrelevant to the analysis.although the legislature has characterized slapp suits as having an underlying meritless goal to chill the defendant exercise of first amendment rights,subd.a see dowling zimmerman th,d dowling,the california supreme court has recently held plaintiff subjective motivations in bringing the suit are irrelevant to the statute application.city of cotati,supra,cal th at,d,navellier,supra,cal th at,d.thus,a defendant moving under section need not demonstrate the targeted action was intended to chill its free speech or petition rights,nor need it show the action had such an effect.city of cotati,at,d.
tde other the public issue of the development agreement did not involve respondents or give them the authority to bring lennar to chula similarly misplaced.this argument improperly focuses on the legitimacy of respondents conduct and thus confuses the threshold question of whether the slapp statute potentially applies with the question whether an opposing plaintiff has established a probability of success on the merits.navellier,supra,cal th at,d,quoting fox searchlight pictures,paladino th,d.a ny claimed illegitimacy of the defendant acts is an issue which the plaintiff must raise and support in the context of the discharge of the plaintiff secondary burden to provide a prima facie showing of the merits of the plaintiff case.navellier,at,d,italics omitted.
having concluded tde claims fall within the ambit of section,subdivision e,we proceed to the second prong of the section analysis and determine whether respondents have met their burden to establish a probability of prevailing on the merits.
iii.probability of prevailing on the merits 
in order to establish a probability of prevailing on the claim,subd.b,a plaintiff responding to an motion must state and substantiate a legally sufficient claim.citations.put another way,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.citations.in deciding the question of potential merit,the trial court considers the pleadings and evidentiary submission of both the plaintiff and the defendant,subd.b though the court does not weigh the credibility or comparative probative strength of competing evidence,it should grant the motion if,as a matter of law,the defendant evidence supporting the motion defeats the plaintiff attempt to establish evidentiary support for the claim.wilson parker,covert chidester cal th,d,wilson see also yu signet th,d.
evidentiary showing 
as a threshold matter,tde contends it presented substantial admissible evidence to support its claims.it maintains that,in reaching its decision,the trial court erred by weighing the evidence instead of considering whether a triable issue of fact existed from the evidence presented.
tde challenge to the trial court ruling is ultimately immaterial as this court must independently consider the moving and opposing papers.nevertheless,the excerpt from the ruling cited by tde shows the court simply considered and ruled on the admissibility of tde opposing evidence,not that it weighed respondents evidence against tde in any way.its admissibility determination was proper under the applicable inquiry,which respondents correctly point out is whether tde established with competent and admissible evidence it has a probability of prevailing on its claims.church of scientology wollersheim th,d,disapproved on other grounds in equilon,supra,cal th at,fn,d,evans unkow th,d evans see,college hospital,superior court cal th,fn,d,college hospital.an assessment of the probability of prevailing on the claim looks to trial,and the evidence that will be presented at that time.citation.such evidence must be admissible.citation.as the court in wilcox superior court th,d,disapproved on other grounds in equilon,supra,cal th at,fn,d,explained,the plaintiff burden of establishing facts to sustain a favorable decision if the evidence submitted is credited citation implies a requirement of admissibility,because otherwise there would be nothing for the trier of fact to credit.citation.at trial,the testimony of a witness concerning a particular matter is inadmissible unless he has personal knowledge of the matter.citation.an averment on information and belief is inadmissible at trial,and thus can not show a probability of prevailing on the claim.evans,at,d.
in evans,the court reviewed the california supreme court analysis of section,a closely related statute having a similar standard.evans,supra,th at,d,citing college hospital,supra,cal th at,d.under code of civil procedure section,a court may allow a plaintiff to file an amended pleading including a claim for punitive damages against a health care provider if the plaintiff establishes there is a substantial probability that he or she will prevail on the claim pursuant to civil code section.code civ,subd.a.in college hospital,the california supreme court held that under section and similar statutes,including section college hospital,at,d,the required motion operates like a demurrer or motion for summary judgment in reverse.rather than requiring the defendant to defeat the plaintiff pleadings by showing it is legally or factually meritless,the motion requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that he possesses a legally sufficient claim which is substantiated,that is,supported by competent,admissible evidence.id.at,d.thus,for example,according to the court,where the evidence in the supporting and opposing affidavits either negates or fails to reveal the actual existence of a triable claim,the motion must be denied.ibid.
in wilson,supra,cal th at page,d,our high court more recently reinforced the view that a plaintiff opposing a section motion must support its claims with admissible evidence.there,the court held a trial court earlier denial of a special motion to strike under section established probable cause to bring that action and precluded maintenance of a later malicious prosecution suit.wilson,at,d.in reaching its conclusion the court explained in denying a motion to strike on the ground that the plaintiff has established the requisite probability of success a trial court necessarily concludes that the plaintiff has substantiated a legally tenable claim through a facially sufficient evidentiary showing and that the defendant contrary showing,if any,does not defeat the plaintiff as a matter of law.this determination establishes probable cause to bring the claim,for such an action clearly is not one that any reasonable attorney would agree is totally and completely without merit.citation.a claim that is legally sufficient and can be substantiated by competent evidence is,on the contrary,one that a reasonable attorney would have thought tenable.citation.id.at,d.the court discussion contemplates a slapp plaintiff presentation of competent,admissible,evidence in support of its prima facie case in opposition to the motion.
however,respondents are incorrect to suggest the prima facie evidentiary showing required of tde under section is entirely different from the summary judgment existence of triable issue standard.in articulating the appropriate standard for assessing evidence under section in college hospital,the california supreme court pointed out its the court in part to determine whether the evidence in supporting and opposing affidavits either negates or fails to reveal the actual existence of a triable largely consistent with the prima facie approach formulated by the courts of appeal in construing section,subdivision a and other similar statutes.college hospital,supra,cal th at fn,d,finding little substantive difference between the prima facie approach and the triable issue approach.to apply the court words in the context of a section motion under either formulation,a motion under section must be granted if,after reviewing the supporting and opposing materials,the court concludes that the allegations made or the evidence adduced in support of the claim,even if credited,are insufficient as a matter of law to support a judgment college hospital,at,fn,d.
using these evidentiary standards to determine whether tde met its burden,we are compelled to disregard a substantial portion of tde evidence.the january and february electronic mail printouts,the letters and the handwritten notes are without foundation,see jacobson gourley th,d.tuchscher declaration recounting the lennar representative report on the contents of lennar computer database consists of hearsay.we further reject tuchscher declaration to the extent it is supported only by information and belief or his mere understanding of events paragraphs,g,h.evans,supra,th at,d.and many of the statements made in tuchscher declaration,including as to respondents authority to involve themselves with the project and the economic boon to lennar,are argumentative,speculative and impermissible opinions,and also lack foundation and personal knowledge 
nevertheless,we must credit all admissible evidence favorable to tde and indulge in every legitimate favorable inference that may be drawn from it.with these principles in mind,for each of tde causes of action we proceed to determine whether there is admissible evidence showing facts that would,if proved at trial,support a judgment in its favor on those claims.kyle carmon th,d.
inducing breach of contract 
the elements of a cause of action for intentional interference with contract are a valid contract between plaintiff and a third party defendants knowledge of the contract defendants intentional acts designed to induce a breach or disruption of the contractual relationship actual breach or disruption of the contractual relationship and resulting damage.quelimane stewart title guaranty cal th,d,applied equipment litton saudi arabia cal th,fn,d,limandri judkins th,d.the required intent is shown if the defendant knows that the interference is certain or substantially certain to occur as a result of his action.the rule applies,in other words,to an interference that is incidental to the actor independent purpose and desire but known to him to be a necessary consequence of his action.quelimane,at,d.whether the interference was justified as merely incidental to the defendant legitimate pursuit of his own interests is a question of fact.ibid.contrary to respondents argument,w rongfulness independent of the inducement to breach the contract is not an element of the tort of intentional interference with existing contractual relations id.at,d,italics omitted.
on appeal,tde does not explain how its evidence substantiates the elements of this claim it simply contends respondents failed to establish their actions were statutorily immune or privileged as they had asserted in their motion for section relief.but this argument misunderstands the burdens on a section motion.in moving for section relief,it was not respondents burden to show tde could not demonstrate a probability of prevailing on its claims its only burden was to establish that the claims fell within the ambit of the statute.the fact respondents also made arguments directed toward the second prong does not relieve tde of its own statutory burden,that is,to make a prima facie showing of facts which would,if proved at trial,support a judgment in plaintiff favor.dowling,supra,th at,d.in this way section differs significantly from the summary judgment statute,which places the initial burden of production on the moving defendant to demonstrate the opposing plaintiff can not establish one or more elements of his or her causes of action.see aguilar atlantic richfield.cal th,d.consequently,tde opening brief arguments do not assist us in our review.
we in any event assess the pleadings and admissible evidence in the record to undertake our independent review.in its cause of action for inducing breach of contract,tde alleges respondents,knowing of the negotiating agreement existence,met with,spoke to,corresponded with and exchanged tde proprietary information with chula vista mayor,shirley horton,the chula vista city manager and other chula vista agents and employees to encourage a relationship between the city and lennar and discourage any development agreement between tde and the city.it also alleges malcolm and mayor horton facilitated communications and meetings between lennar and a cvc representative in order to encourage a purchase agreement between cvc and lennar and discourage further negotiations between cvc and tde.tde alleges this conduct caused the city to breach the negotiating agreement,ignore the staff recommendation to negotiate a development agreement with tde,and refuse to extend the negotiating agreement deadline,causing it damages.
while these allegations may state a prima facie case of interference with the negotiating agreement,the record is absent any admissible direct evidence or evidence from which we may infer respondents actions induced a breach or disruption.the negotiating agreement in no way obligated the city to enter into a development agreement the city staff was merely obligated during the agreement term to negotiate diligently and in good faith the terms and conditions of a development agreement to present to the city board for review and consideration.notably,the sole evidence of the city abandonment or unreasonable failure to negotiate is in tuchscher declaration,in which he avers as a result of the purported communications between respondents,lennar and the city and the heavy pressure wrongfully and greedily exerted by malcolm and the port district,the city abandoned negotiations towards a development agreement,let the negotiating agreement expire without good faith negotiations with tde,and lennar was soon pursuing the development of the crystal bay project.we disregard these conclusionary and argumentative statements.hayman block d.affidavits must cite evidentiary facts,not legal conclusions or ultimate facts weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial the rutter group,to.giving credit to all of tde admissible evidence,it shows the city merely permitted the negotiating agreement to expire,as was the city right under its terms 
even if we disregarded tde evidentiary problems and assumed the port district and malcolm had discussions with lennar,another developer,regarding the proposed project,or that malcolm expressed to city representatives his vision for a different arrangement for crystal bay,such talks do not by themselves establish the city improperly negotiated with malcolm or lennar,abandoned the negotiating agreement,or otherwise refused to meet and confer or negotiate in good faith with tde.it is not reasonable to infer from malcolm advocacy efforts directed to city representatives that the city did not in any event use its best efforts to deal exclusively with tde while the negotiating agreement was in place.indeed,tde president states in his declaration that during that period,tde and chula vista had interaction several times daily and also worked together extensively to resolve environmental issues pertinent to crystal bay.
also,important to the damages analysis,there was no guarantee the city would have approved the development agreement even had tde and the city reached final terms for such an agreement.the negotiating agreement contains a no clause providing the inclusion of the specific terms set forth above shall not be deemed to be acceptance of such items by either party until such time as the city may approve,and the parties execute the development agreement.it also contains a provision entitled retention of discretion to approve the project and dda development agreement that states in part the parties understand that the city has the complete and unfettered discretion to reject the development agreement without explanation or cause.
absent competent evidence supporting the elements of causation,or damages,tde has failed to meet its burden to establish a probability of prevailing on the merits of its cause of action for inducing breach of contract.stated another way,these elements are not supported by a prima facie showing of facts sufficient to sustain a favorable judgment in tde favor.having reached this conclusion,we need not reach respondents contention their actions were statutorily immune under government code sections or protected by the official duty privilege of civil code section,subdivision a.
interference with prospective economic advantage 
we similarly conclude tde can not meet its burden to establish a probability of prevailing on its causes of action for intentional and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage,which are based on the same allegations and evidence as its claim for inducing breach of contract.to prevail on the interference with prospective economic advantage causes of action,tde has the burden of proving not only that respondents knowingly or negligently interfered with an economic relationship,but that they engaged in conduct that was wrongful by some legal measure other than the fact of interference itself.della penna toyota motor sales,cal th,d,gemini aluminum california custom shapes,th,d gemini national medical transportation network deloitte touche th,d independently wrongful requirement applies to negligent interference claims.
in opposition to respondents section motion,tde did not explain how its evidence supported the elements of these claims.likewise,tde opening brief arguments focus only upon the defenses of governmental immunity and privilege,and do not address this element or any other of its interference causes of action.on this basis,we could conclude without further discussion that tde failed to meet its burden of making a prima facie showing of a probability of success on the merits.but even considering tde arguments in reply directed toward the wrongfulness prong of these causes of action,we must conclude it has not met its burden.in its reply brief,tde lists malcolm wrongful acts as interfering with the negotiating agreement conspiring with lennar and the city to oust tde assisting in drafting language in an option agreement between lennar and cvc entered into in april and advocating the city to redesign crystal bay with lennar as its developer.according to tde,these acts constituted anticompetitive conduct in light of the negotiating agreement providing the sole negotiating rights to crystal bay to tde.
there are several reasons why this argument must fail.first,such unsupported argument does not persuade us these acts are wrongful for purposes of its interference with economic advantage causes of action.see gemini,supra,th at,d kurinij hanna morton th,d appellate court will not consider points unsupported by citation to pertinent authority.second,as we have stated,tde evidence fails in many respects and does not establish any purported interference or conspiracy.in addition to its formation and operation and resulting damage,in order to establish a civil conspiracy a plaintiff must prove a wrongful act done in the furtherance of the conspiracy.applied equipment litton saudi arabia cal th,d,see also kidron movie acquisition corporation th,d.in this context,it is insufficient for tde to baldly assert the wrongful conduct is the conspiracy.and even assuming respondents helped draft an agreement between lennar and cvc or advocated their own development ideas to the city,such activity is not wrongful by some legal measure.gemini,at,d reviewing california cases applying wrongfulness standard standard encompasses acts constituting a breach of fiduciary duty,violation of a statute or a tort,or other independently actionable conduct.although the point is obvious,malcolm,the port district,lennar and cvc were not parties to the negotiating agreement and thus they were not bound by any contractual obligation or duty to refrain from taking among themselves or with the push their own development ideas for crystal bay.assuming respondents had talks with the city or its representatives regarding crystal bay,such talks do not make respondents communications wrongful apart from the presumed interference.absent any contractual obligation to avoid discussing the issues with the city,respondents conduct does not amount to a breach of contract or other independently wrongful act sufficient to support plaintiffs interference with economic advantage claim.
although it is suggested by some of its arguments,tde does not and did not before the trial court meaningfully contend malcolm conduct was wrongful by some legal measure because it was outside the scope of his authority as a port commissioner,and thus we do not address that point.
violation of unfair competition law 
citing trinkle california state lottery th,d,tde argues its cause of action under the unfair competition law bus,et must survive against both respondents because the port district should be held vicariously liable for malcolm actions.tde apparently concedes it can not maintain such a cause of action against the port district because,as a governmental entity,it is not a person within the meaning of business and professions code section.california medical regents of university of california th,fn,d state university school of medicine and hospital is a public entity and thus is not a person within scope of prohibitions of unfair competition law,even though hospital is involved in commercial activity trinkle,at,d janis california state lottery th,d governmental entities such as the lottery commission,are not included in the statutes definitions of persons rider city of san diego cal th,d,port district is a governmental entity under the san diego unified port district act harb,appen.
even if we were to conclude a cause of action could be maintained against malcolm,tde does not explain with any reasoned argument or authority how malcolm actions were unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business acts or practices within the meaning of the unfair competition law.see communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d,unfair competition law defines unfair competition to include any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice.it is not for us to make tde arguments for it,and consequently we do not consider the point.gemini,supra,th at,d.
new evidence 
tde contends the court erred when,after granting reconsideration and receiving certain newly discovered evidence,it nevertheless reaffirmed its ruling on respondents section motion to strike.according to tde,such evidence,consisting of pleadings filed in a separate lawsuit gorfine malcolm super.san diego county,no.gorfine revealed inconsistent statements by malcolm and the port district relating to the port district authority and jurisdiction to involve itself in discussions concerning crystal bay,which should have operated as judicial estoppel in the present case.tde argues that whether or not judicial estoppel applies,the inconsistency raises a triable issue as to whether malcolm exceeded his authority and jurisdiction by participating in negotiations concerning the crystal bay property and that a jury,not the trial court,should have decided if malcolm communications were wrongful and caused tde damages.
preliminarily,we reject respondents argument we should not review these contentions.they maintain the trial court order on the reconsideration motion is not an appealable order because it effectively denied reconsideration.they do not recognize that tde argument is made in connection with his challenge to the trial court reaffirmation of the section ruling,and stems from his appeal from the judgment,not from any challenge to the trial court order granting reconsideration.an order denying a motion for reconsideration is interpreted as a determination that the application does not meet the requirements of section.if the requirements have been met to the satisfaction of the court but the court is not persuaded the earlier ruling was erroneous,the proper course is to grant reconsideration and to reaffirm the earlier ruling.mink superior court th,d.
turning to tde arguments as to judicial estoppel,we conclude the trial court correctly rejected application of that doctrine.the doctrine of judicial estoppel,sometimes referred to as the doctrine of preclusion of inconsistent positions,is invoked to prevent a party from changing its position over the course of judicial proceedings when such positional changes have an adverse impact on the judicial process.citation.the policies underlying preclusion of inconsistent positions are general consideration s of the orderly administration of justice and regard for the dignity of judicial proceedings.citation.judicial estoppel is intended to protect against a litigant playing fast and loose with the courts.citation.because it is intended to protect the integrity of the judicial process,it is an equitable doctrine invoked by a court at its discretion judicial estoppel is most commonly applied to bar a party from making a factual assertion in a legal proceeding which directly contradicts an earlier assertion made in the same proceeding or a prior one.citations.citation.international engine parts,feddersen th,d.
according to summary judgment papers filed by malcolm in the gorfine action,that case involved plaintiff allegations that malcolm committed violations of the political reform act of,et by failing to report certain financial interests.a central issue was the port district jurisdiction,which would in turn establish the financial interests malcolm and other port district commissioners were obligated to disclose.in their moving papers,malcolm and the port district argued the port district jurisdiction extended only to tidelands,submerged lands in or adjacent to san diego bay,the airport and some limited annexations.as respondents point out,the trial court in the gorfine action denied respondents summary judgment motion,and in doing so specifically rejected their interpretation of the port district jurisdiction for purposes of the political reform act.
under these circumstances,judicial estoppel will not operate against respondents.the doctrine should be applied only when the person against whom it is asserted was successful in asserting the first position,the tribunal adopted the position or accepted it as true.jackson county of los angeles th,d new hampshire maine,d absent success in a prior proceeding,a party later inconsistent position introduces no risk of inconsistent court determinations,citation,and thus poses little threat to judicial integrity.
nevertheless,tde asks that we follow the principles stated in thomas gordon th,d thomas,in which the court of appeal observed some california courts do not limit application of judicial estoppel to situations where the litigant was successful in asserting the contradictory position.in thomas,the appellant admitted transferring her interest in two corporations to an entity owned solely by her girlfriend in order to keep it out of her creditors hands,and then filed for bankruptcy,expecting to reclaim her funds after her debts were discharged.id.at,d.she signed documents in the bankruptcy court claiming to list all of her assets but said nothing about those interests.ibid.she later sued her accountant for negligence and fraud,claiming he failed to keep her apprised of the financial affairs of both corporations.id.at,d.the accountant successfully moved for summary judgment in part on the ground the appellant should be judicially estopped from claiming any legal or equitable interest in the corporations sufficient to require the accountant to keep her apprised of their affairs.id.at,d.finding this to be the rare situation where the litigant has made an egregious attempt to manipulate the legal system,the court of appeal agreed the circumstances warranted application of judicial estoppel absent proof of appellant success in the earlier litigation.id.at,d agreeing with the trial court that this is as egregious as it gets.in reaching this conclusion,the court observed that because of the nature of bankruptcy law,the appellant obtained a legal benefit from her prior statements as soon as they were made,because they resulted in an automatic stay preventing creditors from taking any action against her for a period of time.ibid.
the circumstances here are distinguishable from those in thomas.respondents position in gorfine was not adopted by the trial court here,and we can not conclude they have gained any advantage in the present action by virtue of the inconsistent position taken in the gorfine matter.notably,tde has not explained with any meaningful authority or argument how the port district jurisdiction is relevant to any particular element of its causes of action that would support the prima facie showing it must make to sustain its section burden.its statement that the jurisdiction issue was the lynchpin of the port district section motion does not shed any light on that question,and it is simply incorrect the port district raised the jurisdiction argument in reply to tde assertion that respondents actions fell outside the official duty privilege of civil code section,subdivision a.as we have stated above,tde misplaced attack on respondents assertion of defenses did not suffice to meet its independent burden in opposition to the section motion to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the merits of its claims.
iv.the court did not abuse its discretion in denying tde discovery requests 
tde contends the court erred by taking a,technical approach and denying tde oral and written motions for discovery.tde maintains the court rulings violated its constitutional right to a jury trial because the assessment of probability of success looks to trial and the evidence that will be presented at that time.the arguments are without merit.
section,subdivision g provides all discovery proceedings in the action shall be stayed upon the filing of a notice of motion made pursuant to this section.the stay of discovery shall remain in effect until notice of entry of the order ruling on the motion.the court,on noticed motion and for good cause shown,may order that specified discovery be conducted notwithstanding this subdivision.
we review for abuse of discretion the trial court decision as to whether a plaintiff has complied with the requirements of section,subdivision g to merit discovery prior to a hearing on the motion to strike.schroeder irvine city council th,d see also sipple foundation for nat.progress th,d lafayette morehouse,chronicle publishing th,d.under this standard the reviewing court will not disturb the trial court decision unless it has exceeded the limits of legal discretion by making an arbitrary,capricious,or patently absurd determination.mendoza club car,th,d.
the court here did not abuse its discretion in denying tde requests.tde first request for discovery was not authorized under section,subdivision g because it was not made by noticed motion.robertson rodriguez th,d see also braun chronicle publishing th,d braun oral request for discovery at hearing on defendant motion failed to comply with sub.g of.as for its second request for discovery,we will follow tde own cited,supra,th,d conclude the court properly denied that request.in evans,as here,the opposing plaintiff did not file a motion for discovery under subdivision g of section until after the trial court granted the defendant motion and the plaintiff moved for reconsideration of that
