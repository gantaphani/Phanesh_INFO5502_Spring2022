state farm general insurance company state farm and mimin mintarsih both appeal a judgment in a declaratory relief action.mintarsih sued state farm insureds,dennis lam and dina lam,in the underlying action for false imprisonment and other counts arising from her employment as a domestic servant.she obtained a judgment against the lams for compensatory and punitive damages,statutory penalties,attorney fees as costs,and other costs.in this action,state farm sought a declaration of the parties rights and duties with respect to two insurance policies that were issued to the lams and later assigned to mintarsih.the trial court determined that the policies provided coverage for in compensatory damages and for the award of in costs,but that state farm had no obligation to pay the attorney fee award.
on appeal,mintarsih contends state farm is obligated to pay the attorney fee award against the lams under policy provisions requiring it to pay costs awarded against the insureds,despite the fact that the right to a fee award arose solely from wage and hour claims for which there was no potential coverage under the policies.she also argues that she is entitled to postjudgment interest on the entire judgment.in its appeal,state farm contends that it has no duty to indemnify the lams for the compensatory damages award,based on insurance code section and other grounds.
we conclude that state farm obligation under the policies supplemental payments provisions,which promise to pay costs awarded against the insureds,extends only to costs arising from claims that were at least potentially covered under one or both of the policies.mintarsih has not shown that the wage and hour claims that gave rise to the right to recover attorney fees were potentially covered under the policies and therefore has not established that state farm is obligated to pay the attorney fees awarded as costs.in addition,insurance code section precludes indemnity for the compensatory damages awarded against the lams for false imprisonment and negligence.because state farm has no duty to indemnify the lams under either policy for the damages awarded against them,we conclude that it has no obligation to pay postjudgment interest on the judgment awarded against them other than interest on the cost award,which state farm concedes.we therefore affirm the judgment in part and reverse in part with directions.
factual and procedural background

present action 
state farm filed a complaint for declaratory relief against the lams and mintarsih in june,seeking a determination of the parties rights and duties under the two policies and of its purported right to reimbursement of defense costs.the court conducted a nonjury trial in august.
state farm argued that the conduct for which the lams were found liable was not an accident within the meaning of the policies.it also argued that the attorney fee award was based on wage and hour claims for which there was no coverage under the policies and that the policies did not provide for payment of attorney fees awarded as costs in these circumstances.state farm did not pursue its claim for reimbursement of defense costs at trial.
the lams and mintarsih argued that state farm had a duty to indemnify the lams for all of the in compensatory damages awarded for false imprisonment,negligence,negligence per se,and fraud,although they conceded that state farm had no duty of indemnity with respect to the fraud count.they also argued that state farm was obligated to pay the attorney fees awarded as costs regardless of whether the right to recover those fees arose from a claim for which there was no coverage under the policies.they conceded that state farm had no duty to indemnify the lams for the amounts awarded for wage and hour violations or for punitive damages.
the trial court issued a statement of decision in january.it concluded that the policies provided coverage for in compensatory damages awarded for false imprisonment and negligence,and that the policies also obligated state farm to pay the awarded against the lams as costs.the court concluded,however,that state farm had no obligation under the policies to pay the attorney fees awarded against the lams based on wage and hour claims for which the policies provided no coverage,and that insurance code section precluded indemnity for those fees.the court entered a judgment on april,stating that state farm had a duty to indemnify the lams for damages in the amount of and costs awarded against the lams in the amount of,state farm otherwise had no duty to indemnify the lams or pay mintarsih any additional sum,and state farm was the prevailing party in this action.
mintarsih moved to vacate the judgment and enter a different judgment ordering state farm to pay postjudgment interest on the entire amount of the judgment in the underlying action.she also moved for a new trial.the court denied the new trial motion but granted in part the motion to vacate the judgment,and entered a new judgment.the new judgment,entered on august,stated that state farm had a duty to indemnify the lams for damages in the amount of and costs awarded against the lams in the amount of,state farm was required to pay interest on only those two portions of the judgment in the underlying action,state farm had no duty to indemnify the lams for any other amount,and state farm was the prevailing party in this action.
mintarsih timely appealed the judgment,and state farm also appealed.
contentions 
mintarsih contends in her appeal that the supplemental payments provisions unambiguously require state farm to pay costs awarded against the lams in suits it defends,including attorney fees as costs,regardless of whether the right to recover attorney fees arises from claims that are covered under the policies insurance code section does not preclude payment of the attorney fees awarded against the lams because their conduct giving rise to the fee award was not willful within the meaning of the statute and because the obligation to pay costs arises from a defense,rather than an indemnity,obligation and the supplemental payments provisions require state farm to pay interest on the entire judgment,including those amounts that are not covered under the policies,until it pays the policy limit.
state farm contends in its appeal that the false imprisonment was willful within the meaning of insurance code section,so it has no duty of indemnity as to the damages awarded for false imprisonment the lams negligence was inseparable from the false imprisonment,so it has no duty of indemnity as to the damages awarded for negligence the negligence was not an accident within the meaning of the policies workers compensation exclusions in the policies precluded coverage for the lams negligence and mintarsih failed to prove what part of the in compensatory damages awarded against the lams was attributable to the counts for which the court concluded there was coverage,as required

duty to defend 
liability policies typically promise that the insurer will defend the insured in an action seeking damages for a covered claim.thus,an insurer duty to defend claims for which there is at least potential coverage under the policy is contractual.buss superior court cal th,d,buss.the contractual duty to defend extends to all claims at least potentially covered under the policy,but no further.an insurer has no contractual duty to defend claims for which there is no potential coverage,but a duty to defend such claims is implied in law if there is at least potential coverage for,and therefore a duty to defend,another claim in the action.id.at,d.in such a mixed action,an insurer has a duty to defend the action in its entirety to ensure that the defense of claims that are at least potentially covered will be both meaningful and immediate.id.at,d.
in such a circumstance,an insurer may provide the required defense under a reservation of its rights to later assert its objections to coverage as to one or more of the claims alleged against its insured.blue ridge ins.jacobsen cal th,d.it may also reserve its right to seek reimbursement from the insured of any defense costs that can be attributed solely to claims that were not potentially covered under the policy.buss,supra,cal th at,d.an insurer,however,may not seek reimbursement from an insured of defense costs attributable to claims that were at least potentially covered,because the duty to defend such claims was part of the insurance policy bargain.id.at,d.an insurer has no contractual duty to defend claims for which there is no potential for coverage,and defense costs that are solely attributable to such claims are not part of the exchange.id.at,d.an insurer right to reimbursement of those defense costs is implied in law to avoid unjust enrichment.ibid.an insured could have no objectively reasonable expectation to retain the windfall of payment for the defense of claims for which there was no potential coverage.id.at,d.
state farm has no obligation to pay costs arising solely from claims that were not even potentially covered 
state farm agreed to pay expenses we incur and costs taxed against an insured in suits we defend,under the terms of the homeowners policy.under the terms of the umbrella policy,state farm agreed to pay the expenses we incur and costs taxed against you in suits we defend,provided that the claim or suit was not covered by any other policy.these provisions make the insurer obligation to pay an award of costs against the insured dependent on the defense duty.courts have interpreted the word costs as used in such a provision consistent with its use in code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,which provides that attorney fees authorized by contract,statute,or law are allowable as costs to the prevailing party under section.prichard liberty mutual ins.th,d prichard insurance of north america national american ins.th,d.
