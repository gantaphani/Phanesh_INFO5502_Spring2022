facts and prior proceedings.
narendra and bela desai owned rental property in santa monica,california,that was partially insured by farmers insurance exchange.the property was damaged by fire during the northridge earthquake of.the desais received disaster loans from the united states small business administration sba and the city of santa monica.they also filed a claim with farmers for the insured portions of the property.
while the claim with farmers was pending,a dispute arose regarding the scope of insurance benefits due under the contract.the desais hired sayas to represent them in an insurance bad faith action against farmers.sayas,in turn,hired q b as in the action.the client retainer agreement signed by the parties provided that sayas and q b would receive of the net settlement after deducting costs plus for the desais.the retainer agreement also contained the following clause in any dispute between lawyers and client,the prevailing party will be entitled to reasonable attorney fees.
with the assistance of sayas and q b,the desais eventually settled the case with farmers.after the settlement,however,the desais became dissatisfied with the quality of representation they had received from sayas and q b.they believed that sayas and q b improperly failed to advise them that the sba and the city would be entitled to immediate repayment of the disaster loans,which would drastically reduce the settlement payment that the desais would ultimately receive.because they believed they had received bad legal advice in settling,the desais hired new counsel and moved in california superior court to vacate the dismissal of their bad faith claim against farmers so that they could rescind the settlement agreement.while the motion to vacate was pending,sayas and q b filed an ex parte application against the desais to recover the fees and costs due to them under the retainer agreement.the motion to vacate was ultimately denied,but the fee dispute between the desais and sayas and q b remained.
as a result of the dispute over the distribution of the insurance proceeds,farmers brought an interpleader action in california superior court,naming as defendants the desais,sayas,q b,the sba,and the city.the sba removed the interpleader action to federal district court.after the desais settled with the sba and the city,sayas and q b moved for,and were granted,summary judgment on the underlying fee dispute.the district court found that sayas and q b were entitled to a total of in attorneys fees and costs under the retainer agreement for representing the desais in the bad faith action and settlement.
sayas and q b then moved for attorneys fees under california civil code to cover the fees they incurred in prosecuting the underlying fee dispute.the district court granted their motions for attorneys fees,awarding q b in fees for its representation of sayas,and sayas in fees for its representation of q the desais appeal.
ii.discussion.
standard of review.
because this case is based on diversity jurisdiction,we are obligated to apply california state law regarding attorneys fees.see kabatoff safeco ins.of america,cir.the task of a federal court in a diversity action is to approximate state law as closely as possible in order to make sure that the vindication of the state right is without discrimination because of the federal forum.gee tenneco,cir.
the district court construction of the law of the state in which it sits is entitled to substantial deference.kabatoff,at.our review of the district court decision is therefore restricted.we will not reverse the district court on issues of the construction of state law unless the construction is clearly wrong.gee,at.
attorneys fees.
california law ordinarily does not allow for recovery of attorneys fees.trope katz,cal th,d.one exception is where the parties contractually obligate themselves to pay attorneys fees.id.at.these contractual provisions are governed by california civil code,which provides 
in any action on a contract,where the contract specifically provides that attorney fees and costs,which are incurred to enforce that contract,shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party,then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract,whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or not,shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees in addition to other costs.
section was enacted to provide for a mutuality of remedy when a contract makes recovery of attorneys fees available only to one party.see trope,d at.
the desais admit that,had sayas or q b hired other counsel to litigate the underlying fee dispute,they would be obligated under the contract and section to pay the attorneys fees.they contend that pursuant to the california supreme court decision in trope katz,sayas and q b are not entitled to attorneys fees because they represented themselves in the fee dispute.sayas and q b argue that trope does not apply because they each hired the other to represent themselves in the fee dispute.
in trope,the court held that an attorney representing himself,in propria persona,is not entitled under section to recover attorneys fees for costs incurred in litigation.id.at.that case,like the instant case,involved a fee dispute between a law firm and its former client,in which the retainer agreement provided for attorneys fees to the prevailing party.id.at,d.the court based its decision solely on the statutory interpretation of section,and specifically on what it means to incur attorneys fees.id.at,d.in ultimately concluding that an attorney who represents himself,in propria persona,is not entitled to attorneys fees under section,the court reasoned that such an attorney does not become liable to pay fees to another,and therefore does not incur fees within the meaning of section.id.rather,an in propria persona attorney incurs only opportunity costs that is,the costs of the time spent preparing his case that could have been spent representing other clients.id.at,d.
the court concluded that the purpose of section,to provide a mutuality of remedy,would be thwarted by allowing an in propria persona attorney to recover attorneys fees when a pro se litigant would not be allowed to recover attorneys fees,even with a contractual attorneys fees provision.id.at,d.to hold that an in propria persona attorney is entitled to attorneys fees would be to hold that the time and opportunity that an attorney gives up when he chooses to litigate a case in propria persona are somehow qualitatively more important and worthy of compensation than those of other pro se litigants.id.thus,the key to the analysis of section under trope is the incurring of fees.
in this case,the district court rejected the desais argument that the trope rule should be applied,reasoning that trope overriding concern about the disparate treatment of pro se litigants was not present in this case to hold that trope applied would be to deny a party the benefit of retaining an attorney who is already familiar with the case and in arizona,which has a rule nearly identical to the trope rule,a court nonetheless held that an attorney,who was a general partner in a partnership where the other general partner was a trust for which he was the trustee and from which he could distribute the corpus to himself upon the death of the beneficiaries,could recover fees for his representation of the partnership.see hunt investment eliot,app.we conclude that the district court was not clearly w
