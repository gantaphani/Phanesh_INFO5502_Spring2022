factual and procedural background 
a detailed recitation of the facts and proceedings leading to the first appeal is set forth in serrano i,supra,th at pages to.briefly,plaintiffs brought a personal injury action against a defendant with whom they subsequently settled.while the action was pending,the defendant took the deposition of one of the plaintiffs experts and designated coast as the deposition reporter.plaintiffs attorney requested a certified copy.when the defendant requested that the transcript be prepared on an expedited basis,coast asked plaintiffs counsel if he too wanted his certified copy to be expedited.plaintiffs counsel did.thereafter,coast billed plaintiffs counsel for the transcript and added a fee for expediting the copy.plaintiffs counsel protested the expedition fee.believing this fee to be proper,coast responded that counsel would not receive the transcript on an expedited basis without payment of the fee.plaintiffs then applied ex parte to the trial court in the underlying action for an order requiring coast to provide a copy of the expert deposition transcript without charging the expedition fee.other depositions were being taken and so plaintiffs and coast agreed that the court would determine the validity and reasonableness of the expedited service fee and that the ruling would govern the fees for all other deposition transcripts in this action.based on that agreement,coast waived its cod requirement and delivered copies of the deposition transcripts to plaintiffs counsel.id.at,fn.omitted.
the trial court found coast practice of charging the party a substantial expedition fee to be unconscionable but,pursuant to urban pacific equities.superior court th,it believed it had no authority to require a deposition reporter to charge other than what the market would allow.serrano i,supra,th at.the court ordered plaintiffs to pay the full expedition fee charged for all depositions.ibid.plaintiffs paid the amount and sought review by means of an extraordinary writ.we summarily denied the writ.id.at.
in the course of plaintiffs ensuing appeal,we solicited briefing from amici curiae.three court reporter associations filed amicus briefs on behalf of coast.coast argued,while a trial court may order a deposition reporter to deliver copies of a deposition transcript to a party and the party must pay for it,that the trial court had no authority to regulate the amount of the fee.serrano i,supra,th at.we disagreed.based on code of civil procedure sections,subdivision c,subdivision a,and,subdivision a,we held that trial courts have the power to require a deposition reporter to provide a copy of a deposition transcript to a nonnoticing party for a reasonable fee and that in the event of a dispute,the trial court was empowered to determine the amount of a reasonable fee.serrano i,supra,at.we did not hold that expedition fees were per se unreasonable.rather,we stated this does not preclude a deposition reporter from charging a reasonable fee for expediting the making,certification,and delivery of a copy.although the reporter ordinarily sets the fee in the first instance,the reasonableness of the expense citation that a court may require a party to pay to obtain a copy of the transcript in a pending action is a question within the sound discretion of the trial court.id.at.we remanded the case to the trial court to exercise its discretion to determine whether coast fees were reasonable.id.at.
remand after serrano i 
on remand,coast argued that its expedition fee was reasonable.plaintiffs countered that the entire fee was unreasonable.the trial court ruled that,under the circumstances presented,coast entire expedition charge was unreasonable.the court ordered that amount refunded to plaintiffs.coast promptly paid that amount plus prejudgment interest

discussion 
the guiding principles for applications for private attorneys fees under section 
codified in section,the private attorney general doctrine,under which attorneys fees may be awarded to successful litigants,rests upon the recognition that privately initiated lawsuits are often essential to the effectuation of the fundamental public policies embodied in constitutional or statutory provisions,and that,without some mechanism authorizing the award of attorney fees,private actions to enforce such important public policies will as a practical matter frequently be infeasible.citations.woodland hills residents,city council cal d,woodland hills.in short,section acts as an incentive for the pursuit of public litigation that might otherwise have been too costly to bring.citations.punsly ho th,italics added.
eligibility for section attorney fees is established when plaintiffs action has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest,a significant benefit,whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons and the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement are such as to make the award appropriate.joshua,supra,cal th at,fn.omitted,quoting from woodland hills,supra,cal d at.because section states the criteria in the conjunctive,each of the statutory criteria must be met to justify a fee award.citations.county of colusa california wildlife conservation bd.th.the burden is on the claimant in the trial court to establish each prerequisite to an award of attorneys fees under section.ryan california interscholastic federation th,consumer cause,gooch natural food markets,th.

some courts have applied a de novo standard of review when the appellate court publishes an opinion in the case.los angeles police protective league city of los angeles d.when an appellate court issues an opinion,it is arguably in as good a position as the trial court to determine whether the legal right enforced through its opinion meets any of the three criteria of section.see los angeles police protective league city of los angeles,supra,at.and,a de novo review of such a trial court order is warranted where the determination of whether the criteria for an award of attorney fees and costs in this context have been satisfied amounts to statutory construction and a question of law.connerly state personnel bd.cal th.as explained below,under either of discretion or de trial court ruling must be affirmed.
the supreme court in joshua established the applicable criteria here for determining under section whether the litigation has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest.
as noted,if any of the section elements is not met,then the fee award is not justified.county of colusa california wildlife conservation,supra,th at.we agree with the trial court that plaintiffs here failed to meet the first element.that is,plaintiffs did not demonstrate that their action resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest.joshua,supra,cal th at.stated otherwise,the supreme court explication in joshua indicates that the dispute here over expedition fees did not amount to public interest litigation.where the trial court ruling denying the attorneys fee request was entirely consistent with joshua,it was not an abuse of discretion.
joshua involved a dispute between a couple who had engaged in a practice known as second parent adoption,in which the partner of a birth mother adopted the child,while the birth mother retained her parental rights.after the couple relationship ended,the birth mother challenged her former partner adoption of the second child,joshua,by arguing,inter alia,that the form of adoption had no legal basis.joshua,supra,cal th at.the prior case concluded in a supreme court opinion that upheld second parent adoptions.ibid.thereafter,the prevailing adoptive mother moved for section attorneys fees on the basis that she had prevailed in the supreme court on an issue of benefit to a large class of persons.ibid.
the supreme court concluded that attorneys fees under section were not appropriately awarded because the losing party birth mother was not the type of party on whom private attorney general fees were intended to be imposed.joshua,supra,cal th at.with respect to the behavior of the party charged with paying attorneys fees,according to the supreme court review of the case law,in virtually every published case in which section attorney fees have been awarded,the party on whom the fees have been imposed had done something more than prosecute or defend a private lawsuit,but instead had engaged in conduct that in some way had adversely affected the public interest.joshua,supra,at,italics added,and cases cited at,fn.that is,the public interest litigation obtained a substantial benefit by causing a change in the defendant behavior,whose actions or failure to act was somehow impairing the statutory or constitutional rights of the public or a significant class of people.id.at,italics added.
the court also found support for its interpretation of public interest litigation such as would justify section attorney fees in the statute legislative history.t he legislature was focused on public interest litigation in the conventional sense litigation designed to promote the public interest by enforcing laws that a governmental or private entity was violating,rather than private litigation that happened to establish an important precedent.joshua,supra,cal th at,italics added,citing com.on judiciary,on assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may,com.on judiciary,hearing on assem.bill reg.sess,testimony of john phillips.the court explained,t he enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest implies that those on whom attorney fees are imposed have acted,or failed to act,in such a way as to violate or compromise that right,thereby requiring its enforcement through litigation.it does not appear to encompass the award of attorney fees against an individual who has done nothing to curtail a public right other than raise an issue in the context of private litigation that results in important legal precedent.joshua,supra,at.the court noted that attorney fees have been awarded to those defending against suits by public entities,or those purporting to represent the public,that seek to expand the government power to curtail important public rights.citation.id.at,italics added.recognizing in some cases the litigation underlying the section award can involve rights or benefits that are somewhat intangible,such as clarifying important constitutional principles,the supreme court explained that,even in such cases,the party against whom the fees are awarded is responsible in some way for the violation of those rights and principles.citation.joshua,supra,at,italics added.
the joshua court viewed the birth mother,the person from whom the prevailing party sought to recover fees,as a private litigant with no institutional interest in the litigation,and the judgment she sought in the present case would have settled only her private rights and those of her children and the prevailing party adoptive mother.she simply raised an issue in the course of that litigation that gave rise to important appellate precedent decided adversely to her.joshua,supra,cal th at,fn.omitted.courts may consider whether the litigation generated important appellate precedent when determining whether the litigation enforced an important right affecting the public interest.id.at.but even when an important right has been vindicated and a substantial public benefit conferred,and when a plaintiff litigation has transcended her personal interest,we conclude that section was not intended to impose fees on an individual seeking a judgment that determines only his or her private rights,but who has done nothing to adversely affect the public interest other than being on the losing side of an important appellate case.joshua,supra,at,italics added.
joshua is on point and is controlling supreme court precedent.
serrano i is analogous to the prior litigation in joshua sharon superior court,supra,cal th and coast is in the same position as the birth mother in that case.the trial court here denied plaintiffs motion for private attorney general fees under section on remand,finding that in seeking an order for coast to provide a copy of the deposition transcript without charging the expedited service fee,plaintiffs were trying to protect their own private interest and not seeking to vindicate an important right affecting the public interest.as explained,our review is deferential.we affirm the denial of attorneys fees because the trial court ruling was clearly correct and well within the bounds of its discretion.
the trial court here did not abuse its discretion in concluding that serrano i was a private dispute,not public interest litigation,notwithstanding our decision to publish serrano i did have,as plaintiffs characterize it a public effect.although it is a consequence of the principle of stare decisis that a legal doctrine established in a case involving a single litigant characteristically benefits all others similarly situated dawson,lawyers and involuntary clients in public interest litigation,the doctrine of stare decisis has never been viewed as sufficient justification for permitting an attorney to obtain fees from all those who may,in future cases,utilize a precedent he has helped to secure.citations.woodland hills,supra,cal d at.
at issue in serrano i was a private business disagreement between plaintiffs and coast the entire deposition reporting the fees one side of the arrangement sought to charge the other side for services provided in the course of a larger personal injury lawsuit.joshua,supra,cal th at.that private dispute raised an issue that resulted in a published appellate opinion.but,that dispute did not arise from an attempt to curtail any conduct on the part of coast that was infringing a statutory or public right or violating a constitutional principal.indeed,as we noted twice in serrano i,coast waived its fees and delivered all of the deposition transcripts to plaintiffs pending the trial court determination of the reasonableness of the expedited service fee.serrano i,supra,th at.coast merely raised the argument that it,not the trial court,had the right to regulate the fees it charged.although the dispute in serrano i happened to result in legal precedent,and even though we happened to request amici briefs,serrano i did not transform this private disagreement over an invoice into public interest litigation because coast was not purporting to represent the public and its conduct addressed in our opinion had not been impairing the statutory or constitutional rights of the public or even a large or significant class of people.joshua,supra,at woodland hills,supra,cal d at.indeed,our opinion in serrano i did not pronounce a rule that all expedition fees are unreasonable we merely clarified that the trial court had the power and discretion to determine the reasonableness of the particular fee that coast was charging plaintiffs in this specific case.serrano i,supra,at.the proceeding in serrano i settled only plaintiffs and coast private rights.accordingly,the trial court acted within the bounds of reason in denying plaintiffs attorneys fees request.the trial court determination that serrano i did not result in enforcement of an important public right is entitled to deference and is easily upheld.
under our independent analysis,serrano i was not public interest litigation for purposes of section as explicated by joshua 
we may determine de novo whether our own opinion enforced a legal right that meets the criteria of section.serrano i did not result in the clarification or enforcement of an important public right or a constitutional principle as described by joshua s.this court earlier decision in serrano i did not create new law or extend existing law.our opinion merely reiterated the state of statutory authority code civ,subd.c,subd.a,which empowers trial courts to regulate deposition fees.nor did our opinion pronounce a new principle.trial courts have long had the inherent power generally to control the conduct of ministerial officers and others connected with judicial proceedings.code civ.the trial court in serrano i misunderstood its power and believed itself constrained by urban pacific equities superior court,supra,th.serrano i gave guidance by disagreeing with urban and explicating the court power.therefore,we merely corrected a error by a trial court that had mistakenly believed it lacked the authority to limit court reporter fees,with the result that serrano i did not enforce fundamental public right or constitutional principle that was being infringed by coast 
for these reasons,we reject plaintiffs contention that,unlike joshua,this case implicate s ongoing adverse impact to the public.although vague,it appears that plaintiffs also argue that the trial court misread joshua and ignored plaintiffs mixed motives both to protect their own rights and to vindicate a public right.however,a similar argument,namely,that the attorney was motivated to defend a public right,was not successful in joshua cal th at.moreover,we review a trial court actual ruling,not its reasons punsly ho,supra.at,and plaintiffs have not persuaded us that the trial court was clearly wrong.joshua is on point as it discusses what sort of action gives rise to public interest litigation such as would justify the imposition of fees against the losing party.that case is not limited to adoptions.
to summarize,the trial court determination that serrano i was private litigation and did not result in the enforcement of an important public right is entitled to deference and is handily affirmed.our independent review of our own opinion confirms the trial court conclusion that serrano i was not public interest litigation.as we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying plaintiffs private attorney general fees because plaintiffs had failed to show the first element of the section test county of colusa california wildlife conservation,supra,th at,we need not address plaintiffs contentions touching on the remaining elements of the test.
disposition 
the order is affirmed.respondent to recover costs of appeal.
i respectfully dissent.
i believe the trial court read the supreme court opinion in adoption of joshua cal th joshua too broadly,and our prior opinion in serrano stefan merli plastering,th serrano i too narrowly.an award of attorney fees under code of civil procedure section section is not inappropriate in this case.therefore,i would reverse.
we held in serrano i that the court in a pending action has the authority to require a deposition reporter to provide a copy of a transcript to a party for a reasonable fee.this is so because a deposition reporter acting,as coast did,as a deposition officer,is a ministerial officer of the court.serrano i,supra,th at.
a deposition must be conducted under the supervision of a deposition officer who is authorized to administer an oath.code civ.the deposition testimony must be recorded stenographically,unless the parties agree or the court orders otherwise.code civ.in this case,coast followed the common practice of acting as both deposition officer and certified shorthand reporter.serrano i,supra,th at.the code of civil procedure imposes certain obligations of and objectivity on deposition officers.code civ.in addition,code of civil procedure section,subdivision a provides,in pertinent part,unless the court issues an order to the contrary,a copy of the transcript of the deposition testimony made by,or at the direction of,any party,if still in the possession of the deposition officer,shall be made available by the deposition officer to any person requesting a copy,on payment of a reasonable charge set by the deposition officer.
in this case,coast violated its statutory duty as a deposition officer by refusing to deliver copies of its transcripts without payment of an unreasonable fee thus,serrano i did not resolve a mere dispute between private parties regarding the reasonableness of a fee,but a dispute between a party to a litigation in the california courts and the deposition officer who was undermining that party ability to prepare for trial by violating its own statutory duties.
in joshua,the supreme court concluded that section fees are not appropriately awarded against a party who only engaged in litigation to adjudicate private rights from which important appellate precedent happens to emerge,but has otherwise done nothing to compromise the rights of the public or a significant class of people.joshua,supra,cal th at.the court reasoned that the unspoken justification for section fees is that it is equitable to impose public interest attorney fees on parties that have done something to adversely affect the public interest,and that this requires something more than merely prosecuting or defending a lawsuit.ibid.
the court also recognized that,as a general rule,in cases where section fees have been awarded,the litigation obtained a substantial benefit by causing a change in the defendant behavior,whose actions or failure to act was somehow impairing the statutory or constitutional rights of the public or a significant class of people.id.at.the court then identified many of these prior cases in a lengthy footnote.id.at,fn.these cases included litigation against private defendants,where the only wrongdoing by the defendants was against their own customers,colgan leatherman tool group,th,corporation labelled its products in violation of the false advertising law beasley wells fargo bank d,disapproved on other grounds by olson automobile club of southern california cal th bank improperly assessed fees against its credit card customers who failed to make timely payments or exceeded their c
