plaintiffs appeal from an order of the court of federal claims awarding them attorney fees under the fee shifting provisions of the uniform relocation assistance and real property act of,c.plaintiffs counsel asserts that the court of federal claims erred when it made a number of reductions to its requested fee award.also pending before this court are plaintiffs motion to supplement the record and plaintiffs motion to order payment of the uncontested attorney fee amount.for reasons discussed below,plaintiffs motion to supplement the record is denied,and the judgment of the court of federal claims is affirmed.because we affirm the judgment below,plaintiffs motion for payment of uncontested attorney fees is denied as moot.
background 
in,thirteen kansas landowners brought suit in the court of federal claims against the united states.plaintiffs alleged that the government had taken their land without just compensation in violation of the fifth amendment after the conversion of a rail corridor to a trail under the national trail systems act,d.the cases were consolidated the following year.
five years later,the parties for summary judgment on the issue of liability.the court of federal claims granted summary judgment in favor of the united states concerning the claims of five plaintiffs and dismissed those claims the court of federal claims then certified questions to the kansas supreme court concerning the scope of railroad easements in kansas.on september,after briefing and holding oral argument on the certified questions,the kansas supreme court determined that it lacked jurisdiction to accept certified questions from the court of federal claims and dismissed the case.
the remaining plaintiffs subsequently refiled their motion for summary judgment on the issue of liability with the court of federal claims.on june,the court of federal claims granted plaintiffs motion.after the court of federal claims issued its opinion,plaintiffs counsel counsel requested attorney fees under the uniform relocation assistance and real property act of,c.in response,the court of federal claims instructed counsel to file a motion for partial summary judgment to determine the method by which the attorney fee award would be calculated.
in its submission,counsel requested that the court of federal claims apply the national rate charged by its firm for all work completed at the prevailing market rate.according to counsel,the use of current,rather than historical,rates was based on the contingent nature of the representation,where payment does not take place until successful completion of the case.in its contingent fee agreement with clients,counsel explained that fees were ordinarily paid when they are accrued,usually on a monthly basis.however,the use of rates in effect at the end of the case,rather than the rates in effect when the work took place,would be used based on the risk that there will be no recovery and that,if a recovery is awarded,the firm may not be reimbursed for the expenses until some time in the future.
on november,the court of federal claims issued an opinion on the requested summary judgment motion.in its opinion,the court of federal claims determined that it would calculate attorney fees using the lodestar method,where a reasonable number of hours expended is multiplied by the prevailing rate in the relevant community.the court of federal claims then determined that,for purposes of the case,the hourly rate for work primarily done in louis would be based on the prevailing market rate in louis,missouri.the court of federal claims noted that,at that time,it could not,without further evidence,rule on specific reasonable rates for louis.the court of federal claims also determined that,due to the rule,historical rates,rather than rates in force at the end of litigation,would be used to compute a final award.see library of congress shaw,d.
counsel subsequently moved for summary judgment requesting in attorney fees and in costs.counsel based its fee request,in part,on rates in effect in the washington metropolitan area at the time of its request based on the kavanaugh matrix,an alternative to the adjusted laffey matrix maintained by the united states attorney office counsel did not submit any evidence regarding the computation of rates for the louis area.the government for summary judgment on the issue of the appropriate hourly rate.
on january,the court of federal claims issued its opinion on attorney fees and costs.in determining the appropriate number of hours,the court of federal claims made a number of adjustments.specifically,the court of federal claims found that some the of hours spent on the argument before the kansas supreme court were duplicative,and that the number of hours spent on calculating the attorney fees and costs were excessive.consequently,the court of federal claims reduced the number of hours spent on those tasks by approximately and,respectively.
in addition,in order to avoid compensating counsel for work done on claims which had been dismissed,the court of federal claims reduced the number of hours expended on the litigation leading up to the first summary judgment motion by.the court of federal claims noted that it made this reduction r ecognizing the validity of plaintiffs contention that there were overlapping issues between the successful and unsuccessful plaintiffs.viewing the number of hours expended on the remainder of the litigation to be excessive,the court of federal claims further reduced those hours by.
to determine the appropriate billing rate,the court of federal claims held that two distinct rates should apply.for hours expended from the commencement of litigation until,when plaintiffs lead counsel was affiliated with a louis law firm,local louis rates should apply.for the period after,when plaintiffs lead counsel moved to a law firm based in washington,local washington rates would apply.the court of federal claims determined that,at that time,there was ample evidence to determine a louis rate and used a rate based on four attorney fee awards by district courts in the eastern district of missouri.for work taking place in washington,the court of federal claims used the adjusted laffey matrix rate,noting that this rate had been used in awarding attorney fees to counsel firm in two other district court litigations.
in addition to making reductions to the requested billing rate and the number of hours,the court of federal claims made a reduction to costs incurred before the summary judgment motion to account for expenses incurred on the unsuccessful claims.
on january,six days after the court of federal claims issued its attorney fee order,counsel submitted a request under the freedom of information act foia,to obtain the government time entry records and costs regarding distinct cases,including the instant cases.counsel also filed a motion for reconsideration with the court of federal claims on february.the motion made no reference to the foia request.the court of federal claims denied the motion on april.
counsel timely brought this appeal challenging a number of cuts made by the court of federal claims.on september,after the appeal was filed,the government responded to counsels foia request and provided its time summaries for the instant cases.shortly thereafter,counsel moved to supplement the record with this new information.

discussion 
we review the court of federal claims attorney fee determination for an abuse of discretion.haggart woodley.we review its underlying legal conclusions de novo.id.an abuse of discretion exists when the trial court decision is clearly unreasonable,arbitrary or fanciful,or is based on clearly erroneous findings of fact or erroneous conclusions of law.lazare kaplan int l,photoscribe,internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
though a trial court has discretion in determining a fee award,it must provide a concise but clear explanation of its reasons for the fee award.hensley eckerhart,d.a fee award that is determined through the use of a lodestar calculation carries a strong presumption that it represents a reasonable attorney fee.bywaters united states,citing city of burlington dague,d.departures from the lodestar figure,once calculated,must be supported by specific evidence justifying the award.perdue kenny ex rel.winn,d.ultimately,a fee award must be adequate to attract competent counsel,but must not produce windfalls to attorneys.hensley,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
as a threshold issue,we must decide whether to grant counsel motion to supplement the record.in general,an appellate court review is limited to the record presented at the court below.see.valley floral grp.shaw rose nets,llc.however,we do have authority to supplement the record in rare instances,should the circumstances of the case require it.see id.citing dickerson alabama,cir.
counsel argues that supplementing the record would be in the interests of justice because the government records for the instant cases are relevant to the reasonableness of the fees requested.counsel also asserts that the records were not available earlier because the government did not respond to the foia request until the appeal was pending,and twenty months after counsel made its first request.consequently,counsel was unable to provide this information to the court of federal claims.
under foia,a government agency must provide an initial response to a request within twenty days of receipt.a a i.there is no dispute that the government response to the initial request was not timely.however,the initial request was made after the court of federal claims issued its initial attorney fee determination.
though counsel is correct that it filed the foia request before the court of federal claims opinion on attorney fees was made final,the timing of the request indicates that the court of federal claims would not have been in a position to consider the documents in deciding the attorney fee request,even if the government had immediately responded.
had the government responded immediately,counsel request to the court of federal claims to consider the government records would necessarily have been part of its motion for reconsideration.such motions are governed by rule a,under rule a,a court,in its discretion,may grant a motion for reconsideration when there has been an intervening change in the controlling law,newly discovered evidence,or a need to correct clear factual or legal error or prevent manifest injustice.young united states.a motion for reconsideration must also be supported by a showing of extraordinary circumstances which justify relief.caldwell united states,internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
counsel has presented arguments as to why this information was unavailable between january,when it initially filed its foia request,and september,when it received the relevant documents from the government.however,counsel has not adequately explained why it did not seek this information sooner.notably,counsel motion for reconsideration before the court of federal claims did not even make reference to its foia request.
if,as counsel argues,this information was relevant to the determination of a reasonable number of hours,the foia request should have been filed before the initial attorney fee motion,not after the motion had been decided.under these circumstances,even if counsel had been able to present this new evidence to the court of federal claims when it filed its motion for reconsideration,the court of federal claims would have been within its discretion to deny the motion.
in sum,the information could have been requested in a timely manner in order to influence the underlying decision.because counsel submission is based on a request that took place after the court of federal claims fee order,there is no basis to grant counsel motion to supplement the record.
with regards to the merits of the fee award,counsel challenges the cuts made based on work done on behalf of the unsuccessful plaintiffs,the court of federal claims use of the adjusted laffey matrix,the use of historical rates,its determination of the standard louis hourly rate,and reductions to the work done for the kansas supreme court argument and fee motions.
counsel argues that the court of federal claims erred when it reduced the number of hours and costs awarded by to take into account work done on behalf of the unsuccessful plaintiffs.counsel characterizes this reduction as an overall adjustment to the lodestar figure that must be supported by specific evidence under perdue.
counsel characterization of the reduction is incorrect.the court of federal claims did not make an overall reduction of the final award,but,rather,an overall reduction in the number of hours.though the end result may be mathematically identical,the factors a court takes into account are different,depending on which aspect of the award is under consideration.t he lodestar figure includes most,if not all,of the relevant factors constituting a reasonable attorney fee pennsylvania.valley citizens council for clean air,d.these factors include the measure of success achieved by a party.see id.at.
there is no dispute that work done on behalf of the unsuccessful plaintiffs is not recoverable.hours that are not properly billed to one client are also not properly billed to one adversary pursuant to statutory authority.hensley,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.when multiple claims are brought in a single litigation and involve common questions of law,it may be difficult,if not impossible,to separate out the hours expended on each claim.however,contrary to counsel assertion,this does not compel the conclusion that all work involved is always compensable.a fee award is subject to a court discretion and a court may attempt to identify specific hours that should be eliminated,or it may simply reduce the award to account for the limited success.id.at.
though a court may reduce an award,it should not do so in a rigid,mechanical way.hubbard united states.here,the court of federal claims did not simply reduce the number of hours based on the number of successful claims but instead came to a reduction after r ecognizing the validity of plaintiffs contention that there were overlapping issues between the successful and unsuccessful plaintiffs.this reduction,based on the degree of success obtained,was within the court of federal claims discretion.
therefore,the court of federal claims did not abuse its discretion when it reduced the hours and costs by in order to take into account work done on behalf of the unsuccessful plaintiffs.
counsel argues that the court of federal claims abused its discretion by not applying the kavanaugh matrix and instead applying the lower adjusted laffey matrix.
in laffey northwest airlines,the district court for the district of columbia set out a matrix of reasonable rates for attorneys in the washington,metropolitan area who were engaged in complex federal litigation at that time.see,aff in part,rev in part,overruled by save our cumberland mountains,hodel,en banc.this matrix of fees has become known as the laffey matrix and its use has been expressly endorsed by the court of appeals for the circuit as a useful starting point for computing attorney fees.see covington district of columbia.we have not had occasion to determine whether the laffey matrix is an appropriate starting point for fee awards,but have acknowledged its use by the court of federal claims.see bywaters,at see also rodriguez sec y of health human,distinguishing vaccine act cases from complex litigation described in laffey.
because the matrix proposed by laffey was based on prevailing market rates for a single point in time,courts have found it necessary to determine similar matrices for other years using the laffey rates as a starting point.see save our cumberland mountains,at.to this end,two competing approaches have been applied by district courts and the court of federal claims.
the first approach is for courts to use the adjusted laffey matrix which is maintained by the united states attorney office.see,rooths district of columbia,d,first fed.sav.loan of rochester united states.adjustments to this version of the matrix are based on changes to the cost of living in the
