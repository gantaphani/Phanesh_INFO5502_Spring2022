martha charnay appeals from the judgment entered after the trial court sustained without leave to amend a demurrer filed by charnay former attorney,joseph cobert,and his law firm,joseph cobert,a professional corporation the cobert firm,to charnay fourth amended complaint for professional malpractice,breach of fiduciary duty,breach of contract,fraud and negligent misrepresentation.because each cause of action is adequately pleaded,we reverse.
factual and procedural background 
charnay dispute with her neighbors 
in charnay and her husband,david charnay,purchased approximately two and acres of a tract in calabasas subject to certain conditions,covenants and restrictions cc rs.the tract had been subdivided in the into four lots three improved lots and one large unimproved lot.richard and pamela aronoff purchased the unimproved lot in.after land subsidence damaged a sloped portion of the tract directly impacting the aronoffs lot and extending to the primary private road through the tract,the aronoffs demanded each of the neighbors pay of the cost to repair the slope,relying on language in the cc rs they claimed required contribution when the expenditure for slope repair was for the benefit of the entire subdivision the charnays refused the aronoffs demand for payment,claiming the cc rs did not require their contribution.
the underlying lawsuit 
the aronoffs sued the charnays in october,seeking to recover from the charnays in a limited civil action.the aronoffs also sought prejudgment interest and attorney fees incurred in prosecuting the action pursuant to a provision in the cc rs the charnays,who were unsophisticated in legal matters,retained cobert to represent them in connection with the aronoffs lawsuit 
the retainer agreement with the cobert firm 
according to the written retainer agreement between the cobert firm and the charnays,attached as an exhibit to the operative fourth amended complaint,the cobert firm agreed to provide legal services to the charnays on a time and charge basis.the agreement specifically states,no guarantees of any specific results can be made and our fee is not contingent upon any specific results.the retainer agreement also provides the charnays would be billed monthly and,if the cobert firm did not receive any billing inquiry from the charnays within days after the billing statement had been sent,the firm would assume the charnays did not dispute the billing statement accuracy 
the cobert firm representation of the charnays 
according to charnay,cobert initially recommended the charnays settle the aronoffs action however,when cobert learned during his initial meeting with the charnays that they had other unresolved issues with other tract owners,cobert,recognizing an opportunity to generate significant attorney fees,changed his recommendation and suggested the charnays vigorously defend the lawsuit and pursue a for declaratory relief,reformation,breach of fiduciary duty and indemnity against the aronoffs and other neighbors in the tract.believing they had a meritorious defense to the aronoffs lawsuit and a meritorious,the charnays followed cobert advice and authorized cobert and the cobert firm to defend rather than settle the action and file the against each of their neighbors.the charnays elicited a separate by the charnays neighbors to recover homeowners assessments that had been withheld by the charnays.cobert did not tell the charnays of their potential exposure to liability for the opposing parties attorney fees if they did not prevail in the action.
the underlying judgment and attorney fee award 
after lengthy discovery,unsuccessful summary judgment motions and a bench trial,the trial court entered a judgment against the charnays on the aronoffs complaint,the neighbors and the charnays.charnay was ordered to pay as repair costs to the aronoffs,in unpaid homeowner assessments that she alleges cobert advised her to withhold during the lawsuit and the aggregate sum of for the opposing parties attorney fees pursuant to the provision in the cc rs.for their part,cobert and the cobert firm billed charnay more than for services provided in connection with the underlying action.
the instant action 
a.the legal malpractice claim 
the first cause of action for professional negligence in the operative fourth amended complaint alleged cobert and the cobert firm breached their duty of care by advising charnay to defend rather than settle the aronoffs action and to file a separate action against the other neighbors concerning the charnays right to withhold homeowners assessments.cobert proffered this advice knowing that both actions could expose the charnays to liability for attorney fees far in excess of the at issue in the aronoffs lawsuit,but did not inform the charnays of that possibility.according to charnay,but for cobert negligence,misrepresentations and omissions,she would have been able to settle the aronoffs lawsuit for no more than,the maximum recovery available in the limited civil action.instead,as a result of cobert breach of duty,a judgment was entered against her for more than.to satisfy the judgment and her own approximately attorney fee obligation,charnay was forced to deplete her personal savings and retirement income and sell her home.had charnay been advised of the consequences of not prevailing,including the risk of being held liable for the opposing parties attorney fees were she to lose at trial,she would not have acceded to cobert advice to go forward with the litigation and would not have continued with the litigation in the face of escalating litigation costs on both sides.
breach of fiduciary duty 
in her second cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty,charnay alleged cobert and his firm breached their fiduciary duties by billing for tasks never performed,billing at cobert billing rate for tasks performed by his secretaries and office assistants and assuring charnay she would recover all of her attorney fees in the action 
breach of contract 
in her third cause of action for breach of contract,charnay alleged she and cobert orally modified the november written retainer agreement in march when cobert agreed not to require payment for any legal bills until the conclusion of the litigation.other than that modification,the november retainer agreement,with its corresponding billing rates therein outlined,remained unchanged.charnay alleges cobert breached the retainer agreement by inflating the bills and billing for tasks at his billing rate that were never performed or were performed by others with much lower billing rates than those charged.
fraud and negligent misrepresentation 
in her fourth cause of action for fraud and deceit and her fifth cause of action for negligent misrepresentation,charnay alleged she had repeatedly expressed her concerns to cobert about the escalating costs in connection with the litigation and continued to pursue the litigation only because cobert had repeatedly assured her the opposing parties could not prevail and she would recover all her attorney fees from the opposing parties at the end of the litigation.according to charnay,cobert made this representation even though he knew or should have known there was a substantial probability charnay would not prevail on any of the claims in the underlying action and she would be liable for the opposing parties fees as well as her own.charnay alleged cobert made these representations specifically to induce her to continue with the litigation so that he could continue to generate attorney fees.
the demurrer 
cobert and the cobert firm filed a demurrer to the fourth amended complaint and successfully requested over charnay objection the court take judicial notice of the cc rs recorded in the official records of the los angeles county recorders office.the trial court sustained the demurrer to the fourth amended complaint without leave to amend,concluding each of the claims was legally deficient and entered judgment against charnay.

the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer 
charnay adequately stated a claim for legal malpractice 
to state a cause of action for legal malpractice,a plaintiff must plead the duty of the attorney to use such skill,prudence,and diligence as members of his or her profession commonly possess and exercise a breach of that duty a proximate causal connection between the breach and the resulting injury and actual loss or damage resulting from the attorney negligence.coscia mckenna cuneo cal th,d.to show damages proximately caused by the breach,the plaintiff must allege facts establishing that,but for the alleged malpractice,it is more likely than not the plaintiff would have obtained a more favorable result.viner sweet cal th,d,judicial council of cal.civ.jury instns.caci plaintiff must prove he or she would have obtained a better result if defendant had acted as a reasonably careful attorney.
in the instant case,charnay alleged she retained cobert and the cobert firm to assist her in understanding her rights and obligations under the cc rs and to advise her in connection with the aronoffs lawsuit.she alleges cobert breached his duty of care to her by failing to properly advise her of her obligation to contribute to the slope repair and to pay homeowner assessments required under the cc rs and,most particularly,to advise her of her potential exposure to the opposing parties attorney fees if she did not prevail in the aronoffs action or her.as for damages,she alleges that,had she been properly advised,she would have settled the lawsuit for no more than the maximum amount recoverable in a limited civil action,far less than the judgment exclusive of interest entered against her at the end of the protracted litigation.
in ruling that charnay had not alleged damages proximately caused by the breach,the trial court reasoned the fourth amended complaint failed to include facts showing the aronoffs would have agreed to such a settlement.and,according to the trial court,absent such allegations,any suggestion that charnay would have received a more favorable outcome but for cobert breach is too speculative to state a claim.see thompson halvonik th,d thompson absent evidence that vesper would have settled with respondents under exactly the same circumstances it settled with the padway firm,actual harm from respondents conduct is only a subject of surmise,given the myriad of variables that affect settlements of medical malpractice actions marshak ballesteros th,d marshak p laintiff simply alleges that the case was worth more than he settled it for.he proffered no evidence to establish the value of his case,other than his own declaration that the family residence was worth more,and the accounts receivable were worth less,than they were valued at for the purposes of settlement.even if he were able to prove this,however,he would not prevail.for he must also prove that his would have settled for less than she did,or that,following trial,a judge would have entered judgment more favorable than that to which he stipulated.
in contrast to thompson,supra,th,d and marshak,supra,th,d,both decided on summary judgment,this is not a case where the allegations of the likelihood of settlement or the settlement amount are too speculative,at least to state a claim at this early stage of the proceedings.charnay adequately alleged she was prepared to resolve the action and that,but for the advice of counsel to defend the action and file a against the neighbors generating a by them against her,the aronoffs action would have been resolved for or less.contrary to cobert argument adopted by the trial court in sustaining the demurrer,charnay need not expressly allege the aronoffs would have accepted such a settlement implicit in the allegation that the case could have been settled for the maximum amount recoverable in a limited civil action is that,having filed a lawsuit seeking less than,the aronoffs,at least at an early step of the litigation before they had incurred significant attorney fees,would have been willing to settle the case at or near the level alternatively,resolution of the case for an amount close to could have been achieved,even without the aronoffs consent,by allowing a default judgment to be entered against the charnays.finally,as charnay argued in the hearing on demurrer,whether the charnays could have settled the matter for the figure alleged as opposed to some greater amount inclusive of additional attorney fees is immaterial.charnay need only allege that,but for cobert malpractice,she would have obtained a more favorable result than the judgment ultimately rendered against her.viner sweet,supra,cal th at,d.of course,whether charnay will be able to prove the element of damages or any of the other elements of her legal malpractice cause of action remains to be determined.at this stage of the proceedings,however,charnay has alleged facts sufficient to state a professional negligence claim.
as an alternative basis for sustaining the demurrer to her legal malpractice cause of action,the trial court ruled the cc rs put charnay on constructive notice of her obligation to pay the opposing parties attorney fees in any action arising under the cc rs.because she was on notice of her potential liability for the opposing parties attorney fees,the court reasoned,she can claim no damages proximately caused by cobert failure to advise her of that possibility,notwithstanding her allegation that she relied on cobert advice regarding her rights and liabilities under the cc rs.in reaching this conclusion,the trial court erroneously relied on cases holding,when a person enters into an unambiguous written agreement,he or she is presumed to understand it as a matter of law and is estopped from claiming otherwise,jefferson department of youth authority cal th,d,jefferson the general rule is that when a person with the capacity of reading and understanding an instrument signs it,he is,in the absence of fraud and imposition,bound by its contents,and is estopped from saying that its provisions are contrary to his intentions or understanding.palmquist mercer cal d,palmquist same.
jefferson,supra,cal th,d,and palmquist,supra,cal d,specifically address disputes between contracting parties.both cases hold a contracting party is legally estopped from circumventing the agreement by declaring the contract objective terms do not coincide with his or her subjective intention.neither case has any application to a legal malpractice action in which a party to a contract alleges she retained a lawyer for the specific purpose of advising her with respect to the meaning of the agreement and asserts she was thereafter damaged by the lawyer negligent advice.whatever the ultimate merit of her malpractice claim,charnay plainly is not estopped from alleging she relied on her lawyer expertise and advice in interpreting her rights and obligations under the cc rs.see,neel magana,olney,levy,cathcart gelfand cal d,classic legal malpractice action involves an attorney alleged failure to apply his or her specialized skills and knowledge to a particular set of facts or circumstances.
charnay adequately stated a claim for breach of fiduciary duty 
to establish a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty,a plaintiff must demonstrate the existence of a fiduciary relationship,breach of that duty and damages.benasra mitchell silberberg knupp llp th,d pierce lyman th,d.charnay alleges cobert breached his fiduciary duty by billing for tasks not performed and by billing at an inflated rate.although,as the trial court found,the retainer agreement on its face may not have been substantively unconscionable,by alleging cobert and his firm improperly inflated the billings sent to charnay by including tasks not performed and incorrectly using higher hourly rates than justified,charnay has adequately pleaded a claim for breach of fiduciary duty.see bird,marella,boxer wolpert superior court th,d client who alleged former defense counsel fraudulently inflated his charges stated breach of fiduciary duty claim all members of the bar owe clients fiduciary duty to charge only fair,reasonable and conscionable fees.
in ruling charnay had not adequately pleaded a breach of fiduciary duty claim,the trial court emphasized the retainer agreement required charnay to dispute the legal bills within days of receipt.because charnay did not allege she had fulfilled this contractual condition precedent for challenging the bills,the trial court concluded she could not state a claim for breach of fiduciary duty as a matter of law.the trial court reliance on the notice provision in the retainer agreement is unsound if cobert breached his fiduciary duty by fraudulently billing charnay for services not performed at all or by using inflated rates for services performed by others,charnay failure to comply with the contractual notice provision does not immunize that breach,which is based on a duty arising from the relationship itself and not the retainer agreement 
in any event,the trial court recognition of the notice provision in the retainer agreement as a defense to a claim for breach of fiduciary duty or to charnay claim for breach of contract,for that matter suffers from multiple defects.first,as written,the notice provision does not purport to limit charnay right to file a lawsuit challenging the fee statements if she fails to meet the requirement rather,it simply provides that the cobert firm shall assume the statement is accurate as presented if no timely objection is made.
second,if the notice provision were interpreted to be an agreement to shorten the applicable limitations period,it would be unreasonable as a matter of law and thus unenforceable.under california law parties may agree to a provision shortening the statute of limitations,qualified,however,by the requirement that the period fixed is not in itself unreasonable or is not so unreasonable as to show imposition or undue advantage.citations.capehart heady d.see beeson schloss cal,hambrecht quist venture partners american medical,th,d.when,as in this case,defendants have demurred to the complaint based on a contractual limitations period,the real question to be determined here is whether the allegations of the complaint show that the limitation is unreasonable the question is one of law,namely,is the period of limitation,in itself,unreasonable.citation.capehart,at.whatever the outside limit may be for shortening a limitations period see,tebbets fidelity casualty cal,holding on demurrer that six month contractual limitations period was not unreasonable,we have no doubt requiring a client to assert a claim for breach of contract against her attorney within days of receipt of a billing statement is inherently unreasonable.
third,as we held in moreno sanchez th,d,a contractually shortened limitations period has never been recognized outside the context of straightforward transactions in which the triggering event for either a breach of a contract or for the accrual of a right is immediate and obvious.moreover,no decision upholding the validity of a contractually shortened limitation period has done so in the context of an action against a professional or skilled expert where breach of a duty is more difficult to detect.instead,most reported decisions upholding shortened periods involve straightforward commercial contracts plus the unambiguous breaches or accrual of rights under those contracts.
finally,enforcement of the notice provision in the manner suggested by the trial court would abrogate the delayed discovery rule applicable to actions asserting breach of fiduciary duty see april enterprises,kttv d.it is that the delayed discovery rule applies to causes of action involving breach of a fiduciary relationship neel magana,olney,levy,cathcart gelfand,supra,cal d at,an action for professional malpractice,for example,typically involves the professional failure to apply his or her specialized skills and knowledge corollary to this expertise is the inability of the layman to detect its misapplication the client may not recognize the negligence of the professional when he sees it.code civ,delayed discovery rule applies to legal malpractice actions.as we have explained in moreno sanchez,supra,th at pages,d to,the delayed discovery rule is founded on important public policy considerations contractual efforts to eviscerate the delayed discovery rule are thus void as against public policy.accordingly,even if the notice provision were otherwise applicable as a potential defense to charnay breach of fiduciary duty claim,it would have been error for the trial court not to grant her leave to amend to allege when she discovered the alleged improper billing practices.
charnay adequately stated claims for intentional fraud and negligent misrepresentation 
the elements of fraud are a misrepresentation false representation,concealment,or nondisclosure b knowledge of falsity or scienter c intent to defraud,to induce reliance d justifiable reliance and e resulting damage.lazar superior court cal th,d,see also agricultural ins.superior court th,d.the elements of negligent misrepresentation are similar to intentional fraud except for the requirement of scienter in a claim for negligent misrepresentation,the plaintiff need not allege the defendant made an intentionally false statement,but simply one as to which he or she lacked any reasonable ground for believing the statement to be true.bily arthur young cal th,d,see also alliance mortgage rothwell cal th,fn,d,negligent misrepresentation is a species of the tort of deceit and like fraud,requires a misrepresentation,justifiable reliance and damage.
charnay alleged at specifically identified times following her execution of the retainer agreement she confronted cobert about the escalating attorney fees and costs she had incurred in this limited civil action and inquired whether it was worth continuing to litigate the matter.according to charnay,cobert assured her on each of these specified occasions that she need not be concerned about the mounting attorney fees because she would definitely prevail and recover those fees from the opposing parties at the end of the action.charnay alleged cobert made these representations knowing they were false because he did not believe,and indeed there was no reasonable basis to believe,charnay could prevail in the action.as a result of cobert misrepresentations,she continued to vigorously litigate the matter and incurred additional attorney fee obligations,both her own and ultimately the opposing parties.in addition,charnay alleged cobert engaged in fraudulent billing practices,including billing for tasks not performed.
plainly,as we have explained,the allegations relating to fraudulent billing practices are sufficient to withstand demurrer and the trial court reliance on charnay purported failure to adhere to the notice provision in the retainer agreement as an immunizing factor is error.the additional justifications proffered by the trial court for rejecting her fraud claim are also erroneous.for example,cobert argued and the trial court agreed that,in light of the plain and unambiguous no guarantees clause in the retainer agreement,and the additional clause requiring any modificatio
