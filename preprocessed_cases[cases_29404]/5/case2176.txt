after an unsatisfactory,but not quite,a laborde sued his wife former attorney,evan ginsburg,and susan aronson,the psychologist retained to conduct a custody evaluation in his marital dissolution proceeding.the complaint alleges breach of contract,malpractice,defamation,conspiracy to defame,invasion of privacy,conversion,interference with contract,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and injunctive relief.aronson prevailed on a motion for summary judgment and the action against ginsburg was dismissed with prejudice in the face of the same summary judgment motion.the trial court awarded each defendant sanctions pursuant to code of civil procedure section.laborde contests the judgments and the sanction award,but we find no error save our own,and therefore affirm.
at some point in the course of the laborde marital dissolution proceedings,the attorneys handling the matter agreed to retain aronson as an evidence code section evaluator laborde agreed to advance the costs subject to a court ruling apportioning her fees.evan ginsburg,the attorney representing laborde,mailed a confirming letter stating the evaluator would prepare an opinion and testify in court if necessary.
laborde attorney,michael wolf,requested aronson to prepare an evidence code section evaluation report.the doctor interviewed various family members,prepared an evaluation,and discussed the results with the parties.because the results were not what he had hoped,laborde directed another attorney,riordan zavala,to write aronson a letter advising her she would be sued if she testified in the family law matter.laborde also refused to pay aronson fees,forcing his to pick up the tab.aronson,in turn,forwarded zavala letter to the presiding judge of the family law court,indicating her understanding that laborde and attorney zavala threatening an independent witness regarding her testifying is a felony.
while the family law case was still pending,laborde filed a complaint naming attorney ginsburg and aronson as defendants.the case against ginsburg and his law firm,was based on their representation of laborde wife in the pending dissolution matter.in the fourth cause of action,laborde alleged ginsburg and aronson conspired to defame laborde by planning and scheming to send a letter to the presiding judge at the family law division of the superior court of t he county of orange,wherein it was falsely asserted plaintiff had threatened a witness in violation of the p enal c ode 
both defendants asserted the litigation privilege,in their demurrers to the complaint.declining the invitation to enter into a series of pleadings skirmishes,the court overruled the demurrers and encouraged the defendants to raise the civil code section privilege in the context of a motion for summary judgment.the court tentative ruling specifically cautioned laborde and zavala they should take no solace in these rulings but it is strongly recommended they take notice of kaufman superior court may,opinion ordered nonpublished august,and code of civil procedure section.
in the interim,aronson was declared the court expert witness in the marital dissolution action,and her report and recommendations regarding child custody and visitation issues were received into evidence.the court also found an intimidation of the mental health expert witness,aronson,who was ultimately declared the court expert,per the zavala letter.attorney zavala was an agent of laborde.
both defendants moved for summary judgment adjudication of issues,and requested sanctions under code of civil procedure section.in his motion,ginsburg advised laborde the request for sanctions would be withdrawn if the complaint was withdrawn within the next days.
laborde did not oppose ginsburg summary judgment motion,opting instead to file a request for dismissal of his complaint without prejudice.the court ordered the request withdrawn and dismissed the action with prejudice as to ginsburg and his firm.the court also granted aronson motion for summary judgment,based on the litigation privilege.
as to the code of civil procedure section motions,the court awarded aronson in sanctions against laborde and his attorney,zavala,contingent upon the court approval of billing information which is to be provided to the court the court also granted ginsburg motion and awarded some in sanctions against attorney and client,finding the action was frivolous and without merit and with bad faith 
laborde first challenges the order granting aronson motion for summary judgment.he contends his suit fell within an exception to the litigation privilege,and should have been allowed to proceed.we conclude the trial court correctly determined laborde claims were barred by the litigation privilege expressed in civil code section,subdivision b.
civil code section states a privileged publication or broadcast is one made b in any legislative proceeding,judicial proceeding,in any other official proceeding authorized by law the first amended complaint set forth eight different causes of action against aronson.in each instance,the conduct complained of was based on aronson appointment as an evidence code section evaluator and expert witness in the laborde divorce proceeding.the trial court ruled the litigation privilege applied and granted aronson immunity for her statements and conduct in the underlying family law case.the trial judge noted the family law court did not issue a formal order,nor was there a signed stipulation by the parties,but it is unequivocal that the parties to that action entered into an agreement to submit to and agreed to independent evaluation rather than retain their own experts on the issue of custody.only after aronson made her recommendations,did plaintiff raise this issue of exclusively retaining her as his expert.the agreement to jointly retain aronson had been consummated by that time.further,judge mandel then accepted her report as a expert by nunc pro tunc order at trial as a result,there are no triable issues of fact and aronson is entitled to immunity.
in evaluating this ruling,we find gootee lightner d.instructive.there,the plaintiff sued a psychologist for professional malpractice,alleging intentional and negligent conduct in the course of psychological testing and evaluation performed in conjunction with judicial proceedings indistinguishable from ours.the trial court granted a defense motion for summary judgment,based on the civil code section privilege,and the appellate court upheld it it is undisputed that defendants role was a limited one to evaluate the partisans in the custody matter for purposes of testifying concerning the custody dispute.because the gravamen of plaintiff claim relies on negligent or intentional tortious conduct committed by defendants in connection with the testimonial function,we conclude the absolute privilege bars civil lawsuits other than for malicious prosecution seeking to impose liability on defendants for such misfeasance.gootee lightner,supra,d at,fn.omitted.
similarly,in silberg anderson cal d,the parties to a dissolution proceeding retained an independent psychologist to evaluate the parties and submit recommendations on custody issues.displeased with the findings,the husband sued his wife attorney for failing to disclose a preexisting relationship with the psychologist,which allegedly resulted in the preparation of a biased and defamatory report.detailing the expansive nature of the privilege and its underlying rationale,the california supreme court held civil code section covers all tort claims based on negligent and intentional conduct.id.at.it applies to any communication,whether or not it amounts to a publication and it applies to any publication required or permitted by law in the course of a judicial proceeding to achieve the objects of the litigation,even though the publication is made outside the courtroom and no function of the court or its officers is involved.citations.id.at.
clearly,the basic rule contravenes laborde position.in his declaration in opposition to the motion,laborde attempted to raise a spoliation of evidence issue,claiming aronson tampered with a consent for release of medical records
