background 
the long,divisive history of this and related litigation over the waters of the truckee and carson rivers,and the decline of pyramid lake,is best reflected in nevada united states,d,and in several landmark opinions of this and other courts.see,pyramid lake paiute tribe of indians hodel,cir tribe hodel irrigation dist.sec y of dep t of interior,cir tcid secretary united states alpine land reservoir,cir pyramid lake paiute tribe of indians morton.tribe morton.congress had passed the reclamation act in,creating projects to reclaim otherwise arid western lands for farming.see reclamation act of,stat.one of the projects created by the reclamation act,the newlands project project,controls diversions from the truckee and carson rivers.the irrigation district tcid has managed the project under a contract with the federal government for decades.this particular case concerns the united states effort to recoup excess diversions tcid permitted over many years.
the nevada district court originally established the amount of water that could be diverted for agricultural uses from the truckee river in a order known as the orr ditch decree,equity no.the court did not issue a final order on rights to the carson until,in united states alpine land reservoir.alpine decree.
in the century,concerns grew over the adverse effect of the diversions on pyramid lake unique fish populations.see nevada,at noting surface area of pyramid lake decreased by acres between and.water from the truckee naturally flows to pyramid lake which is under the control of the pyramid lake paiute tribe the tribe.the secretary of the interior secretary responded to the concerns about pyramid lake fish in by imposing operating criteria and procedures ocaps limiting the maximum diversions from the truckee and carson.
unhappy with the ocaps as too generous to the farmers,the tribe successfully challenged them in the district of columbia.the district court in tribe morton.at,ordered the secretary to implement a more restrictive ocap.known as the ocap,it was challenged by tcid in this court.we upheld it in tcid secretary,at,yet tcid has refused to follow it.
in,congress stepped in to attempt a resolution of the ongoing dispute between the tribe and tcid by enacting the fallon paiute shoshone indian tribes water rights settlement act of,stat.settlement act.the settlement act,as relevant to this case,provides 
the secretary shall henceforth ensure compliance with all of the provisions of the operating criteria and procedures referenced in paragraph of this subsection or any applicable provision of any other operating criteria or procedures for the newlands project previously adopted by the secretary,and shall,pursuant to subsection h or judicial proceeding,pursue recoupment of any water diverted from the truckee river in excess of the amounts permitted by any such operating criteria and procedures.
settlement act j.the settlement act also states that it should not be read in such a manner as to conflict with the orr ditch and alpine decrees.see settlement act b.
five years after the enactment of the settlement act the united states instituted this case by filing a complaint against tcid,its board members,and all water users in the project as a class,seeking to recoup over one million af of water diverted in excess of applicable ocaps from.the tribe intervened as a plaintiff.
after lengthy evidentiary proceedings,the district court in issued its decision holding that tcid had willfully failed to comply with the ocap.nevertheless,although the government had sought over a million af of water as recoupment,the district court awarded just under af.the court credited the report of tcid expert and concluded that the government was only entitled to recoupment for excess diversions in,and the court also awarded recoupment for spills of water in and.the court held that the government,and not tcid,was responsible for excess diversions after,because the government had failed to revise the ocaps to reflect the water duties in the alpine decree.
with respect to interest on the water tcid owed the government by virtue of its decision,the court initially denied both prejudgment and postjudgment interest.the reasons it gave were the government delay in bringing this action and the government having inadvertently destroyed certain records relevant to the litigation.the district court later modified this decision and awarded postjudgment water interest.it ruled tcid must repay each year on the balance of water remaining to be recouped for replenishing the waters of pyramid lake.
tcid now appeals the district court ruling that the government under the settlement act can pursue any claim for past excess diversions.it also appeals the award of interest on water yet to be recouped and,on behalf of water rights holders farmers,it appeals the denial of attorneys fees under the equal access to justice act eaja.nevada,a party to the case because it owns some of the irrigated land,appeals the denial of its claim for costs.
the government and the tribe the denial of prejudgment interest.they also appeal the district court rejection of the government position that more recoupment should have been ordered as a result of gauge error in measuring the excess diversions and the denial of recoupment for diversions and spills occurring between and.
because the district court judgment followed a bench trial,this court reviews the district court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.crockett myers,napier,fitzgerald kirby,llp,cir.we vacate the district court rulings with respect to interest and remand for the court to explain the legal basis for its unprecedented award of interest that must be repaid in water.we also reverse the denial of the government claim that gauge error was not properly accounted for.we otherwise affirm the district court judgment.
discussion 
i.this action was properly maintained pursuant to the settlement act.
tcid fundamental position is that congress,in passing the settlement act,did not intend to create a judicially enforceable cause of action to allow the government to recoup excess diversions for past violations of ocaps.tcid position is not supported by the language,history,or purpose of the act.
congress passed the settlement act to encourage settlement of litigation and pending claims,to fulfill its trust obligations to the tribe,and to promote the recovery of pyramid lake.see settlement act d f.congress optimistically envisioned the possibility of tcid and the government achieving these goals through a settlement.this is evidenced in settlement act h which provides that certain provisions of the act would not go into effect unless and until the irrigation district has entered into a settlement agreement with the secretary concerning claims for recoupment of water diverted in excess of the amounts permitted by applicable operating criteria and procedures.to facilitate settlement,the act includes a provision allowing the secretary to cancel certain tcid repayment obligations.see settlement act g.given the years of contentious litigation surrounding pyramid lake,however,congress recognized that such a settlement might not occur.
accordingly,congress included section j in the settlement act.it directs the secretary to ensure compliance with all of the provisions of the ocaps,and expressly refers to compliance with previously adopted ocaps.see settlement act j.that section in turn directs the secretary to pursue recoupment of any water diverted from the truckee river in excess of the amounts permitted by any ocap and to do so pursuant to a judicial proceeding.
tcid contends the statute merely permits the secretary to prevent future violations of the ocaps.but the statutory language is mandatory,and the purpose of the act was to remedy past violations.section declares the purpose of the act to promote the recovery of the pyramid lake fishery.the stated purpose demonstrates that congressional intent was to restore the lake,not to maintain the status quo.
moreover tcid is mistaken in suggesting the court was somehow imposing a new and not clearly authorized duty with respect to past misconduct.see landgraf usi film,noting legislation may be applied retroactively only where congressional intent is clear.the court acted pursuant to express congressional authority to redress past violations of the limits that were in effect when the excess diversions took place.thus,the district court did not err in finding the settlement act unambiguously authorizes the government to seek recoupment for tcid prior violations of ocaps via this action.
ii.the district court decision does not conflict with the water decrees.
tcid,joined by nevada,also argues that even if a cause of action exists,the district court decision allowing recoupment conflicts with the orr ditch and alpine decrees,essentially because there is not enough water both to satisfy the requirements of the decrees and to restore pyramid lake.tcid is correct that the settlement act itself recognizes that it is not intended to affect the rights of farmers under the decrees.see settlement act b.the district court recognized that replenishing the water of pyramid lake while still providing farmers with the water they are due will prove a difficult task because of the substantial water duties the decrees established for agriculture.
the orr ditch and alpine decrees set the water duty for newlands farmers at acre feet per acre afa for bottom lands,and afa for bench lands.this allowance,however,is limited by the principle of beneficial use.see also ickes fox.we have described beneficial use as a dynamic concept,which is variable according to conditions,and therefore over time.alpine land reservoir,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.it is not a hard and fast unit of measurement.the district court decision here made it clear that it was reserving for the future the annual calculation of the actual amounts to which each farmer would be entitled applying the concept of beneficial use.therefore we do not yet know how much water the government will recoup in any given year.we also do not know how much water will be available to meet the competing demands.conservation may increase the supply.at oral argument counsel for the tribe explained,for example,that tcid can implement water conservation measures that create credit water.if so,tcid can send this credit water to pyramid lake,rather than to farmers,in satisfaction of the judgment.indeed,we were told this process has already begun.
even if it proves difficult,tcid has not convinced us that the district court recoupment order will be impossible to implement.it is for the district court in administering the order to ensure the recoupment process remains consistent with the orr ditch and alpine decrees.given tcid past record of noncompliance,it is for tcid to make a good faith effort to maximize the supply of water to meet the competing demands.
iii.the ocap is valid and enforceable.
tcid makes a related argument that the ocap,which the district court found to have been violated between and,was not valid.the ocap was directed by the court in tribe morton and embodied in a regulation promulgated by the secretary.it remained in effect through.this ocap maximum diversions were premised on the carson water duty of afa.the alpine decree raised this water duty to afa for bottom and bench lands respectively.tcid thus argues that the increased water duties created in the alpine decree invalidated the ocap,making it unenforceable as a basis for recoupment.
the settlement act again forecloses this argument by declaring that a ll actions taken heretofore by the secretary under any operating criteria and procedures are hereby declared to be valid.settlement act j.the act thus validates the ocap,as it became a regulation promulgated by the secretary acting at the direction of the court in tribe morton.the settlement act even expressly requires the secretary to act in a manner that is fully consistent with the decision in the case of tribe morton.see settlement act j.the district court did not err in ordering the ocap to be enforced.
iv.tcid remaining challenges to the recoupment order.
tcid several additional attempts to sidestep accountability under the settlement act have no merit.tcid contends the district court was without power in equity to order the transfer of water from tcid to the government or tribe because neither has any relevant water rights.tcid does not dispute that it controls all diversions of water from the truckee and carson rivers,and the settlement act is clear in its mandate for recoupment of excess diversions to protect the tribe enjoyment of pyramid lake.thus,the requirements of the settlement act may only be accomplished by the court order requiring tcid to manage the recoupment process.
tcid also contends the district court recoupment order in effect constitutes a civil contempt order or penalty because it orders tcid to account for violations of the ocap and that it can not constitute a valid contempt order because the ocap is no longer in effect.the district court,however,entered a judgment in an action maintained pursuant to the settlement act.the court did not impose a penalty or hold tcid in contempt for violating a judicial order.see ftc affordable media,cir noting that a party is in contempt only when it first violates a judicial order.
estoppel does not preclude the government from bringing this suit,despite tcid claim that it relied on the government statements decades ago that it would not enforce the ocap.even if the government took a different position in the past,the g overnment may not be estopped on the same terms as any other litigant.heckler cmty.health servs.of crawford county,d.for the government to be estopped,tcid must establish that the government engaged in affirmative misconduct,and that the government conduct has caused a serious injustice.watkins army,cir en banc.
tcid contends that the government committed affirmative misconduct by not enforcing the ocaps in the past.but affirmative misconduct requires an affirmative misrepresentation or affirmative concealment of a material fact by the government that go es beyond mere negligence.id.the simple of a regulatory requirement certainly does not rise to this level.see western pioneer,united states,cir.
tcid points to the government argument in a lawsuit by environmental plaintiffs that implementation of the ocap by tcid was not imminent.this was not an instance of affirmative misconduct.tcid has not shown that the government argument was a representation that it would never enforce the ocap against tcid,let alone an intentional or reckless misrepresentation to that effect.
we thus hold the district court did not err in finding tcid liable under the settlement act for its violations of ocaps.we now turn to the next issue,the extent of tcid liability.
v.the district court should reexamine the awards of pre and postjudgment interest.
the novel issue in this appeal concerns the court acceptance of the concept of interest payable in water.the judgment orders the return of water,not money,so the district court ordered interest to be paid in water.the district court original decision denied both pre and postjudgment interest to the government because it found that the government delayed in bringing this suit and accidentally destroyed a number of documents relevant to this litigation.the district court modified this decision without explanation when it entered judgment,and required that tcid pay postjudgment water interest in the amount of two percent each year on the outstanding balance of water due.
the court did not explain the basis for the award of water interest.tcid contends there is no basis.for the following reasons,we remand to the district court so that it may explain the basis in the record for its legal or equitable award of water interest that is,water over the amount wrongfully diverted each year.
the purpose of postjudgment interest is to compensate the successful plaintiff for being deprived of compensation for the loss of time between the ascertainment of the damage and the payment by the defendant.dishman unum life ins.of america,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.under the common law there
