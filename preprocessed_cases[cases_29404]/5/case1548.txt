is the defendant in an action arising out of contract entitled to an award of attorney fees under civil code section section by virtue of having obtained a dismissal from a california court on the ground that the agreement at issue contained a forum selection clause specifying the courts of another jurisdiction in the circumstances of this case,we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that defendants were not prevailing parties for purposes of section.considering that the action had already been refiled in the chosen jurisdiction and the parties substantive disputes remained unresolved,the court could reasonably conclude neither party had yet achieved its litigation objectives to an extent warranting an award of fees.see,subd.b court may determine that there is no party prevailing on the contract hsu abbara cal th,prevailing party determination is to be made by comparing the parties relative degrees of success upon final resolution of the contract claims.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiff,llc disputesuite owns copyrighted software it markets to credit repair organizations cros for their use in serving their customers.defendant performs services for cros,including supporting credit repair software such as disputesuite.the individual defendants are principals of we refer to defendants collectively as score.
the parties entered into a business relationship embodied in a series of oral and written agreements.under these agreements,disputesuite referred cros buying its software to score for outsourcing services,licensed the software to score and allowed score to relicense it to end users,and provided score with proprietary marketing methods.in return,score agreed to pay disputesuite a commission on referred cros,to provide services only to cros that used disputesuite software,to market that software exclusively,and to maintain the confidentiality of marketing information and software disputesuite provided.
two of the parties written agreements,referred to as the master agreement and the agreement,contain clauses subjecting disputes arising out of the agreements to the sole jurisdiction of courts in florida.according to disputesuite,a third contract,the agreement,had been modified to specify courts in los angeles as the exclusive forum for dispute resolution,but score denied receiving notice of that modification.
in july of,disputesuite brought this action for breach of contract,fraud,and related causes of action,alleging score had breached its obligations to pay commissions and to use only disputesuite software in its services to cros.in september,the court issued a preliminary injunction barring score from transferring cros referred by disputesuite to other software platforms or transferring disputesuite software to anyone other than the parties joint customers.
citing the two florida forum selection clauses,score moved to dismiss the action on grounds of forum non conveniens.on october,the trial court granted the motion,concluding the action arose out of the master and agreements,which specified courts in florida as the proper forum,rather than the agreement,which disputesuite maintained specified los angeles as the forum.the court,however,stayed the action rather than immediately dismissing it,giving disputesuite days to refile in florida.after granting disputesuite a extension of that period,on december,the court dismissed the case and vacated its preliminary injunction.
score then moved to recover in attorney fees incurred in connection with the motion to dismiss,relying on an attorney fee clause in the agreement and on section.the trial court denied the motion,finding that because the merits of the contract issues were still disputed and under litigation,score was not the prevailing party for purposes of section.in the trial court view,a defendant would be entitled to fees for obtaining a nonmerits victory only if that victory finally ended the parties litigation,which was not the case here.disputesuite has filed suit in florida,the more convenient forum.as defendants have not prevailed on the parties contract,they are not entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys fees.
the court of appeal affirmed,agreeing with the trial court that score was not entitled to fees because there has been no final resolution of the contract claims.score had not achieved an unqualified victory on the contract claim against it.rather,d efendants succeeded only in enforcing one contractual clause,not in disposing of all of plaintiff contract claims.thus,defendants obtained merely an interim victory by succeeding in getting the case moved from one forum to another,thereby delaying final resolution of the contract claims.
we granted score petition for review.
discussion 
section,subdivision a,provides in part in any action on a contract,where the contract specifically provides that attorney fees and costs,which are incurred to enforce that contract,shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party,then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract,whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or not,shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees in addition to other costs.subdivision b of the statute provides the court,upon notice and motion by a party,shall determine who is the party prevailing on the contract for purposes of this section,whether or not the suit proceeds to final judgment.except as provided in paragraph relating to voluntary dismissals and settlements,the party prevailing on the contract shall be the party who recovered a greater relief in the action on the contract.the court may also determine that there is no party prevailing on the contract for purposes of this section.
the trial court ruling on a motion for fees under section is vested with discretion in determining which party has prevailed on the contract,or that no party has.hsu abbara,supra,cal th at hsu.if neither party achieves a complete victory on all the contract claims,it is within the discretion of the trial court to determine which party prevailed on the contract or whether,on balance,neither party prevailed sufficiently to justify an award of attorney fees.scott blount,cal th.as we explained in hsu,a party who obtains an unqualified victory on a contract dispute,including a defendant who defeats recovery by the plaintiff on the plaintiff entire contract claim,is entitled as a matter of law to be considered the prevailing party for purposes of section.hsu,supra,at.but when the results of the contract litigation are mixed,the trial court has discretion under the statute to determine that no party has prevailed.ibid.
in hsu,the trial court granted the defendants motion for judgment on the complaint for breach of contract but denied the defendants motion for fees under section.hsu,supra,cal th at.the plaintiffs contended the trial court could properly conclude neither party had prevailed,and deny the fee request,because the defendants had acted inequitably in the disputed transaction.id.at.we rejected the plaintiffs interpretation of section,holding that when one party has achieved an unqualified victory on the only disputed contract claim,that party has prevailed the trial court may not invoke equitable considerations unrelated to litigation success as grounds to deny fees under the statute.hsu,supra,at.
we articulated our general holding in hsu,that the prevailing party determination depended on success vis the disputed contract claim or claims,as follows accordingly,we hold that in deciding whether there is a party prevailing on the contract,the trial court is to compare the relief awarded on the contract claim or claims with the parties demands on those same claims and their litigation objectives as disclosed by the pleadings,trial briefs,opening statements,and similar sources.the prevailing party determination is to be made only upon final resolution of the contract claims and only by a comparison of the extent to which each party ha s succeeded and failed to succeed in its contentions.hsu,supra,cal th at.
applying these principles,we conclude the trial court acted within its discretion in determining that score had not prevail ed on the contract within the meaning of section,subdivision b,by moving the litigation to florida.while score had succeeded in enforcing the forum selection clauses in two of its agreements with disputesuite,it had not defeated disputesuite breach of contract and related claims.because none of those claims had yet been resolved and the litigation was still ongoing in florida,the california trial court was in no position to compare the relief awarded on the contract claim or claims with the parties demands on those same claims and their litigation objectives that comparison could be made only upon final resolution of the contract claims.hsu,supra,cal th at.score was therefore not the prevailing party as a matter of law,and the trial court could reasonably decide that at the time fees were sought neither party had prevailed sufficiently to justify an award of attorney fees.scott blount,supra,cal th at.
no reported california case appears to have decided the precise issue before us here,a defendant entitlement to attorney fees for obtaining dismissal of a contract action under the agreement forum selection clause.the section issue has,however,arisen in related procedural contexts,in which a party has won a procedural victory ending the contract litigation in one court but the litigation has continued or could continue in a different forum.courts of appeal have reached differing results on the diverse facts of these cases.
in estate of drummond th drummond,a testator children engaged an attorney to contest their father will,but eventually fired the attorney and disputed his claim for payment of fees.id.at.after the children filed a civil action against the attorney for fraud and breach of faith,the attorney petitioned successfully in probate court for the disputed fees,id.at,but the court of appeal held the attorney claim should instead have been filed as a in the children civil action hence,on remand,the probate petition was dismissed and the attorney filed a for his fees in the civil action.ibid.the children then sought their own attorney fees incurred in defending the probate petition,which the probate court denied.id.at.
the court of appeal affirmed.the court held the fees were properly denied under section because the testator children had obtained only an interim victory,based on the attorney having attempted to pursue his claims in the wrong forum.drummond,supra,th at.put another way,the children had at no time won a victory on the contract.they had only succeeded at moving a determination on the merits from one forum to another.id.at.the trial court denial of fees was thus consistent with hsu direction that the prevailing party determination be made only after final resolution of the contract claims.drummond,supra,at,quoting hsu,supra,cal th at.
the drummond court did not rule out the possibility a defendant might prevail on the contract within the meaning of section by winning a purely procedural dismissal.if refiling in another forum would be legally barred by the statute of limitations,for example or would be otherwise impossible or impracticable,the defendant might be deemed the prevailing party without obtaining a resolution on the merits.drummond,supra,th at.in drummond,however,the attorney had already refiled his contractual claim in the civil action.the dismissal of his petition in the probate matter did not defeat his contract claims it merely deflected or forestalled them.ibid.
the same may be said of score achievement in the california trial court.in obtaining dismissal in favor of a florida venue,score did not defeat disputesuite breach of contract and related claims,but succeeded only in moving their resolution to another forum.this is not a case in which the claims prosecution in another forum is barred or even doubtful disputesuite had already refiled in florida at the time score requested its fees for obtaining dismissal in california.far from obtain ing a simple,unqualified win on the contract claims hsu,supra,cal th at,score merely obtained a different forum in which to oppose them.such a victory was insufficient to make score the prevailing party as a matter of law.
the court in lachkar lachkar d reached a similar conclusion in the arbitration context.after granting the plaintiffs petition to compel arbitration of a dispute arising from a contract for sale of a business without any civil action on the contract having yet been filed,the trial court awarded the plaintiffs their attorney fees expended on the petition to compel under the sale agreement attorney fee provision.id.at.the appellate court reversed.applying the version of section,which defined the prevailing party as the party who is entitled to recover costs of suit,the court reasoned the statute required a final disposition of the rights of the parties and a reckoning by the trial court of the net success of the respective parties,which could not be ascertained until the final termination of the suit.id.at.in ordering the dispute to arbitration,the trial court had not determined the parties substantive rights no party had yet prevailed within the meaning of section.id.at accord,green diablo hospital dist.d.
although decided under an earlier version of section,lachkar conclusion accords with drummond a party does not become the prevailing party under the statute merely by obtaining a forum for resolution of the contractual dispute or by moving it from one forum to another.lachkar view that the prevailing party can not be determined until the contractual dispute reaches a final disposition and the parties respective achievements can be compared prefigured this court direction that the trial court should decide which party,if either,has prevailed only upon final resolution of the contract claims and only by a comparison of the extent to which each party ha s succeeded and failed to succeed in its contentions.hsu,supra,cal th at.
frog creek partners,llc vance brown,th frog creek,also an arbitration case,followed lachkar and drummond in denying fees for prevailing on an interim motion that did not resolve the parties substantive dispute.in frog creek,a property owner filed a civil action against a builder for breach of an agreement to construct improvements on the property the builder.the defendant builder twice petitioned to compel arbitration under the contract.the trial court denied the first petition but,pursuant to an appellate court order,granted the second.in arbitration,the defendant won a substantial award.frog creek,supra,at.at issue on appeal was the propriety of awarding the plaintiff,rather than the defendant,attorney fees incurred opposing the first,unsuccessful,petition to compel arbitration.id.at.
the frog creek court held that under section,attorney fees for the first petition to compel should have been awarded to the defendant,who prevailed on the contract dispute as a whole,rather than to the plaintiff,who won only an interim victory on the first petition.that victory did not make the plaintiff the prevailing party on the contract because denial of the petition to compel arbitration did not resolve the parties contract dispute instead,the merits of that dispute remained before the court in the plaintiff complaint and the defendant.frog creek,supra,th at.that dispute was ultimately resolved in the defendant favor through arbitration.the defendant was thus the prevailing party on the contract and,under prior appellate decisions,was entitled to all of its fees,including fees incurred during the lawsuit in proceedings where it did not prevail.ibid.
although frog creek is not closely analogous to this case procedurally the petition to compel for which fees were sought there did not result in moving the litigation to another forum,as the dismissal motion here did it supports the denial of fees in this case by its invocation of the general principle,equally applicable here,that fees under section are awarded to the party who prevailed on the contract overall,not to a party who prevailed only at an interim procedural step.frog creek,supra,th at accord,presley of southern california whelan d,revers
