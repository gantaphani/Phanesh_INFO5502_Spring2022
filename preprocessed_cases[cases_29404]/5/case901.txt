the cody class in this prison civil rights litigation seeks attorneys fees for counsel work that culminated in a private settlement agreement dismissing the case without prejudice.because the class had earlier obtained a consent decree lasting more than a decade,and because the parties earlier practice had been for the defendants to pay the class legal fees,the district court awarded fees.the state appeals,and we affirm.
the class members are south dakota prisoners.defendants are that state main prison officials,whom we refer to as the state.in the class sued under to challenge conditions of confinement in several south dakota prisons as violative of the eighth and fourteenth amendments.after a bench trial,the district court held that numerous conditions in the prison system were unconstitutional.cody hillard.in july,the parties entered into a consent decree that set out remedies for many of the violations found by the court.the decree addressed prison environmental conditions,fire safety,medical and psychological care,and prisoners access to the courts,among other subjects.the decree recited that its remedial provisions were fairly supported by the evidence.
in the years that followed,the state paid attorneys fees to the class on multiple occasions beginning at least as early as.the state did not dispute the class entitlement to fees,though the parties sometimes negotiated the reasonableness of particular fee and expense requests.
the court held evidentiary hearings in and to monitor the state compliance with the consent decree.after the hearing the court entered a supplemental order outlining procedures to identify deficiencies in compliance.after the hearing the court found that the state had failed to comply with the decree in certain respects relating to sanitary conditions in the prison and inmate fire safety.it entered supplemental remedial orders.
on april,the state,arguing that it was now in substantial compliance,moved under.b to dissolve the consent decree and supplemental orders.the class opposed the motion.after submissions,but without an evidentiary hearing,the district court entered a order terminating the decree.the class appealed.we remanded,holding that the district court order had not provided a sufficient factual or legal basis to explain its decision.cody hillard,cir.we noted that the record suggested there we re still at least some violations of the consent decree.id.at.
after remand,before the district court entered any further ruling,the parties entered into a settlement agreement stipulating that the case would be dismissed without prejudice.most of the agreement consists of promises by the state to take specific steps to improve prison conditions.the agreement contains no provision expressly discussing attorneys fees.
the district court approved the settlement agreement on february.cody hillard,d.shortly thereafter,the class moved for an award of fees for the work its counsel had done since december.over the state opposition,the district court awarded most of the fees sought.the court held that the initial litigation had established the class status as prevailing parties under,entitling them to attorneys fees for work done to enforce the relief ordered in the consent decree.the court further held that the work done by class counsel in monitoring the decree,resisting the state motion to vacate it,and negotiating the settlement agreement upon remand was inextricably intertwined with the initial litigation.finally,the court held that awarding fees did not violate the prison litigation reform act of.the court applied the prison litigation reform act hourly rate caps to the work done after the act effective date,and calculated a final fee award of.
the state appeals this award.it presents the same arguments it raised below that with respect to most of the work at issue here,the class was not a prevailing party under that the award was contrary to the prison litigation reform act,which limits fees not directly and reasonably incurred in proving a violation,see d a and that the class waived any right to seek attorneys fees by entering into a settlement agreement silent about fees.we consider each argument in turn.
under,district courts may award attorneys fees to the prevailing party in suits brought under and other civil rights statutes.a plaintiff who prevails under a statute covered by is normally entitled to fees.wray clarke,cir.we review legal issues relating to fee awards de novo,the awards themselves for abuse of discretion.jenkins missouri,cir.
the supreme court recently clarified the meaning of prevailing party in buckhannon bd.care home,west.dep t of health human resources,d.that case held that a plaintiff must secure a judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties to qualify as a prevailing party.id.at.buckhannon affirmed that a plaintiff who obtains either an enforceable judgment on the merits or a consent decree has established the required judicially sanctioned change in legal relationship,and so is a prevailing party.id.at.
here,the class obtained a consent decree which governed the operation of the prison for twelve years.this was clearly a judicially sanctioned change in the parties relationship that conferred prevailing party status on the class under buckhannon.id.at.
nevertheless,that a plaintiff has once established prevailing party status does not make all later work compensable.compensability is subject to several limitations.first,the award of fees should take into account the degree of a plaintiff success in the case as a whole.jenkins,at.second,an earlier established prevailing party status extends to postjudgment work only if it is a necessary adjunc t to the initial litigation.id.at.work that is more like a new,separate lawsuit requires a fresh determination of entitlement to fees.the test is whether the later issues litigated were inextricably intertwined with those on which the plaintiff prevailed in the underlying suit.id.at.third,plaintiffs can not.postjudgment litigation,like all work under the statutes,must be reasonable in degree.hensley eckerhart,d.s ervices that were redundant,inefficient,or simply unnecessary are not compensable.jenkins,at.
it is helpful to divide the period of time for which the class seeks fees into three phases.see pennsylvania delaware valley citizens council,d describing analysis by phases as useful in protracted litigation.in the first phase,the class seeks a small amount of fees for monitoring the state compliance with the consent decree after december.this phase ended when the state filed its motion to dissolve the decree under rule b on april.the second phase consists of the class litigation before the district court and this court in opposition to the motion to dissolve.it culminates in our remand order of march,cody hillard,cir.finally,the third phase is work done after the remand to negotiate and secure approval of the private settlement agreement.the district court approved the settlement on february,and this phase ends with the filing of the class petition for fees on march.
one of the state arguments against status applies to the entire period at issue.the district court order said it vacated the consent decree and remedial orders in the case,rather than saying it terminated them.some courts have expressly distinguished these terms.in construing the automatic termination provisions of the prison litigation reform act,the first circuit stated that terminate means to put an end to or to end,whereas vacate means to annul or to render void.inmates of suffolk county jail rouse,cir internal citation omitted quoting black law dictionary,ed.the court thought this distinction may well possess practical significance in the context of prison civil rights litigation.id.while terminating a consent decree strips it of future potency,it observed,the decree past puissance is preserved vacating a consent decree,however,wipes the slate clean and,indeed,cast s a shadow on past actions taken under the decree imprimatur.id.citing rouse,the state argues that because the district court said vacate,its order wiped away the earlier existence of the consent decree,depriving the class of its status,which is based on the decree.
we are reluctant to consider this argument since it was not clearly articulated until the state reply brief.see akeyo,cir.assuming it is proper to address the argument,we reject it.our own most recent opinion in this case described the order as a decision to terminate jurisdiction over a consent decree,and analyzed it accordingly.cody,at.quite apart from our choice of words,it is facially clear from the order that it was a termination order,of prospective effect.it recited that the consent decree has served its purposes and is no longer needed in order to serve the public interest.id.emphasis added.the order added that the class had asked the court to continue its jurisdiction,but that in the absence of ongoing substantial violations,the court declines the invitation.see id.none of this suggests that the district court held the decree to have been void from the start.rather,the court held only that it need not be extended into the future.hence the order did not cas t a shadow on past actions under the decree,rouse,at,or nullify the class status.
the state does not otherwise dispute that class counsel activity in the first of the three phases was compensable under case law.a district court may award fees to a prevailing party for reasonable postjudgment monitoring.association for retarded citizens of north dakota schafer,cir see mills freeman,cir.the class considerable success in the litigation as a whole supports a fee award in this phase.the parties do not dispute the district court assessment of reasonable fees for the particular steps class counsel took during this time.we thus uphold the award for this phase without further discussion.
the state does argue,however,that the class members fail to qualify as prevailing parties with respect to the second and third phases,which begin with the state motion to vacate the decree.the state maintains that this part of the litigation was not inextricably intertwined with the constitutional violations recognized in the class consent decree,because the settlement agreement the parties finally entered into after remand addressed issues not contained in the decree.hence the class can not claim fees unless it prevailed anew on these issues under buckhannon standards.securing the settlement agreement,the state further argues,was not enough to do this.
we reject the state contention with respect to the second phase,resisting the motion to vacate.we have held before that work done to defend a remedy for a constitutional violation is inextricably intertwined with the litigation that yielded that remedy.see jenkins,at schafer,at.the fact that plaintiffs did not prevail before the district court in this phase of litigation does not deprive them of fees.when a remedial consent decree is threatened,plaintiffs counsel are under clear obligation to make the defensive effort.id.quoting plyler evatt,cir.we have also held that as long as a plaintiff litigation to protect a remedy does not rise to the level of overkill,even largely unsuccessful defensive efforts may be compensable.schafer,id.at see plyler,at awarding full compensation for plaintiffs largely unsuccessful opposition to attempt to modify consent decree work was essential to the preservation of the integrity of the consent decree as a whole.here,the class achieved partial success in this phase by winning a remand from this court.the state does not contend that they engaged in excessive litigation,nor would the record support this view.we therefore hold that the district court award of fees for class counsel work before the district court and this court during the second phase was consistent with the prevailing party requirement,and a permissible exercise of the court discretion.
similar reasoning justifies compensating class counsel activity in the third phase,negotiating the settlement agreement after remand.the settlement agreement provisions correspond to the more general provisions of the original consent decree and the supplemental remedial orders.as the district court earlier observed,the agreement 
contain s more specific language than is found in the consent decree.for example,the consent decree provides that defendants shall provide proper medical screening for newly admitted inmates while the settlement agreement specifies diagnostic and infection control procedures consistent with center for disease control guidelines.in addition,the consent decree states that adequate ventilation must be provided in the west hall shower,while the settlement agreement specifies that defendants shall provide at least ten air exchanges per hour.
cody,d at.in addition to the examples given by the district court,the settlement agreement provisions dealing with fire safety inspections,plumbing and ventilation maintenance,the storage of food and combustible materials,and initial medical screening of prisoners for tuberculosis likewise implement more general commands on these subjects in the consent decree.similarly,the agreement provision for chemical disposal in the prison wheelchair shop corresponds to the consent decree requirement that adequate ventilation be maintained in the prison shops.we agree with the district court that the issues dealt with by the agreement are inextricably intertwined with the issues in the consent decree.thus,class counsel work on all three phases is compensable under the general framework.
because the class members are prisoners,their civil rights suit is also subject to the prison litigation reform act of,stat,or plra,which imposes special limitations on fee awards.it provides 
in any action brought by a prisoner who is confined to any jail,prison or other correctional facility,in which attorney fees are authorized under,such fees shall not be awarded,except to the extent that 
a the fee was directly and reasonably incurred in proving an actual violation of the plaintiff rights protected by a statute pursuant to which a fee may be awarded under and 
b i the amount of the fee is proportionately related to the court ordered relief for the violation or 
ii the fee was directly and reasonably incurred in enforcing the relief ordered for the violation.
d.the state argues that this provision bars any award of fees for the work done by class counsel after march,when the district court entered its order vacating the consent decree.the state claims that because the work after this event yielded only a private settlement agreement,it was not directly and reasonably incurred in proving an actual violation of the plaintiff rights,d a,and so is not compensable.
to evaluate this argument we must interpret d,which,like other parts of the plra,is not a paragon of clarity.rouse,at.the language of subsection b ii envisions that fees will sometimes be available for legal work that enforc es relief ordered for constitutional violations.yet b ii is connected by an and to subsection a,which authorizes only fees that are incurred in proving a violation.read in isolation,subsection a might be thought to forbid any fees for legal work done to enforce previously established relief.one would not ordinarily say that a lawyer performing such work is proving a violation.
statutes are to be interpreted as a whole,however.united states talley,cir.in particular,courts should not interpret one provision in a manner that renders other sections of the same statute inconsistent,meaningless,or superfluous.united states fiorillo,cir quotation marks omitted.here,subsection a and subsection b ii are flatly inconsistent unless a permits some fee awards for enforcement work,thus allowing some effect to b ii.
a reasonable reading of the statute accomplishes this.under the plra,attorneys fees can be awarded in a prisoner civil rights case only if the prisoner prov es an actual violation of rights protected by a relevant statute.d a.once a violation has been proven,later work is compensable if it is directly and reasonably incurred in enforcing the relief ordered for the violation.d b ii accord webb ada county,cir.see also martin hadix,d affirming fee award under plra for postjudgment monitoring,w
