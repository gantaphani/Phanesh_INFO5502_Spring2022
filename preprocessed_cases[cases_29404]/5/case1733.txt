introduction 
probate code section,subdivision b permits a probate court to award attorney fees to the beneficiary of a trust who contests the trustee account if the court determines the trustee opposition to the contest was without reasonable cause and in bad faith.based on section b,the trial court not a probate court granted the motion for attorney fees brought by richard soria,barbara soria,eleanor soria,and renee soria grandchildren,and awarded them attorney fees against their grandparents richard soria and lynda soria grandparents.grandparents appeal from that order and the portion of the amended judgment incorporating the attorney fees award.we reverse.
section b does not permit recovery of attorney fees in this case for the simple reason grandchildren did not contest a trustee account.instead,grandchildren pursued a civil action against grandparents,alleging they breached their duties as trustees,and sought an injunction to compel grandparents to produce an account.the very existence of a trust was in dispute.at trial,there was no contest of a trustee account within the meaning of section b.the recent decision of leader cords th leader is distinguishable and does not alter our conclusion grandchildren could not recover attorney fees under section b.
section b permits an attorney fees award only as a surcharge against the trustee compensation from or interest in the trust.because this case was prosecuted as a civil lawsuit,the attorney fees award became part of a money judgment against grandparents and was not surcharged against future compensation or interest in the trust.section b does not permit attorney fees to be awarded in such a manner.
