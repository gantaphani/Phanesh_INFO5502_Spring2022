background 
california maintains a dual system of water rights,which distinguishes between the rights of riparian users,those who possess water rights by virtue of owning the land by or through which flowing water passes,and appropriators,those who hold the right to divert such water for use on noncontiguous lands.el dorado irrigation dist.state water resources control bd.th.riparian users and appropriators whose claims were staked before december need neither a permit nor other governmental authorization to exercise their water rights.california farm bureau federation state water resources control bd.cal th.while there is no predetermined limit on the amount of water an individual riparian user may divert phelps water resources control bd.th,appropriators may divert only so much water as is authorized by their particular water right,assuming the claim was properly perfected by the original claimant pleasant valley canal borror th.
in,hill and gomes acquired a parcel of land adjoining the russian river the parcel.as part of the transaction,they were assigned an appropriative water right known as the waldteufel claim,which had been recorded in early by waldteufel,a prior owner of the parcel.as later determined by the board,waldteufel claimed the right to divert the equivalent of per year afa from the russian river.
in,hill and gomes sold most of the parcel to a developer,who later constructed homes on it.the same year,they licensed the waldteufel claim to millview,which provides water service to an unincorporated area of mendocino county north of ukiah.the annual license fee started at in and rose to by.soon after licensing the waldteufel claim,millview began diverting water from the russian river,supplying water not only to the homes built on the parcel but also elsewhere within the boundaries of the district.during the years for which information is available in the record,through,millview diversions varied from a low of in the first year to a high of in.
in,a private citizen filed a complaint with the board,contending the waldteufel claim did not authorize millview diversion because the right was riparian rather than appropriative and forfeited by long nonuse.board staff investigated the claim and,the next year,issued a memorandum concluding that water rights under the waldteufel claim had indeed been largely forfeited.staff opined the claim could now support the diversion of no more than afa,dramatically less than the afa claimed in waldteufel claim.in april,the board issued a notice proposing entry of a cdo limiting millview diversion of water under the waldteufel claim to a maximum volume of afa.plaintiffs requested a hearing on the proposed cdo.
a few months later,in august,hill and gomes sold the waldteufel claim to millview,along with two parcels of real property referred to as the riparian corridor and parcel a,together with any appurtenant water rights.the purchase price of was not allocated separately among the assets the agreement embodying the sale the purchase agreement required millview to make a down payment of,with the remainder of the purchase price funded by a promissory note due and payable three years from the close of escrow or days following the time a final order is entered by any court of competent jurisdiction adjudicating the validity extent of the waldteufel claim,whichever is later.
although the purchase agreement specified a price for the various assets of million,the amount millview was ultimately required to pay depended entirely upon the outcome of the cdo proceeding.in the event a final court order was entered limiting millview diversion under the waldteufel claim to less than cubic feet per second,a reduction in purchase price was to be agreed by the parties or determined by binding arbitration in the event of a more severe limitation on diversion,set at cubic feet per second during the period of july to november,the purchase price shall be deemed to be the amount of the down payment and the note shall thereupon be cancelled.the purchase agreement required millview to pursue litigation of the cdo proceeding,but hill and gomes were permitted to intervene.
following an evidentiary hearing on plaintiffs challenge,the board issued a cdo in,limiting millview diversion under the waldteufel claim to afa,taken only during the period april through september.although the waldteufel claim purported to be a right of appropriation,the board order noted the claim did not appear to have been perfected as such because waldteufel only demonstrated use of water was for irrigation on the parcel.a finding to this effect would have precluded any appropriation under the claim,but the board did not base its order on this theory because the original cdo notice did not raise the validity of the waldteufel claim as an issue.accepting the waldteufel claim as appropriative,the board found plaintiffs had failed to prove waldteufel had ever perfected the claimed volume of afa.at most,the board concluded,waldteufel had diverted afa,exclusively during the months of april through october.this amount fixed a maximum level of diversion under the claim.the board limitation of diversion to the much lower afa was based on its finding that diversion in excess of afa had been forfeited by the failure of the owners prior to hill and gomes to divert a greater volume.
millview,gomes,and hill filed a petition for a writ of mandate requiring the board to set aside the cdo.the trial court order granting the writ was affirmed by this court in millview i,supra,th,although on grounds that were not particularly favorable to plaintiffs.we concluded the board was correct in questioning the appropriative nature of the waldteufel claim and in finding the maximum perfected diversion to be afa.however,we found the board had used the wrong legal standard in determining forfeiture,thereby requiring its order to be set aside.we noted three possible options for the board on remand,besides dismissal of the proceeding the board can set aside the present cdo and enter a new cdo limiting millview diversion under the waldteufel claim to afa,between the months of april and october.the board can set aside the present cdo and conduct further evidentiary hearings on the issue of forfeiture.or the board can begin again by issuing an amended notice of draft cdo addressing the issue of the perfection of the waldteufel claim as a right of appropriation and conduct new administrative hearings directed at this issue,alone or in combination with the issue of forfeiture.millview i,at.if the board chose to pursue any of those options,there was a risk millview diversion of water under the waldteufel claim would once again be limited to far less than the afa originally claimed by plaintiffs.
following remittitur of our decision,the board set aside the cdo and,in an order dated august,directed its staff to consider initiating an enforcement action against millview,consistent with the options set out in millview i.the board has apparently taken no further action with respect to millview diversion under the waldteufel claim.
also following remittitur,plaintiffs renewed a previously filed motion for an award of attorney fees under code of civil procedure section.the original motion was filed in,after the trial court issued its order granting the writ of mandate,seeking fees incurred by plaintiffs in connection with the board and trial court proceedings.the trial court denied it,concluding plaintiffs had not shown a significant public benefit from the litigation.in their renewed motion,plaintiffs added a request for fees incurred in connection with the millview i appeal.the renewed motion argued a lthough plaintiffs did not get everything they wanted from the appeal,they were the prevailing party in the litigation because they obtained a writ vacating the board cdo the litigation enforced an important right affecting the public interest because it concerned appropriative water rights the litigation conferred a public benefit on a large class of persons by clarifying the law with respect to forfeiture of such rights and the financial burden of private enforcement justified an award because plaintiffs attorney fees exceeded their financial benefit.
with respect to the financial burden element,plaintiffs argued the litigation would result in no financial benefit to them because they did not receive a monetary award.at most,they argued,the litigation protected an interest that they previously had.in a declaration explaining hill and gomes motive for challenging the proposed cdo,hill conceded,it was in our financial and other interest to get as much of the water right validated as possible,but he said the pair were also offended by the citizen complaint challenging their diversion of the water and shocked and upset by the arrogant and mocking attitude of a board staff member.millview general manager also submitted a declaration explaining its motivation for challenging the proposed cdo.millview was responsible for supplying water to connections,as well as mendocino community college.in may,prior to millview licensing of the waldteufel claim,the state department of health services had issued a compliance order that had the effect of placing a moratorium on new connections in the district due to an insufficient water supply.since entry of the compliance order,millview had developed a waiting list of applicants for water service.diversion under the waldteufel claim,if upheld,would permit millview to serve these applicants.although millview could also obtain water from the russian river flood control and water conservation improvement district improvement district,one of the interveners in this litigation,millview was dissatisfied with the terms offered by the improvement district.in particular,during an earlier dry period the improvement district had restricted the water available to millview,requiring conservation efforts by its customers.if the waldteufel claim was upheld at the full diversion level claimed by waldteufel,millview would not be dependent upon the improvement district for water.
by the time of the renewed motion,hill and gomes had been billed over by their attorneys,while millview attorney fees totaled.
plaintiffs renewed motion for attorney fees was opposed by the board,the improvement district,and the other intervener.they argued the court no longer had jurisdiction to award attorney fees sought in their original attorney fees motion plaintiffs were not prevailing parties because they had not obtained a judgment affirming their right to divert the full amount of appropriation claimed by the waldteufel claim plaintiffs had not conferred a significant public benefit because,at most,they inadvertently achieved a clarification of the law of forfeiture and plaintiffs failed to satisfy the financial burden requirement because they had a significant financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.as to the latter issue,they argued the litigation implicates who millview pays for its water and how much it pays,nothing more.they pointed out that hill and gomes stood to receive an immediate economic benefit from the litigation of million,the amount due to them under the purchase agreement if the proposed cdo was vacated and millview allowed to divert the full amount claimed under the waldteufel claim.millview benefitted,they argued,by acquiring a million asset that could be used or sold.further,the water diverted under the waldteufel claim had a value,potentially generat ing an enormous economic benefit to millview rate payers that far exceeds the value millview paid to hill and gomes.finally,they argued,in the absence of diversion under the waldteufel claim,millview would be required to obtain water from another source at some substantial cost.
the trial court granted the renewed motion in part,awarding plaintiffs the fees incurred in litigating the millview i appeal,but it denied them fees incurred prior to the appeal,viewing those as no longer available because plaintiffs did not appeal the denial of the original motion.the court concluded plaintiffs were the prevailing parties by virtue of their invalidation of the cdo and had enforced an important right affecting the public interest by obtaining a published appellate opinion addressing forfeiture law.as to the issue of financial burden,the court construed in re conservatorship of whitley cal th whitley as holding,a fee award will ordinarily be appropriate except where the expected value of the litigant own monetary award exceeds by a substantial margin the actual litigation costs.because plaintiffs received no monetary award from the litigation but merely protected what they already had,the court concluded,an award of fees was appropriate.the court order directed fees to be paid by the board only,excusing interveners from liability.
the board has appealed the trial court award of the attorney fees incurred in connection with the appeal,while plaintiffs have appealed the court refusal to award them the fees they incurred earlier in the litigation.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,the parties largely reiterate the arguments presented to the trial court.we find it necessary to address only the issue of financial burden.because there is no substantial evidence to support the trial court conclusion that plaintiffs lacked a sufficient financial incentive to justify their challenge to the cdo,the court award of private attorney general attorney fees under section constituted an abuse of discretion.
section was enacted as a codification of the private attorney general attorney fee doctrine that had been developed in numerous prior judicial decisions.t he fundamental objective of the private attorney general doctrine of attorney fees is to encourage suits effectuating a strong public policy by awarding substantial attorney fees to those who successfully bring such suits and thereby bring about benefits to a broad class of citizens.citation.the doctrine rests upon the recognition that privately initiated lawsuits are often essential to the effectuation of the fundamental public policies embodied in constitutional or statutory provisions,and that,without some mechanism authorizing the award of attorney fees,private actions to enforce such important public policies will as a practical matter frequently be infeasible.whitley,supra,cal th at,italics omitted.e ligibility for section attorney fees is established when plaintiffs action has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest,a significant benefit,whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons,and the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement are such as to make the award appropriate.summit media,llc city of los angeles th,fn.omitted summit media.
our focus is on the final element,that the financial burden of private enforcement is such as to make the award appropriate.the meaning of financial burden was addressed by the supreme court in whitley in determining the financial burden on litigants,courts have quite logically focused not only on the costs of the litigation but also any offsetting financial benefits that the litigation yields or reasonably could have been expected to yield.an award on the private attorney general theory is appropriate when the cost of the claimant legal victory transcends his personal interest,that is,when the necessity for pursuing the lawsuit placed a burden on the plaintiff out of proportion to his individual stake in the matter.citation.citation.this requirement focuses on the financial burdens and incentives involved in bringing the lawsuit.whitley,supra,cal th at.
in evaluating the element of financial burden,the inquiry before the trial court is whether there were insufficient financial incentives to justify the litigation in economic terms.summit media,supra,th at.if the plaintiff had a personal financial stake in the litigation sufficient to warrant the decision to incur significant attorney fees and costs in the vigorous prosecution of the lawsuit,an award under section is inappropriate.summit media,at.section was not designed as a method for rewarding litigants motivated by their own pecuniary interests who only coincidentally protect the public interest.davis farmers insurance exchange th,davis award inappropriate where plaintiff expected a substantial financial recovery from the litigation.instead,its purpose is to provide some incentive for the plaintiff who acts as a true private attorney general,prosecuting a lawsuit that enforces an important public right and confers a significant benefit,despite the fact that his or her own financial stake in the outcome would not by itself constitute an adequate incentive to litigate.flannery california highway patrol th.the relevant issue is the estimated value of the case at the time the vital litigation decisions were being made.davis,at.
the burden is on the party requesting section fees to demonstrate all elements of the statute,including that the litigation costs transcend his or her personal interest.norberg california coastal com.th,norberg.utilizing its traditional equitable discretion,the trial court must realistically assess the litigation and determine,from a practical perspective citation whether or not the statutory criteria have been met.citation.the trial court judgment on whether a plaintiff has proved each of the prerequisites for an award of attorney fees under section will not be disturbed unless the appellate court is convinced that it is clearly wrong and constitutes an abuse of discretion.summit media,supra,th at.with respect to the issues of necessity and financial burden,the trial court abuses its discretion in making an award under section when there is no substantial evidence to support the required findings.bui nguyen th.
plaintiffs failed to provide substantial evidence to support a finding that pursuing the lawsuit placed a burden on them out of proportion to their individual stake in the matter.whitley,supra,cal th at.as to hill and gomes,the financial incentive was unmistakable.if the proposed cdo was entered by the board,they would be limited to retaining the down payment under the purchase agreement,forfeiting the portion of the purchase price that was due if no governmental order was entered limiting diversion under the waldteufel claim.defeating entry of the proposed cdo therefore earned them an additional million under the purchase agreement.because this potential gain far exceeds the cost to hill and gomes of pursuing the litigation,they had more than adequate financial incentive to pursue their challenge.
millview had a similarly ample financial incentive for challenging issuance of the proposed cdo.most obviously,millview had paid for an asset that would be rendered worthless if a cdo was entered severely curtailing diversion under the waldteufel claim.preserving the value of its investment was a substantial incentive.further,being able to divert water under the waldteufel claim was plainly valuable to millview the district was willing to pay over million for the claim.in making that investment,millview hoped to gain the ability to serve the waiting list of applicants for water service independence from the improvement district as a source of water a steady supply of water for its customers in dry periods,when its supply might otherwise be reduced and an ample supply of free water,once the purchase costs of the waldteufel claim were depreciated these gains,of course,would only accrue if millview successfully challenged the cdo.
plaintiffs argument that they were merely protecting what they had,even if accepted,does not demonstrate they lacked an adequate financial incentive to participate in the board proceeding.plaintiffs viewed the waldteufel claim as authorizing diversion of afa from the russian river.the proposed cdo would have limited diversion under the claim to slightly more than percent of that volume.had plaintiffs taken no action,the board,in the ordinary course,would have entered the cdo,thereby essentially eliminating diversion under the claim.from millview point of view,the board entry of the cdo would have rendered the newly purchased asset,for which it claims to have paid a minimum of,essentially worthless.as to hill and gomes,entry of the proposed cdo would have reduced their return under the purchase agreement from million to.for both,the prevention of this result would have provided ample financial incentive to become involved in the lawsuit,even if that involvement is characterized merely as protecting the value of the claim.
controlling in this regard is summit media.in that case,the plaintiff,an operator of billboards in los angeles,sued to invalidate a litigation settlement agreement between the city of los angeles and several other billboard companies,competitors of the plaintiff.the agreement exempted the competitors from city regulations limiting their ability to modernize their billboards.because the plaintiff was not a party to the settlement,its billboards would have continued to be subject to those regulations.summit media,supra,th at.after prevailing,the plaintiff sought an award of attorney fees under section,contending it lacked an adequate financial incentive to pursue the litigation because it had sought no damages or other economic recovery.summit media,at.as the court pointed out,however,the plaintiff had alleged in earlier pleadings that the settlement would place it at a substantial competitive disadvantage,threatening it with substantial economic harm and even the failure of its business.id.at.in affirming the trial court denial of fees,the court rejected the dubious proposition that the absence of a monetary award necessarily equates to zero financial benefits.t he absence of a monetary award,or of precise amounts attached to financial incentives,does not prevent a court from determining whether the plaintiff financial burden in pursuing the lawsuit is out of proportion to his individual stake in the matter.id.at.given the potential threat to its profitable business posed by the settlement,the court concluded,t he record supports the trial court conclusion that plaintiff had a personal financial stake in this litigation that was sufficient to warrant its decision to incur significant attorney fees and costs in the vigorous prosecution of this lawsuit,and thus to support the denial of an award under section.summit media,at.similarly,in children families com.of fresno county brown th fresno,the court found an award of attorney fees under section inappropriate because the plaintiff,while it recovered nothing from the lawsuit,stood to lose millions of dollars in funding if its lawsuit was unsuccessful.fresno,at.as the court noted,t he benefit to be obtained
