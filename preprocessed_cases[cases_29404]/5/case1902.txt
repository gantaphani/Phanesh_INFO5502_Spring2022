in this construction litigation,a property owner,as a third party beneficiary,sued a subcontractor in contract and tort for breach of the contract between the subcontractor and the general contractor.the trial court granted judgment in favor of the owner on breach of contract,but against the owner on negligent misrepresentation.the trial court also denied the owner request for prejudgment interest on the contract.however,the trial court granted the owner motion for attorney fees pursuant to an attorney fee clause in the contract.both the owner and the subcontractor appeal,the former on the judgment denying prejudgment interest and negligence liability,the latter on the order awarding attorney fees.we affirm the judgment and attorney fee order in their entirety.
in late,plaintiff vincent loduca,began to develop property to build a custom home for him and his family.he retained mcm builders mcm and its principal,steve mishler,to act as general contractor.
in early,mcm solicited a bid from defendant george polyzos,doing business as quality manufacturing company qmc,to manufacture and install custom cabinetry in the new home.tony xirouhakis,a qmc employee,prepared two bids for the project.after consulting with plaintiff,mcm accepted the bids.the signed bids became the written contract between qmc and mcm.the parties refer to the bids as the bid and the bid.
under the agreement,qmc agreed to install extensive cabinetry in the new home for a total cost of.the contract required payments as follows percent of the cost as a down payment,percent upon delivery of the cabinets,and the last percent upon completion of the installation.
the contract also included the following clause,typed in all capitals if a court action is brought,prevailing party to be awarded attorneys fees and collection costs,any unpaid balance subject to interest annually.
qmc warranted the work would be completed in a substantial workmanlike manner according to standard practices qmc also represented the project would take between two and three months to complete.
qmc received the first payment on the cabinets in march,commencing the contract.by the end of august,loduca had paid approximately to qmc,about percent of the total purchase price.some of these payments had been made by mcm,and others had been made directly from loduca to polyzos.the project,however,was not completed,and a number of components remained to be delivered.
by an agreement dated november,between loduca and xirouhakis acting for qmc,qmc agreed to deliver the remaining parts and loduca agreed to pay upon delivery.qmc agreed to complete installation by november,except for two components,including an entertainment center,which qmc agreed to deliver by november and install by november.the parties agreed qmc would pay a penalty of per day for every day after november and november in which the project is not completed due to delay caused by qmc.
when the goods arrived around november,loduca gave xirouhakis a check for.as he inspected the goods,however,he noticed the cabinet doors did not fit.other ordered doors and parts were missing.he also learned from a qmc worker there was no entertainment center being constructed in qmc shop.loduca called his bank and stopped payment on the check.in response,qmc filed a mechanic lien against the project in the amount of.
on november,all of the cabinetry materials that had been delivered on november along with other cabinetry materials that had not been fastened or nailed down were taken out of the house without loduca permission.loduca and mishler went to qmc warehouse to see if they could recover the items.although they could see some of the items,xirouhakis would not allow access to the warehouse.qmc never completed the job.
ultimately,xirouhakis filed a complaint against loduca for assault and battery.in,loduca filed a against xirouhakis and polyzos individually and as doing business as qmc alleging breach of contract,fraud,negligent misrepresentation,conversion,assault and battery,and intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress.he also sought punitive damages,as well as prejudgment interest and attorney fees as provided in the contract.
the underlying complaint and the assault and emotional distress claims of the were compromised and dismissed.loduca with its remaining causes of action against polyzos was designated as the complaint.
loduca claims were tried without a jury on the second day of trial,defense counsel stipulated that polyzos had in fact breached the contract represented by the bid and the bid.defense counsel also stipulated it would not rely on the november agreement as a defense to loduca breach of contract claim.
later in the trial,all counsel stipulated the total amount of contract damages was.this amount encompassed the amounts loduca had paid to another entity thus far to finish the cabinets and the estimated amount loduca would pay in the future to finish the cabinets.the stipulated amount did not include an award of prejudgment interest,as that issue was left for the court to decide.
counsel also stipulated that if the court determined loduca actually paid to pay off the mechanic lien and that this payment was consequential damage of the breached contract,the court would enter a finding to that effect.
the trial court entered judgment in favor of loduca and awarded in damages calculated as follows the stipulated,plus for satisfying the mechanic lien,and for interest loduca paid on his construction loan that he would not have incurred but for the delays in work caused by qmc breach.
the trial court denied loduca request for prejudgment interest at the rate of percent based on the contract.the court determined the contract clause provided for interest on unpaid balances due qmc,not damage awards given to loduca.even if the clause applied to the judgment award,the court held the rate of percent was usurious.
the court ruled polyzos was liable for conversion,but determined no additional amount in damages was payable for this cause of action.the court held loduca claim for fraud was not established.
as to negligent misrepresentation,the court stated loduca had elected to accept the contract damages,thereby obviating the court obligation to rule on the negligence claims.in any event,the court determined loduca had failed to prove actionable misrepresentation or negligence.
at a subsequent hearing,the trial court awarded attorney fees to loduca pursuant to the contract in the amount of.
both parties appeal.in case no,loduca claims the court erred by denying prejudgment interest under either the contract or civil code section and precluding his claim for negligence damages and finding there was no negligence.in case no,polyzos claims the court erred by awarding loduca attorney fees.we have consolidated the appeals and will resolve both in this decision.
