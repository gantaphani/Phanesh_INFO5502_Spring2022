these consolidated appeals involve a breach of contract.defendant stuke nursery,stuke appeals from the judgment and denial of its postjudgment challenges,and from the postjudgment award of attorney fees,all in favor of plaintiff brittalia ventures brittalia.brittalia from the amount of attorney fees awarded.
the key issue concerned what comprised the contract between stuke and brittalia.we shall affirm the judgment but reverse the award of attorney fees because the contract between the parties did not contain an attorney fee provision.
on the attorney fee issue,we conclude that a prevailing party can not obtain attorney fees under civil code section if the contract it championed did not contain an attorney fee provision,notwithstanding that the losing party defended the matter by championing a different contract that did contain an attorney fee provision.
background 
in early,craig podesta podesta,a walnut farmer doing business as rdj farms,rdj farms,contacted stuke about purchasing howard walnut trees for a orchard.podesta wanted to plant the orchard in a hedgerow configuration consisting of trees.a hedgerow configuration costs significantly more initially,but yields significantly more over time because its quality permits greater density and mechanized farming trees are a must,however,to establish the hedge effect.podesta intended to sell the howard walnuts to japan,where buyers apparently enjoyed their unique flavor.
podesta had heard that stuke had had a problem with crown,localized tumor,in its most advanced stages,can kill a tree and devastate an orchard.according to podesta,he raised the crown gall issue with stuke.he was assured by tommie york york,who handled sales for stuke,and by ron snyder snyder,an expert that stuke had hired,that stuke had corrected the problem.york testified that stuke had a standard response to crown gall would assure growers that they would be buying trees that were not infected with crown gall.crown gall is a common condition.in its early stages,it is difficult to detect.
satisfied with these assurances,podesta,through rdj farms,eventually ordered howard walnut trees with paradox rootstock from stuke in late february for approximately the other trees to be planted came from another nursery,bonilla.this order was documented in a written confirmation dated february,and a corresponding written invoice dated january.we will refer to these two documents collectively as the.
the confirmation part of the was signed by york on behalf of stuke and by podesta on behalf of rdj farms.both the confirmation and the invoice noted rdj farms deposit payment of,and each document contained a number of preprinted standard provisions that were neither discussed nor read.these standard provisions included a disclaimer of express and implied warranties,an as is sale statement,a statute of limitations,and a limitation of the buyer damages to the trees purchase price.the also included a royalty fee of per tree that stuke collected on behalf of the university of california,which had patented the howard variety.
in,rdj farms and stuke cancelled the.evidence showed that each side had its reasons for doing so.
for rdj farms,podesta was not keen on being the last person likely to pay the howard royalty,which was expiring on april,and any orchard planting would be occurring after that date.furthermore,for tax purposes,podesta in the interim had now made rdj farms his processing company and brittalia his farming company.
stuke,for its part,had made a computational error in the that understated the price of the trees by furthermore,stuke wanted the entire purchase price to be paid in advance.
consequently,as york explained,the was cancelled,no royalty was paid,and that contract was forgotten about.
stuke then sent a written purchase proposal to brittalia dated february.this proposal listed each of the categories of the howard trees to be sold,corrected the computational error in price now,a total price was due of,deleted the royalty fee,specified the delivery and cold storage fees,and specified the conditions of sale cash in advance customer waives inspection and return of the deposit.brittalia sent stuke a check dated february,for the,stating in an accompanying note paid in full invoice of.thank you for your time and trouble on this matter,it is greatly appreciated,you can be assured that you have a happy customer.craig podesta.the february,documents did not contain any of the standard preprinted provisions warranty disclaimers,limitations on bringing suit and requesting damages contained in the.
stuke then delivered the trees to brittalia over three days in late april,accompanied by three delivery receipts.each receipt was signed by brittalia orchard foreman,and contained the standard preprinted provisions on warranty disclaimers and lawsuit limitations noted above.
stuke also sent brittalia a final invoice dated may,acknowledging the paid,but containing changes to the delivery and cold storage charges these charges still comprised a small fraction of the total purchase price.this invoice also contained the standard preprinted provisions on warranty disclaimers and lawsuit limitations noted above.toward the end of,stuke alerted brittalia that it may have delivered some walnut trees that were not howards.it turned out that of the stuke trees were not howards.stuke assured brittalia that it would fix the problem.
as these remedial efforts regrafting were underway,podesta began noticing around the spring of that some of the stuke trees were displaying crown gall.podesta notified stuke about the crown gall,but stuke did not respond the problem remained the focus.stuke continued to refuse to discuss the crown gall issue.by the time of trial,approximately percent of the stuke trees were visibly infected with crown gall,compared with less than one percent of the trees in the bonilla section of the orchard.
stuke continued to work with brittalia regarding the problem until april,when york informed podesta that brittalia would now have to sue stuke.
brittalia did just that,suing stuke for breach of express warranty regarding the trees,and for breach of implied warranties concerning the and the crown gall problem.brittalia had also sued for fraud and negligent misrepresentation,but dismissed those claims at trial.
at trial,brittalia argued that its contract with stuke consisted only of the february,purchase proposal and check and warranties not excluded therein.brittalia sought million in damages.stuke defended,contending that the contract included the additional,standard preprinted provisions including the warranty disclaimers and the lawsuit limitations contained in the documents beginning with the and culminating with the may,final invoice.
in a general verdict,the jury found in brittalia favor on its claims for breach of express warranty and for breach of implied warranty,and awarded brittalia nearly million in damages.stuke moved unsuccessfully for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for new trial.the trial court subsequently awarded brittalia nearly in attorney fees as the prevailing party on the contract claims pursuant to civil code section.
these appeals ensued,which we consolidated at the parties request.

standard of review and posture of appeal regarding contractual issues 
we agree with brittalia that the underlying issue in this appeal asks what are the terms of the contract governing stuke sale of goods to brittalia the underlying question,then,is not what the contract at issue means,but what that contract is.and the evidence on this question was conflicting.consequently,our standard of review is the substantial evidence test rather than an independent interpretation of the,is there any substantial evidence to support the jury determination of what comprised the contract see judicial council of california civil jury instructions,caci,regarding essential factual elements of contract given here see foreman clark fallon cal d,foreman clark whether there is any substantial evidence contradicted or uncontradicted which will support the finding of fact contra,parsons bristol development cal d,contractual interpretation is ordinarily a question of law.

the jury determination of the terms of the contract 
that brings us to the issue of whether there is any substantial evidence to support the jury implicit factual finding that the contract between brittalia and stuke was comprised only of stuke february,purchase proposal and brittalia check of that same date and warranties not excluded therein.
stuke centers its case on all the other documents relating to its interaction with in addition to the february,purchase proposal.these other documents encompass a february,confirmation that preceded the and confirmed a different mix of trees the podesta,on behalf of rdj farms,signed the confirmation part of this the three april delivery receipts and the final invoice of may.all of these other documents contained standard,preprinted provisions disclaiming all warranties and specifying the sale of the goods as is and with all faults.under the commercial code,unless excluded or modified,a warranty of merchantability,fitness for ordinary purposes is implied in any sale by a with respect to goods of the kind sold,and a warranty of fitness for a particular purpose is implied where the seller has reason to know that the buyer desires goods to be used for a particular purpose and is relying on the seller skill and judgment to furnish such goods.see,subds,c,see witkin,summary of cal.law ed.sales.implied warranties extend to latent defects.moore hubbard johnson lumber d.
in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence in a civil appeal,the power of an appellate court begins and ends with a determination as to whether there is any substantial evidence,contradicted or uncontradicted,which will support the trier of fact conclusion.foreman clark,supra,cal d at.
here,the evidence showed that the between rdj farms and stuke was cancelled and forgotten about.the february,confirmation,which was a forerunner to the,consequently fell with the latter demise.evidence showed that each side had its reasons for cancelling the for podesta,the deletion of the howard royalty payment,and the change of his farming operation from rdj farms to brittalia for stuke,the correction of the undercharge error,and the chance to be paid in full in advance.
this cancellation rendered the february,purchase proposal between brittalia and stuke the pivotal document in their contractual relationship.this proposal specified the conditions of sale cash in advance customer waives inspection return of the deposit.these conditions did not include a warranty disclaimer or specify an as is sale.
the warranty disclaimer and as is provisions did,however,return to the transactional fold in the form of the three delivery receipts in april and the final invoice in may.but the jury could reasonably discount the significance of these documents in the contractual equation.these documents came after the pivotal february,purchase proposal had been accepted by brittalia purchase check payment in advance.the purchased trees were then simply delivered to brittalia via the delivery receipts,which were signed by brittalia orchard foreman evidence showed that the foreman did not have the authority to enter into contracts on brittalia behalf.the may final invoice essentially reiterated the february purchase proposal,but contained immaterial modifications to the delivery and cold storage fees.
in addition to the documents aside from the february,purchase proposal,stuke points to evidence of the parties course of performance their prior dealings and custom in the walnut farming industry trade usage.we discuss these in turn.
the parties course of performance did encompass the other documents just described that did contain warranty disclaimers and as is provisions.but as we have seen,the jury reasonably could have found these were not the actual contract documents.more importantly,there was evidence that stuke had assured podesta it had corrected its crown gall problem at its nursery that stuke standard response to crown gall inquiries was to assure growers that the trees it was selling were not infected with crown gall and that stuke acknowledged its responsibility here for delivering trees of the correct type and without significant crown gall infection.along these lines,evidence showed that stuke initially identified and worked with brittalia to fix the problem,and only balked at remedial efforts when a significant crown gall problem was also disclosed.there is no evidence that stuke,prior to this lawsuit,ever invoked any warranty disclaimer or as is provision in its contract with brittalia.
the evidence of the parties prior dealings consisted of two dated invoices,one in and the other in,which contained a warranty disclaimer and an as is provision.but these two invoices also stated all stocks are guaranteed to be delivered to buyer in good condition,to be up to grade,and to pass state inspection.stuke will replace,regraft or refund the cost of any trees falling short of this guarantee.
as for the walnut industry custom,stuke evidence consisted only of its dealings with podesta bonilla bill to podesta that contained a warranty disclaimer and podesta testimony that he had signed contracts with other nurseries containing warranty disclaimers.
this evidence,together with the evidence relied on by stuke of the other documents aside from the february,purchase proposal,is not sufficient,as a matter of law,to override the substantial evidence supporting the jury determination of the terms comprising the contract at issue here.
we conclude there is substantial evidence to support the jury implicit finding that the contract between stuke and brittalia did not contain a warranty disclaimer or an as is provision.consequently,the jury findings that stuke breached express and implied warranties as to brittalia can not be overturned on this basis.
also,the jury supported implicit finding that the contract between stuke and brittalia encompassed the february,purchase proposal and purchase check without the standard,preprinted provisions found in the other documents asserted by stuke defeats three other contentions that stuke has raised on appeal.stuke has contended that brittalia implied warranty claims were barred by the standard provision on warranty disclaimers brittalia express and implied warranty claims were barred by the standard provision on statute of limitations and any damages were limited to the purchase price by the standard provision on damage limits.
inherent susceptibility and timely and adequate notice regarding crown gall 
stuke raises two other points in arguing that it was not liable for breaching any implied warranties concerning crown gall.
first,stuke argues it was undisputed that paradox root trees a
