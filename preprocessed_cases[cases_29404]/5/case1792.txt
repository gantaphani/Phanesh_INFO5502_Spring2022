we described the facts of the underlying accident in our prior published opinion,safeco ins.of america parks th,d safeco i,and again,more briefly,in our subsequent unpublished opinion,safeco ins.of america parks july,wl safeco ii.in summary,during the early morning hours of february,parks was walking on highway north of santa barbara when he was struck by a passing motorist.parks suffered serious,permanent injuries in the collision including having his leg amputated.he was on the side of the freeway because his then girlfriend,old michelle miller,and two of her friends left him there.miller had been driving parks,who was drunk,from santa barbara to his home in santa maria when the car got a flat tire.she called a friend,teresa cooney,to pick them up.cooney arrived with her friend isaiah rivera and the group started back to santa maria in cooney car.parks was soon forced out of the car because he was being violent toward miller.over one mile and more than minutes later,parks was struck by a car as he walked back to his own car.
at the time,miller lived with her father,charles miller,and grandmother evelyn miller,in a condominium rented by the grandmother.miller parents were divorced.her father,charles,had sole legal and physical custody of michelle.her mother was living with eddie barnette whom she later married.miller sometimes stayed with her mother at barnette house.barnette had a homeowner insurance policy issued by safeco.
parks sued cooney,rivera and miller.cooney automobile insurer provided all three with a defense,retaining richard phillips to represent them.cooney and rivera settled with parks for the policy limits of.phillips tendered miller defense to safeco under the homeowner policy issued to barnette.safeco declined the defense.miller and parks submitted their claims to binding arbitration.the arbitrator,a retired superior court judge,james slater,found in favor of parks,awarding damages of after a percent reduction for comparative fault.a judgment in that amount was entered against miller in january.miller settled with parks by assigning to him any claims she might have against safeco.
in july,parks sued safeco to recover the judgment he obtained against miller the bad faith action.he alleged that safeco breached the barnette policy and its implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by refusing,in bad faith,to defend miller under the barnette policy and to settle within the limits of that policy.in august,safeco filed a separate action for declaratory relief against miller and parks,alleging that it had no duty to defend or indemnify miller under the barnette policy the declaratory relief action.the two cases were consolidated.
parks served safeco with requests for production of documents that asked safeco to produce all applicable insurance policy or polices providing coverage for the nature and extent of the damages alleged,and all applicable umbrella insurance policy or policies providing coverage for the nature and extent of the damages alleged safeco objected that the document requests were vague,ambiguous,overbroad,burdensome and oppressive and that the documents they sought were not relevant or reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.it declined to produce any documents in response to the requests.parks did not move to compel further responses to the request for production of documents.
the bad faith action was stayed while the parties tried the declaratory relief action to the court sitting without a jury.charles miller testified at the trial.afterwards,he went home and asked his mother evelyn,apparently for the first time,whether she had any insurance on her condominium.charles then discovered that safeco had issued evelyn a renter insurance policy covering the condominium.he gave the policy to michelle or to her lawyer.
in august,the trial court entered a declaratory judgment in favor of parks and against safeco,finding that safeco had a duty to defend and to indemnify miller because she was an insured under the barnette policy.the parties agreed to rescind the order consolidating the bad faith and declaratory relief actions and to stay the bad faith action until further order of the court.
safeco appealed the declaratory judgment in october.in august,we reversed,holding that safeco had no duty to defend miller under the barnette policy because she was not an insured under that policy.safeco i,supra,th at,d.
in september,parks counsel demanded that safeco pay the policy limits under the policy issued to evelyn miller.safeco assigned the claim to james diley,an adjuster who had not participated in the prior coverage determination or the litigation between safeco and parks.diley interviewed charles miller and reviewed portions of the transcripts of charles and michelle miller depositions in the personal injury action.he purposefully did not review the claims file for the barnette policy because he wanted to make an independent evaluation of the present claim.diley also did not review the arbitrator award in parks miller.within one week of receiving the demand letter from parks counsel,diley concluded that michelle was an insured under the policy issued to her grandmother and its automobile exclusion did not preclude coverage.he forwarded a check for the policy limits of to parks on september.in may,after receiving another demand from parks,safeco forwarded to him a check for the medical payments coverage limits.
in february,parks amended his complaint in the bad faith action to allege for the first time that safeco had a duty under the policy issued to evelyn miller the miller policy to pay the judgment and that it breached the implied covenant of good faith by refusing to defend or indemnify miller under the miller policy.
as required by our decision in safeco i,the trial court,in june,entered a declaratory judgment in favor of safeco.it later reversed itself,however,denying safeco motions for costs and attorneys fees and eventually vacating the judgment entirely.the trial court reasoned that,although we held safeco had no duty to defend miller,we had not decided whether it had a duty to indemnify her.as a result,the trial court decided it had prematurely entered judgment in favor of safeco.
safeco appealed a second time.we reversed in safeco ii,holding that there could be no duty to indemnify without a duty to defend in the prior appeal,we considered only safeco potential duty to defend miller under the barnette policy.we held that it had no such duty.it follows that safeco has no duty to indemnify miller under that policy.safeco ii,supra,at.our opinion noted that,while the holding in safeco i,foreclosed continued litigation with respect to the barnette policy,the declaratory judgment had no res judicata or collateral estoppel effect on the question of whether safeco owes a duty to defend or indemnify miller under the policy issued to her grandmother.id.
on remand,the declaratory relief action was transferred to another department of the superior court and another trial court judge.that judge entered a judgment declaring that safeco had no duty to defend or indemnify defendant michelle miller under the barnette policy.the court reserved for future determination the question of whether safeco was entitled to recover its costs as a prevailing party.
meanwhile,the bad faith action proceeded to trial.the jury found in favor of parks on both his judgment creditor claim alleging breach of the miller policy and his cause of action for breach of the covenant of good faith implied in that policy.the trial court entered judgment in favor of parks,awarding damages of and reserved the question of costs for a future hearing 
in the declaratory relief action,safeco sought a cost award of,which included a claim for in attorneys fees.safeco contended it was entitled to attorneys fees as cost of proof sanctions,because parks failed to admit,in response to a request for admission propounded by safeco,that michelle miller was not an insured under the barnette policy.parks moved to tax all of safeco costs on the grounds that safeco could not be declared the prevailing party unless it also prevailed in the bad faith action.he opposed the award of cost of proof sanctions because he contended that he had a reasonable ground for believing he would prevail on the issue of miller status as an insured under the barnette policy,subd.b.the trial court continued the hearing until after the jury returned its verdict in the bad faith action.it then found that safeco was not entitled to recover costs because,on balance,it was not the prevailing party.it further found that safeco was not entitled to cost of proof sanctions because parks reasonably believed he would prevail on the question of miller status as an insured.
in the bad faith action,the trial court awarded parks costs of.parks moved for cost of proof sanctions under section,based on safeco failure to admit,in response to requests for admission,that it owed michelle miller a defense under evelyn miller policy,and that it breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing with regard to its claims handling of parks miller the trial court awarded parks attorney fees of.
contentions 
safeco appeals the judgment in the bad faith action.it contends parks cause of action for breach of the covenant of good faith implied in the miller policy is barred by the applicable statute of limitations the trial court erred when it denied safeco motion for summary adjudication of that cause of action because a miller did not comply with the policy notice provisions b miller received an adequate defense from another insurer and c there is no substantial evidence that safeco rejected a policy limits settlement demand parks and miller impermissibly split their causes of action under the miller policy safeco had no duty to settle the personal injury action because the automobile exclusion in the miller policy precludes coverage for parks injuries safeco was denied its right to a jury trial on the amount of parks damages the trial court erred in its instructions to the jury concerning a the duty to initiate settlement negotiations,b safeco contract defenses,and c the definition of reasonable conduct by an insurer the trial court erred in removing from the jury consideration the question of whether the judgment in the underlying personal injury action was collusive the trial court made erroneous evidentiary rulings relating to testimony by parks counsel and safeco conduct during discovery parks was not entitled to recover attorney fees as damages pursuant to brandt superior court,supra,cal d,the amount of the judgment was incorrectly calculated the trial court erred in awarding parks his attorney fees as cost of proof sanctions the trial court erred in its cost award to parks and the trial court erred in the declaratory relief action when it struck safeco memorandum of costs and refused to award safeco its attorneys fees as cost of proof sanctions 
on the parks contends the trial court erred when it granted safeco summary adjudication of his judgment creditor claim,subd.b,to collect the entire judgment in the personal injury case.he makes a similar contention with respect to his first cause of action and requests that we reverse the judgment on that count if we reverse the judgment as to the cause of action for bad faith alleged in count.because we affirm the judgments,except for the order granting parks attorney fees,we need not address the latter contention.
discussion 
issues raised in safeco unsuccessful motion for summary adjudication and the absence of prejudice.
safeco moved for summary adjudication of parks cause of action for breach of the implied covenant on the grounds that its duties to defend,settle or indemnify never arose because miller breached the policy notice provisions that miller was not prejudiced by safeco failure to defend because she received a defense from another insurer and that safeco never rejected a policy limits settlement demand.the trial court denied the motion.safeco contends this was error.parks contends an order denying summary adjudication can not be reviewed on appeal.
if a trial court denies summary judgment or adjudication because it erroneously concludes that disputed issues of material fact exist,and those issues are resolved against the moving party at a trial on the merits,the error in denying summary judgment can not result in reversal of the final judgment unless that error resulted in prejudice to the defendant.waller tjd,th,d see also california housing finance agency management accounting center,th,d denial of summary judgment not prejudicial where jury later resolved fact issues adversely to moving party.the applicable standard of prejudice is that described in article vi,section of the california constitution a judgment can not be set aside unless,after an examination of the entire cause,including the evidence,the court shall be of the opinion that the error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.cal,art.vi,waller tjd,supra,th at,d.we apply that same standard of prejudice here.
notice to safeco under the miller policy.
safeco argued that its duty of good faith and fair dealing under the miller policy never arose because michelle miller tendered her defense only under the barnette policy and there was no evidence safeco had actual knowledge of the miller policy when it declined the defense the trial court correctly rejected this argument because the adequacy of safeco investigation of miller claim and the prejudice it may have suffered from delayed notice were disputed issues of material fact.
the duty of good faith and fair dealing implied in every insurance contract includes a duty on the part of the insurer to investigate claims submitted by its insured.a n insurer can not reasonably and in good faith deny payments to its insured without thoroughly investigating the foundation for its denial.egan mutual of omaha ins.cal d.these duties,however,arise after the insured complies with the claims procedure described in the insurance policy.kpff california union ins.th,d paulfrey blue chip stamps d.insurer responsibility to investigate would not arise unless and until insured files claim or makes good faith effort to comply with claims procedure.w ithout actual presentation of a claim by the insured in compliance with claims procedures contained in the policy,there is no duty imposed on the insurer to investigate the claim.california shoppers royal globe ins.d.
an insured failure to comply with the notice or claims provisions in an insurance policy will not excuse the insurer obligations under the policy unless the insurer proves it was substantially prejudiced by the late notice.clemmer hartford ins.cal d,campbell allstate ins.cal d.prejudice is not presumed from delayed notice alone.citations.the insurer must show actual prejudice,not the mere possibility of prejudice.shell oil winterthur swiss ins.th,d.where,as here,the insurer denies coverage,it may establish substantial prejudice only by demonstrating that,in the event that a timely tender of the defense in the underlying action had been made,it would have undertaken the defense.clemmer hartford ins,supra,cal d at.if the insurer asserts that the underlying claim is not a covered occurrence or is excluded from basic coverage,the earlier notice would only result in earlier denial of coverage.to establish actual prejudice,the insurer must show a substantial likelihood that,with timely notice,and notwithstanding a denial of coverage or reservation of rights,it would have settled the claim for less or taken steps that would have reduced or eliminated the insured liability.shell oil winterthur swiss ins,supra,th at,d.
here,safeco notice defense was rejected by the trial court on the motion for summary adjudication and later by the jury.those decisions were correct because safeco did not establish that it was prejudiced by the delayed notice.in the declaratory relief action,safeco contended that,even if miller was an insured under the barnette policy,its automobile exclusion precluded coverage for this accident.safeco now relies on the same automobile exclusion to contend there was no potential for coverage under the substantially identical miller policy.as a result,both the trial court and the jury could reasonably infer that safeco was not prejudiced by the late notice because it would have relied on the automobile exclusion to decline the defense under the miller policy.safeco suffered no prejudice by the order denying summary adjudication of the issue.
defense provided by another insurer.
safeco also argued that miller was not damaged by its denial of a defense because she was defended by cooney automobile insurer,california casualty insurance company.the trial court found that the question whether the lawyer did everything possible to defend miller was a triable issue of fact.the jury later found that miller was damaged by safeco failure to defend.
an insured is entitled to only one full defense.san gabriel valley water hartford accident indem.th,d.an insurer refusal to defend is of no consequence to an insured whose representation is provided by another insurer under such circumstances,the insured is not faced with an undue financial burden or deprived of the expertise and resources available to insurance carriers in making prompt and competent investigations as to the merits of lawsuits filed against their insureds.citation.ceresino fire ins.exchange d.horace mann ins.barbara th,d.this result differs,however,where the insurer who accepts the defense has a policy limit far below the amount claimed,and far lower than that of the insurer who declines the defense.under those circumstances,our supreme court has held,where more than one insurer owes a duty to defend,a defense by one constitutes no excuse of the failure of any other insurer to perform.wint fidelity casualty cal d,see also campbell superior court th,d.
here the limit of liability on the miller policy was.the limit of liability on the automobile policy was,split among miller and her two codefendants.the codefendants settled for amounts within the policy limits.miller,on the other hand,suffered an arbitration award and subsequent judgment of over.safeco now contends the judgment may have been collusive,an issue that would not arise had safeco furnished miller a defense.given these facts,the trial court correctly denied summary adjudication.safeco was not prejudiced by the denial of summary judgment on this issue 
safeco rejection of policy limits settlement demand.
safeco contended it was entitled to summary adjudication because it never received a policy limits settlement demand that referenced the miller policy and its rejection of a demand under the barnette policy could not breach the miller policy.the trial court denied summary adjudication because it concluded that the facts were in dispute concerning the adequacy of safeco claims investigation and its receipt of the settlement demand.that ruling was correct.there was evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could find that safeco breached its duties under the miller policy when it failed,in response to michelle miller claim under the barnette policy,to investigate whether it had issued any other policy that might cover her claim.that failure to investigate,in turn,led to safeco rejection of the policy limits settlement demand.safeco was not prejudiced by the order denying summary adjudication.
among the duties imposed on an insurer by the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing are the duty to investigate claims made by its insured and the duty to accept a reasonable settlement demand within policy limits.egan mutual of omaha ins,supra,cal d at,comunale traders general ins.cal d.ordinarily,an insurer breaches the implied covenant by denying an insured claim without first thoroughly investigating all of the possible bases of the claim.jordan allstate ins.th,d.in discharging this duty,the insurer may not ignore evidence which supports coverage.if it does so,it acts unreasonably towards its insured and breaches the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.id.at,d,quoting mariscal old republic life ins.th,d.whether the insurer investigation of a particular claim was reasonable must be determined on a case by case basis and will depend on the contractual purposes and reasonably justified expectations of the parties.chateau chamberay homeowners ass associated international ins.th,d,quoting careau security pacific business credit,d.
administrative regulations adopted by the insurance commissioner provide that,every insurer shall disclose to a first party claimant or beneficiary,all benefits,coverage,time limits or other provisions of any insurance policy issued by that insurer that may apply to the claim presented by the claimant,tit,subd.a.an insurer failure to comply with this regulation does not,in itself,establish a breach of contract or bad faith by the insurer.the regulations may,however,be used by a jury to infer a lack of reasonableness on the insurer part.rattan united services auto.ass th,d.
here,safeco did not investigate whether any safeco policy,other than the barnette policy,provided coverage to miller.the trial court denied summary adjudication because the facts were in dispute and could have supported a finding that safeco investigation was unreasonable.safeco contends the trial court erred as a matter of law because neither the administrative regulation nor the implied covenant require safeco to search for policies it has issued,other than the specific policy referenced by its insured in his or her claim.we are not convinced.
first,the plain language of section contains no such limitation.the regulation requires an insurer to disclose to its insured the terms of any insurance policy issued by that insurer that may apply to the claim presented by the claimant,tit,subd.a,emphasis added.had the insurance commissioner intended to limit disclosure to the policy already relied on by the insured,this regulation would refer to the insurance policy,not to any insurance policy.moreover,the regulations delineate certain minimum standards for the settlement of claims id.at,subd.a.they do not provide the exclusive definition of all unfair claims settlement practices,tit,subd.b.thus,just as a violation of the regulations does not,standing alone,prove the insurer acted unreasonably rattan united services auto.ass,supra,at,d,compliance with them is not alone sufficient to prove reasonable conduct.
second,whatever the scope of these administrative regulations,the conduct required of an insurer to discharge its duties of good faith and fair dealing will vary from case to case.chateau chamberay homeowners ass,supra,th at,d.in some cases,the insurer investigation will only be reasonable if it includes a search for other policies issued by that insurer,in addition to the policy relied on by the insured.we need not here decide whether the insurer may also be obligated to search for other policies issued by other carriers.here,it is only necessary to rule that it was unreasonable for safeco not to search for other policies it had issued after concluding that there was no coverage under the barnette policy.
an insurer duty to conduct a reasonable investigation is not narrowly confined to the facts or theories of coverage relied on by its insured.for example,in jordan allstate ins,supra,th,d,the insured made a claim against her homeowner policy for structural damage in her living room,including failing floorboards.the damage was,her expert concluded,caused by a water conducting fungus.id.at,d.the homeowner policy issued by allstate excluded coverage for loss caused by wet or dry rot and for loss caused by collapse.id.at,d.it provided additional coverage,however,for the entire collapse of all or any portion of the house,where the collapse was a sudden and accidental direct physical loss caused by hidden decay of the building structure id.at,d.allstate relied on the dry rot exclusion to deny coverage.the insured asked allstate to reconsider based only on her contention that the fungus was not dry rot.allstate declined.it did not investigate whether the additional coverage for entire collapse might also apply.
the jordan court reversed a summary adjudication in favor of allstate on the insured bad faith claim because the reasonableness of allstate investigation was a disputed factual issue.w here an insurer denies coverage but a reasonable investigation would have disclosed facts showing the claim was covered,the insurer failure to investigate breaches its implied covenant.the insurer can not claim a genuine dispute regarding coverage in such cases because,by failing to investigate,it has deprived itself of the ability to make a fair evaluation of the claim.citation.thus,although allstate interpretation of the dry rot exclusion was reasonable,it also had a duty to investigate the insured coverage claim that was based on the additional coverage provisions relating to an entire collapse,which was also reasonable and consistent with the insured objectively reasonable expectations.id.at,d.a trier of fact could,the jordan court concluded,find that allstate unreasonably failed to consider the additional coverage,even though the insured claim did not mention that policy provision and even though she never provided allstate with proof of an actual collapse.id.at,d.
jordan,is instructive here,even though it involved a single policy,because it demonstrates that the insurer duty to investigate may extend beyond the facts and coverage theories advanced in an insured claim.here,michelle miller made a claim against the barnette policy on the theory that she was an additional insured under that policy.safeco concluded miller was not an additional insured and declined coverage.at the same time,however,safeco knew that michelle miller lived somewhere.it took the position that she lived with her father and grandmother at the david road condominium.safeco claims file contains no evidence that safeco ever searched its own records for potentially applicable safeco policies issued to the adults with whom michelle resided,or on her place of residence.nor did safeco interview michelle father or grandmother to determine whether they had safeco policies that might cover her claim.these omissions occurred even though safeco unit manager instructed the adjuster to determine whether michelle had other applicable insurance this evidence created issues of fact concerning whether safeco acted unreasonably and breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied in the miller policy by failing,in response to michelle miller claim under the barnette policy,to investigate whether any other safeco policy covered her claim.safeco suffered no prejudice when the trial court denied summary adjudication on this issue.
for the same reasons,we conclude that safeco was not prejudiced by the order denying summary adjudication on the question of whether safeco failed to accept a reasonable policy limits settlement demand.michelle miller made her initial claim in march.parks made a policy limits settlement demand two months later,in may.both the claim and the settlement demand referenced only the barnette policy.at all times,however,safeco took the position that michelle miller resided not with barnette,but with her grandmother.that is why its adjuster and analyst had been directed by their unit manager to search for other potentially applicable safeco policies.its database was searchable by both name and address,and either search would have disclosed the miller policy.thus,if safeco had performed the investigation its own manager considered adequate,it would have found the miller policy.this is true regardless of the specific policy referenced in the insured claim or the third party settlement demand.in this unusual context,we conclude that safeco failure to conduct a reasonable search for other safeco policies breached duties arising under the miller policy to reasonably investigate and settle michelle miller claim.safeco can not rely on its breach of the duty to conduct a reasonable investigation to shield itself from liability for breach of the related duty to accept a reasonable settlement demand.
here,there was evidence that safeco received the may settlement demand.parks made the demand in a letter that was incorrectly addressed.safeco contends it was never received.but there was substantial evidence to the contrary.parks counsel,martin pulverman,testified that he hand delivered the letter to the adjuster,michael pagach.the unit manager,brent french,testified that he had never seen the demand letter,but the casualty analyst,steve small,testified that he had seen it in the file.the jury was permitted to credit the testimony of pulverman and small.in these circumstances,safeco was not prejudiced by the order denying summary adjudication on this issue.
automobile exclusion.
the miller policy excludes coverage for damages,arising out of the ownership,maintenance,use,loading or unloading of motor vehicles owned or operated by or rented or loaned to an insured.safeco contends this exclusion bars coverage for all of parks damages because his injuries arose out of miller negligent driving or unloading of either his car or cooney.safeco contends it was entitled to a directed verdict on this question.parks contends safeco is estopped to rely on the automobile exclusion because it paid the policy limits of the miller policy without reference to the exclusion.he also argues the exclusion is inapplicable because he was injured while walking,after he left cooney car.finally,parks contends that coverage exists because miller negligence in abandoning him on the freeway was an independent,concurrent cause of his injuries.
in determining whether automobile use precludes coverage under a homeowner policy,we ask whether automobile use was the predominating factor in causing the damages at issue prince united nat.ins.th,d american nat.property casualty julie th,d.where both insured risks and excluded risks constitute concurrent proximate causes of an accident,the insurer is liable so long as one of the causes is covered by the policy.state farm mut.auto.ins.partridge cal d.
thus,for example,in partridge,supra,the insured under a homeowner policy negligently filed down the trigger mechanism on a gun so that it discharged with very little force.the same insured then put the gun in a car where it accidently discharged while the insured was driving,injuring a passenger.our supreme court held the automobile exclusion in the homeowner policy did not preclude coverage for the passenger injuries.a lthough the accident occurred in a vehicle,the insured negligent modification of the gun suffices,in itself,to render him fully liable for the resulting injuries i nasmuch as the liability of the insured arises from his conduct in filing the trigger mechanism,and exists independently of any use of his car,we believe the homeowner policy covers that liability.id.
