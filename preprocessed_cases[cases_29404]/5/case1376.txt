after prevailing in administrative proceedings against the district of columbia and district of columbia public schools collectively,the district under the individuals with disabilities education act idea,the children with disabilities and their under the idea provision,id.i b,to recover a portion of their costs that the district refused to pay.the district court granted summary judgment partially in their favor,but declined to include in their award fees paid to expert witnesses beyond the amounts permitted under and see goldring dist.of columbia,slip op.at may,reprinted in joint appendix at.they now appeal,alleging that the district court erred because,as they see it,an award of expert witness fees to a party prevailing under the idea is not so limited.the question before us thus is whether reasonable attorneys fees as part of the costs,words that are used in section,encompass expert fees,words that are not.i b.we say therefore affirm the district under united states supreme court precedent section of the idea precludes the awarding of expert witness fees as part of a prevailing party costs.
to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education designed to meet their unique needs,d a,the idea conditions eligibility for federal education assistance on a state implementation of policies and procedures to ensure that resident children who are in need of special education and related services are identified,located,and evaluated and receive a n individualized education program.id.a.each child individualized education program,or iep,must be developed by a team including the child parents,at least one regular education teacher and one special education teacher,a local educational agency representative who is knowledgeable about the school general education curriculum and the availability of resources and whenever appropriate the disabled child himself.id.d b i iv,vii see reid ex rel.reid dist.of columbia.among other things,the iep must contain a statement of the child current performance level and the special education and related services the child will receive from the school.id.d a i,iii.parents dissatisfied with any matter relating to their child identification,evaluation,or educational placement or the provision of a free appropriate public education to him,id.b,may lodge their complaints with a state educational agency and have their complaints aired at an impartial due process hearing,see id.f,where they are accorded the right to be accompanied and advised by counsel and by individuals with special knowledge or training with respect to the problems of children with disabilities,id.h.under the idea provision,the district court in its discretion,may award reasonable attorneys fees as part of the costs to a prevailing party who is the parent of a child with a disability.in such a proceeding or court action.id.i b.
exercising their statutory rights under the idea,the appellant parents complained to the district about their children educational placements.following due process hearings,they requested the district to reimburse their fees and costs pursuant to the idea statute.with respect to four of the children the district did not dispute that their parents were the prevailing parties and paid a portion of their requested fees.the parents and children sued to recover the balance.
the district court granted partial summary judgment in their favor.see goldring,slip op.at.relevant to this appeal,it concluded that they could not recover the entirety of their expert fees,but instead must be limited to no more than what and permit.id.at.according to the district court,because supreme court precedent holds that when a prevailing party seeks reimbursement for fees paid to its own expert witnesses,a federal court is bound by the limit of section b,absent contract or explicit statutory authority to the contrary,the critical question was whether the idea provides such explicit statutory authority permitting recovery of expert witness fees.id.at quoting crawford fitting gibbons,d.the idea did not,it concluded therefore,it awarded the appellants only in expert witness the they sought.id.at.
the appellants sought reconsideration but were no more successful.see goldring dist.of columbia,slip op.at july,reprinted in at.the district court rejected both of their is,that our decision in moore dist.of columbia,held that a prevailing party is entitled to an award of expert fees under the idea and that the idea legislative history demonstrates that the congress intended a party prevailing under the idea to recover expert fees.see goldring,slip op.at.
the parents and children timely appealed on july.we have jurisdiction to entertain their appeal,see,and on de novo review,see,diamond atwood,we affirm the district court.
the question whether the idea a prevailing party to recover expert fees as part of his costs is one of first impression in our circuit and one not free of controversy in others.to date four of our sister circuits have treated this issue and divided evenly into opposing camps,two holding an idea prevailing party can not recover expert fees,see lagrange sch.dist,cir neosho sch.dist.clark,cir,two holding he can,see murphy arlington cent.sch.dist.bd.of,cir arons bd.of,cir.the district courts have likewise failed to reach a consensus on the question,compare,bd debuono,d,allowing recovery of expert fees bd.of,d,same field haddonfield bd.of,same,with eirschele craven county bd.of,d,refusing recovery of expert fees cynthia bd.of educ.of high sch,wl,at,april,same,including those within our circuit,compare,czarniewy dist.of columbia,slip op.at,wl,allowing recovery of expert fees bailey dist.of columbia,same aranow dist.of columbia,same,with george dist.of columbia,mem.at,refusing recovery of expert fees goldring,slip op.at same.the correct decision does not seem to us to be difficult to reach,for the supreme court has stated in fairly unequivocal terms that language nearly identical to that used in section is unambiguous and,more to the point,does not allow a prevailing party to shift his expert fees.accordingly,today we join the seventh and eighth circuits in holding that a prevailing party under the idea can not recover expert fees.
the idea provision provides that i n any action or proceeding brought under this section,the court,in its discretion,may award reasonable attorneys fees as part of the costs to a prevailing party who is the parent of a child with a disability.i b.that the crucial statutory language reasonable attorneys fees as part of the costs,to allow a prevailing party to shift his expert fees flows directly from the application of two supreme court decisions.one tells us that when a prevailing party seeks reimbursement for fees paid to its own expert witnesses a federal court is bound by the limit of b absent contract or explicit statutory authority to the contrary.crawford fitting gibbons,d.the other tells us that the idea provision contains no such explicit statutory authority to the contrary.see,casey,d.
in casey,the court addressed whether an earlier version of,which provided that the court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney fee as part of the costs,satisfied the crawford fitting explicit statutory authority test.id.at.the court concluded that it did not.id.at.looking to the record of statutory usage,it explained that,w hile some provisions,like,refer only to attorney fees,many others explicitly shift expert witness fees as well as attorney fees.id.at.emphasis in original.by the court count,a t least statutes in different titles of the united states code explicitly shift attorney fees and expert witness costs.id.at.emphasis in original see id.at.in view of a record of usage that demonstrated beyond question that attorney fees and expert witness fees are distinct items of expense,the court concluded that,if it were to hold that the one includes the other,dozens of statutes referring to the two separately become an inexplicable exercise in redundancy.id.at.not surprisingly,the court declined to so hold.accordingly,because section and the version of section construed in casey contain materially identical language and casey held that section language does not enable a prevailing party to shift his expert fees,we can not but conclude that section does likewise.that is the end of the matter for us.
but it is not the end for the appellants.finding the statute text unhelpful,they seek refuge in its history.legislative history is a traditional tool of statutory construction to divine congressional intent,they argue,and,when considered here,it reveals an intent to allow a prevailing party to shift expert fees under section.the appellants point to a single sentence in the house conference report on the handicapped children protection act conference report,which amended the idea 
the conferees intend that the term attorney fees as part of the costs include reasonable expenses and fees of expert witnesses and the reasonable costs of any test or evaluation which is found to be necessary for the preparation of the parent or guardian case in the action or proceeding,as well as traditional costs incurred in the course of litigating the case.
conf,at,reprinted in.while two of our sister circuits have looked to this language in construing section,see murphy,at arons,at,we believe recourse to it is simply unwarranted.
while r eference to statutory design and pertinent legislative history may often shed new light on congressional intent,notwithstanding statutory language that appears superficially clear,natural res.def.council browner,internal quotation marks omitted accord,sierra club epa,consumer ass fcc,we do not confront superficially clear language here.in casey,the supreme court said that the expression reasonable attorneys fees as part of the costs is clear,not just superficially so.see at.rejecting argument that section purpose must overcome ordinary meaning of statutory terms because w here statutory text contains a phrase that is has a clearly accepted meaning in both legislative and judicial do not permit it to be expanded or contracted by the statements of individual legislators or committees during the course of the enactment process.this is good enough for us for when the statute language is plain,the sole function of the least where the disposition required by the text is not to enforce it according to its terms.lamie united states trustee,d internal quotation marks omitted see also ratzlaf united states,d courts should not resort to legislative history to cloud a statutory text that is clear davis michigan dep t of treasury,d legislative history is irrelevant to the interpretation of an unambiguous statute.in our view this case represents a paradigmatic one for application of the principle that statutory text enacted by the congress trumps the views expressed by one of its committees see neosho sch,at absent some ambiguity in the statute,we have no occasion to look to legislative history.accord,at.as we said last term,there would be no need for a repeated admonition from the supreme there should be no resort to legislative history when language is plain and does not lead to an absurd result,if the rule did not apply precisely when plain language and legislative history may seem to point in opposite directions.united states ex rel.totten bombardier.
continuing down this path,the appellants maintain that the conference report gains additional relevance in light of the supreme court apparent reliance on it in casey.the appellants are not alone in this view in reaching a holding contrary to our own,the second circuit found the casey court characterization of this snippet of legislative history as an apparent effort to depart from ordinary meaning and to define a term of art,at,to support its construction of section.see murphy,at.a pparent or no,we conclude,as have two other circuits,see,at neosho sch,at,that the conference report effort is a failure.a sentence in a conference report can not rewrite unambiguous statutory text,particularly text with a supreme and approved meaning.the casey holding declares that w here the statute contains a phrase that is has a clearly accepted meaning in both legislative and judicial do not permit it to be expanded or contracted by the statements of individual legislators or committees during the course of the enactment process.at.citing united states ron pair,d.
nor are we convinced to reach a different result by the appellants other arguments derived from the casey court footnote reference to the conference report.first,we are unpersuaded by the fact that the justice who included the footnote is a reputed textualist.see murphy,at to those who would question our resort to legislative history,we observe that it was justice scalia,a noted skeptic of the use of legislative history,who authored casey dicta about the apparent effort by congress to depart from the ordinary meaning of the term costs in the idea.if the court had found this one sentence of legislative history compelling,it would have included section in its catalogue of statutes authorizing a prevailing party to shift attorney fees as well as expert fees.in other words,the court would have counted a t least such statutes,not.casey,at.
second,we can not agree with the second circuit that it is reasonable to infer that congress,on the basis of the supreme court decision in casey,saw no need to amend the idea because the court had recognized that,in enacting the idea,congress sufficiently indicated in the conference committee report that prevailing parties could recover expert fees under the act.murphy,at.while the supreme court has instructed us that t he fact that inaction may not always provide crystalline revelation should not obscure the fact that it may be probative to varying degrees,johnson transp.agency of santa clara,d accord united states,we doubt that the congress inaction with respect to section following casey is probative at all.more to the point,given that the casey court merely labeled the conference report an apparent effort by the congressional committee and did not number section among the statutes authorizing the recovery of attorney fees and expert fees,we are unwilling to infer from the congress failure after casey to amend section that the congress believed that the supreme court had considered the text to have been altered by the conference report.indeed,given that the version of section construed in casey is nearly identical to section,the more reasonable inference to draw from the fact that,following casey,the congress amended section but not section is that the congress had no intention of allowing recovery of expert fees under the idea.before the court handed down casey,the congress had a proven track record demonstrating its ability to shift expert fees when it desired and,following the court decision,the congress on notice of the precise language required to do so.the former inferential path,in any event,leads to where reason goes to die.
moving from supreme court precedent to our own,the appellants cite our decision in moore dist.of columbia.en banc,cert.denied,d,as well as the procedural history leading up to it,for the proposition that we have long allowed an idea prevailing party to recover expert fees.in moore,however,we addressed only the issue whether the handicapped children protection act authorizes a court to award attorney fees to a party who has prevailed in an administrative proceeding under the education of the handicapped act,id.internal citations omitted,and conclude d that both the text and the legislative history of hcpa evidence congressional intent to authorize recovery of fees by a parent who prevails in eha administrative proceedings.id.at.our holding in moore did not consider whether a prevailing party may shift his expert fees,as appellants themselves readily concede.see appellants br.at th e expert fees issue simply was never addressed.
the appellants last argument is that,given the critical role of professional opinion in assessing the educational needs of a child with disabilities,the upshot of denying an idea prevailing party expert fees will be that parents seeking to contest a school district educational placement may face a severe informational disadvantage the school district.while we are not unsympathetic to the challenges that these and other parents often confront in securing an appropriate free education for their children with disabilities,this line of on considerations of public policy rather than statutory,in our view,addressed to the wrong branch of government under our constitutional design.our job is to interpret the law as it is,not as it should be.see neosho sch,at t he problems of public policy are for the legislature and the court job is one of interpreting statutes,not redrafting them.quoting welsh boy scouts of,cir.accordingly,a prevailing party under the idea may shift expert fees only to the extent allowed under sections and

for the foregoing reasons,the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
so ordered.
in west virginia university hospitals,casey,d,the supreme court construed the ordinary meaning of the term attorney fees in not to include fees for experts services.id.at.listing statutes that explicitly shift both attorney fees and expert witness fees,see id.at,the court explained that this statutory usage shows beyond question that attorney fees and expert fees are distinct items of expense,id.at.the court further explained that while lower courts may have relied previously on their equitable powers to shift fees for experts services,they did not shift them as an element of attorney fees,see id.at,and at the time was enacted,neither statutory nor judicial usage regarded the phrase attorney fees as embracing fees for experts services,id.at.thus,the court concluded that the clearly accepted meaning in both legislative and judicial practice of the phrase attorney fees was unambiguous and could not be expanded or contracted by the statements of individual legislators or committees during the course of the enactment process.id.at.the court therefore held that the term attorney fees in did not provide the necessary explicit statutory authority to shift fees for experts services beyond the limits set in and.id.at.quoting crawford fitting gibbons,d.while my colleagues treat this conclusion as the end of the matter because the provision of the individuals with disabilities education act idea,i b,contains the same language construed by the court in casey,op.at,i conclude,in light of this court en banc decision in moore district of columbia,en banc,that the supreme court definition of the ordinary meaning of the term attorney fees does not apply to the idea provision because congress clearly expressed its intent in the conference report to define the phrase attorney fees as part of the costs as a term of art to include fees for experts services.see conf,at,reprinted in at accordingly,i respectfully dissent.
the joint explanatory statement in the conference report accompanying the provision of the idea states 
the conferees intend that the term attorneys fees as part of the costs include reasonable expenses and fees of expert witnesses and the reasonable costs of any test or evaluation which is found to be necessary for the preparation of the parent or guardian case in the action or proceeding,as well as traditional costs incurred in the course of litigating a case.
id.in footnote of the casey opinion,the supreme court explained that this statement did not provide evidence of the ordinary meaning of the term attorney fees in because the specification in the conference report would have been quite unnecessary if the ordinary meaning of the term included those elements.the statement is an apparent effort to depart from ordinary meaning and to define a term of art.casey,at.thus,the court recognized in footnote that congress could depart from the ordinary meaning of the statutory phrase in by defining it as a term of art.while the second and third circuits view the conference report accompanying the idea provision as persuasive evidence that congress intended to authorize recovery of fees for experts services in idea proceedings,see murphy arlington cent.sch.dist.bd.of,cir arons new jersey state bd.of,cir,my colleagues join the seventh and eighth circuits in rejecting reliance on the conference report on the grounds that the supreme court in casey defined the ordinary meaning of the term attorney fees and that the apparent effort in the conference report to depart from that meaning was unsuccessful.see op.at lagrange sch.dist,cir neosho sch.dist.clark,cir.in my view,that conclusion is inconsistent with this court en banc decision in moore and rests on a misreading of casey and crawford fitting.
sitting en banc,this court in moore relied on a conference report as evidence of congressional intent to authorize recovery of attorney fees incurred in idea administrative proceedings.see moore,at.in so doing,the court recognized that a conference report is the most persuasive evidence of congressional intent after statutory text itself.id.quoting demby schweiker.similarly,in relying on the conference report accompanying the idea provision as evidence of congressional intent to allow the shifting of fees for experts services in idea proceedings,the second circuit in murphy explained why a joint explanatory statement in a conference report is more persuasive as evidence of legislative intent than a committee report prepared before either the house or the senate has passed a bill.see murphy,at.because a conference report represents the final statement of terms agreed to by both houses,next to the statute
