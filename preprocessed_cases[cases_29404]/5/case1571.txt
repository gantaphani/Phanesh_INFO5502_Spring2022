factual and procedural background 
plaintiff huskinson brown is a law firm that specializes in defending health care providers.beverly sanchez approached plaintiff with a potential medical malpractice claim against a health care provider.plaintiff referred the matter to defendants mervyn wolf and the law firm of appell wolf.although defendants took responsibility for prosecuting sanchez action,plaintiff paid to a medical expert involved in her lawsuit.plaintiff also performed hours of legal services on sanchez case,which the trial court later valued at per hour.in exchange for the referral,defendants orally agreed to pay plaintiff percent of any attorney fees recovered.
following a judgment in sanchez favor,defendants received attorney fees from sanchez but failed to pay percent of the fees to plaintiff in accordance with their oral agreement.plaintiff then sued defendants for,among other things,breach of contract,unjust enrichment,and recovery in quantum meruit.
the matter was tried to the court.the trial court denied recovery on plaintiff breach of contract cause of action,finding the agreement unenforceable because it was not disclosed to sanchez in writing and her written consent was not obtained.on the unjust enrichment cause of action,however,the court awarded,an amount equal to what plaintiff would have received under the unenforceable agreement.as an alternative to the unjust enrichment award,the court awarded plaintiff in quantum meruit for the legal services and costs it rendered on behalf of sanchez.
the court of appeal agreed that breach of contract recovery was unavailable,but reversed the judgment and directed the trial court to enter a new judgment awarding plaintiff in damages and an additional sum for costs and disbursements under code of civil procedure section.the appellate court concluded the unjust enrichment award was in error because the contractual arrangement violated rule.it further found the alternative quantum meruit award of improper to the extent of that award represented fees for legal work 
we granted plaintiff petition for review and later ordered briefing,limited to the issue of quantum meruit recovery.
discussion 
rule provides in relevant part that a member of the state bar shall not divide a fee for legal services with a lawyer who is not a partner of,associate of,or shareholder with the member unless t he client has consented in writing thereto after a full disclosure has been made in writing that a division of fees will be made and the terms of such division rule a.in chambers kay cal th,d,chambers,we held that an attorney may not recover on an agreement with another attorney to divide contingent fees generated from the successful prosecution of a client case in the absence of compliance with rule written client consent requirement.the central issue here is whether,in the absence of written client consent to an agreement between law firms to divide fees,a law firm that is barred from dividing fees under rule may nonetheless recover from the other law firm in quantum meruit for the reasonable value of services it rendered to advance the client case 
quantum meruit refers to the principle that the law implies a promise to pay for services performed under circumstances disclosing that they were not gratuitously rendered.long rumsey cal d.to recover in quantum meruit,a party need not prove the existence of a contract maglica maglica th,d mayborne citizens trust savings bank,but it must show the circumstances were such that the services were rendered under some understanding or expectation of both parties that compensation therefor was to be made estate of mumford cal,see long rumsey,supra,cal d at,crane derrick cal,see generally witkin,summary of cal.law ed.contracts.here,the quantum meruit award reflects the trial court implicit determination that plaintiff did not gratuitously offer the services covered by that award and that all parties herein expected plaintiff would be compensated for its work in the event attorney fees were recovered in sanchez case.nonetheless,defendants contend,in essence,that they owe plaintiff nothing because allowing recovery on an implied promise to pay for plaintiff services is tantamount to permitting a division of client fees,in contravention of rule 
to resolve this issue,we look first to rule to ascertain what it seeks to accomplish.by its terms,the rule expressly prohibits attorneys from divid ing a fee for legal services when certain requirements,such as written client consent to the fee division after a full written disclosure of its terms,have not been met.notably,however,rule does not purport to restrict attorney compensation on any basis other than a division of fees.nor does it suggest that attorneys or law firms are categorically barred from making or accepting client referrals,from agreeing to a division of labor on a client case,or from actually working on a case where labor is divided.
the question arises whether a quantum meruit award for services rendered in reliance on a agreement that lacks written client consent constitutes a division of fees within the rule contemplation.we think not.true,a quantum meruit award as such would serve to compensate for legal services that have been performed pursuant to an agreement rendered unenforceable under rule.but when based on the reasonable value of those services,such an award involves no apportionment of the fees that the client paid or has agreed to pay and therefore is not a fee division subject to rule client disclosure and consent requirements.
formal opinion of the state bar standing committee on professional responsibility and conduct state bar,formal opinion clarifies that rule does not apply where there is no direct division of fees.for example,if a law office that works directly with a client agrees to pay an outside lawyer per hour for his or her services,and bills that work to the client at,the proposed compensation would not trigger rule requirements because the outside lawyer would not be paid a percentage of the fees collected from the client.state bar,formal opn,supra,at.that is,the amount paid to the outside lawyer is not tied to specific legal fees received by the law office.id.at.like an hourly fee arrangement,an award of compensation based on the number of hours plaintiff worked on sanchez case would not divide or be otherwise tied to the specific legal fees she paid.
we next examine whether allowing recovery in quantum meruit would undermine compliance with the rules of professional conduct.as we recently explained,the purpose of rule disclosure and consent requirements is to safeguard the right of clients to know how their legal fees will be determined and the extent of,and the basis for,their attorneys sharing of fees.chambers,supra,cal th at,d.in the case of pure referral fee arrange
