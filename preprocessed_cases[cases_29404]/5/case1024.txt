factual and procedural background 
in spring,wells fargo notified various credit reporting agencies that grove was delinquent on an automobile loan.grove disputed that he was behind in his payments and sent letters to wells fargo requesting that it submit corrected information to the credit reporting agencies.grove filed a lawsuit under the fcra when wells fargo refused to correct the information it had provided the agencies.a mediation session did not result in a settlement,and the parties proceeded with discovery,including depositions and document production.
on the eve of trial,the parties reached a settlement.pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure,the district court entered the parties stipulated judgment,which provided that wells fargo would submit a written request to the credit reporting agencies to delete the disputed information in grove credit report.it also provided that wells fargo would pay grove plus costs incurred to date and recoverable attorney fees.the judgment concluded that grove was the prevailing party and that he was entitled to recover his reasonable attorney fees and costs in this action by filing a motion with the court and that wells fargo may contest the amount of the fees and costs to be awarded,but not plaintiff entitlement to the same.
