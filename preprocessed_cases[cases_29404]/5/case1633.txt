background 
much of the history of this case is discussed in our prior opinions,and we will repeat only what is necessary to explain our disposition.in,some years after she first sued miller and others for fraud and related torts,cardinale sued miller,knapp,and various other individuals and entities to enforce the judgment she won against miller in her fraud suit and a related bankruptcy action.her complaint alleged that miller,aided and abetted by other defendants,operated a refinance ponzi scheme through which he shielded his assets from cardinale attempts to collect on her judgments.the complaint alleged miller did this by obtaining loans on properties he owns and controls through sham entities and family members,and converting the loan proceeds to his own personal use.he would then either force a discounted payoff of prior loans without recording a reconveyance,so that to his creditors the properties appeared to have no equity,or would simply allow the loans to default.
cardinale alleged that knapp and chl salesperson derald kenoyer conspired in this scheme to drain the equity from miller property by brokering at least loans for miller sham entities in exchange for highly remunerative brokerage commissions.knapp knew or should have known that miller was the actual recipient of the loan proceeds,that the point of miller and kenoyer enterprise was to defraud miller creditors,and that miller had a dismal record of defaults and foreclosures.knapp allegedly allowed miller and kenoyer activities to continue so he could reap extravagant commissions.the complaint alleged knapp knew kenoyer was arranging the loans without loan applications,reference to lending standards,or regard to the borrowers creditworthiness that knapp knew or should have known the borrowing entities were a sham and that the loans were inadequately secured and being used to get money out of the secured properties.the complaint further allege d knapp deliberately breached his duty to supervise and regulate kenoyer because kenoyer activities were extremely profitable.cardinale miller,supra.
the trial court sustained knapp demurrer to cardinale cause of action for conspiracy to commit fraudulent transfers,but this court held the complaint sufficiently stated a claim for fraudulent transfers against miller and the related conspiracy claim against the broker defendants.id.at.in the meantime,cardinale obtained a default judgment against miller.after she prevailed on her appeal,cardinale proceeded to a jury trial against the broker defendants and daniel miller,miller senior 
we will save most discussion of the evidence for our discussion of the discrete legal issues raised by this appeal.suffice it to say that the jury found in favor of cardinale on all issues.there were fraudulent transfers of property interests from miller to other defendants miller controlled the entities that held title to the subject properties and he fraudulently transferred his legal or equitable interest in one or more of those properties.on the conspiracy count,the broker defendants and miller senior were found to have conspired with or aided and abetted miller in stripping his equity in properties for the purpose of hindering,delaying or defrauding cardinale,and that their conduct was a substantial factor in causing her loss.the jury awarded compensatory damages of.in a second phase of trial on punitive damages,the jury added a punitive award of,comprised of against knapp individually,against chl,and against miller senior.cardinale was also awarded in attorneys fees.
this appeal timely followed.
discussion 
substantial evidence supports the jury findings 
the complaint alleged a cause of action for enforcement of judgments against miller and sham entities pashlin pashlin and villa diamante llc villa diamante.as to all defendants,the complaint alleged fraudulent transfers and conspiracy to engage in fraudulent transfers under the uniform fraudulent transfer act ufta,et a fraudulent transfer under the ufta involves a transfer by the debtor of property to a third person undertaken with the intent to prevent a creditor from reaching that interest to satisfy its claim.citation.a transfer made by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor,whether the creditor claim arose before or after the transfer was made,if the debtor made the transfer as follows with actual intent to hinder,delay,or defraud any creditor of the debtor,subd.a.filip bucurenciu th.
the broker defendants contend they can not be liable for conspiring to commit fraudulent transfers because,under their theory,there was no evidence that anyone committed tortious acts surrounding the alleged fraudulent transfers.conspiracy is not a cause of action,but a legal doctrine that imposes liability on persons who,although not actually committing a tort themselves,share with the immediate tortfeasors a common plan or design in its perpetration.citation.by participation in a civil conspiracy,a coconspirator effectively adopts as his or her own the torts of other coconspirators within the ambit of the conspiracy.applied equipment litton saudi arabia cal th,applied equipment.here,the underlying tortious acts are the fraudulent transfers under ufta.see generally filip bucurenciu,supra,th at affirming judgment for conspiring to transfer property in violation of the ufta.
appellants argument takes a bit of explaining.they assert there was no underlying ufta violation here because the jury was instructed that a necessary element of the offense was that miller transferred property to defendants.italics added.but,they say,it is undisputed that they were never the recipients of any such transfers,and the only other defendant remaining in the case by the time it went to the jury was miller senior.as for miller senior,they assert that o f all the transactions in evidence,there is no document or any other evidence indicating any transfer of any kind by miller junior or any entity to miller senior.
first and foremost,the ufta requires only that a fraudulent transfer be made to a third party,not to a defendant,subd.a.the jury was properly instructed on the elements of a fraudulent transfer under the ufta and found that miller made such transfers.the simple fact that the instruction referred to transfers to defendants rather than more generally to third parties does not undermine the jury finding that miller violated the ufta.
moreover,cardinale adduced evidence of multiple transactions that involved fraudulent transfers to miller senior,patrice,and pashlin,all of whom cardinale named as defendants.appellants failure to address the evidence in their opening brief or to identify parts of the trial record that would demonstrate its purported absence warrant treating the claimed error as waived.when appellants challenge the sufficiency of the evidence,all material evidence on the point must be set forth and not merely their own evidence.citation.failure to do so amounts to waiver of the alleged error and we may presume that the record contains evidence to sustain every finding of fact.toigo town of ross th,witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal.but the assertion also fails for its lack of merit.there was ample evidence from which the jury could reasonably find fraudulent transfers to miller senior.appellants contentions that specific transfers were either not made by miller junior,or to miller senior,were resolved against them at trial,and we will not disturb those factual determinations.in so far as the evidence is subject to opposing inferences,it must upon a review thereof be regarded in the light most favorable to the support of the judgment.mah see north american accident ins.cal,witkin,supra,appeal.
taking a slightly different tack,appellants contend that transfers to patrice and pashlin do not establish ufta violations because the jury instructions did not explicitly identify them as defendants,or,alternatively,because these two defendants were not before the court at trial because of their default or bankruptcy.nonsense.there is no basis in the record,or,for that matter,in logic,for appellants claim that the jury could not consider transfers to these two named defendants in assessing cardinale claims under the ufta any other conclusion would pointlessly elevate form over substance.appellants further assert for the first time in their reply brief that the evidence does not show any fraudulent transfers to pashlin,but the claim violates our proscription against raising arguments for the first time in a reply brief.obvious considerations of fairness in argument demand that the appellant present all of his points in the opening brief.to withhold a point until the closing brief would deprive the respondent of his opportunity to answer it or require the effort and delay of an additional brief by permission.witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal,granite construction american motorists ins.th,fn.moreover,although the jury instructions might not have explicitly identified patrice and pashlin as defendants,the jury was instructed,without objection,that transfers of title or rights to purchase real property from daniel miller,to controlled entities or to patrice miller and daniel miller,is a transfer.there is no basis here to disturb the jury findings.
ii.the jury findings were sufficient to establish liability 
in a variation on their theme that there can be no liability for conspiracy without proof of an underlying wrong,the broker defendants next assert they can not be held liable for conspiring in or aiding and abetting miller fraudulent transfers because t he special verdict lacked any finding that equity stripping occurred.this argument,too,is meritless.the jury findings in response to questions in the special verdict state that miller fraudulently transferred his assets to sham entities under his dominion and control,and that the broker defendants conspired with or aided and abetted him in stripping his equity in properties for the purpose of hindering,delaying or defrauding cardinale.appellants concede that this latter finding comports with the conspiracy and aiding and abetting instructions because they mention hiding assets and stripping equity,but they argue that what missing is any finding that equity was,in fact,stripped.
perhaps the special verdict could have been more explicit.but,its meaning is sufficiently clear to show the jury made the necessary findings.woodcock fontana scaffolding equipment cal d,courts interpret verdict from its language considered in connection with the pleadings,evidence and instructions irelan yuba gold quartz mining pacific gas electric cal d,verdict construed with reference to instructions.in accordance with cardinale theory of the case,the jury was instructed that cardinale claims that she was harmed by miller fraudulent transfers to hide assets and drain asset equity,and that each of the defendants has responsibility for the harm because each defendant aided and abetted miller in committing these acts.if you find that miller engaged in fraudulent transfers to hide assets and drain asset equity that harmed cardinale,then you must determine whether any of the defendants is also responsible for the harm.a defendant is responsible as an aider and abetter if cardinale proves all of the following.that the defendant knew that miller was engaged in fraudulent transfers to hide assets and drain asset equity in order to avoid payment of cardinale judgments the jury was also instructed that t ransfer means every method of parting with a debtor property or an interest in a debtor property,including through the payment of the creation of a lien or other encumbrance.
on the conspiracy cause of action,the jury was instructed that i f you find that miller committed a fraudulent transfer that harmed cardinale,then you must determine whether defendants are also responsible for the harm,and that if any defendant joined the conspiracy to commit fraudulent transfers by aiding and abetting miller to hide assets and drain asset equity,then that defendant was liable for all acts done as part of the conspiracy.
the jury found that miller committed fraudulent transfers and that appellants conspired or aided and abetted him in stripping his equity in properties for the purpose of hindering,delaying or defrauding cardinale.the jury also found that cardinale was harmed by the conspiracy.in the context of the instructions and the theory of cardinale case as expressed to the jurors from start to finish,the equity stripping was one factor that made the transfers fraudulent.it is therefore not fatal that the verdict form did not include an express finding that miller in fact stripped equity from the properties.such a conclusion is implicit in the jury finding of harm.to the extent appellants now complain the verdict form was insufficient for failing to include a specific finding of equity stripping,they waived the claim by failing to object and request a more formal and certain verdict at trial.behr redmond th,behr.
appellants also contend the jury fraudulent transfer findings are inconsistent with its conspiracy findings.to some extent this contention merely repeats their prior argument.beyond that,their precise point is somewhat difficult to discern.the nub seems to be that the jury was not asked to find that appellants conspired in making the same fraudulent transfers that miller had made.this,again,simply ignores the allegations of the complaint,the jury instructions,and,indeed,the heart of cardinale theory.it also defies common sense,as the jury verdict states that miller fraudulently transferred his interest in the subject properties,that the broker defendants conspired with him in thus stripping his equity in those properties for the purpose of hindering,delaying or defrauding cardinale,and that cardinale was harmed by the scheme.there is no conflict between those findings.in any event,again,it was the broker defendants obligation to point out any possible ambiguity in the verdict form at trial.they did not,so the claim is waived.behr,supra,th at.
iii.damages 
appellants next challenge the compensatory award of.they contend the amount is unsupported to the extent it exceeds the amount of cardinale judgments with accrued interest at the time of trial or the in cash they claim miller garnered from the fraudulent loan transactions.they also assert the award can not include any proceeds of miller fraudulent loans that were disbursed to his other creditors instead of cardinale.the first of these contentions,only,has merit,and requires us to reduce the award.
cardinale essential problem is that neither the trial record nor her appellate brief identifies a theory or evidence that can support an award of damages beyond the amount owed on the uncollected judgments.to the contrary,all indications in the record are that cardinale provided the jury with no other basis for computation of damages her pretrial issue conference statement,for example,said that t he amount of damages in this case,since the lost equity due to the fraudulent transfers far exceeds it,is the amount of the judgment,which she identified as at that time.her trial brief plainly stated that the sum of the unpaid judgments represents the damages claimed by plaintiff
