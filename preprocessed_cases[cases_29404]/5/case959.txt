prior proceedings and factual 
in her complaint,muniz identified a single adverse employment action her demotion from division manager to supervisor and alleged alternative discriminatory motives for ups action in separate claims for retaliation,gender discrimination and age discrimination.muniz contended that the wrongful discrimination was traceable in part to ups negligence in hiring and training its employees.
it appears that muniz only identified one adversary in ups management ron meyer to whom she traced all of her problems.meyer is the only one specifically accused by muniz of retaliation and age and gender discrimination.she does not contend that mary gill,the district manager who demoted her,or ups other managers were gender biased or had any reason to retaliate against her.she maintains that gill and the other managers were influenced by meyer into taking all of the actions upon which this case is brought.
from the record provided,it appears that ups essentially argued that muniz was an example of what has elsewhere been called the peter principle that she had been promoted to her level of incompetence.see laurence peter raymond hull,the peter principle why things always go wrong william morrow ed.in line with this theory,ups apparently argued that meyer was simply the first to recognize muniz failings,and that his efforts were a reasonable attempt to persuade senior management to demote her to a position consistent with her limitations.the jury disagreed and awarded damages.ups does not challenge the jury verdict on appeal.
on march,muniz filed a complaint with the california department of fair employment and housing dfeh alleging that she was demoted based on gender,age and retaliation for engaging in protected activity.the only adverse action muniz mentioned in her state court complaint and in her administrative complaint was the twostep demotion.her complaint about the manager performance improvement plan mpip and the stock bonus came later.muniz filed the instant action on april.
muniz claims for age discrimination,retaliation and punitive damages were resolved against her through summary judgment.after ups moved for summary judgment but prior to oral argument,muniz abandoned her age discrimination claim and no longer argued that her retaliation claim fell under feha as pled.muniz sought to amend her complaint to properly allege retaliation under state labor law,but the district court held that she had waited too long and,in any event,she could not show that her reports of fair labor standards act violations in were close enough in time to permit an inference of causation regarding the adverse employment actions in.muniz claim for negligent supervision and training survived summary judgment but was abandoned at trial.ups concedes that the negligent supervision claim was interrelated with the gender discrimination claim.
the case went to trial on claims of employment discrimination.see muniz united parcel,cv cw,wl,at.the district court described the claims tried and the result as follows 
a jury trial was held on plaintiff feha gender discrimination claim.this claim rested on three alleged adverse actions the denial of a stock bonus her placement on the mpip and her demotion from division manager to supervisor.the jury found that ups decision to deny plaintiff a stock bonus was not motivated by her gender.it concluded that ups decision to place her on an mpip,although motivated by her gender and a substantial factor in causing her harm,was made for both discriminatory and nondiscriminatory reasons and that ups would have made the same decision for a reason however,the jury found that plaintiff gender motivated ups to demote her,it was a substantial factor in causing her harm and ups would not have demoted her for a reason.the jury awarded plaintiff,which was the sum of for her lost earnings,for her past medical expenses and for her past loss 
muniz,wl,at.ups and muniz,each claiming to be prevailing parties,sought attorney fees under feha,california government code section b 
ups brought a number of motions which were decided by the trial court.in that decision,the district court also addressed both parties request for attorney fees.the court found muniz to be a prevailing party and rejected ups motion for attorney fees.the court summarized muniz fee request in the following table 
the district court considered muniz requested fees in determining the lodestar.based upon the district court review of the record,the submissions of the parties,fees awarded in other cases in the same district,and the district court observation of jaffe during trial and earlier proceedings,the district court reduced his requested hourly fee from per hour to per hour.the district court reduced landman requested fee from to and jaffe rate from to per hour.the district court left zaheer quoted fee intact.
initially ups vigorously objected to the hours claimed by the jaffes.the district court largely agreed with ups.it found jaffe record keeping inadequate and sent him back three times to improve it.the court ultimately found that jaffe had not sufficiently proved his hours or jaffe hours and therefore reduced each by percent.the court then multiplied the adjusted hourly rate by the adjusted hours and arrived at a lodestar award of.the district court reduced this amount by a further percent to reflect muniz limited success having recovered and her disproportionate fee request million in fees requested versus awarded resulting in an adjusted fee award of.the district court summarized muniz award for attorney fees and costs as follows 
discussion 
in general,california courts,like their federal counterparts,utilize the lodestar or touchstone approach to determine a proper fee award to a prevailing plaintiff in a civil rights law suit.chavez,at.each attorney reasonable hourly rate is determined,and then that rate is multiplied by the hours reasonably spent in achieving plaintiff victory.id.the result is the lodestar,which may be adjusted up or down to determine an appropriate award in the individual case.id.in the absence of special circumstances which would make the adjusted lodestar amount unjust,it should be awarded to a prevailing plaintiff attorneys.id.at.
ups has narrowly focused its appeal.it does not challenge the jury verdict.it concedes that the district court lodestar calculation,after the reductions noted,was within its discretion except in one particular instance.ups argues that the award of fees to paralegal susan jaffe was based upon inadmissible hearsay.ups directs its primary argument to the court treatment of muniz limited success and its inflated fee request,which ups contends required a substantially greater downward adjustment.
was the fee award to paralegal susan jaffe based upon inadmissible hearsay 
declarations in support of attorney fee awards should be based upon personal knowledge.mardirossian,ersoff,d.jaffe did not file a declaration swearing to the hours she spent on this case.jaffe filed a declaration his third which he alleged was based upon his personal knowledge and in which he stated that he had watched jaffe reconstruct her hours using the same information he used,and that the attached spreadsheet showed her hours.
ups objected that this statement and the accompanying spreadsheet were inadmissible hearsay.muniz argued that jaffe declaration verified jaffe hours based upon his personal knowledge.no evidentiary hearing was held.the district court interpreted jaffe declaration as stating that he had personal knowledge of jaffe hours and tasks,that he watched her reconstruct her hours and the spreadsheet he attached to his declaration showed her hours,and that he could state from personal knowledge that the hours she put down were an approximation of those she actually expended under his supervision on the identified tasks.see strong valdez fine foods,cir rejecting similar hearsay objection and finding that the declaration was an expression of lay opinion.here the declaration would arguably be an expert opinion by jaffe.
our decision on this issue is controlled by the federal rules of evidence.hearsay is a statement by someone who does not testify at a hearing and which is offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement.fed.evid.c.here the matter asserted in the statement is the hours expended by jaffe in this case and contained in the spreadsheet.we are satisfied that the only reasonable interpretation of jaffe declaration is that jaffe provided this information to him.it was therefore hearsay and the district court conclusion to the contrary clearly mistaken.
muniz argues that if the spreadsheet is hearsay,any error was harmless because the trial court had sufficient information to estimate hours reasonably spent by the jaffes,and her adjusted hours reflects the district court conclusion regarding the proper hours.mardirossian analogizes the foundation for an attorney fee award in california to the rule that an injured party must show that he was injured,damaged by persuasive evidence,but is not required to show with certainty the amount of his damage.d at precise calculations of hours spent not required estimates based upon personal knowledge which are a fair approximation will suffice.here,there is no question the jaffes invested some hours in this case,and that the district court knew what tasks they performed.jaffe certainly knew if he assigned work to jaffe and if she completed it.nevertheless,mardirossian requires an evidentiary basis for each aspect of an award.id.in the absence of a more complete explanation from the district court regarding paralegal hours,we can not conclude that allowing hearsay as the sole justification for an award to jaffe was harmless.
did the district court abuse its discretion in failing to reduce the fee award to a greater extent due to limited success and inflated fees 
no reported decision of the california supreme court has held that a trial court abused its discretion by awarding a prevailing plaintiff in a feha case fees based upon the lodestar.the cases like chavez,upon which ups relies,all involve decisions upholding the trial court discretion in adjusting the lodestar calculation and determining fees.see at.these cases provide little support to ups because trial court decisions are not precedential.an appellate decision upholding a particular exercise of trial court discretion does not mean that the appellate court would not have also upheld a substantially different decision.
limited success 
ups argues that the district court did not adequately account for muniz limited success in this case.under both california and federal law,a fee award must be adjusted to reflect limited success.hensley eckerhart,chavez,at.california considers this aspect of federal law persuasive.chavez,at.the limited success determination has two components first,the court must deduct from the lodestar hours spent exclusively on unrelated unsuccessful claims and second,the court must evaluate the remaining hours to determine if they were reasonably necessary to achieve the result obtained.hensley,at odima westin tucson hotel,cir.
a the district court did not abuse its discretion in failing to deduct more time for unsuccessful claims 
california law requires a trial court to adjust a lodestar award to account for time spent exclusively on an unsuccessful claim.chavez,at.it appears that california law follows federal law in evaluating such claims.see envtl.prot.info.ctr.cal.dep t of forestry fire,d,applying limited success analysis set forth in hensley eckerhart and remanding for reevaluation of award of attorney fees under california private attorney general feeshifting statute harman city cnty.of san francisco,d,holding that,on remand,trial court did not abuse its discretion in evaluating attorney fees awarded in civil rights case for limited success under hensley eckerhart.
hensley cautions that,before hours may be deducted specifically for unsuccessful claims,the claims must be suitable for entirely separate lawsuits.at schwarz sec y of health human,cir.they must be distinct in both fact and law.hensley,at harman,d at in evaluating a claim for limited success under hensley,the court must inquire whether the different claims for relief are based on different facts and legal theories.if so,they qualify as unrelated claims.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.to deduct time,the court must find that the time deducted did not aid in proving the successful claims.schwarz,at discussing herrington cnty.of sonoma,cir.ups points to muniz claims for retaliation and age discrimination,which it claims are unrelated.the district court agreed,reasoning that the age discrimination and retaliation claims involved different legal theories than the gender discrimination claim,and that muniz had not shown that they were related factually.the district court therefore deducted a further percent from the total lodestar award on this account.ups argues that this was not a sufficient deduction.
ups does not attempt to estimate the actual number of hours the jaffes could reasonably have spent on the claims for age discrimination,retaliation,negligent hire and punitive damages.ups apparently assumes that it and the jaffes spent an equal amount of time on each claim,whether successful or unsuccessful.ups points to no evidence supporting this assumption.ups argued that the district court should assume that muniz spent as much time developing its age discrimination claim which it abandoned at summary judgment as it spent on its gender discrimination claim upon which it prevailed after a seven day jury trial.the district court properly rejected this contention,and under both federal and california law,that the jury sustained a defense does not preclude an award of
