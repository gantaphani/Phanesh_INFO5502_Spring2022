in this design patent infringement case,the jury,answering interrogatories,found that the patent was valid and willfully infringed,and awarded damages of for the infringement,but denied damages for breach of a agreement.the district court denied judgment as a matter of law for the defendants,refused to establish a constructive trust for the patentee benefit,and awarded the patentee attorney fees.junker eddings,amended judgment.we affirm all of those actions,except the attorney fee award,which we vacate and remand for further proceedings.
the basic facts are largely undisputed.larry junker was an inventor and a salesman of medical devices.beginning in,the appellant galt medical corporation president,james eddings,met and communicated with junker to develop and market an introducer sheath for medical insertion of catheters.at their first meeting in august,junker and eddings each signed a agreement.junker then showed eddings a prototype design for an introducer sheath that junker had developed,which included larger handles so that doctors could more easily grip the sheath.
junker suggested to eddings by fax in december that the handle of the sheath be made larger wider and attached a sketch showing a design.the appellants collectively,galt subsequently revised the handle design of the galt introducer sheath in development so that it appeared similar to junker sketch.during,galt gave junker copies of its prototypes and final production drawings to aid in his sales and marketing efforts.
on january,galt filed a patent application for the introducer sheath,naming richard gillespie,a developer it had hired,as the inventor.galt utility patent,patent issued,the patent eventually issued from this application.
shortly after learning about galt application,junker filed his own design patent application on february,using the same production drawings that galt had filed as part of its patent application.the patent in suit,patent no.d issued,the patent,issued to junker from this application.the sole claim of the patent reads as follows the ornamental design for a handle for introducer sheath,as shown and described,followed by figures taken from galt drawings.d patent.
following a business disagreement,junker sued galt in the united states district court for the northern district of texas.junker alleged infringement of the patent,as well as state law claims including breach of contract based on galt violation of the agreement.in response,galt asserted that the patent was invalid under several provisions of because junker was not the first to invent the claimed design.junker eddings,joint pretrial order.
from the start of the litigation,junker contended that the scope of his patent claim was limited to a single ornamental feature of the introducer sheath,namely,the enlarged,rounded,mickey mouse ear shaped handle.in keeping with this argument,at trial junker only presented evidence relating to this single feature,which he contended that he had invented prior to the patent application,based on evidence including his december fax to eddings.galt argued that the patent claimed numerous additional features that junker did not invent.galt also moved unsuccessfully for partial summary judgment under on the ground that the d design was functional rather than ornamental.the claim of the d patent was never judicially construed,and galt never requested that such a construction be done.
before the case was submitted to the jury,galt moved for judgment as a matter of law jmol pursuant to rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure.galt contended that the claim of the patent was invalid under e based on the earlier filing date of the patent,or alternatively under f g.the trial court denied galt motion without prejudice to its renewal.
without objection,the court gave the jury a single question covering all of galt section defenses 
do you find from clear and convincing evidence that plaintiff was not the first inventor of the design described in the patent 
the court also gave the following jury instruction without objection 
y ou are instructed that plaintiff was not the first inventor if you find from clear and convincing evidence that the ornamental features claimed in the patent were known and used,or made and not abandoned or suppressed,by persons other than plaintiff before the date of plaintiff invention.answer yes or no.

based on the jury findings that galt had breached the agreement,but that the breach had not caused junker any damages,junker asked the district court to impose a constructive trust on galt patent as a remedy for galt breach.the court denied the request,stating that because the jury awarded no damages,plaintiff is not entitled to any relief for defendant breach.id.at.junker has the denial of a constructive trust and the failure to award damages.
galt first argues that the patent is invalid under e,f g because junker was not the first to invent the ornamental design features shown in the patent,and that the district court therefore erred in denying galt motions for jmol.galt contends that because the patent includes ornamental features such as upswept handles and distal rounded side edges in addition to the enlarged mickey mouse ear shaped handle,no reasonable jury could have concluded that junker was first to invent the design claimed in the patent.implicit in this contention is the assumption that galt,in its rule motions for jmol,adequately challenged the sufficiency of the evidence supporting junker infringement claim.we agree with junker,however,that galt jmol motions did not adequately raise the issue,and that galt therefore can not now press the contention.
galt filed two motions for jmol based on the alleged insufficiency of the evidence to support junker infringement claim,both of which involved the scope and meaning of the patent.galt filed the first motion under rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure after the trial had been completed,but before the case was submitted to the jury.it was an oral motion that raised a number of issues.with respect to the question here at issue,galt alleged that t here is no evidence presented by the plaintiff that corroborates junker claim to have invented the design shown and claimed in this patent before january,or any other prior time,and that there is no corroboration from his oral testimony that he was the inventor of the design claimed in the patent prior to the date stated.galt referred several times to the design claimed in the patent or the design.the district court denied the motion from the bench without explanation and without prejudice to the issue being raised post verdict.at.
after the jury upheld the validity of the patent,galt moved for jmol that the patent was invalid because there was no evidence that junker had conceived each element or feature of the design claimed in his patent prior to the filing date of that patent or that of galt patent.at emphasis in original.galt further argued that the plaintiff must have shown that at the time of his conception,he could have described his invention as claimed in the drawings that is,every feature in the drawings of the patent,at emphases in original,and that 
there is no corroborating evidence whatsoever of such a conception by plaintiff of every feature in the patent prior to the date he filed his application,or prior to any other date he could have claimed as his date of invention.he only produced some evidence of a racetrack shaped handle model and a later view in a fax of a propeller shape.he introduced no corroborating evidence of his conception of the complex handle curving through space,with it sic many surface features,that appears in the patent drawings which he admits he did not draw but obtained from defendants.this is not clear and convincing evidence of his conception of every feature claimed in all the drawings of the patent and therefore is legally insufficient to support a finding that he was the prior inventor before the filing date or the filing date.
at emphases in original.
rule a provides that a motion for jmol made before the case is submitted to the jury shall specify the facts on which the moving party is entitled to the judgment.a.therefore,galt rule a oral motion had to be sufficiently specific regarding its factual basis to inform junker of exactly what galt alleged to be deficient in junker evidence,thus giving junker an opportunity to cure the defects in proof.see gaus conair,custom seal.the specificity requirement serves the further important purpose of informing the trial court of the precise issues it must decide in ruling on the motion.see,gordon county of rockland,cir clark cent.states dredging,cir see also james moore et,moore fed.practice ed.the issue here pertains uniquely to patent law in that it concerns specific features of a design patent and therefore,we review the district court determination under federal circuit law,at.
galt original jmol motion referred to the subject matter claimed in the d patent in general terms,such as the design claimed in the patent.at trial,junker only introduced evidence on the sole ornamental feature that he claimed to have invented,the enlarged mickey mouse ear shape of the handle.galt present argument of invalidity,however,is based upon specific additional features of the design,such as its upswept appearance and rounded side edges,which galt now contends are ornamental.we do not think that the general statements in galt original jmol motion were adequate to inform either junker or the district court that galt challenges to the validity of the patent involved these specific elements of the design.
to be sure,courts may excuse a party failure to comply with the technical requirements of rule if the party clearly challenged the sufficiency of the evidence on the disputed issue at some point during trial,thereby alerting the opposing party as to the grounds on which the evidence is allegedly insufficient,at gaus,at party had notice of claim construction issue on appeal where opponent had made similar argument before trial.but this case involves not just a mere technical failure to comply.although junker repeatedly contended that the only ornamental feature his patent disclosed was the enlarged rounded handle,galt never offered evidence at trial relating to specific additional ornamental features claimed in the patent as the basis for invalidating it.while galt presented some evidence relating to various features of the introducer sheath,these features were not definitively categorized as ornamental or functional.for example,evidence regarding the rounded edges,which galt now contends are ornamental features,suggests that these edges had the functional purpose of preventing surgical gloves from snagging.
although galt motion was somewhat more specific,it too was not sufficiently detailed in describing the facts and ornamental features upon which galt based its claim of invalidity.in any event,galt rule b motion came too late,after the jury had already upheld the design patent validity based upon the only specific ornamental design element that junker evidence had addressed.see,at stating that it is constitutionally impermissible under seventh amendment for district court to enter jmol on grounds not sufficiently raised in jmol motion.
galt contends,however,that because only the solid line,and not the dotted line,portions of design patent diagrams define the claimed ornamental features of the design and the additional design elements upon which it relies are depicted in solid lines,the references in its motions to the design shown in the patent sufficiently indicated that it was relying upon all the design elements shown in solid lines,and not just the element the enlarged mickey mouse ear handle clearly addressed by the evidence.assuming without deciding that galt correctly states the rule governing solid and dotted lines as defining the claims in design patents,that argument does not sustain its position.that principle,usually applied in construing the claims of a design patent,may be useful in determining what the claims of the design patent cover.see contessa food,conagra,yorktowne.the issue in this case,however,is not what the design patent claim means,but which elements of that claim galt asserted in its jmol motions as a basis for its invalidity assertion.
what remains on this issue,therefore,is to determine the evidentiary support for the jury verdict of patent validity based on the only ornamental feature of the patent that the trial evidence enlarged mickey mouse ear shaped handle.this court will reverse a denial of jmol only if the jury factual findings are not supported by substantial evidence or if the legal conclusions implied from the jury verdict can not in law be supported by those findings.cybor fas,en banc.where,as here,a jury finds a patent valid,this court will not disturb that finding unless reasonable jurors could not have reached that verdict,at citing computervision.
in this case,the evidence before the jury on the validity issue included junker message and sketch suggesting to eddings larger wider handles,which occurred well before galt patent application.that evidence supports the jury finding that there was not clear and convincing evidence that junker was not the first to invent the enlarged mickey mouse ear shaped handle design claimed in the patent.we affirm the district court denial of galt motion for jmol.
section of title of the united states code provides that in exceptional patent cases the court may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.in this case,the attorney fees junker actually incurred totaled.the district court awarded junker as a reasonable attorney fee,without any explanation for more than doubling junker actual fees and without stating the basis upon which the court concluded that the higher fee was reasonable.on the record before us,we can not sustain the fee award because we do not know the basis for it and therefore can not determine whether it is reasonable.we therefore vacate the award of that fee,and remand the issue to the district court for reconsideration and explanation of the basis upon which the court determines that whatever fee it awards is reasonable.
galt does not question either the jury finding that its infringement was willful,or the district court finding that the case was exceptional.its sole challenge to the attorney fee award is that the amount was excessive.
galt contends that any award more than the amount the client actually paid the attorney would not be reasonable.galt relies upon this court statements in central soya geo.hormel,that t he purpose of is to compensate the prevailing party for its monetary outlays in the prosecution or defense of the suit,and that attorney fees include those sums that the prevailing party incurs in the preparation for and performance of legal services related to the suit.although the amount the client paid the attorney is one factor for the court to consider in determining a reasonable fee,it does not establish an absolute ceiling.the determination of a reasonable attorney fee requires the court to consider all the relevant circumstances in a particular case,and we review that determination for abuse of discretion.pharmacia upjohn mylan,water techs.calco.
before the district court,galt stipulated that the fee,which is the actual billing rate on hours,was a reasonable basis,and a reasonable fee.however,junker lawyer stated that some enhancement of the fee is appropriate for two reasons the case presented quite a few issues in trial and the re
