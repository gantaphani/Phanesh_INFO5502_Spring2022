on appeal,we modify the awards of backpay and attorneys fees and,as so modified,affirm the judgment of the district court.
vacation sales associates,a developer,marketer,and seller of timeshare properties in virginia beach,virginia,employed pamela depaoli as a sales associate in april.by,depaoli had become a sales manager for the sales department,focusing on people who already owned timeshare units.
in the fall of,the position of director of sales came open,and depaoli made an inquiry about obtaining that position.vacation sales president tim faulkner told her,however,that the position was to be eliminated.nonetheless,a few weeks later,he hired david hamlin for the position.
depaoli alleged that hamlin,who had become her superior,verbally harassed her and the sales associates under her supervision regarding their sex and age.she complained to faulkner in february but was dissatisfied with how he handled her concerns.in march,depaoli contacted the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc to ascertain her rights.although she did not file a complaint at that time,she told several employees,including vacation sales vice president george georgitsis,that she had contacted the eeoc.shortly thereafter,faulkner transferred depaoli,along with her team of sales associates,away from hamlin.
in july,hamlin employment was terminated and the director of sales position again became vacant.despite depaoli expressed interest in the position,the responsibilities of the position were transferred to a male,mark rosenfield.
in march,after another position that depaoli desired was vacated and filled by a male,depaoli contacted the eeoc a second time to initiate an investigation.depaoli again told coworkers,including vice president georgitsis of her action.
until that point in time,depaoli had performed well as a sales manager,producing strong average per guest figures indeed,for the period spanning january to march,depaoli average per guest surpassed that of the two other comparable sales managers by nearly.
in april,however,after depaoli had contacted the eeoc to conduct an investigation,depaoli average per guest dropped sharply,and she became the sales manager with the lowest average.she began to suspect that vacation sales management were taking steps to dampen her sales figures.in may,with her sales figures remaining subpar,depaoli filed a formal complaint with the eeoc,alleging sex discrimination in violation of title vii.that month she became anxious and ill and took a leave of absence.
when depaoli returned to work at the end of june,she discovered that yet another position she would have sought had become available and filled during her absence by a male.depaoli and her sales team had continued to perform poorly in june,and georgitsis directed her to terminate three of her sales associates.by,depaoli average per guest was about lower than the next highest sales manager.finally on july,depaoli was offered a lesser paying position as an sales associate.when she declined the position,her employment as sales manager was terminated.
depaoli commenced this action in october,claiming that vacation sales removed her from her sales manager position in retaliation for filing a claim with the eeoc,in violation of a.a jury agreed and awarded depaoli backpay of,compensatory damages of million,and punitive damages of million.
vacation sales filed motions for application of the statutory cap on damages provided by b,for judgment as a matter of law,and in the alternative,for a new trial.the district court reduced the compensatory and punitive damage award to in accordance with the statutory cap and,as a court of equity,recalculated the award of backpay,awarding.the court also awarded depaoli attorneys fees in the amount of,plus costs of.this appeal followed.
vacation sales contends first that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury verdict and that the district court erred in denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law on liability.
there is no suggestion that depaoli failed to prove a prima facie case of stated that she was removed from her sales manager position in retaliation for her may eeoc filing.likewise,there is no contention that vacation sales failed to meet its burden of giving a reason for firing her sales were substandard.vacation sales centers its argument on the contention that the evidence was insufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that vacation sales proffered reason for terminating depaoli was merely a pretext for the alleged retaliation.we have little doubt,however,in concluding that the jury heard sufficient evidence to support its finding that the reason given for firing depaoli was a pretext.
first,cynthia mclachlin,a former vacation sales sales associate,testified that in march,soon after depaoli made her initial contact with the eeoc,mclachlin overheard a conversation between president faulkner and vice president georgitsis.she testified that faulkner said to georgitsis,i not going to have any lawsuits on my watch.after faulkner hung up,georgitsis shared with mclachlin a letter to depaoli that required her to meet for supervision.mclachlin told georgitsis that the required meeting would humiliate depaoli who would rather quit than submit to the letter terms,and georgitsis responded,that what we are hoping she does for going to the eeoc faulkner does want her here any longer.
second,sandra williams,a former vacation sales manager,testified that sometime after depaoli was removed,williams told georgitsis that she contemplated filing a complaint with the eeoc because of another actions.georgitsis replied to williams,you do want to do that you will end up like pam depaoli.
third,depaoli testified that in june,upon returning from a leave of absence to discover that a position she desired had been filled,georgitsis told her that if she did start an investigation with the eeoc,she would have gotten that director position.
in addition to this direct evidence of vacation sales motives for removing depaoli,the jury also heard evidence of actions vacation sales employees took to dampen depaoli average per guest figures after depaoli had contacted the eeoc in march.for example,victoria headden,a former vacation sales receptionist responsible for assigning tours to sales associates,testified that in march,sales managers began cherry picking likely purchasers out of group tours,even though those tours and purchasers were supposed to be handled by a different manager.headden testified that georgitsis told her to permit only certain managers to engage in cherry picking,and depaoli was not one of them.also,headden testified that in april,georgitsis directed her to assign unsuccessful group tours to particular sales associates,and to assign a higher proportion of those unsuccessful tours to members of depaoli team 
finally,the sharp drop in depaoli average per from in march to in april,the month after she filed her complaint with the circumstantial evidence that the conduct of vacation sales management did effect a drop in depaoli sales figures.
vacation sales argues that judgment as a matter of law should have been entered in its favor because the evidence could not support a finding that actions taken by vacation sales employees were the actual cause of the drop in depaoli average per guest.this argument,however,misses the point of the show that vacation sales tried to sabotage depaoli,not that they succeeded,thus supporting the claim that the true reason vacat
