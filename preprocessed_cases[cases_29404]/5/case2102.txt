both meeker and henley appeal from the september,order regarding indemnity and prevailing party fees.
discussion 
prevailing party litigation expenses from base camp pursuant to the camp contract 
no doubt recognizing that the indemnity provisions in addendum to the camp agreement do not constitute a provision,meeker does not assert a direct right to recover attorney fees pursuant to that contract.those provisions required meeker to indemnify base camp against any third party claims arising from meeker performance under the agreement.this includes an obligation to r eimburse base camp for any and all legal expense incurred in connection with any action covered by the indemnity provisions or to enforce the indemnity.such a clause is not a provision within the meaning of civil code section,but an enumeration of the scope of the indemnity.campbell scripps bank th,d.
nevertheless,meeker contends base camp is judicially estopped to deny that the camp agreement contained a provision in light of base camp request for attorney fees.as explained previously,base camp sought an award of attorney fees in its breach of contract claim against meeker based on the meeker base camp agreement.meeker argues that base camp alleged the existence of a provision in the camp agreement and is now estopped to contend otherwise.
judicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine aimed at preventing fraud on the courts.in re marriage of dekker th,d.it prohibits a party from taking inconsistent positions in the same or different judicial proceedings.jackson county of los angeles th,d.judicial estoppel is invoked to prevent a party from changing its position over the course of judicial proceedings when such positional changes have an adverse impact on the judicial process the policies underlying preclusion of inconsistent positions are general consideration s of the orderly administration of justice and regard for the dignity of judicial proceedings.judicial estoppel is intended to protect against a litigant playing fast and loose with the courts.citation.it seems patently wrong to allow a person to abuse the judicial process by first advocating one position,and later,if it becomes beneficial,to assert the opposite.jackson county of los angeles,supra,th at,d.
in international billing services,emigh th,d international billing services,this court applied judicial estoppel under circumstances similar to those presented here.there,the plaintiff company brought a trade secret action against three former employees and others and sought attorney fees pursuant to a provision of the employment agreements.id.at,d.the defendants prevailed and the trial court awarded them attorney fees.id.at,d.
on appeal,the company argued that the agreement did not contain a prevailing party attorney fee clause but rather an indemnity provision.international billing services,supra,th at,d.the provision in question required the employee to promise to reimburse the company for attorney fees in the event of litigation.id.at,d.if the provision was an attorney fee provision,it was subject to reciprocity under civil code section.if it was an indemnity provision,it was not.we concluded that any ambiguity in the provision must be construed against the drafter,the company,and,therefore,the trial court properly found that the provision authorized the fee award.international billing services,supra,th at,d.
having concluded that the provision permitted an award of attorney fees to the prevailing party,the matter before us was resolved.however,in dicta,we took the opportunity to address another chronic misuse of attorney fee claims.we explained t he question whether a given provision is a fees provision,which one might think was readily ascertainable,results in frequent,protracted,litigation which ties up the courts and parties long after the merits of a decision are settled.time and again in civil cases,often those with parties willing and able to spend thousands or tens of thousands of dollars on the issue,the fees debate assumes a life of its own.the prospect of attorney fees plays a significant part in determining a strategy for initiating or defending litigation.litigation costs including the potential fee award can be enormous,sometimes rivaling or even exceeding the amount involved on the merits f ee litigation has become a specialty of some lawyers and a fees phase of cases is foreordained.this wasteful consumption of judicial resources and client money serves no public purpose and impairs the image of the legal profession.id.at,d.
in order to discourage overreaching attorney fee claims,we announced the following rule where a party claims a contract allows fees and prevails,it gets fees.where it claims a contract allows fees and loses,it must pay fees.international billing services,supra,th at,d.in other words,even where the contract does not contain an attorney fee provision,if a party claims that it does and loses the case,it will be required to pay the prevailing party attorney fees.however,we emphasized that this rule applies only where a party brings a breach of contract action and the contract contains some provision which the party asserts operates as a fees provision.id.at,d.thus,it is not enough that the losing party claimed a nonspecific right to attorney fees.it must be a claim that a contract on which a cause of action for breach of contract is premised contains an attorney fee provision.
this is such a case.in its claim for breach of contract against meeker,base camp alleged that it had performed all conditions,covenants and promises under its contract with meeker,which contract includes provisions entitling the prevailing party in this litigation to recover its costs and attorney fees.however,a review of the contract reveals no provision.addendum contains indemnity provisions,which provide that the indemnitor shall r eimburse owner or its officers,directors,members,agents,employees,or property manager,or any of them,for any and all legal expenses incurred by any of them in connection herewith or in enforcing the indemnity granted in this addendum italics added.through the reciprocity of civil code section,this provision would permit the prevailing party in any action brought to enforce the indemnity to recover attorney fees.however,base camp did not seek indemnity in its complaint against meeker.
nevertheless,under the international billing services dictum,because base camp claimed a contractual right to attorney fees and lost its case,meeker would be entitled to attorney fees.however,as we shall explain,we believe international billing services sweeps too broadly and decline to follow it in this instance.
international billing services was based primarily on civil code section.we noted generally,where the losing party would have obtained fees had it won,it is liable for fees if it lost,such as where a nonsignatory to a contract asserts entitlement to fees based on a contract,loses the case,then seeks to avoid an adverse fee award.citation.the reciprocity provision of civil code section was designed to prevent overreaching in litigation.absent the reciprocity provision,contracting parties with superior economic bargaining power would routinely insert fees provisions in contracts.in the event of a dispute,and regardless of the merits vel non of the disputant claims,the drafting party would have an unfair litigation advantage from the outset even if it lost,it would only have to pay contract damages if it won,the weaker party would also have to pay fees.attorney fees clauses can thus be used as instruments of oppression to force settlements of dubious or unmeritorious claims.citation.civil code s ection was obviously designed to remedy this evil.international billing services,supra,th at,d.
we continued if a party to a contract can claim a right to recover attorney fees pursuant to a provision in a contract and then deny the effect and application of that provision if his opponent prevails,civil code section purposes would be thwarted and attorney fees claims could be used as instruments of oppression.specifically,uncertainty about a party rights and obligations with respect to ultimate recovery of attorney fees would create pressure to settle unmeritorious claims.international billing services,supra,th at,d.
while stating that we had no quarrel with the cases holding civil code section was not designed to extend the right to recover attorney fees to persons who themselves could not have been required to pay attorney fees in the event their adversary prevailed in the acti
