the question presented is to whom,as between attorney and client,attorney fees awarded under government code section hereafter section part of the california fair employment and housing act feha,et,belong when no contractual agreement provides for their disposition.we conclude that,absent proof on remand of an enforceable agreement to the contrary,the attorney fees awarded in this case belong to the attorneys who labored to earn them.
background 
the court of appeal adequately stated the relevant facts.plaintiff leslie flannery sued her former employer,the california highway patrol chp,alleging violations of feha.the jury awarded plaintiff in damages.the trial court awarded in attorney fees,expressly basing the award both on government code section,subdivision b and on code of civil procedure section.flannery california highway patrol th,d flannery i.
on appeal by the chp,the court of appeal concluded that the fee award was improper insofar as it was based on code of civil procedure section and that,insofar as it was based on feha,the trial court had not applied the correct standards in determining the amount.the court of appeal remanded for reconsideration of the amount of the fee award.flannery i,supra,th at,d.on remand,the trial court applied a reduced multiplier and awarded in fees and expenses for the underlying case and in fees and expenses for fee work.the chp also appealed that award,and the court of appeal unanimously affirmed it 
meanwhile,flannery brought this action against her former counsel,john prentice,john scott,and the law firms of prentice scott,and bley bley,john prentice former firm collectively,defendants.her amended complaint included causes of action for declaratory relief,breach of fiduciary duties,legal malpractice,and constructive fraud.she sought damages and a judicial declaration that she was entitled to the entire statutory fee awarded in the earlier action.flannery alleged that she and defendants had orally entered into a contingent fee agreement entitling defendants only to of the net settlement or net award of the jury.she also contended that defendants failure to advise her of the terms and conditions of their representation and to obtain her full and informed consent to a fee agreement constituted a breach of their fiduciary duties,legal malpractice,and constructive fraud.the amended complaint also included causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty and legal malpractice based on allegations that defendants had in the feha litigation failed to present competent evidence of future wage loss.
prentice scott against flannery,seeking a declaration that they were entitled to the statutory fee award and,in the alternative,recovery in quantum meruit or damages for breach of contract.prentice scott contended they had a contingency agreement with flannery providing they would receive either forty percent of the amount recovered from a jury verdict or the entirety of statutory fees that might be awarded additionally,bley bley against prentice scott for equitable indemnity and contractual damages.
defendants moved for summary judgment on flannery complaint.prentice scott also moved for summary adjudication on their declaratory relief cause of action.the trial court granted summary judgment for defendants,concluding as matters of law that flannery was not entitled to the attorney fee award in the feha litigation and that there had been no malpractice.the trial court also granted prentice scott motion for summary adjudication,declaring that,as a matter of law,they were entitled to the proceeds of the attorney fee award in the feha litigation.the remaining claims in the were dismissed voluntarily.
the court of appeal reversed,reasoning,in the published portion of its opinion,that attorney fees awarded under section,subdivision b belong to the litigant formally awarded them who may or may not agree to give these fees to counsel as compensation,and that whether any compensation agreement exists in this case presents a triable question of fact.
discussion 
a.who owns funds awarded pursuant to section when no contract provides for their disposition 
as noted,in private actions brought under section,the court,in its discretion,may award to the prevailing party reasonable attorney fees and costs,including expert witness fees,subd.b.the propriety of the court having awarded fees in this case is not at issue our question pertains to the ownership of the statutory award.in such circumstances,our fundamental task is to ascertain the legislature intent in order to effectuate the law purpose.white ultramar,cal th,d.as will appear,while the legislative purposes underlying feha and its attorney fee provision are relatively clear,which formulation among various combinations of rules and exceptions proffered by the parties will most reliably effectuate these purposes is a closer question.we conclude that any proceeds of a section fee award exceeding fees the client already has paid belong,absent a contractual agreement validly disposing of them,to the attorneys for whose work they are awarded.
statutory language 
we begin our inquiry by examining section words,giving them a plain and commonsense meaning.garcia mccutchen cal th,d.in doing so,however,we do not consider the statutory language in isolation.lungren deukmejian cal d.rather,we look to the entire substance of the statute in order to determine the scope and purpose of the provision west pico furniture pacific finance loans cal d.we avoid any construction that would produce absurd consequences.people mendoza cal th,d.
while it is true that section authorizes fee awards to the prevailing party,subd.b,italics added,that language does not unambiguously favor plaintiff.the word part y is reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation.levy superior court cal th,d.in the countless procedural statutes in which the term party is used,it is commonly understood to refer to either the actual litigant or the litigant attorney of record.citations.since that is the ordinary import of the term,that is the meaning we must ascribe to it when used in a statute,unless the legislature has clearly indicated a contrary intent mcdowell watson th,d,citing levy superior court,supra,at,d,see also trope katz cal th,d.
even if we were to construe party in section formally to designate a litigant only,that would not preclude our also declaring that beneficial ownership of section fees remains,absent contract,with the attorneys they are designed to compensate.ex rel.virani jerry lewis truck parts equipment cir,cert.den,d virani concluding,in an action under the federal false claims act,that a client right to reasonable attorney fees is really a power to obtain fees for his attorney the attorneys right does not come into being until the client exercises that power the defendant liability will only arise if that power is exercised.
section expressly authorizes the award only of attorney fees.an award that does not compensate the litigant for payments made to,owed to,or forgiven by an attorney or attorneys is,in one sense,not an attorney fee at all.read plainly in accordance with this language,therefore,section does not authorize awards that the litigant is not absent agreement,at any rate obligated to pay as attorney compensation.indeed,as we previously have recognized,the usual and ordinary meaning of the words reasonable attorney fees is the consideration that a litigant pays or becomes liable to pay in exchange for legal representation.trope katz,supra,cal th at,d.
despite the foregoing,section is nevertheless,in our view,sufficiently ambiguous to warrant our consideration of evidence of the legislature intent beyond the words of the statute.snukal flightways manufacturing,cal th,d.accordingly,in order to ascertain the most reasonable interpretation of section,we may examine extrinsic information,including the statute legislative history and underlying purposes.hughes board of architectural examiners cal th,d.
legislative intent 
plaintiff takes the position that,because she is the prevailing party and defendants are unable to prove the existence of a compensation agreement,she is entitled to retain,not only the jury damages,minus some costs,already has been disbursed to,in addition,the full amount of the court attorney fee award.we do not believe our legislature could have intended such an outcome.
plaintiff urges us to construe section in the light of federal cases construing certain federal statutory attorney fee provisions.generally speaking,the cases cited have recognized the right of the client,rather than the attorney,to seek,recover,or waive statutory fees.we are of course not bound by lower federal appellate decisions.people zapien cal th,d,see,commodore home systems,superior court cal d,declining to follow federal decisions barring punitive damages in federal discrimination actions.and while the high court pronouncements respecting fees awarded under federal statutes may be instructive,they do not control our construction of feha attorney fee provision.romano rockwell,cal th,d,declining in feha matter to follow supreme court decisions concerning federal statute of limitations for wrongful termination actions.as has been recognized see,flannery i,supra,th at,d,the federal decisions urged by plaintiff are to some extent based on federal legislative history,which is without california parallel.see,evans jeff,d discussing and its legislative history.
plaintiff relies most heavily on two united states supreme court cases involving attorney fees awarded under united states code section in evans,supra,d,a class action,the issue of who owns an attorney fee award arose because the clients sought to waive that remedy in order to effect settlement.the high court held the district court in that case had not abused its discretion by approving a settlement that included a fee waiver id.at,noting that a straightforward reading of id.at,fn.indicates congress bestowed fee award eligibility on the prevailing party id.at.congress in section did not prevent the party from waiving this eligibility anymore than it legislated against assignment of this right to an attorney evans,supra,at,the court reasoned.more recently,in venegas,supra,d,the high court held that united states code section did not invalidate a contingent attorney fee contract requiring a prevailing civil rights plaintiff to pay his attorney more than the statutory fees awarded by the court.venegas,supra,at.in so holding,the court reiterated that it is the party,rather than the lawyer,who is eligible id.at.for a section award.
to the extent the high court construction of united states code section properly may inform our construction of government code section,of course,evans and venegas would support the view that it was plaintiff as opposed to defendants who was eligible to seek the fee award in the feha litigation below.neither case,however,expressly considered the narrow question we face whether a party may receive or keep the proceeds of a fee award when she has neither agreed to pay her attorneys nor obtained from them a waiver of payment.the united states supreme court has not spoken to that precise question,and an opinion is not authority for a proposition not therein considered.aguilar avis rent a car system,cal th,d.
in any event,the high court analysis of united states code section fee eligibility is not incompatible with the trial court ruling that defendants prentice and scott are entitled to the proceeds of the fee award that plaintiff concedes she authorized defendants to seek.as the ninth circuit court of appeals explained in virani,supra,evans stands for the proposition that,under united states code section,only a plaintiff has the power to demand that a defendant pay the fees of the plaintiff attorney,and the defendant liability will only arise if that power is exercised virani,supra,at.but once the client power to demand attorney fees is exercised,the attorney right to receive them come s into being.ibid.accordingly,and as pertinent for our purposes,t he plaintiff has no power to confer the fee upon himself.but see gilbrook city of westminster cir,holding fee award payable directly to party rather than counsel.
outside of the united states code section fee eligibility context,federal jurisprudence is not uniform federal courts vary their handling of attorney fee awards depending on the context,sometimes awarding fees to litigants and sometimes directly to counsel despite this lack of uniformity,however,t he propriety of a direct award to the plaintiffs attorney,rather than to plaintiffs themselves,in the exercise of the court equitable powers,is no longer questioned in the federal courts.serrano priest cal d,fn,citing numerous authorities.
until the court of appeal rendered an opinion in this case,no california court had published a view as to whether attorney fees awarded under section belong,absent contract,to the party or to the party attorneys,or whether the term prevailing party as used in that statute may in appropriate circumstances be construed to include counsel.but at the time the statutory language,originally part of the labor code,was first enacted see commodore home systems,superior court,supra,cal d at,citing stats,ch,california courts,including this court,had determined that courts awarding attorney fees,including statutory fees,could pay them directly to the prevailing litigant attorney.see,serrano priest,supra,cal d at,upholding award of private attorney general fees directly to attorneys for plaintiffs who challenged state school funding scheme horn swoap d.welf,fees properly paid directly to counsel for petitioner who challenged welfare regulation knoff city of san francisco d,fn.court in class action had discretion under city charter to award fees directly to counsel.
in,upholding an attorney fee award under code of civil procedure section,which codifies the private attorney general fee doctrine we considered it established that awards are properly made to plaintiffs attorneys rather than to plaintiffs themselves.folsom butte county of governments cal d,fn.neither in enacting nor in amending government code section or feha generally,has the legislature repudiated such precedents.
the basic,underlying purpose of feha is to safeguard the right of californians to seek,obtain,and hold employment without experiencing discrimination on account of race,religious creed,color,national origin,ancestry,physical disability,medical disability,medical condition,marital status,sex,age,or sexual orientation,stevenson superior court cal th,d.there is no doubt that privately initiated lawsuits are often essential to the effectuation of the fundamental public policies embodied in constitutional or statutory provisions baggett gates cal d,and w ithout some mechanism authorizing the award of attorney fees,private actions to enforce such important public policies will as a practical matter frequently be infeasible.ibid.
attorneys considering whether to undertake cases that vindicate fundamental public policies may require statutory assurance that,if they obtain a favorable result for their client,they will actually receive the reasonable attorney fees provided for by the legislature and computed by the court.as the high court has recognized,the aim of statutes is to enable private parties to obtain legal help in seeking redress for injuries resulting from the actual or threatened violation of specific laws.hence,if plaintiffs find it possible to engage a lawyer based on the statutory assurance that he will be paid a reasonable fee,the purpose behind the statute has been satisfied.pennsylvania.valley citizens council,d discussing federal clean air act.
because contracts are not always obtainable or obtained and always may be disputed,were we to interpret section as plaintiff urges,vesting ownership of fees awarded thereunder and not disposed of by contract in the litigant,rather than in counsel,we would diminish the certainty that attorneys who undertake feha cases will be fully compensated,and to that extent we would dilute section effectiveness at encouraging counsel to undertake feha litigation.such an interpretation of section,thus,ultimately would tend to undermine the legislature expressly stated purpose of feha to provide effective remedies that will eliminate these discriminatory practices.
construing section as vesting ownership of unassigned fees,fees not disposed of by contract awarded thereunder in the litigant rather than counsel also would be inconsistent with the established method for calculating reasonable attorney fees under feha.pursuant to precedent and practice,section fees are calculated by determining the number of hours reasonably worked by the attorneys who prosecuted the matter and multiplying that number by the reasonable hourly rate those attorneys should receive for such work.depending on the circumstances,consideration may also be given to the attorneys experience,the difficulty of the issues presented,the risk incurred by the attorneys in litigating the case,the quality of work performed by the attorneys,and the result the attorneys achieved.serrano priest,supra,cal d at.again,never in its frequent amendments to feha has the legislature questioned this practice or the precedents validating it.
public policy 
construing section as vesting ownership of unassigned attorney fees awarded thereunder in counsel rather than the litigant to the extent fees are not otherwise paid will,moreover,advance important public policies.specifically,such a construction will 
encourage representation of legitimate feha claimants and discourage nonmeritorious suits 
it need hardly be reiterated that t he policy that promotes the right to seek and hold employment free of prejudice is fundamental.job discrimination foments domestic strife and unrest,deprives the state of the fullest utilization of its capacities for development and advance,and substantially and adversely affects the interest of employees,employers,and the public in general.commodore home systems,superior court,supra,cal d at,quoting.as california courts long have recognized,section fees are intended to provide fair compensation to the attorneys involved in the litigation at hand and encourage litigation of claims that in the public interest merit litigation.weeks baker mckenzie th,d.as discussed above,our construing section to vest ownership of fees awarded thereunder in counsel when,for whatever reason,no contract exists disposing of them,thus diminishing the risk of noncompensation or undercompensation,will enhance the likelihood that attorneys who undertake feha cases will be fully compensated,and to that extent will enhance the fee provision effectiveness in encouraging counsel to undertake feha litigation 
the availability of feha fees,moreover,is reciprocal,benefiting defendants forced to defend frivolous suits,as well as plaintiffs who bring meritorious suits.see,guthrey state of california th,d awarding fees on appeal to defendant employers in sex discrimination case.accordingly,our construing section attorney fee provision to assure compensation of attorneys who successfully represent feha litigants will further the important public policy of discouraging frivolous suits as well as the policy of encouraging meritorious ones 
avoid unjust enrichment 
the usual statute is not intended to replicate exactly the fee an attorney could earn through a private fee arrangement with his client.pennsylvania.valley citizens council,supra,at.in a particular case,an award of reasonable attorney fees under a statute might not match the actual amount a client has paid or agreed to pay,because such awards generally are computed from their reasonable market value serrano unruh cal d,even if the attorney has performed services pro bono or for a reduced fee.see also blum stenson,d reasonable fees under are to be calculated according to the prevailing market rates in the relevant community,regardless of whether plaintiff is represented by private or nonprofit counsel.in this case,of course,plaintiff,the client,has not paid defendants any fees,and it remains disputed whether any enforceable contract provides for disposition of the fee award.
an attorney who appears in propria persona,doing all the legal work involved in a matter,is not entitled to collect statutory attorney fees.trope katz,supra,cal th at,d,fees sought under,kay ehrler,d same,in case.a fortiori,defendants argue,a person who is represented by counsel,and thus has done none of the legal work for which statutory attorney fees are intended as compensation,should not absent agreement be entitled to retain any such that may be awarded.
without concluding that such reasoning would hold in every context,it seems evident that,in general,where attorney compensation has neither been paid nor forgiven and there is no contract assuring it,allowing a victorious litigant to retain the proceeds of a fee award in addition to a substantial damages judgment would confer an unjustified windfall.
ensure fairness 
vesting ownership of unassigned section fees in counsel rather than the prevailing litigant to the extent fees are not otherwise paid is fairer than the alternative to the litigants who must pay such fees.statutory attorney fees are not of course intended to compensate the prevailing party for damages suffered.see elton beverage group,th,d.nor by definition do they compensate the party for litigation costs when no agreement requiring attorney compensation exists and no fees have been paid.paying the proceeds of a section award to the party rather than to counsel in such circumstances would,from the perspective of those paying them,transform the award,without legislative authorization,into a kind of punitive damages.
address ethical concerns 
allowing litigants to keep the unassigned proceeds of section awards would amount,defendants contend,to improper sharing of legal fees by nonlawyers.with exceptions not relevant here,california attorneys are enjoined not to directly or indirectly share legal fees with a person who is not a lawyer.rules conduct,rule a.
plaintiff argues,on the other hand,that any rule permitting payment of section fees directly to counsel would contravene conflict of interest principles barring attorneys from obtaining pecuniary interests adverse to their clients.as defendants can not produce a written agreement entitling them to the disputed award,plaintiff argues,those proceeds can not be paid directly to them.see rules conduct,rule rule state bar standing com.on responsibility and conduct,formal opn,state bar advisory opn.in order ethically to obtain exclusive possession of the right to collect attorney fees,and therefore to control settlement,a possessory interest adverse to the client,the member must comply with rule by obtaining client consent to fair and reasonable terms after full disclosure in writing.
we agree with defendants that plaintiff proffered construction would implicate in some measure the policy our prohibition is designed to advance.plaintiff argument premised on rule,on the other hand,is less persuasive,as the state bar advisory opinion construing that rule only addresses the propriety of such agreements in the context of actions brought under united states code section state bar advisory,supra,at and expressly was advisory only id.at,not binding on the courts,the state bar of california,its board of governors,any persons or tribunals charged with regulatory responsibilities,or any member of the state bar ibid.more fundamentally,in recognizing that counsel should,absent contract,receive the proceeds of any section award exceeding fee payments made,we would confer no exclusive possession of the right to collect attorney fees state bar advisory,supra,at such as might compromise public policy favoring client control over settlement of feha cases.we would merely reconcile that policy with those underlying feha attorney fee provision and feha generally 
ultimately,we are not persuaded we can dispose of the question presented solely through consideration of these somewhat competing ethical considerations.obviously,it is not necessary that we deprive attorneys of feha fees in cases where they have in fact been sought and awarded in order to vindicate the principle that a civil rights plaintiff may,in order to effect settlement,agree to waive the right to seek fees.see state bar advisory,supra,at recognizing that attorneys may contract for ownership of fees.
the court of appeal opined that section ought not to be construed so that the successful litigant attorney will own any unassigned fee award,because such a construction would risk prompting attorneys to contract with clients for a percentage of the damages without advising them about the possibility of a statutory fee award,thus undermining the public policy favoring full compensation of victims of unlawful discrimination.we do not believe such a concern need detain us.plaintiff own authority implies that an attorney is not permitted to proceed as the court of appeal theorized.state bar advisory,supra,at requiring client consent to fair and reasonable terms after full disclosure in writing before an attorney can acquire interest in fee award potentially adverse to client interest.
more fundamentally,nothing we say in this opinion concerning ownership of unassigned government code section proceeds alters existing rules forbidding attorneys to charge or obtain unreasonable fees,or diminishes clients established remedies if unreasonable fees are sought or exacted.see,bus,et arbitration of attorney fees.and,even assuming the court of appeal identified a theoretical contracting scenario to some extent not remediable under existing rules,the court did not demonstrate that its proposed resolution has significant comparative benefits over existing incentives 
encourage written fee agreements 
while they dispute the facts relating to their respective efforts,the parties each claim they took steps to obtain from the other a written agreement respecting attorney compensation in the feha litigation.at least to that extent,the court of appeal would appear correct in having opined that the problem in this case arises because counsel failed to secure or retain a written fee agreement.plaintiff contends our awarding her the disputed proceeds in this case would provide a strong incentive for attorneys to secure written fee agreements in feha cases and thus would further public policies generally favoring such agreements.plaintiff correctly points out,also,that our construing section in her favor would not diminish defendants right to enforce any compensation right in quantum meruit.see,elconin yalen cal.
as the court of appeal noted,business and professions code section requires a written fee agreement in most classes of cases where an attorney agrees to represent a client on a contingency fee basis.plaintiff argues that,for us to require that attorneys secure written fee agreements as a prerequisite to receiving monies awarded under section,would be reasonable and consistent with the legislative intent underlying business and professions code section.while this argument has some surface appeal,we reject it.
ordering that section fee awards be paid directly to plaintiffs whenever there exists no contrary agreement between plaintiffs and their counsel such that plaintiffs realize a windfall at counsel expense could make sense only if the law treated attorneys who fail to secure fee agreements as deserving of such punishment.see,conservatorship of chilton d.attorney with conflict of interest not entitled to recover fee for services hardy san fernando valley of d,same,regarding attorney who was not a member of the state bar.but that is not the case.the rule is,to the contrary,that,i n the absence of an agreement upon the subject,the client must be deemed to have promised to pay the attorney the reasonable value of the services performed in his behalf and with his consent and knowledge.batcheller whittier,see also elconin yalen,supra,cal.at,witkin,cal.procedure ed.attorneys.
even in circumstances where the legislature has required a written fee agreement,bus,contingency fee agreements,other agreements for fees exceeding,it has provided that,while noncompliance renders the agreement voidable,the attorney nevertheless is entitled to collect a reasonable fee,subd.b,subd.c.to that extent,the legislature expressly has declined to sanction failure to obtain a written agreement as plaintiff proposes.
plaintiff categorical assertion that an attorney can always obtain protection by complying with the rules of professional conduct a matter of in every noncontingency fee case where to obtain a writing is impractical bus,subd.d,as the requirement of obtaining a written agreement expressly does not apply in such cases.more broadly,because written fee agreements are not always required,our construing section as plaintiff requests would risk punishing lawyers who do not violate the business and professions code,as well as those who do.written fee agreements are not required for noncontingency fee representation when the client is a corporation as will often be the case,presumably,with nonprofit and public interest groups,when the client for whatever reason is not obligated to pay anything,when an agreement can be implied from counsel prior representation of the client,in an emergency situation when the attorney must act to avoid prejudice to the client,or,as noted,where a writing is otherwise impractical.bus,subd.d.
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that attorney fees awarded pursuant to section exceeding fees already paid belong,absent an enforceable agreement to the contrary,to the attorneys who labored to earn them.the preceding analysis,of course,may not be,will not even come into the parties have made an enforceable agreement disposing of an award proceeds.whether an enforceable agreement exists,or what its terms may be in any given case,are of course questions of fact.
the court of appeal,in holding incorrectly,as we have explained that a section award invariably belongs to the party rather than counsel in the first instance,remanded for further proceedings on the question of fact whether an agreement between flannery and her counsel created in defendants an entitlement to the disputed proceeds.while,as explained,we disagree with the court of appeal legal analysis regarding ownership of unassigned section proceeds,we agree summary judgment is not appropriate on this record,which contains conflicting evidence as to whether a controlling agreement exists or what the terms of any such may be.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the court of appeal.
venue for resolution of fee award ownership disputes 
defendants asked in their petition for review that we announce in this case a rule requiring that all litigated disputes between attorneys and their clients over statutory fee awards be resolved by the trial judge who handled proceedings in the matter to which the fees relate.they ask us to bar collateral proceedings like the instant suit.defendants,however,did not raise this issue in the court of appeal.as a matter of policy,on petition for review,we normally do not consider any issue that could have been but was not timely raised in the briefs filed in the court of appeal.cal.rules of court,rule b.citing fisher city of berkeley cal d,defendants suggest that our considering their additional issue notwithstanding our normal policy would not prejudice plaintiff,and that we should,therefore,address it as one involving an important question of law implicating the jurisdiction of the courts.
defendants obtained summary judgment in the trial court,both as defendants and as.a judgment rendered with consent of the appellant is not appealable.witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal.it was plaintiff,of course,who appealed the trial court summary judgment rulings with the result that led to defendants petitioning us for review.nevertheless,it ill behooves defendants to disparage the trial court competence to hear the merits of the instant suit,inasmuch as defendants themselves sought affirmative declaration of their entitlement to the disputed the trial court.there is substantial authority for the proposition that a party who has invoked or consented to the exercise of jurisdiction beyond the court authority may be precluded from challenging it afterward,even on a direct attack by appeal.witkin,cal.procedure,supra,jurisdiction,citing numerous authorities.
defendants do not persuade us that we should depart from our ordinary policy in this case.ultimately,we can not conclude that defendants novel proposal regarding fee dispute resolution raises extremely significant issues of public policy and public interest fisher city of berkeley,supra,cal d at,fn,such as may have caused us on infrequent prior occasions to depart from it.
disposition 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the judgment of the court of appeal.
in clear and unequivocal language,government code section,subdivision b authorizes courts to award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party in civil rights actions brought under the fair employment and housing act according to the majority,however,the statute does not mean what it says prevailing party does not mean prevailing party but prevailing lawyer.that construction ignores the plain language of the statute as well as persuasive united states supreme court precedent construing virtually identical language in the federal civil rights law.therefore,i dissent.
i begin with a brief discussion of the circumstances leading to the california legislature enactment of the attorney fee provision at issue here.
in the united states,the prevailing litigant is ordinarily not entitled to collect a reasonable attorneys fee from the loser.alyeska pipeline service wilderness society,d,italics added alyeska pipeline.this is known as the american rule,to distinguish it from the practice in england where for centuries there has been statutory authorization to award costs,including attorneys fees to the party who prevails in a lawsuit.see code of civ,witkin,cal.procedure ed.judgment,describing code of civil procedure section as the california version of the american rule under which each party must pay its own legal fees.
in,the united states supreme court reaffirmed the american rule when it decided alyeska pipeline.at issue there was a federal appeals court order requiring the alyeska pipeline company to pay the attorney fees incurred by environmental groups who had successfully challenged the department of interior issuance of permits to alyeska for construction of the oil pipeline.no federal statute authorized fee shifting to the losing party in such cases.nevertheless,the appellate court considered the award of attorney fees to be within its equitable powers as necessary to encourage private litigants to bring public interest suits as private attorneys general.alyeska pipeline,supra,at.the high court disagreed.it noted that although congress had statutorily authorized attorney fees in some instances to encourage private litigation as a means of implementing public policy,congressional utilization of the concept can in no sense be construed as a grant of authority to the judiciary to jettison the traditional rule against nonstatutory allowances to the prevailing party and to award attorneys fees whenever the courts deem the public policy important enough to warrant the fee award.id.at.
in the wake of alyeska pipeline,supra,d,congress in amended united states code section title,section by expressly authorizing courts in civil rights actions,in their discretion,to award the prevailing party a reasonable attorney fee.the next year,california legislature enacted a similar statute,code of civil procedure section,which provides that a court may award attorneys fees to a successful party against one or more opposing parties in any action which has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest.both the federal and the california statutes were legislative responses to the high court decision in alyeska pipeline.folsom butte county of governments cal d,fn.both authorize courts to award attorney fees in certain situations.
in,the california legislature enacted the attorney fee provision at issue here,subd.b.like the federal attorney fee statute,it applies to civil rights that are brought under the fair employment and housing act feha and assert employment or housing discrimination.see et in relevant part,the feha fee statute provides t he court,in its discretion,may award to the prevailing party reasonable attorney fees and costs,including expert witness fees,except where the action is filed by a public agency or a public official,acting in an official capacity,subd.b,italics added.at issue here is the meaning of the phrase prevailing party.
in interpreting the feha attorney fee provision in subdivision b of section,courts must,as with any statute,follow settled principles of statutory construction.summers newman cal th,d.the aim of statutory construction is to discern and give effect to the legislative intent.phelps stostad cal th,d.the first step is to examine the statute words because they are generally the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.holloway united states,d people gardeley cal th,d.to resolve ambiguities,courts may employ a variety of extrinsic construction aids,including legislative history,and will adopt the construction that best harmonizes the statute both internally and with related statutes.pacific gas electric county of stanislaus cal th,d,hsu abbara cal th,d.ibid.
subdivision b of section states that a court may award reasonable attorney fees and costs,including expert witness fees to the prevailing party.the statutory language could not be clearer an award of attorney fees by the trial court is to the prevailing party,not the latter lawyer.in those instances where the legislature intended an award of attorney fees to go directly to a lawyer for a party,it has expressly said so.see,subd.d the court may order the board to pay to the applicant attorney reasonable attorney fees italics added,subd.a making fees and costs payable in whole or part to the attorney italics added labor code,former added by stats,ch,and repealed by stats,ch,the attorney shall be awarded a reasonable fee italics added.the wording in these statutes and the one at issue here show that the legislature knows how to use language that clearly expresses its intent in the attorney fee area.see people murphy cal th,d,city of port hueneme city of oxnard cal d,where a statute,with reference to one subject contains a given provision,the omission of such provision from a similar statute concerning a related subject is significant to show that a different legislative intention existed.
one more point statutes providing for the payment of fees to a party lawyer are an exception to california general rule for statutory attorney fees.such fees are considered an element of costs witkin,cal.procedure,supra,judgment,and costs are payable directly to a prevailing party code of civ,subd.b.accordingly,this court has invalidated statutory awards of attorney fees when ordered paid directly to a party lawyer.see stevens stevens cal,the attorneys were not parties to the action and any award of counsel fees should have been made to the parties litigant see also keck keck cal,henry superior court cal.
my construction of section,subdivision b also comports with the united states supreme court construction of title,section,which is the federal civil rights fee statute and,just like the state statute at issue here,authorizes a court discretionary award of attorney fees to the prevailing party.see evans jeff,d jeff.
in jeff,the issue was whether,in a civil rights case brought as a class action,the representative plaintiff could waive entitlement to title,section attorney fees in order to secure from the defendant a favorable settlement agreement.the high court upheld such a waiver,noting that under the plain language of the statute the entitlement to attorney fees belonged not to the lawyer but to the prevailing party congress bestowed on the prevailing party,generally plaintiffs a statutory eligibility for a discretionary award of attorney fees in specified civil rights actions.it did not prevent the party from waiving this eligibility any more than it legislated against assignment of this right to an attorney jeff,supra,at,fns.omitted.although shifting the cost of plaintiffs attorney fees to defendants was intended to attract competent counsel to represent citizens deprived of their civil rights,the high court stressed that congress had not bestowed fee awards upon attorneys but rather included entitl
