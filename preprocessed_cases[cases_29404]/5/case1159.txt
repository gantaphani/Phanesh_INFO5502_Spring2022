abraham carbonell appeals the district court denial of his petition for attorney fees and costs under the equal access to justice act eaja,d a.carbonell contends that he qualifies as a prevailing party under eaja because he obtained a court order incorporating a voluntary stipulation which awarded him a substantial portion of the relief he sought.we conclude that the court order materially altered the relationship between carbonell and the government and that this alteration was judicially sanctioned.we therefore hold that carbonell is a prevailing party and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings.
background 
carbonell,a native and citizen of the philippines,entered the united states in on a visitor visa.in,after being served with an order to show cause and after several continuances that allowed him time to find counsel,carbonell appeared in immigration court with an attorney,at which point he conceded removability and applied for asylum.the immigration judge ij set a hearing date,which was subsequently rescheduled.according to carbonell,his attorney was notified of the change in date but never informed him.neither carbonell nor his attorney attended the rescheduled hearing,and the ij consequently issued an in absentia order of deportation,of which carbonell was unaware.soon thereafter,carbonell applied for and secured an visa.when the visa expired in,he attempted to renew it,under the mistaken belief that he was still lawfully in the united states.it was then that he was informed of the in absentia order of deportation.
in june,carbonell hired a new attorney and filed a motion to reopen based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.three months later,the motion to reopen was denied and carbonell appealed to the board of immigration appeals bia.while the appeal was pending,carbonell applied for adjustment of status as a derivative beneficiary of his wife and daughter approved petition for residency.on june,carbonell attended the hearing regarding his adjustment of status application,at which point the immigration and naturalization service ins arrested him and denied him adjustment of status because of the in absentia deportation order.he was detained in a federal facility,where he remained for the next months.on june,after his appeal had been pending for over three years,the bia affirmed the ij denial of carbonell motion to reopen.carbonell then filed a motion to reconsider and a request for a stay of deportation with the bia.without ruling on the motion to reconsider,the bia denied carbonell request for a stay in a cursory,boilerplate decision.
held in detention and faced with an enforceable order of deportation,carbonell appealed to this court.under,had the ins deported carbonell prior to deciding the motion to reconsider,the bia would have dismissed his case and he would have had no further recourse.we granted the ins motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,on the ground that the bia denial of a request for stay of deportation was not a final,appealable order.however,we issued a temporary stay of deportation to remain in effect until the issuance of the mandate.while carbonell petition was still pending before this court,the ins informed him that as soon as the stay issued by the ninth circuit was dismissed,he would be placed on the next available flight to the philippines regardless of the pending motion before the bia.the ins secured a travel document from the philippines consulate general for deportation,although the bia had still not ruled on the motion to reconsider the denial of the motion to reopen.
in december,carbonell filed a complaint and petition for writ of habeas corpus in the district court.he sought to compel the bia to rule on his motion to reconsider,and to stay deportation until it did so.carbonell counsel attempted to reach an agreement with the government,but it refused to stipulate to a stay of deportation.carbonell then requested a temporary restraining order from the district court.in response,the ins stated that it would not attempt to deport carbonell until the mandate in carbonell initial appeal issued from this court.the district court denied carbonell request for a temporary restraining order on that basis,reasoning that carbonell could file for a temporary restraining order once the mandate issued or seven days before the deportation,whichever came first.
carbonell then asked the ins to give him seven days notice before the date on which the ins intended to deport him,so that he could file for a temporary restraining order once this court mandate had issued,but the ins refused to do so.consequently,carbonell requested a temporary restraining order for a second time.the ins explained in response that it would take a minimum of thirty days from the date that the mandate issued for the ins to deport carbonell.the district court denied carbonell second request for a temporary restraining order on that basis,but stated that carbonell could renew his request once the mandate issued.
the ins subsequently moved to dismiss carbonell claims before the district court.the district court denied the motion,explaining that it had jurisdiction to hear carbonell habeas claim and that based on the alleged facts,carbonell had stated claims under the administrative procedure act,the mandamus act,and bivens.the court noted that it was completely disingenuous for the ins to assert that carbonell had no habeas claim when it was holding him in custody while the bia failed to rule on his motion to reconsider.
nearly a week after the district court denied the government motion to dismiss,the mandate in carbonell appeal to this court issued.about one week later,carbonell requested a temporary restraining order for the third time.within two weeks,the ins and carbonell stipulated to a stay of deportation until the bia ruled on his motion to reconsider,and the court incorporated the stipulation into an order.less than a month afterwards,the bia granted carbonell motion to reconsider and allowed him to reopen his case on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel in order to pursue adjustment of status.he was then released from jail.soon afterwards,carbonell gave notice to the district court of the bia ruling.he subsequently requested that the district court dismiss the action,and the court did so.
carbonell then moved for attorney fees and costs under the equal access to justice act eaja.the district court denied the motion,on the ground that carbonell was not a prevailing party under eaja.carbonell appeals.
ii.standard of review 
we review a district court denial of attorney fees and costs under eaja for an abuse of discretion.akopyan barnhart,cir.a district court abuses its discretion if its ruling on a fee motion is based on an inaccurate view of the law or a clearly erroneous finding of fact.barrios cal.interscholastic fed n,cir.any elements of legal analysis and statutory interpretation underlying the district court attorney fees decision are reviewed de novo.id.factual findings underlying the district court decision are reviewed for clear error.id.
iii.discussion 
under the american rule,litigants ordinarily are required to bear the expenses of their litigation unless a statute or private agreement provides otherwise.congress has authorized fee recovery by prevailing parties in eaja.under eaja,a litigant is entitled to attorney fees and costs if he is the prevailing party the government fails to show that its position was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust and the requested fees and costs are reasonable.smith,cir citing d a.
the first question that must be resolved,therefore,is whether carbonell is a prevailing party.in buckhannon bd.care home,west virginia dep t of health human,d,the supreme court clarified who constitutes a prevailing party for the purpose of awarding attorney fees.according to buckhannon,a litigant must meet two criteria to qualify as a prevailing party.first,he must achieve a material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties.second,that alteration must be judicially sanctioned.id.at.labotest,bonta,cir t he buckhannon
