in this case,we decide whether,in a suit for benefits under a personal injury protection policy,an insurer may ever recover attorney fees pursuant to the offer of judgment statute.we review nichols state farm mutual,so d dca,which held that an insurer could recover such fees but certified to us a question of great public importance.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.state farm mut.auto.ins.nichols,so d granting review.as we explain below,we agree with the district court in this case,as well as the other district courts that have considered this issue,and hold that a suit for pip benefits is a civil action for damages to which the offer of judgment statute applies.we also agree with the district court,however,that in this case the insurer offer did not satisfy the requirements of florida rule of civil procedure.we therefore approve the district court decision in full.
after suffering injuries in a car accident in,shannon nichols requested personal injury protection benefits from her insurer,state farm.while agreeing to pay her early medical bills,state farm requested that nichols undergo an independent medical examination to determine the need for further treatment.despite repeated rescheduling,she ultimately failed to attend the exam.under the pip statute,i f a person unreasonably refuses to submit to an examination,the personal injury protection carrier is no longer liable for subsequent personal injury protection benefits.b.stat.relying on the statute,state farm refused to pay any additional benefits.
nichols filed a complaint against state farm in county court,alleging breach of their insurance contract.while the pip suit was pending,state farm served nichols with a proposal for settlement in the amount of.as a condition of the settlement,however,nichols would have been required to execute a general release in favor of state farm,which will be expressly limited to all claims,causes of action,that have accrued through the date of nichols acceptance of this proposal.at the time,she also had an outstanding uninsured motorist um claim arising from the same accident,which later settled for.fearing that the release would extinguish both the pip claim and the um claim,nichols rejected the offer.state farm later claimed that it did not intend for the release to extinguish the um claim.
at trial,the jury found that nichols unreasonably refused to submit to a medical examination,which meant she was not entitled to any recovery.state farm therefore requested attorney fees and costs under the offer of judgment statute.see.stat.the county court initially denied the request,concluding that the offer of judgment statute does not apply to pip suits.only days later,however,the third district held that the offer of judgment statute does apply to such suits.see sec.ins.cahuasqui,so d dca,review dismissed,so d.upon reconsideration,the county court awarded to state farm.it also certified to the fifth district a question of great public importance,asking whether the offer of judgment statute applies to pip suits.
the fifth district answered yes.nichols,so d at.applying the statute plain language,which encompasses any civil action for damages filed in the courts of this state.stat,the district court concluded that the legislature clearly and unambiguously intended for the statute to cover pip suits.nichols,so d at.while acknowledging thoughtful policy arguments for the opposite result,the district court advised that they would be more appropriately addressed to the legislature.id.
judge sawaya dissented in part.he argued that the legislature never intended a suit to recover pip benefits to be an action for damages under section.id.at sawaya,concurring in part and dissenting in part.the purpose of the pip system,he wrote,was to guarantee swift payment to insureds without regard to fault.in his view,application of section to pip cases,with its inherent uncertainties and risks,has completely abrogated the security and the assurance that injured insureds were promised by the legislature through the act.id.at.he joined the majority,however,in certifying to us a question of great public importance may an insurer recover attorney fees under rule,florida rules of civil procedure,and section,florida statutes,in an action by its insured to recover under a personal injury protection policy id.at.
on appeal,nichols raised another issue whether state farm settlement proposal satisfied florida rule of civil procedure,which demands that such proposals state with particularity any relevant conditions and state with particularity all nonmonetary terms.civ.c c d.she argued that state farm offer was too ambiguous because it arguably required her to release not only her pip claim,but also her outstanding um claim.nichols,so d at.at the attorney fees hearing,she even accused state farm of attempting in bad faith to kill two claims with one release.id.but state farm,professing to have been unaware of the existence of the um claim at the time,testified that had the proposal for settlement been accepted,it would not have required that the release include the um claim.id.at.the trial court accepted state farm explanation and deemed the settlement proposal valid under rule.id.at.
the fifth district concluded,however,that because the scope of the release could not be determined without resort to clarification or judicial interpretation,the settlement proposal was too ambiguous to satisfy rule.according to the district court,t he terms and conditions of the proposal should be devoid of ambiguity,patent or latent.id.it therefore reversed the award of attorney fees to state farm.
both parties petitioned us for review.nichols relied on the certified question,whereas state farm alleged express and direct conflict with other district court decisions regarding rule particularity requirement.we granted review based on the certified question and consolidated the cases.state farm,so d at.we now approve the fifth district reasoning on both issues,which we analyze separately.
ii.the certified question 
the certified question asks whether the offer of judgment statute applies to pip suits.the fifth district answered yes,nichols,so d at,as have the other two district courts to consider the issue.see tran state farm fire cas,so d dca cahuasqui,so d at.two of those cases,however,produced dissents.see nichols,so d at sawaya,concurring in part and dissenting in part cahuasqui,so d at fletcher,dissenting.we agree with the three district courts and hold that the offer of judgment statute applies to pip suits.to explain our decision,we discuss a whether the offer of judgment statute includes pip suits,b whether the separate attorney fees provision in the pip statute precludes application of the offer of judgment statute,and finally c whether applying the offer of judgment statute to pip suits would render unconstitutional the entire pip system.
a.the offer of judgment statute 
the first issue is whether the offer of judgment statute applies to pip suits.the statute provides 
in any civil action for damages filed in the courts of this state,if a defendant files an offer of judgment which is not accepted by the plaintiff within days,the defendant shall be entitled to recover reasonable costs and attorney fees incurred by her or him from the date of filing of the offer if the judgment is one of no liability or the judgment obtained by the plaintiff is at least percent less than such offer,and the court shall set off such costs and attorney fees against the award.
stat.emphasis added.the district courts,emphasizing the plain meaning of the statute,have consistently held that a pip suit is a civil action for damages.see nichols,so d at cahuasqui,so d at.but nichols maintains that her suit is better characterized as an action for benefits or security.
we find this characterization to be a distinction without a difference.the purpose of a pip suit is to recover damages for breach of an insurance contract.in fact,in nichols initial complaint,and again in her amended complaints,she expressly referred to her suit as an action for damages.while the contractual breach may consist of a failure to pay insurance benefits or security,the plaintiff,if successful,nevertheless will receive compensation for her loss,which is the very definition of damages.see,black law dictionary ed defining damages as m oney claimed by,or ordered to be paid to,a person as compensation for loss or injury.as one court has said,t he right to damages may arise under tort law it may arise under contract law it may arise under property law.if the party seeks damages from another party,then the claim is covered by section broad phrase,civil action for damages.beyel.crane rigging of ace,so d,dca.nothing in the offer of judgment statute exempts claims for contractual damages.
we have long recognized that,where a statute is free from ambiguity,we must follow its plain meaning.as we have explained,w hen the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous and conveys a clear and definite meaning,there is no occasion for resorting to the rules of statutory interpretation and construction the statute must be given its plain and obvious meaning.clines state,so d,quoting douglass,mcrainey,so.this is one of those times.the phrase any civil action for damages unambiguously includes suits to recover damages for breach of a pip insurance contract.we therefore conclude that the offer of judgment statute encompasses such cases.
b.the pip statute 
having determined that a pip suit is a civil action for damages covered by the offer of judgment statute,we now consider whether the separate attorney fees provision in the pip statute precludes application of other attorney fees provisions.in considering this issue,we note the principle of statutory construction that where two statutory provisions are in conflict,the specific statute controls over the general statute.state,so d,citing state ex rel.johnson vizzini,so d.moreover,the chapter containing the offer of judgment statute expressly states that i f a provision of this part is in conflict with any other provision of the florida statutes,such other provision shall apply.stat.thus,if the offer of judgment statute conflicts with the attorney fees provision in the pip statute,the latter controls.we conclude,however,that they do not conflict.
the attorney fees provision in the pip statute,entitled applicability of provision regulating attorney fees,states that w ith respect to any dispute under the provisions of the pip statute between the insured and the insurer,the provisions of shall apply.stat.the statute,section,provides 
upon the rendition of a judgment or decree by any of the courts of this state against an insurer and in favor of any named or omnibus insured or the named beneficiary under a policy or contract executed by the insurer,the trial court or,in the event of an appeal in which the insured or beneficiary prevails,the appellate court shall adjudge or decree against the insurer and in favor of the insured or beneficiary a reasonable sum as fees or compensation for the insured or beneficiary attorney prosecuting the suit in which the recovery is had.
stat.in other words,a prevailing insured,but not a prevailing insurer,is entitled to attorney fees.
nichols argues that because section only authorizes attorney fees for insureds,and because it is the only attorney fees provision incorporated into the pip statute,it implicitly precludes courts from awarding attorney fees to pip insurers under any other provision,including the offer of judgment statute.she emphasizes our decision in danis industries ground improvement techniques,so d,which explained that section is a street offering the potential for attorneys fees only to the insured or beneficiary in order to discourage insurers from contesting valid claims and to reimburse successful policy holders forced to sue to enforce their policies.id.at.
even danis recognized,however,that the street under section can not be used as a detour around settlement negotiations.the specific issue in that case was what it meant for an insured to prevail under section.we held that an insured prevails only when the insured obtain s a judgment greater than any offer of settlement previously tendered by the insurer.id.in a later case,scottsdale insurance desalvo,so d,we clarified that the judgment includes the insured damages plus any attorney fees,taxable costs,and prejudgment interest incurred before the insurer offer.
together,danis and desalvo drew a clear line between the and periods.unless and until the insurer offers to pay the insured damages plus attorney fees,costs,and interest,the street under section entitles the insured to attorney fees.but once such an offer is made and rejected,the street ends.the insured,having turned down the full amount she is owed,can not claim the protection of section.
the question here is whether the insurer,having made an offer that eliminates the insured entitlement to further attorney fees under section,can recover its own fees if it meets the conditions of the offer of judgment statute.neither danis nor desalvo resolved that question.recently,however,we did clear the way for application of the offer of judgment statute to insurance cases by extending a crucial part of the reasoning to the offer of judgment statute.in white steak ale of florida,so d,we held that the term judgment under the offer of judgment statute must be it is under section include not only the plaintiff damages award,but also any attorney fees,taxable costs,and prejudgment interest to which the plaintiff would have been entitled when the offer was made.id.at.it is this judgment to which the offer must be compared in determining whether to award fees and costs under both the offer of judgment statute and section.id.citing desalvo,so d at.we explained that a lthough danis and desalvo involved an award of attorneys fees under section,we see no reason why this rationale should not apply equally to offers or demands made under section.id.at.
because we have uniformly defined the term judgment under both section and the offer of judgment statute,the two statutes can be applied simultaneously to pip cases without creating conflict.the following chart illustrates how they interact 
the most complex situation is where the insured recovers some damages,but the judgment is only percent or less of the defendant offer.this is not such a case,because nichols recovered nothing.in that situation,both parties have a statutory entitlement to attorney fees.even then,however,the two statutes will not conflict under section the insured will be awarded attorney fees incurred before the offer,and under the offer of judgment statute the insurer will be awarded fees incurred after the offer.
given the lack of conflict between the statutes,the question becomes whether the expression of one thing,attorney fees for insureds under sections and implies the exclusion of another,attorney fees under the offer of judgment statute.as one court noted in holding that the offer of judgment statute applied in pip cases,t his rule that the inclusion of one thing means the exclusion of another,however,does not mean that the application of one precludes the additional application of another.cahuasqui,so d at.
in cases involving other types of insurance,we have not interpreted section as precluding the application of other attorney fees provisions.to the contrary,we have authorized the application of the offer of judgment statute in an underinsured motorist case,even though it also fell within the scope of section.see sarkis allstate ins,so d.the district courts,too,have applied the offer of judgment statute to insurance cases,including those involving property insurance,see.lumbermens mut.ins.sunrise club,so d,dca,liability insurance,rabatie sec.ins,so d dca,and uninsured motorist benefits.see weesner united servs.auto.ass n,so d,dca allstate ins.manasse,so d,dca allstate ins.silow,so d,dca state farm mut.auto.ins.marko,so d,dca.one court has specifically rejected the argument that in an uninsured motorist case section precludes an award of attorney fees to the insurer under the offer of judgment statute.weesner,so d at.
nichols attempts to distinguish pip suits from these other insurance cases on the ground that section applies to pip suits through a separate provision in the pip statute,which incorporates it by reference.see.stat.according to nichols,the legislature reason for including this separate provision must have been to foreclose the application of any other attorney fees provisions to pip suits.otherwise,she argues,the provision would be redundant with section.
we find this argument unpersuasive.if the legislature had enacted section for the sole purpose of excluding all other attorney fees provisions in pip suits,then presumably it would have used exclusionary language,rather than the inclusive language it used.the words in the statute are the best guide to legislative intent.here,section gives no clue that the legislature intended to prohibit application of the offer of judgment statute.
access to courts 
nichols argues that applying the offer of judgment statute to pip suits will deny insureds access to courts and thus render the entire pip system unconstitutional.article i,section of the florida constitution provides that t he courts shall be open to every person for redress of any injury,and justice shall be administered without sale,denial or delay.we hold that even with the addition of the offer of judgment statute,the pip statute withstands constitutional scrutiny.
we first considered the pip statute constitutionality in kluger white,so d.we interpreted the provision to mean that the legislature can not abolish a traditional right of recovery without providing a reasonable alternative to protect the rights of the people of the state to redress for injuries,unless the legislature can show an overpowering public necessity for the abolishment of such right,and no alternative method of meeting such public necessity can be shown.id.at.applying this standard,we held unconstitutional the portion of the pip statute that provided an exemption from tort liability for certain property damage.id.at.we cautioned,however,that if insurance had been made compulsory for property damage,the provision might have been upheld.id.
one year after kluger,we decided that the personal injury portion of the pip statute,which does make insurance compulsory,provides a reasonable alternative to the traditional action in tort and therefore complies with the provision.see lasky state farm ins,so d.we reasoned that,under the pip system,i n exchange for his previous right to damages for pain and suffering with recovery limited to those situations where he can prove that the other party was at fault,the injured party is assured of recovery of his major and salient economic losses from his own insurer.id.we emphasized that the insured can recover something even where he himself is at fault,and that normally there will be speedy payment rather than prolonged litigation.id.
as the pip statute has been amended over the years,we have considered new challenges to its constitutionality.the most prominent example is chapman dillon,so d.in the eight years between lasky and chapman,the legislature substantially reduced the percentage of medical expenses and lost wages the insured may recover.id.at.deciding that the amendments were reasonable attempts by the legislature to correct some of the practical problems which the law had posed,we again upheld the statute.id.although the changes meant that insureds would not necessarily recover all their economic losses,we explained that full recovery was not essential to the outcome in lasky i nstead the crux in lasky was that all owners of motor vehicles were required to purchase insurance which would assure injured parties recovery of their major and salient economic losses.id.at.we determined that the statutory amendments have not fundamentally changed this essential characteristic of the law.id.
the question here is whether allowing pip insurers to recover attorney fees under the offer of judgment statute enacted after lasky and chapman,see ch,laws of would fundamentally change the essential characteristics of the pip system and thereby deny access to courts.the only case in which we have analyzed an attorney fees provision under the provision is florida patient compensation fund rowe,so d.there,we considered whether section,florida statutes,which provided attorney fees for the prevailing party in medical malpractice cases,violated the florida constitution.we held it did not,explaining 
the assessment of attorney fees against an unsuccessful litigant imposes no more of a penalty than other costs of proceedings which are more commonly assessed the statute may encourage an initiating party to consider carefully the likelihood of success before bringing an action,and similarly encourage a defendant to evaluate the same factor in determining how to proceed once an action is filed.we reject the argument that section so deters the pursuit of medical malpractice claims that it effectively denies access to the courts to either party in malpractice actions.we find that an award of attorneys fees to the prevailing party is a matter of substantive law properly within the aegis of the legislature,in accordance with the american rule adopted by this court.see whitten progressive cas.ins,so d.as difficult as the resulting application of this statute may be in certain cases,we conclude that section is constitutional.
id.at citations omitted.as this passage makes clear,statutes generally do not deny access to courts.id.
we recognize that the pip statute is unique.it expressly abolished a traditional right by limiting the recovery available to car accident victims.in exchange,the statute made pip insurance compulsory and allowed recovery regardless of fault.as we have noted,the purpose of the statutory scheme is to provide swift and virtually automatic payment so that the injured insured may get on with his life without undue financial interruption.ivey allstate ins,so d,quoting gov t employees ins.gonzalez,so d,dca.this benefit balances the restrictions on recovery,making the pip statute a reasonable alternative to the traditional tort action.
applying the offer of judgment statute to pip suits will not upset this balance.insurers are entitled to attorney fees only in two limited circumstances where the insured recovers nothing at trial,as happened in this case and where the insured rejects an offer that turns out to be at least greater than the damages awarded at trial,when added to any attorney fees,taxable costs,and prejudgment interest that the insured accumulated before the offer.in other words,for the offer of judgment statute to apply,the plaintiff either must have a very weak case,or must reject a very generous offer.encouraging plaintiffs to settle in those circumstances,rather than pursue needless litigation,is entirely consistent with the intent of the legislation of relieving our overburdened court system.cahuasqui,so d at.we therefore hold that application of the offer of judgment statute to pip suits does not render the pip statute constitutionally infirm.
iii.the particularity requirement 
the remaining issue is whether state farm settlement proposal satisfied the particularity requirement of florida rule of civil procedure.the rule requires that settlement proposals state with particularity any relevant conditions and also state with particularity all nonmonetary terms.civ.c c d.as the district court noted below,t his requirement of particularity is fundamental to the purpose underlying the statute and rule.a proposal for settlement is intended to end judicial labor,not create more.nichols,so d at.
the fifth district decided that the language requiring nichols to sign a general release was too ambiguous to satisfy rule.nichols,so d at.accordingly,it reversed the trial court award of attorney fees under the offer of judgment statute.state farm now challenges the fifth district ruling,claiming it conflicts with other district court decisions.we exercise our discretion to review the issue.see savoie state,so d,holding that once this court has jurisdiction of a cause,it has jurisdiction to consider all issues appropriately raised in the appellate process.as explained below,we conclude that state farm settlement proposal failed to eliminate ambiguity regarding nichols outstanding um claim and thus can not support an award of attorney fees.
as a threshold matter,we must determine whether a general release qualifies as one of the relevant conditions or nonmonetary terms of a settlement proposal,which must be described with particularity under rule.in this case,the fifth district determined that a release is a condition and a nonmonetary term.see nichols,so d at.most district courts agree.see,nation tech.teletronics,so d,dca dryden pedemonti,so d,dca palm beach polo holdings,vill.of wellington,so d,dca sink emerald hill owners ass n,so d,dca boyd nationwide mut.fire ins,so d,dca swartsel publix super,so d,dca hales advanced.design,so d,dca.
in an earlier case,however,the third district held that the releases and dismissal required by a settlement proposal were not conditions of the settlement,but rather mechanical and legally inconsequential means of effecting it.they thus should be regarded as mere surplusage,the existence of which should not affect substantial rights.earnest stewart,codina,so d,dca.a few decisions,mostly from the third district,have expressed this view.see delpa,martinez,so d,dca gulf coast,padron,so d,dca kaplan goldfarb,so d,dca.
applying the plain meaning of rule,we agree with those courts that have treated releases as conditions or nonmonetary terms that must be described with particularity.a condition is traditionally defined as a stipulation or prerequisite in a contract,will,or other instrument,constituting the essence of the instrument.black law dictionary ed.a term is defined more broadly as a contractual stipulation.id.at.we think it clear that when an offeror insists that an offeree sign a general release,the release becomes a stipulation or prerequisite of the contract.even if the release does not constitute the essence of the settlement thus a condition under subdivision c c of the the very least it qualifies as a nonmonetary term under subdivision c d.
next we consider what degree of particularity the rule requires.some courts have demanded that an offeror state all the terms of any general release or,instead,attach a copy of the actual documents themselves to the offer.swartsel,so d at emphasis added.in this case,however,the fifth district interpreted the rule as giving offerors the option of including either the proposed language of the release or a summary of the substance of the release.nichols,so d at see also palm beach polo,so d at following nichols boyd,so d at requiring only a summary sufficient to apprise the offeree of its terms.
we agree that a summary of the proposed release can be sufficient to satisfy rule,as long as it eliminates any reasonable ambiguity about its scope.as the second district recently explained 
the rule intends for a proposal for judgment to be as specific as possible,leaving no ambiguities so that the recipient can fully evaluate its terms and conditions.furthermore,if accepted,the proposal should be capable of execution without the need for judicial interpretation.proposals for settlement are intended to end judicial labor,not create more.
lucas calhoun,so d,dca citation omitted.we recognize that,given the nature of language,it may be impossible to eliminate all ambiguity.the rule does not demand the impossible.it merely requires that the settlement proposal be sufficiently clear and definite to allow the offeree to make an informed decision without needing clarification.if ambiguity within the proposal could reasonably affect the offeree decision,the proposal will not satisfy the particularity requirement.
we caution that rule is not intended to revolutionize the language used in general releases.traditionally,general releases have included expansive language designed to protect the offeror from unforeseen developments or creative maneuvering by the other party.such language can be sufficiently particular to satisfy rule.for example,in board of trustees of florida atlantic university bowman,so d dca,the fourth district concluded that the language in a general release,even though expansive,is typical of other general releases and is clear and unambiguous.id.at.the rule aims to prevent ambiguity,not breadth.
state farm settlement proposal was too ambiguous to satisfy rule.the proposal stated,at the outset,that it would be a full and final satisfaction and settlement of any and all of nichols claims and causes of action in,or arising out of,the case.then it provided that nichols would be required to execute a general release in favor of state farm,which will be expressly limited to all claims,causes of action,that have accrued through the date of nichols acceptance of this proposal.at the time of the offer,nichols not only had a pending pip claim against state farm,but also a um claim arising from the same accident and of greater value.although that claim was not technically in the case,it could have been viewed as a claim arising out of the case,because it arose from the same set of facts.state farm use of the broad phrase all claims,causes of action,exacerbated this ambiguity.
the district courts have consistently held,and we agree,that settlement proposals must clarify which of an offeree outstanding claims against the offeror will be extinguished by any proposed release.see,dryden,so d at holding that the description of a general release was not as clear and as certain as it should be,because it could have been found to have extinguished additional claims palm beach polo,so d at holding that the offer was legally deficient because plaintiff acceptance could have extinguished other pending unrelated claims morgan beekie,so d,dca holding that an offer can not be a basis for an award of attorney fees because it was both ambiguous and failed to make it clear that it was solely for personal injuries when the settlement of the property damage claim had not yet been fully consummated.because state farm offer failed to do so,it is invalid under rule and can not support an award of attorney fees under the offer of judgment statute.
iv.conclusion 
we hold that the offer of judgment statute applies to pip suits.in this case,however,state farm offer of judgment was too ambiguous to satisfy florida rule of civil procedure.we therefore approve in full the district court decision reversing the award of attorney fees.
it is so ordered.
while i agree with the majority as to the ultimate outcome,i can not agree with the majority analysis or conclusion as to the use of the offer of judgment statute to circumvent the legislature clear intention to limit the entitlement to attorney fees in pip actions to the.by applying a broader and more general statute on fees the majority opinion has essentially eviscerated the specific legislative intent on fees,as well as fundamentally undermining the legislative scheme to assist florida citizens in the collection of pip benefits.one can only hope that the legislature will recognize that its work has been undone,and act promptly to restore the balance of rights of in their dealings with insurance companies who have now been armed with a powerful new economic weapon to discourage insureds from litigating legitimate claims.
because i agree with the dissenting opinion of judge sawaya on this issue,i quote that opinion here and endorse its analysis 
i concur with the majority that the order awarding attorney fees must be reversed.however,i respectfully disagree that the offer of judgment statute found in section,florida statutes,applies to pip cases.in my view,application of section to pip cases would completely thwart and circumvent the purposes of the florida motor vehicle law the act and pip benefits.moreover,i believe that the legislature never intended a suit to recover pip benefits to be an action for damages under section.although i concur that this issue should be certified to the florida supreme court,i believe that the question certified should be rephrased as follows to reflect the true nature of a suit to recover pip benefits and answered in the negative 
may an insurer recover attorney fees under rule,florida rules of civil procedure,and section,florida statutes,in an action brought by its insure
