introduction 
the issue presented by this appeal is whether a defendant who is not a party to a contract but is sued for breach of that contract and various related tort and statutory causes of action may recover attorney fees incurred in defending the noncontract causes of action if the plaintiff files a voluntary dismissal with prejudice.we hold that he can not.
background of the case 
appellant topanga and victory partners,llp topanga and two other plaintiffs filed a complaint against omni medical centers,omni alleging breach of contract,claims for violation of the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico et,negligence,unfair competition,and money had and received.the complaint alleged that respondent nicholas toghia,in his individual capacity as shareholder,corporate officer,and as an alter ego of omni,is liable on all of the grounds alleged in the complaint.toghia demurred to the complaint on the grounds that topanga failed to allege the elements required for a rico claim and that he was not a party to the lease agreement underlying the contract cause of action.the demurrer was overruled and toghia filed an answer.
on february,trial commenced.following opening statements and two days of testimony,topanga informed the trial court that all of the parties,except toghia,had entered into a final settlement agreement thus concluding the proceedings.the settlement agreement included a specific provision for a dismissal with prejudice of toghia.toghia counsel explicitly stated on the record that,toghia is not a party to the settlement agreement he never made a request that it be settled.he did not make a demand.the record clearly establishes that toghia was not a party to the settlement agreement and never bargained for,solicited,or otherwise requested such dismissal.
toghia filed a motion for costs and attorney fees in the amount of based on the underlying that provides in relevant part if either landlord here,topanga or tenant here,omni and,allegedly,toghia as omni alter ego commences or engages in,or threatens to commence or engage in,any action or litigation or arbitration against the other party arising out of or in connection with the lease,the premises or the building or the property,including but not limited to,any action for recovery of any payment owed by either party under the lease,or to recover possession of the premises,or for damages for breach of the lease,the prevailing party shall be entitled to have and recover from the losing party reasonable attorneys fees and other costs incurred in connection with the action and in preparation for said action.if landlord becomes involved in any litigation or dispute,threatened or actual,by or against anyone not a party to the lease,but arising by reason of or related to any act or omission of tenant or tenant employees,tenant agrees to pay landlord reasonable attorneys fees and other costs incurred in connection with the litigation or dispute regardless of whether a lawsuit is actually filed.
toghia applied for attorney fees for defending the rico and tort causes of action pursuant to civil code section.toghia,however,did not request attorney fees incurred for defending the contract cause of action because section,subdivision b effectively precludes any award of attorney fees by providing there is no prevailing party when,as here,the contract cause of action is voluntarily dismissed.the trial court granted toghia motion relying on santisas goodin cal th,d,santisas and awarded him.topanga now appeals from the award of attorney fees and costs we conclude the trial court reliance on santisas is misplaced.toghia is not entitled to recover the attorney fees he incurred with respect to any of the alleged causes of action.
discussion 
standard of review 
the issues presented by this appeal involve statutory and case law respecting an award of attorney fees.we,therefore,review the matter as a pure question of law.silver boatwright home inspection,th,d.there are no relevant evidentiary disputes and the determination of the trial court did not require an exercise of discretion.consequently,this appeal does not involve the resolution of disputed facts,and is subject to the appellate court de novo review.eisenberg et,cal.practice guide civil appeals and writs the rutter group.
toghia claim for attorney fees is based on the following provision of civil code section in any action on a contract,where the contract specifically provides that attorney fees and costs,which are incurred to enforce that contract,shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party,then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract,whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or not,shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees in addition to other costs,subd.a.
only in an action on a contract does section provide mutuality of remedy when the contract includes a provision for the recovery of attorney fees as costs.it is applied where an otherwise unilateral right to recover attorney fees is not reciprocal,ensuring mutuality of remedy so that attorney fees may be awarded to whichever contracting party prevails.it is also applied where a party is sued on a contract providing for an award of attorney fees to which he is not a party.to ensure mutuality of remedy in this situation,it has been consistently held that when a party litigant prevails in an action on a contract by establishing that the contract is invalid,inapplicable,unenforceable,or nonexistent,section permits that party recovery of attorney fees whenever the opposing parties would have been entitled to attorney fees under the contract had they prevailed.see,reynolds metals alperson cal d,santisas,supra,cal th,d.toghia claim for attorney fees is predicated on this last recited application of section,which applies to a person sued on a contract he did not sign.
toghia acknowledges that recovery of attorney fees on the contract action is not allowed.where an action has been voluntarily dismissed or dismissed pursuant to a settlement of the case,there shall be no party prevailing on the contract for purposes of this section,subd.b.he contends,however,that the supreme court decisions in international industries,olen cal d,olen and santisas,supra,cal th,d,support his claim for recovery of attorney fees incurred for the defense of the noncontract causes of action even though the entire action was dismissed with prejudice.
olen concerned two actions to enforce a sublease containing a provision for attorney fees incurred by the sublessor to enforce a sublease.the sublessor filed an action to recover rent and another action for unlawful detainer.the sublessee vacated the leased premises and the sublessor relet the premises to another tenant.the sublessor then dismissed both actions.the sublessee then moved for an award of costs,including attorney fees,based on section.as it then read,section authorized recovery of attorney fees to the prevailing party in any action on a contract,where such contract specifically provides that attorney fees and costs,which are incurred to enforce the provisions of such contract,shall be awarded to one of the parties citation.but section then defined prevailing party simply as the party in whose favor a final judgment is rendered.santisas,supra,cal th at,d.
the olen court held that section attorney fees could not be awarded where the action was voluntarily dismissed before trial because there was no judgment rendered in favor of the sublessee.the court reasoned that rendition was a judicial act whereas a dismissal is a nonjudicial act performed by the clerk and does not determine the rights of the parties.olen,supra,cal d at.the court further concluded that equitable principles govern the application of section and rejected any rule that automatically permits recovery of fees when a plaintiff has voluntarily dismissed the action before trial.in pretrial dismissal cases,we are faced with a hobson choice of either adopting an automatic right to attorney fees,thereby encouraging the maintenance of pointless litigation and violating the equitable principles which should govern attorney fee clauses,providing for application of equitable considerations,requiring use of scarce judicial resources for trial of the merits of dismissed actions,or continuing the former rule,denying attorney fees in spite of agreement.we are satisfied that concern for the efficient and equitable administration of justice requires that the parties in pretrial dismissal cases be left to bear their own attorney fees,whether claim is asserted on the basis of the contract or section reciprocal right.olen,supra,cal d at.
in,the legislature amended section,codifying olen holding that a voluntary dismissal precludes recovery of attorney fees in a contract action,but did not limit this exclusion to pretrial dismissal cases.in its present form section,subdivision b reads where an action has been voluntarily dismissed or dismissed pursuant to a settlement of the case,there shall be no party prevailing on the contract for purposes of this section.
in santisas,the plaintiffs purchased a home from the defendants pursuant to a written purchase agreement and deposit receipt.the agreement included an inclusive provision for the award of attorney fees as follows in the event legal action is instituted by the broker s,or any party to this agreement,or arising out of the execution of this agreement of the sale,or to collect commissions,the prevailing party shall be entitled to receive from the other party a reasonable attorney fee to be determined by the court in which such action is brought.cal th at,d.the fact that the buyer plaintiffs and seller defendants signed the purchase agreement was uncontested.
after the consummation of the sale,the buyer plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against the seller defendants based on allegations that the house was defective and they sought recovery of both general and exemplary damages the complaint alleged causes of action for breach of contract and various tort claims including negligence and deceit.the seller defendants answered,but prior to trial the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the action with prejudice.the seller defendants moved to recover their attorney fees as costs under code of civil procedure sections,and pursuant to the attorney fee provision of the purchase agreement.the plaintiff buyers opposed the motion on the ground that section and olen precluded any recovery of attorney fees where an action is voluntarily dismissed.the court concluded that section,subdivision b barred an award of any attorney fees incurred in defending the contract claims,but held that neither civil code section nor olen,supra,cal d,bars recovery of attorney fees incurred in defending tort or other noncontract claims.whether attorney fees incurred in defending tort or other noncontract claims are recoverable after a pretrial dismissal depends upon the terms of the contractual attorney fee provision.santisas,supra,cal th at,d.
the supreme court considered the request for attorney fees as a claim made pursuant to a contract signed by both the plaintiffs and the defendants.whether a party to litigation is entitled to recover costs is governed by code of civil procedure section,which provides,in subdivision b,that except as otherwise expressly provided by statute,a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding.for the purpose of determining entitlement to recover costs,code of civil procedure section defines prevailing party as including,among others,a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered.code civ,subd.a.because plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed this action with prejudice,the seller defendants are defendants in whose favor a dismissal has been entered.accordingly,they are prevailing parties within the meaning of code of civil procedure section,subdivision b,and are entitled as a matter of right to recover costs unless another statute expressly provides otherwise.santisas,supra,cal th at,d.
the court held the seller defendants were entitled under the terms of the attorney fees provision of the contract between the parties to recovery attorney fees as the prevailing parties on the tort causes of action claim,but the recovery of attorney fees on the contract cause of action was barred by section,subdivision b.the significant point of the decision in santisas is that the claims for attorney fees were based on the terms of a written contract entered into by the parties.therefore,the application of section applies only to breach of contract actions and does not apply to tort causes of action.
application 
toghia was not a party to the contract underlying the breach of contract cause of action and can not rely on code of civil procedure section,subdivision a a,authorizing an award of attorney fees as costs pursuant to a contract between the parties.he asserts that because section is applicable to his claim for attorney fees,he is entitled to recover attorney fees incurred in defending the tort causes of action,as did the defendants in santisas.we disagree.as we discuss post,toghia misapprehends the application of section and fails to distinguish between it and contracts within operation of the award of costs as provided in code of civil procedure section.
toghia argues that attorney fees are recoverable whenever a party is sued without regard to the theory of the action.he claims that hsu abbara cal th,d,supports that conclusion.we disagree.the only question resolved in hsu was whether the trial court abused its discretion when it determined there was no prevailing party even though the defendant obtained a simple,unqualified victory by defeating the only contract claim in the action.toghia,however,invokes hsu in support of his claim for attorney fees pursuant to section for the tort causes of action.in fact,hsu specifically recognizes that section applies only to an action on a contract.it is now settled that a party is entitled to attorney fees under section even when the party prevails on grounds the contract is inapplicable,invalid,unenforceable,or nonexistent,if the other party would have been entitled to attorney fees had it prevailed.citations.this rule serves to effectuate the purpose underlying section.as this court has explained,s ection was enacted to establish mutuality of remedy where a contractual provision makes recovery of attorney fees available for only one party citations,and to prevent oppressive use of attorney fees provisions.citation.citations.the statute would fall short of this goal of full mutuality of remedy if its benefits were denied to parties who defeat contract claims by proving that they were not parties to the alleged contract or that it was never formed.to achieve its goal,the statute generally must apply in favor of the party prevailing on a contract claim whenever that party would have been liable under the contract for attorney fees had the other party prevailed.id.at,d,italics added.hsu fails to provide any support for toghia contention that attorney fees may be awarded when incurred to defend the tort causes of action.
similarly,toghia other citations do not support his claim for attorney fees.for example,he claims jones drain d.stands for the proposition that attorney fees are recoverable despite the fact that the contract has been rescinded.in that case,the trial court found,as a matter of law,no contract existed and it denied the defendants request for attorney fees.defendants appealed.reversing,the appellate court held the courts have consistently held that the award of civil code section contractual attorney fees is to be governed by equitable principles.citations.we believe that it is extraordinarily inequitable to deny a party who successfully defends an action on a contract,which claims attorney fees,the right to recover its attorney fees and costs simply because the party initiating the case has filed a frivolous lawsuit.as a consequence,we find that a prevailing defendant sued for breach of contract containing an attorney fees provision and having had to defend the contract cause of action is entitled to recover its own attorney fees and costs therefor,even though the trial court finds no contract existed.id.at.again,the applic
