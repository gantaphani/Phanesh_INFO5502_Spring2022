we address whether the state of washington has designed its election ballots in a manner that eliminates the risk of widespread voter confusion,a question left unresolved in washington state grange washington state republican party grange.we hold that the state has done so.the ballots,and related informational materials,inform voters that,although each candidate for partisan office may specify a political party that he or she prefers,a candidate preference does not imply that the candidate is nominated or endorsed by the party,or that the party approves of or associates with that candidate.given the design of the ballot,and in the absence of evidence of actual voter confusion,we hold that washington top two primary system,as implemented by the state,does not violate the first amendment associational rights of the state political parties,the appellants here.we also affirm the district court dismissal of the plaintiffs ballot access and trademark claims.we reverse the district court order granting the state request for reimbursement of attorney fees paid in accordance with a stipulation.
background 
in,this court invalidated washington blanket primary as a violation of political parties first amendment freedom of association.see democratic party of.state reed,cir.in response to that decision,the washington state grange proposed the people choice initiative of,or initiative i,as a replacement.see grange,at.the initiative passed with nearly percent of the vote and became effective in december.see id.at.
i created a top two primary,in which the primary serves as a means of winnowing the candidates to two rather than selecting party nominees.under i,all elections for partisan offices are conducted in two stages a primary and a general election.id.footnote omitted to participate in the primary,a candidate must file a declaration of candidacy form,on which he declares his major or minor party preference,or independent status.id.quoting former,superseded in part by.each candidate and his party preference or independent status is in turn designated on the primary election ballot,and a political party can not prevent a candidate who is unaffiliated with,or even repugnant to,the party from designating it as his party of preference.id.citing former.admin.code.in the primary election,voters may select any candidate listed on the ballot,regardless of the party preference of the candidates or the voter.id.quoting former.admin.code.the candidates with the highest and vote totals advance to the general election,regardless of their party preferences.id.at.each candidate party preference is listed on the general election ballot,and may not be changed between the primary and general elections.id.at citing former.admin.code.
in may,the washington state republican party filed suit against the state,challenging i on its face.see id.the party contended that the new system violates its associational rights by usurping its right to nominate its own candidates and by forcing it to associate with candidates it does not endorse.id.the washington state democratic central committee and libertarian party of washington state joined the suit as plaintiffs,and the washington state grange joined as a defendant.see id.the district court granted the plaintiffs motions for summary judgment and enjoined the implementation of i,see.state republican party logan,d,and this court affirmed,see.state republican party washington,cir.in a separate order,we also awarded attorney fees on appeal to the plaintiffs and against the state under.
the supreme court reversed.the court began by reciting the general principle that e lection regulations that impose a severe burden on associational rights are subject to strict scrutiny,and will be upheld only if they are narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.grange,at quoting clingman beaver.if a statute imposes only modest burdens,however,then the state important regulatory interests are generally sufficient to justify reasonable,nondiscriminatory restrictions on election procedures.id.at quoting anderson celebrezze.
the court next determined that i did not on its face severely burden the plaintiffs associational rights.first,the court rejected the plaintiffs argument that i allows primary voters who are unaffiliated with a party to choose the party nominees.see id.at.the flaw in the parties argument was that the i primary does not,by its terms,choose parties nominees the parties are free to nominate their own candidates outside the primary by whatever mechanism they choose.id.at.
second,and relevant here,the court considered the plaintiffs argument that i burdens their associational rights because voters will assume that candidates on the general election ballot are the nominees of their preferred parties.id.at rejecting this argument,the court said there was no basis to presume that a electorate w ould interpret a candidate designation to mean that the candidate is the party chosen nominee or representative or that the party associates with or approves of the candidate.id.the court recognized that it was possible that voters w ould misinterpret the candidates designations as reflecting endorsement by the parties.but these cases involve a facial challenge,and we can not strike down i on its face based on the mere possibility of voter confusion.id.at.
because the court was considering a facial challenge,the question was whether the ballot could conceivably be printed in such a way as to eliminate the possibility of widespread voter confusion and with it the perceived threat to the first amendment.id.at.the court said it was not difficult to conceive of such a ballot.id.
for example,petitioners propose that the actual i ballot could include prominent disclaimers explaining that party preference reflects only the of the candidate and not an official endorsement by the party.they also suggest that the ballots might note preference in the form of a candidate statement that emphasizes the candidate personal determination rather than the party acceptance of the candidate,such as my party preference is the republican party.additionally,the state could decide to educate the public about the new primary ballots through advertising or explanatory materials mailed to voters along with their ballots.we are satisfied that there are a variety of ways in which the state could implement i that would eliminate any real threat of voter confusion.and without the specter of widespread voter confusion,respondents arguments about forced association and compelled speech fall flat.
id.at footnotes omitted.in the court view,these implementations of i would be consistent with the first amendment.id.at.
given that i did not on its face severely burden the plaintiffs associational rights,strict scrutiny did not apply and the state had to demonstrate only that i furthered important regulatory interests.the court held this lesser scrutiny was satisfied because i served the state important regulatory interest in providing voters with relevant information about the candidates on the ballot.id.at.the court remanded,however,allowing the plaintiffs to challenge i as applied.anticipating that challenge,the court said that whether voters will be confused by the designations will depend in significant part on the form of the ballot.id.at.
the state subsequently implemented i in a manner consistent with the supreme court suggestions.first,each primary and general election ballot includes a disclaimer informing voters of the absence of an association between the candidate and the preferred party.this disclaimer states 
read each candidate for partisan office may state a political party that he or she prefers.a candidate preference does not imply that the candidate is nominated or endorsed by the party,or that the party approves of or associates with that candidate.
admin.code a.second,the ballots denote a candidate party preference in the form of a candidate statement that emphasizes the candidate personal choice rather than the party acceptance of the candidate.rather than designating a candidate party preference with a simple d or r,or with the words democrat or republican,under each candidate name the ballots contain a parenthetical such as prefers democratic party or prefers republican party.third,the state requires explanatory materials to be mailed to voters every voter receives a voters pamphlet before each primary and general election.the pamphlet includes an explanation that each candidate for partisan office may state a political party that he or she prefers,and that a candidate preference does not imply that the candidate is nominated or endorsed by the party or that the party approves of or associates with that candidate.admin.code.voters also receive along with their ballots an insert stating 
each candidate for partisan office may state a political party that he or she prefers.a candidate preference does not imply that the candidate is nominated or endorsed by the party,or that the party approves of or associates with that candidate.
id.j k.fourth,the state disseminated educational information to the public about the new ballots before the primary by airing public service announcements on radio and television.
in the district court on remand,the plaintiffs argued that i,as implemented by the state,violated their first amendment associational rights.they contended that strict scrutiny applied because the state had failed to show that its implementation of i eliminated the risk of widespread voter confusion.they faulted the state for failing to present affirmative evidence to show that the ballot disclaimer and related voter information were read and understood by voters,or that these materials were effective at eliminating the risk of confusion.they also offered evidence purporting to show actual voter confusion regarding the i ballot.
on cross motions for summary judgment,the district court granted the defendants motions on the plaintiffs associational rights claims.the court emphasized that the state had implemented i in accordance with the supreme court suggestions,and that the plaintiffs evidence of actual voter confusion was either legally irrelevant or factually insufficient to create a triable issue of widespread voter confusion.
the district court also disposed of the remaining issues in the case.the court granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs on their claim that the manner in which the state provided for the election of local party officials precinct committee officers,or pcos violated the parties associational rights.the court granted the defendants motions to dismiss the plaintiffs ballot access and trademark claims,denied the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaints to add a claim under the washington constitution and granted the state motion for reimbursement of the attorney fees it paid in connection with the previous ninth circuit appeal.
the plaintiffs timely appealed.the defendants did not cross appeal the court ruling on the pco elections.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm in part and reverse in part.
ii.discussion 
freedom of association claims 
the district court granted the defendants summary judgment on the plaintiffs claims that i violates their first amendment associational rights as applied.reviewing de novo,see humane soc y of locke,cir,we affirm.
to trigger strict scrutiny,the plaintiffs must show that the state implementation of i severely burdens their freedom of association to do so,they must show that a electorate will interpret a candidate designation to mean that the candidate is the party chosen nominee or representative or that the party associates with or approves of the candidate.grange,at.this inquiry depend s in significant part on the form of the ballot.id.at.
form of the ballot 
the form of the ballot plainly supports the conclusion that i does not impose a severe burden on the plaintiffs freedom of association.as described above,the state in implementing the ballot adopted each of the supreme court suggestions.see grange,at.the ballot includes a prominent disclaimer explaining that party preference reflects only the of the candidate and not an endorsement by the party.the ballot describes a candidate party preference as prefers republican party rather than as r,republican or republican party.voters pamphlets and ballot inserts also inform voters that party preference reflects only a candidate.the form of the ballot thus points to an absence of voter confusion.
evidence of actual voter confusion 
the plaintiffs attempt to rebut this inference with evidence of actual voter confusion.this purported evidence falls into four categories,which we address in turn.as did the district court,we find this evidence insufficient to create a triable issue of widespread voter confusion.
first,the plaintiffs rely on newspaper articles in which the news media and elected officials refer to candidates as democrats or republicans when they are not official party nominees or representatives but have simply declared a preference for the democratic or republican party.such statements do not establish that members of the media or elected officials are confused about these candidates party affiliations,however.the speakers in these examples may simply be using shorthand to indicate the party preference the candidate listed on his or her declaration of candidacy.as the district court explained,these isolated incidents do not show the type of widespread voter confusion the supreme court contemplated in its review.
second,the plaintiffs introduced a study of voter confusion by mathew manweller,a professor of political science.manweller conducted cognitive experiments to determine whether voters are likely to perceive candidates listed on the i primary and general election ballots as nominees or representatives of the political parties the candidates have declared as their preference.his results suggest voter confusion,but manweller did not give the subjects in his experiments the ballot inserts and voter pamphlets the state provides to the actual electorate.the sample ballots manweller used also did not conform to the ballots used in actual elections whereas state law requires that the disclaimer regarding the lack of party association appear immediately above the first partisan congressional,state or county office.admin.code a,the ballots used in the study placed the notice on the corner,below the first partisan race.manweller results therefore are not relevant evidence of whether a electorate will interpret a candidate designation to mean that the candidate is the party chosen nominee or representative or that the party associates with or approves of the candidate.grange,at emphasis added.
third,the plaintiffs argue that washington statutes and regulations create voter confusion over whether political parties associate with or approve of candidates who specify a preference for that party on their declarations of candidacy.the plaintiffs point to two sections of washington election law that refer to a candidate statement of party preference as that candidate party affiliation.see.f.admin.code they contend that,if voters were to read these sections and see that the state equates a candidate party preference with that candidate party affiliation,they would come away with the impression that candidates are official representatives of their preferred parties.we disagree.in the first place,we find implausible the premise that even voters are aware of the intricacies of washington election regulations.it is highly unlikely that voters would read and rely on f and to obtain an understanding of i.even if voters were aware of those provisions,we do not find them confusing.there is nothing inherently misleading about equating a candidate party preference with party affiliation a candidate who has declared a preference for a particular political party has affiliated with that party.the confusion that is at issue here is whether voters mistakenly believe the party has affiliated with the candidate,not vice versa.in light of the clear language of the ballot,the voters pamphlet and the ballot insert,no reasonable voter would be confused by f and 
fourth,the democratic party complains that in several i primary elections its official nominee failed to advance to the general election.it attributes those results to voter confusion,speculating that its nominee failed to finish among the top two votegetters because another democrat entered the race and siphoned votes from the official nominee.the plaintiffs offer no evidence,however,that these election results reflect voter confusion rather than voters actual preferences.the plaintiffs have not,for example,produced surveys of actual voters showing that they voted for a candidate they mistakenly believed to be an official party nominee or representative.that official party nominees have failed to advance does not,without more,suggest voter confusion.
in sum,the plaintiffs have not demonstrated a triable issue that the state implementation of i imposes a severe burden on their freedom of association.the state therefore need show only that i furthers an important regulatory interest.they have done so,because,as the supreme court held in grange,i serves the state important regulatory interest in providing voters with relevant information about the candidates on the ballot.at.we therefore affirm summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the plaintiffs freedom of association claims.
ballot access claims 
the libertarian party argues that i violates its fundamental right of access to the ballot by making it difficult for a candidate to qualify for the general election ballot.we review de novo the district court dismissal of these claims under federal rule of civil procedure b.see cook brewer,cir.
when evaluating the constitutionality of ballot access regulations,we weigh the degree to which the regulations burden the exercise of constitutional rights against the state interests the regulations promote.see libertarian party of munro,cir.if the burden is severe,the challenged procedures must be narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest.see id.if the burden is slight,the procedures will survive review as long as they further a state important regulatory interests.nader brewer,cir quoting burdick takushi,internal quotation marks omitted.in determining whether the burden is severe,t he question is whether reasonably diligent minor party candidates can normally gain a place on the ballot,or if instead they only rarely will succeed.libertarian party of,at accord nader,at.
here,the libertarian party acknowledges that it has broad access to the i primary.to qualify for the primary ballot,a candidate whether from a major or minor party need only file a declaration of candidacy and either pay a filing fee equal to percent of the annual salary for the office or submit a signature petition in lieu of the filing fee.see.the libertarian party argues,however,that its rights are violated because i makes it difficult for a candidate to progress to the general election ballot.a candidate,whether from a major or minor party,can attain a place in the general election only by finishing in the top two in the primary.
the libertarian party relies on cases invalidating early filing deadlines for and independent candidates seeking access to general election ballots.in anderson celebrezze,the court struck down a statute requiring an independent candidate for president to file a statement of candidacy and nominating petition in march in order to appear on the november general election ballot.the court held that the early filing deadline placed an unconstitutional burden on voting and associational rights because it prevented independents from taking advantage of unanticipated political opportunities that might arise later in the election cycle and required independent candidates to gather petition signatures at a time when voters were not attuned to the upcoming campaign.see anderson,at.
by giving candidates access to the august primary ballot rather than the november general election ballot,i poses,albeit to a lesser extent,some of these same concerns.i,however,is distinguishable from the ballot access rules invalidated in anderson.first,the i primary is in august,not march.second,unlike the system challenged in anderson,in which independent candidates were required to file petitions before the major parties selected their nominees,the libertarian party participates in a primary at the same time,and on the same terms,as major party candidates.libertarian party candidates thus have an opportunity to appeal to voters at a time when election interest is near its peak,and to respond to events in the election cycle just as major party candidates do.in addition,whereas conventional systems guarantee candidates a place on the general election ballot,i gives candidates the same opportunity as candidates to advance to the general election.
in light of these distinctions,we hold that i does not impose a severe burden on the libertarian party rights.see munro socialist workers party,it can hardly be said that washington voters are denied freedom of association because they must channel their expressive activity into a campaign at the primary as opposed to the general election.the party has not shown that i impermissibly limit s the field of candidates from which voters might choose.anderson,at quoting bullock carter,internal quotation marks omitted.in addition,because i gives major and candidates equal access to the primary and general election ballots,it does not give the established parties a decided advantage over any new parties struggling for existence.williams rhodes.
we recognize the possibility that i makes it more difficult for candidates to qualify for the general election ballot than regulations permitting a candidate to qualify for a general election ballot by filing a required number of petition signatures.this additional burden,however,is an inherent feature of any top two primary system,and the supreme court has expressly approved of top two primary systems.see cal.democratic party jones.the district court therefore properly dismissed these claims.
trademark claims 
the libertarian party also contends that the state implementation of i infringes its rights under federal trademark law.we review de novo the district court rule b dismissal of these claims.see cook,at.
to establish a federal trademark infringement claim,the libertarian party is required to show that the defendant here,the state of washington uses the party registered mark in connection with the sale,offering for sale,distribution,or advertising of any goods or services.a emphasis added.this does not require any actual sale of goods or services.bosley med,kremer,cir.at minimum,however,the plaintiff must show that the defendant offers competing services to the public.id.
the libertarian party correctly points out that services can include activities performed by a political party.see united we stand,united we stand,am,cir.but it has not plausibly alleged that the state uses party labels on the ballot to perform a service in competition with the libertarian party.nor has it even attempted to make this showing.on the contrary,although the district court focused on this weakness in the party case,and although the state presses the same issue in its brief on appeal,the party has not explained how the state uses the party mark in connection with the provision of competing services.we therefore affirm dismissal of the trademark claims 
attorney fees 
in,after ruling in the plaintiffs favor on the merits,we issued an order awarding attorney fees on appeal to the plaintiffs and against the state under.the parties subsequently entered into a settlement governing the amount and payment of those fees.they reduced their settlement to a written stipulation,which was filed in this court.the supreme court thereafter granted certiorari and reversed our decision,and the state then moved for reimbursement of the fees,arguing that the plaintiffs were no longer prevailing parties.the plaintiffs opposed the motion,arguing that the settlement had definitively resolved the fee issue,irrespective of further proceedings.the district court granted the motion,and the plaintiffs appeal.because this issue turns on a question of contract interpretation,we review de novo.see doe i wal mart stores,cir contract interpretation is a question of
