phillip wagner appeals from a final judgment of the united states court of appeals for veterans claims veterans court denying his application for supplemental attorney fees incurred in the defense of his initial application for attorney fees under the equal access to justice act eaja.see wagner shinseki.vet.claims lexis.we reverse and remand.
background 
wagner served in the united states navy from july to july and from march to march.he appealed to the veterans court after the board of veterans appeals board denied his claim for benefits for a thyroid disorder.pursuant to a joint motion of the parties,the veterans court vacated the board decision and remanded the case to the department of veterans affairs for reconsideration.
wagner subsequently filed an application for attorney fees under the eaja,arguing that the remand made him a prevailing party for purposes of establishing entitlement to an eaja award.he sought fees of for hours of attorney work.the secretary of veterans affairs conceded that wagner was a prevailing party for purposes of the eaja,but challenged the amount of the fee request based on the reasonableness of the requested fees.see wagner shinseki.vet.claims lexis,at,citations and internal quotation marks omitted.specifically,the secretary argued that the fee for legal research should be reduced by hours because theodore jarvi,wagner attorney,was an experienced veterans law attorney,and should not have needed to conduct extensive research,the fee for review of wagner claim file should be reduced by hours because jarvi had already spent hours reviewing the file,and the fee for scanning the claims file and instructing staff on how to combine the files of the record before the agency rba should be reduced by hours since these tasks were purely clerical.id.at.wagner thereafter filed a response,defending his original fee application and requesting additional fees of for time spent defending the fees that had been challenged by the secretary.
on october,the veterans court granted wagner an eaja award of,which was an approximately percent reduction from the he had requested.id.at.the court reduced wagner requested fees for legal research by hours,the fees sought for review of the claims file by hours,and the fees sought for scanning the claims file and instructing staff on how to combine files from the rba by hours.of the hours that had been challenged by the secretary,the veterans court disallowed hours.id.
on october,wagner filed a revised fee application,seeking in supplemental fees for time expended defending his original eaja fee request.wagner did not seek compensation for time spent on arguments that were rejected by the veterans court when it made its original award.he argued,however,that he was partially successful in defending his original fee application,and that he should be compensated for the hours he spent successfully responding to the secretary challenges to his application as well as for the hours he spent reviewing the veterans court decision and drafting the supplemental fee request.
on february,the veterans court,in a single judge decision,denied the application for supplemental fees.the court stated that it would not reward wagner for his efforts to defend his earlier application since the court had substantially reduced wagner original eaja application after concluding that much of the requested fees were unreasonable.see wagner shinseki.vet.claims lexis,at,supplemental fees decision.the court asserted that i t would be anomalous to reduce an initial eaja award by some and then award nearly that amount to the losing party simply for putting up a fight.id.
wagner thereafter filed a motion seeking panel review of the decision denying him supplemental fees,but the veterans court denied this motion on april.wagner then appealed to this court.
discussion 
we have jurisdiction over appeals from the veterans court under.interpretation of the eaja is a question of law,subject to de novo review kelly nicholson.
the primary purpose of the eaja is to ensure that litigants will not be deterred from seeking review of,or defending against,unjustified governmental action because of the expense involved.scarborough principi,d citations and internal quotation marks omitted.the statute plays a particularly important role in the veterans adjudicatory system 
removing deterrents to seeking judicial review is imperative in the veterans benefits context,which is intended to be uniquely,and in which veterans generally are not represented by counsel before the regional office and the board.the eaja is a vital complement to this system designed to aid veterans,because it helps to ensure that they will seek an appeal when the va has failed in its duty to aid them or has otherwise erroneously denied them the benefits that they have earned.

a n award of fees incurred in every stage of litigation is consistent with the legislative purpose of the eaja fritz principi.thus,a prevailing party in a veterans case is entitled to an award of fees not only for hours devoted to the underlying merits litigation,but also for attorney time reasonably expended defending an initial eaja application.comm r,immigration naturalization serv.jean,d jean fritz,at.fees awarded for the defense of an initial fee application are commonly referred to as supplemental fees or fees on fees.
wagner contends that the veterans court misinterpreted d a when it denied,in full,his petition seeking supplemental fees.he notes that he was partially successful in defending against the secretary challenge to his initial eaja application,and argues that he should be awarded supplemental fees commensurate with the degree of success he achieved.
we agree.in jean,the supreme court expressly rejected the argument that a claimant could be awarded supplemental fees only if the government challenge to an initial eaja application was not substantially justified.at.the court explained that a ny given civil action can have numerous phases,but that the eaja like other statutes favors treating a case as an inclusive whole,rather than as atomized.id.at.recognizing that requiring courts to make a separate finding of substantial justification regarding the government opposition to fee requests would multiply litigation,id.at,the court concluded that only one threshold determination that the government position in the underlying merits litigation was not substantially justified is required,id.at.accordingly,a party who prevails in fee litigation under the eaja may recover fees for legal services rendered during the fee litigation even if some of the government positions regarding the proper fee were substantially justified,the district court need not make a second finding of no substantial justification before awarding fees for the fee contest itself.scarborough,at citing jean,at.
when calculating a supplemental fee award,a court is required to consider the relationship between the amount of the fee awarded and the results obtained through the initial eaja application jean,at.thus,supplemental fees should be denied to the extent that a claimant defense of his original fee application proves unsuccessful.id.conversely,however,supplemental fees should be granted to the extent that a claimant successfully defends his original fee application.see fritz,at emphasizing that a veteran is entitled to attorney fees incurred throughout the litigation,including those incurred in preparation and defense of the fee application to the extent those fees are defensible footnote omitted.to deny a litigant all supplemental fees simply because the defense of his original fee application was not wholly successful unjustifiably dilutes the value of the original eaja fee award and is contrary to the fundamental objectives of the eaja.see orange blossom.cal.sunbelt developers,cir explaining that it would be inconsistent with the purpose of statutes to dilute a fees award by refusing to compensate attorneys for the time they reasonably spent in establishing their rightful claim to the fee citations and internal quotation marks omitted prandini tea,cir if
