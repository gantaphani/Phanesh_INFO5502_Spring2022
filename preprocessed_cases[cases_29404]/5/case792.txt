enforcing the original fee award 
though the eleventh amendment bars an award of damages against a state in a action,a federal court may award attorneys fees and other costs against the state under as part of the prospective injunctive relief authorized in the landmark decision ex parte young.see hutto finney.a nebraska statute first enacted in expressly provides that a federal court award of fees and expenses against the state shall be paid in the manner provided in the state miscellaneous claims act.the miscellaneous claims act mca provides that a claim must be submitted to the state claims board and,if approved by the board,a claim for more than shall be reviewed by the legislature at its next session and an appropriation made therefor if appropriate.
time sheets submitted in support of request for a supplemental fee award reveal that his attorneys began researching a legal basis to challenge state statutory restrictions upon enforcing a federal court judgment in february.on may,some two months later,the district court awarded in attorneys fees and costs as the prevailing party.in late october,he filed a motion for relief under rules a and of the federal rules of civil procedure.in support,counsel submitted an affidavit averring that,on october,he called assistant attorney general linda willard and advised that would file a motion to enforce the attorneys fee judgment and seek additional compensation for failure to pay because counsel had not received any response to our prior requests for payment.after the state claims board advised willard it had not received a claim requesting payment,she promptly advised counsel that,under nebraska law,the judgment could not be paid without approval of a claim by the claims board and the legislature,and that the department of correctional services legal staff would promptly endorse a request for payment.the affidavit further averred that counsel law firm operates under a line of credit that exceeds the amount of the may judgment and accrues interest at the rate of five percent per year.
