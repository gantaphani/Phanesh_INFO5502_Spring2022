in separate orders,the trial court charged a trust with some million in past and ongoing attorney fees incurred on behalf of a former trustee in defending against the beneficiary allegations of and conflict of interest.eight attorneys from three major law firms comprised the former trustee legal team,with four to five of those attorneys simultaneously appearing at the court trial.
we reverse the fee awards.while trustees are properly reimbursed for reasonable attorney fees to defend adverse claims against the trust,we can not determine from the trial court order whether the fee awards are consistent with applicable legal principles.principles of trust law impose a reasonableness requirement the fee award must be reasonable in amount and reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation,but it also must be reasonable and appropriate for the benefit of the trust.we remand for the trial court to review the evidence and to assess a fee reimbursement in accordance with these dual criteria.
factual and procedural background 
appellant michelle donahue michelle became involved in litigation with her,respondent patrick donahue patrick,over his administration of an irrevocable inter vivos trust established by her late husband,daniel donahue decedent the trust assets were highly concentrated in a private reit real estate investment trust that owned and operated numerous shopping centers in the western united states.patrick filled the roles of director,officer,and shareholder of the reit.michelle is a life income beneficiary of the trust her three daughters are the remainder beneficiaries.
the decedent named patrick as his successor trustee of the trust.patrick served as trustee for nearly two years beginning in until his resignation in october.he was succeeded by his brother,terence donahue terence,along with cotrustee northern trust bank of california 
a.the first appeal 
in april,patrick initiated the instant litigation under probate code section to secure court confirmation and approval of a final accounting and compensation for his service as a trustee.
michelle objected.she claimed patrick imprudently sold approximately percent of the trust interest in the reit below value to the reit,thereby losing about million in potential appreciation.
the court trial took place in the fall of.patrick,as the former trustee,was represented by four attorneys and a paralegal from two major law firms,loeb loeb and jones day.in addition,the current trustees retained two attorneys to represent the trust.the minor beneficiaries were represented by minors counsel.
the court approved the accounting and overruled michelle objections.michelle appealed from the trial court final ruling on patrick accounting and her objections.in donahue donahue,nonpub.opn,we affirmed the judgment on the accounting,concluding substantial evidence supported the trial court determination that the trust received fair value for the options and shares.
b.the second appeal 
in november,patrick petitioned for more than million in attorney and trustee fees he incurred to defend himself against unmeritorious allegations that virtually every act undertaken by him as trustee was a breach of trust.patrick sought reimbursement from the trust for incurring through trial million in attorney fees and for personal compensation.patrick fee request included the sum of simply to prepare the fee petitions.another was spent to prepare an case chronology and for case administration.one attorney at jones day billed hours,for a total of million during his involvement.
among patrick cost requests were in charges billed by decisionquest,a trial consulting firm retained to provide visual planning and development and multimedia design,programming production during the court trial.patrick claimed he incurred these expenses in the ordinary course of business of administering the trust as successor trustee and in the proceedings relating to my activities as successor trustee.
patrick initially supported his fee claim with a declaration from adam streisand,a partner at loeb loeb,who purported to authenticate spreadsheets to break down the attorney fees patrick incurred through his legal team from three separate law firms.
in opposing the motion,michelle requested limited discovery on the amount and necessity of the fees,including the retention of an expert.michelle explained the basis of her request given the large sum at issue,the number of attorneys involved,and billing rates up to,it is appropriate to allow beneficiary an opportunity to retain an expert witness in this field and allow that expert sufficient time to review bills,records and supporting documentation for purposes of formulating his opinion and advising the court.alternatively,michelle sought to appoint a referee pursuant to code of civil procedure section to review the time entrees and make a recommendation to the court.
in his reply,patrick explained that he was predominantly represented by a legal team at jones day from to early,but he also decided to retain loeb loeb in may based on its specialty in trusts and estates litigation to take the lead in the trial.about percent of patrick requested attorney fees were billed by eight key individuals.patrick justified the million singlehandedly billed by a jones day associate as not surprising given michelle outrageous and limitless discovery according to patrick,it was far more in this highly complex case to build upon the experience and insight of the lawyers involved in the case up until the point that loeb loeb assumed a lead role.patrick opposed michelle request to consult an expert because each side experts would contradict the other,explaining,for every expert michelle could call upon who might testify that the fees are unreasonable,patrick could do the same to testify that the fees are reasonable.
at the january hearing on the fee petition,the trial court denied michelle request for discovery,but ordered patrick to provide admissible evidence to support his claim because streisand does not have personal knowledge of the work done by other firms and can not supply the foundation for the business record exception to the hearsay rule for firms other than his own.
patrick thereupon filed supplemental declarations to support the fee request from each of the three law firms that continued to represent him throughout the litigation.michelle objected to the excessive duplication of work performed simultaneously between three large law firms underscoring capitalization omitted.she pointed out that patrick million fee claim came after the trust paid another million in attorney fees to represent the current trustees in contrast,michelle argued,she was primarily represented by two attorneys,who billed at the rate of per hour.michelle renewed her request for limited discovery,and suggested the appointment of a discovery referee to place appropriate limits on any attorney depositions.
a second hearing on the fee request was held on april.michelle counsel argued that the cost item by the decisionquest technicians itself approaches what some people could try the case for the three weeks that they were here.
the court issued a minute order on april,directing the current trustees to reimburse the fees and costs prayed for in the petition with the following exceptions.the court specifically excluded fee charges for named timekeepers,none of whom were attorneys or paralegals,and for indecipherable items on loeb loeb november invoices because they are so severely redacted the court can not assess the appropriateness of the charges listed.the court deducted about in costs from the cost bill,but otherwise left the cost items untouched.
on july,michelle filed a timely notice of appeal from the order for attorney fees and costs.
c.the third appeal 
while michelle first two appeals were pending,patrick applied to the court for an additional in past attorney fees and trustee fees from the close of trial in october through may,and for an order requiring the current cotrustees to pay his future appellate fees.
patrick new request included the fees and costs from the loeb loeb invoice that had been redacted,as well as in fees to draft and litigate the statement of decision.about of the new fee request was for researching and drafting the first fee petition,analyzing the billing records of the law firms,reviewing michelle opposition,preparing the replies and attending the hearings.another was for the attorneys collective time to prepare their billing records and declarations in support of the second fee petition.
patrick argued that the trust should pay his ongoing defense fees and costs because it would be unjust to force him to continue to sell assets and borrow funds to the financial detriment of his family and him,to fend off michelle relentless attacks.
michelle opposed the second fee petition and requested the court defer any additional fee award until the issues on appeal were adjudicated.michelle specifically objected to the duplication of work between the two law firms and multitude of attorneys,paralegals and staff that continue to represent patrick.
on november,the trial court,without explanation,ordered the current cotrustees to reimburse patrick over in attorney fees and an additional in trustee fees.the court also granted patrick request for future attorney fees the trustees are further ordered to pay,on a monthly basis,patrick donahue future reasonable attorney fees,costs,and trustee fees incurred in connection with this action,subject to final approval by the court at the conclusion of the litigation and reimbursement by patrick donahue of any disallowed amounts.
both sides objected to the trial court failure to specify how it arrived at the amount of the fees and costs and requested the court to provide reasons for its determination.in his postorder motion for reconsideration,patrick stated that he does not know how or for what reason the court arrived at the precise reimbursement amount of.if the court declines to reconsider its ruling,in the alternative,patrick respectfully asks the court to clarify its award of attorney fees and costs to patrick by specifying which fees costs have been denied so that the court decision may be understood by the parties.the court declined to reconsider or further clarify its fee order,and michelle timely filed a notice of appeal.
consolidation orders 
after all three appeals were fully briefed,we severed the second appeal from the first appeal and consolidated it instead with the third appeal to resolve all issues concerning attorney fees in a single opinion.

even after his resignation as a trustee,patrick retained the fiduciary responsibility to complete and defend his accounting until settled by the court.kasperbauer fairfield th,kasperbauer.
because he acted on the trust behalf in retaining attorneys to pursue this litigation,patrick claims the trust is obligated to pay the reasonable attorney fees.attorneys hired by a trustee to aid in administering the trust are entitled to reasonable fees paid from trust assets.preparing the accounting and responding to the beneficiaries objections to that accounting are aspects of trust administration.kasperbauer,supra,th at estate of beach cal d,beach trustee entitled to reimbursement from trust for reasonable legal expenses incurred in defending trust in capacity as trustee hollaway edwards th,hollaway successful defense of allegations against trustee benefited trust by eliminating questions regarding whether the trustee had properly administered trust estate of cassity d,former trustee entitled to reimbursement of legal expenses where he successfully defended himself from surcharge for conduct determined to have been proper see also trustee has power to retain attorneys to advise or assist the trustee.
as patrick points out,michelle does not disagree with these propositions in the abstract.michelle does not dispute that attorney fees and litigation costs incurred in the trustee successful defense of an action brought by the beneficiary are recoverable.
michelle vigorously challenges,however,the manner in which patrick exercised his fiduciary responsibilities in retaining multiple sets of attorneys from three major law firms to pursue this litigation.michelle also contests the reasonableness of their billings,particularly where the current trustees also had retained two additional attorneys to represent the trust in the litigation under a common defense agreement.

probate courts have a special responsibility to ensure that fee awards are reasonable,given their supervisory responsibilities over trusts.presented with a section petition to settle an account,the probate court has a duty imposed by law to inquire into the prudence of the trustee administration.schwartz,supra,th at,original italics.a ttorney fees deriving from probate court litigation are subject to concerns sufficiently unique,we believe,to distinguish them from fees generated in ordinary civil litigation.hollaway,supra,th at.thus,t he underlying principle which guides the court in allowing costs and attorneys fees incidental to litigation out of a trust estate is that such litigation is a benefit and service to the trust.lefkowitz,supra,th at.because probate courts have wide powers and responsibilities to preserve trusts under their supervision,they should make clear the basis for fee awards and thereby facilitate meaningful appellate review.all too often this responsibility to supervise trusts is abdicated by granting whatever fees are sought in the petition.estate of nazro d,trustee sought excessive compensation for attorney services.

the trial court april order granting attorney fees to patrick is notable for what it does not say.not only is there no explanation for why the trial court concluded patrick reasonably incurred attorney fees,but the court did not expressly specify the amount of the fee award.instead,the court merely stated that it would allow the amount prayed for in the petition with several specified exceptions.
in the particular circumstances here,the trial court generic order undermines the process of appellate review.comparing the court pithy explanation to the size and complexity of the fee request,with the full billing records consuming more than pages of the record on appeal,we can not tell whether the court exercised its discretion to carefully review the attorney documentation and determine their reasonableness and necessity,particularly in relationship to the trust interest and purposes.
the november fee order is equally cryptic.while the trial court did specify the amount of the fee award,even patrick complained about the court failure to explain why and how it reached its conclusion.it is the essence of arbitrariness to make an award of attorney fees that can not be justified by the plaintiffs request,the supporting bills,or the defendant opposition.gorman,supra,th at reversing fee award in contractual case where,after much puzzlement and frustration,appellate court unable to determine any mathematical or logical explanation for trial court reasoning in issuing fee award.
besides thwarting meaningful appellate review,the lack of detail and explanation in the orders raise the concern the trial court utilized an overly deferential approach to the fee request.a trial court may not rubber stamp a request for attorney fees,but must determine the number of hours reasonably expended.california courts have consistently held that a computation of time spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a determination of an appropriate attorneys fee award.plcm group,drexler cal th.the evidence should allow the court to consider whether the case was overstaffed,how much time the attorneys spent on particular claims,and whether the hours were reasonably expended.christian research institute alnor th,christian research see also levy toyota motor sales,th,party seeking attorney fees has the burden of showing that the fees incurred were allowable,were reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation,and were reasonable in amount.

in thayer wells fargo bank th,the court of appeal reversed a fee award of in a class action lawsuit because of the unjustified duplication of work that took place where numerous attorneys passively appeared on behalf of a single client.while there was no issue regarding the lawyers honesty in recording their time,duplication was,indeed,the hallmark of the coordinated proceeding with multiple hours spent in correspondence and phone calls between the different law firms representing the parties claiming fees.id.at.under these circumstances,the unquestioning award of generous fees may encourage duplicative and superfluous litigation and other conduct deserving no such favor.id.at.
there are no declarations in the record to explain patrick decision to retain two major law firms loeb loeb and jones day to concurrently represent him each with supervising partners and associates in this court trial.however,just as there can be too many cooks in a kitchen,there can be too many lawyers on a case.guckenberger boston d.even after loeb loeb became lead attorneys for patrick,scott bertzyk at greenberg traurig billed some,while jones day billed more than million.
understandably,these law firms brought with them their own supervising,support and administrative infrastructure,but simultaneous representation by multiple law firms posed substantial risks of task padding,attorney stacking multiple attendance by attorneys at the same court functions,and excessive research.see christian research,supra,th at indeed,the five attorneys defendant deployed on the motion appear to have expended undue time telephoning,conferencing,and each other supporting the trial court conclusion the matter was overstaffed.
by contrast to patrick large litigation team,two attorneys represented michelle.a comparative analysis of each side respective litigation costs may be a useful check on the reasonableness of any fee request.the court can look to how many lawyers the other side utilized in similar situations as an indication of the effort required.ramos lamm cir.
although we can not tell whether the trial court distinguished between fees expended to protect patrick personal interests from those of the trust,it is plausible the court may have decided that michelle,rather than patrick,should reap the consequences of the aggressive litigation tactics she had sown.but california has declined to adopt a prevailing party outcome for the award of attorney fees in surcharge actions between trustees and beneficiaries.a contrary rule would unduly deter contestants such as these from questioning the stewardship of executors and administrators through proceedings brought in good faith.beach,supra,cal d at trial court exceeded its authority in ordering that trustee attorney fees be charged against unsuccessful contestants trust shares rather than against all property otherwise distributable to the trust.
at oral argument,patrick offered a bet the farm rationale for his litigation decision to simultaneously retain a legal team of seven to eight lawyers with primary activity and involvement from three major law firms.as counsel explained,this was a bet the farm case where the beneficiaries were seeking to million from our entire stake could be wiped out if he lost the case.counsel further explained that patrick incurred the attorney fees without any assurance he would receive reimbursement from the trust.every single dollar that patrick incurred was at risk and he knew it was at risk.
but that is precisely the point.it was patrick farm that was at stake,not the trust.faced with the prospects of ruinous exposure,patrick may have decided to leave no field unfurrowed and to act without regard to cost in protecting his own personal interests.for example,at oral argument,counsel justified patrick decision to retain rather than replace his original attorneys at jones day and greenberg traurig to preserve institutional memory.counsel further explained that while some of patrick trial attorneys may have appeared to do nothing at trial,they actually served as reserves to witnesses that michell
