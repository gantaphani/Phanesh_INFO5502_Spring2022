we have examined the procedural posture of this case and the applicable law,and we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied boatwright motion for fees.plaintiffs obtained their litigation objective,recovery of damages,through settlements with defendants other than boatwright.we hold that under santisas goodin cal th,d,this recovery of damages,even though it was not from boatwright,will support the trial court determination that boatwright was not the prevailing party for purposes of recovering attorney fees it incurred in defending the noncontract causes of action plaintiffs alleged against it.therefore,the order denying boatwright such fees will be affirmed 
background of the case 
the events prompting this action 
this case has its beginnings in plaintiffs purchase of residential property in los angeles county the property.plaintiffs and boatwright entered into an agreement for boatwright to conduct an inspection of the main house and the guest house on the property,and to provide plaintiffs with a written report on the inspection.
named as defendants in this suit were boatwright,the sellers of the property,the sellers broker and his employer together sellers broker,and an exterminator hired by one or more of the other defendants to inspect the property.according to the operative complaint,defendants failed to live up to the duties of inspection,reporting,and disclosure they owed to plaintiffs.the consequence of this failure was that after plaintiffs purchased the property,they discovered that the main house and the guest house have extensive water and termite damage,which necessitates extensive repairs to the structures,and which makes the property worth far less than what plaintiffs paid for it.
the causes of action against boatwright and various of the other defendants were for negligence,breach of contract,fraud and deceit,constructive fraud,and breach of fiduciary duty.additionally,plaintiffs alleged boatwright engaged in a civil conspiracy with the other defendants to conceal from plaintiffs the extent of the pest and water damage to the houses and the extent of the needed repairs.
the subject contract 
the contract between plaintiffs and boatwright contains an attorney fees clause.the clause states the prevailing party in any dispute arising out of this agreement,the inspection,or report s shall be awarded all reasonable attorney fees,arbitration fees and other costs.
the contract also contains a special statute of limitations provision that states no legal action or proceeding of any kind,including those sounding in tort or contract,can be commenced against boatwright or its officers,agents or employees more than one year after the date of the subject inspection.this time period is shorter than otherwise provided by law.boatwright inspection of the property was made on may.this suit was filed on june.
the dismissal of boatwright from the suit 
based on the timing of boatwright inspection of the property and the commencement of this suit,and on the contractual provision for a shortened statute of limitations,boatwright filed a motion for summary judgment,contending the suit is against boatwright and therefore boatwright was entitled to a judgment in its favor.however,prior to the date on which the motion was set to be heard,plaintiffs filed a request for dismissal of boatwright from the lawsuit.a dismissal was entered by the clerk and thereafter,the court signed and filed a judgment of dismissal that awards boatwright its costs of suit.
boatwright prevailing party claim 
boatwright filed a memorandum of costs which included in attorney fees and a motion for attorney fees as costs.citing civil code section and code of civil procedure section,boatwright contended it was entitled to attorney fees because plaintiffs dismissed their suit against it.
plaintiffs filed a motion to strike or tax costs and to be declared the prevailing parties in the suit.the declaration of plaintiffs attorney that was filed in support of their motion states that plaintiffs settled with the sellers of the property for,the termite inspection company for,and certain plaintiffs realtor and broker for.additionally,settlement negotiations with sellers broker were pending.according to plaintiffs moving papers,their damages total approximately.plaintiffs asserted that it was because of these settlements and pending settlement that they dismissed boatwright from the suit since pursuing boatwright any further would have been a waste of resources.prior to the hearing on the parties respective motions,plaintiffs filed notice that they settled with sellers broker for.
the trial court denied boatwright motion for fees and ruled that plaintiffs motion was therefore moot.citing international industries,olen cal d,the court stated that equitable principles govern awards of attorney fees made pursuant to contract,and when plaintiffs case is viewed as a whole,plaintiffs are the prevailing parties because they have recovered,or are in the process of recovering,significant relief.on the other hand,said the court,if only plaintiffs case against boatwright is considered,boatwright is the prevailing party because it was dismissed from the suit.the court observed that if it awarded boatwright the fees it requested,it would virtually eliminate the relief procured by plaintiffs from any other parties.this result is inequitable.the court also believes that public policy considerations favoring voluntary dismissal of before trial sic to avoid maintaining pointless litigation takes priority over the recovery of attorney fees.
issues on appeal 
plaintiffs and boatwright raise the following appellate issues.what is the appropriate standard of review for this court to apply did the trial court improperly deny boatwright claim for prevailing party status and attorney fees if such claim was improperly denied,what amount of fees is boatwright entitled to recover 
because we find no cause to reverse the order denying boatwright attorney fees,the latter issue need not be addressed.
discussion 
standards of review 
the correct application,to this case,of statutory and case authority respecting awards of attorney fees presents a question of law,which we address de novo.akins enterprise th,d.additionally,as we discuss below,the trial court determination that boatwright should not be declared a prevailing party was an exercise of the court discretion.discretionary decisions are subject to an abuse of discretion standard of review,and will not be reversed on appeal unless it appears that the court abused its discretion and a miscarriage of justice has resulted.denham superior court cal d.discretion is abused whenever,in its exercise,the court exceeds the bounds of reason,all of the circumstances before it being considered.the burden is on the party complaining to establish an abuse of discretion,and unless a clear case of abuse is shown and unless there has been a miscarriage of justice a reviewing court will not substitute its opinion and thereby divest the trial court of its discretionary power.ibid.
boatwright claim for prevailing party status and attorney fees
