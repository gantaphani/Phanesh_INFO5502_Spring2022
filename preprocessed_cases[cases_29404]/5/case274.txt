background 
brennan,a general contractor,entered an agreement in april with the state of connecticut the state to rehabilitate a bridge over the west river in new haven.the project called for the installation of an cathodic protection system,which brennan subcontracted to adco,adco.adco in turn subcontracted with elgard to manufacture the necessary equipment.the subcontract became effective on or about april.for,elgard was to produce and deliver the protection system to adco,which would install it.the contract further provided that a ny balance remaining due after thirty days of delivery shall accrue interest at the rate of one and percent per month.as of september,elgard delivered to adco all materials called for under the contract,and has been seeking collection ever since.
as a,elgard was required to submit invoices to adco,which would submit them to brennan,which would seek payment from the state.upon receipt of state funds,brennan was to send payment back down the chain,through adco to elgard.the cause of the various controversies is that adco used fraud to induce payment by the state to brennan,and by brennan to adco for elgard account,and then misappropriated elgard money en route.
on june,adco submitted to brennan a requisition for payment in the amount of by regulation,connecticut will reimburse a contractor for unincorporated materials if such materials have been paid for by the contractor as shown by receipted bills,or in lieu of such receipted bill or bills,a duly executed certification of title executed by the contractor and the vendor in the form approved by the department of transportation.of,standard specifications for roads,bridges and incidental construction b.thus,adco was entitled to payment if it had paid elgard for the materials,or if it provided brennan with a certification of title to a cathodic protection system.adco furnished a certification of title,but the certificate was deficient in two critical and undisputed respects i partial delivery had been made to adco west haven storage facility as of the date it sought payment,but the balance of the system was not scheduled to arrive until early september and ii without elgard knowledge or consent,adco president,robert adams,forged elgard signature on the certification of title.the forgery that adams submitted to brennan was accompanied by two elgard invoices,seemingly in an effort to suggest that the equipment had been delivered.adco had asked elgard in late may to invoice for the cathodic protection system,notwithstanding that no equipment had yet been delivered.elgard sent adco two invoices dated may and june,but each invoice reflected that no materials had been shipped as of those dates.
in reliance on adco forgery,brennan signed the title certification and requested payment from the state.before paying brennan,the state sent an inspector to adco west haven storage facility to verify the presence of the cathodic protection system.by that time,all but two rectifiers a value had arrived,and expecting the planted among the west river bridge materials a single rectifier meant for another job.the ruse succeeded the inspector noted that some equipment appeared to be missing,but allowed himself to be persuaded that the project specifications called for a single rectifier and thus satisfied was sent on his way.
on august,the state issued a check to the order of brennan in the amount of.two weeks later,adams came to brennan offices looking for payment.he received a check in the amount of payable to adco,elgard corporation.adams knew the funds were meant for elgard,and indicated to brennan that he would send the check to the company.instead he deposited the funds in an adco account.brennan was unaware that adco had filed for bankruptcy eleven days before this misappropriation.
in the meantime,elgard completed manufacture of the cathodic protection equipment,all of which was delivered to adco as of september.elgard awaited payment.the underlying litigation started when elgard ran out of patience.
the procedural posture of this litigation is complicated by adco bankruptcy and by connecticut law,which affords subcontractors like elgard specific remedies for nonpayment.
brennan undertook the west river bridge rehabilitation pursuant to a bonded construction contract that was subject to.as a condition precedent to signing the contract,elgard and its surety,american,executed a million payment bond in favor of the state.under,a subcontractor can enforce its right to payment under such a bond by serving a notice of claim on the surety within one hundred eighty days after the date bonded materials were supplied.a.elgard delivered the last of the cathodic protection equipment to adco on september,and duly served a notice of claim on american days later,on january.
when american investigated the claim,it learned that brennan had received the elgard invoices and the forged certification of title for the cathodic protection system on june,and had paid adco for the equipment two months later.because elgard submitted its claim on january,more than days after the date on which american erroneously believed the equipment had been delivered,june,it was denied as untimely.
section provides that when a surety denies liability on a bonded claim,the claimant can file suit in connecticut superior court within one year of the date that materials were last supplied.a,b.elgard commenced the underlying action in the district of connecticut on september,demand ing a judgment against brennan and american in the sum of,plus interest,costs,and attorneys fees.five days later,elgard filed a settlement offer in the amount of,pursuant to connecticut offer of judgment statute.see.brennan and american moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim.
during the pendency of that motion,brennan moved in the adco bankruptcy proceedings for an allowance of an administrative expense claim in the amount of on the grounds that i adco estate ha d been benefitted by virtue of brennan payment of which should have rightfully been turned over to elgard for the delivery of goods,and ii that any payment of the administrative expense claim to brennan would be turned over to elgard in satisfaction of any of its valid claims against brennan related to the payment of the cathodic protection system materials.the united states bankruptcy court for the district of connecticut granted the motion on march.at approximately that time,brennan recovered,and entered an agreement with adco that was still owing from adco bankruptcy estate.contrary to its representations to the bankruptcy court,brennan did not pay elgard the,but continued to contest the action in the district of connecticut,where it asserted various affirmative defenses,including the statute of limitations and estoppel.
on february,three years after brennan recovered on the administrative expense claim ostensibly to pay elgard for the cathodic protection system,brennan sent the subcontractor a check in the amount of,with a cover letter reciting that the funds were to be used as a principal only payment,and not for interest or attorney fees or for any other purpose.elgard cashed the check,and the litigation continued.magistrate judge donna martinez conducted a bench trial from may to.in a decision entered september,the district court found brennan and american li
