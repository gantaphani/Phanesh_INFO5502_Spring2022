we accepted this interlocutory appeal to consider a claim that directors failed to act in good faith in conducting the sale of their company.the court of chancery decided that unexplained inaction permits a reasonable inference that the directors may have consciously disregarded their fiduciary duties.the trial court expressed concern about the speed with which the transaction was consummated the directors failure to negotiate better terms and their failure to seek potentially superior deals.but the record establishes that the directors were disinterested and independent that they were generally aware of the company value and its prospects and that they considered the offer,under the time constraints imposed by the buyer,with the assistance of financial and legal advisors.at most,this record creates a triable issue of fact on the question of whether the directors exercised due care.there is no evidence,however,from which to infer that the directors knowingly ignored their responsibilities,thereby breaching their duty of loyalty.accordingly,the directors are entitled to the entry of summary judgment.
factual and procedural background 
before the merger at issue,lyondell chemical company lyondell was the third largest independent,publicly traded chemical company in north america.dan smith smith was lyondell chairman and ceo.lyondell other ten directors were independent and many were,or had been,ceos of other large,publicly traded companies.basell af basell is a privately held luxembourg company owned by leonard blavatnik blavatnik through his ownership of access industries.basell is in the business of polyolefin technology,production and marketing.
in april,blavatnik told smith that basell was interested in acquiring lyondell.a few months later,basell sent a letter to lyondell board offering per share.lyondell determined that the price was inadequate and that it was not interested in selling.during the next year,lyondell prospered and no potential acquirors expressed interest in the company.in may,an access affiliate filed a schedule with the securities and exchange commission disclosing its right to acquire an block of lyondell stock owned by occidental petroleum corporation.the schedule also disclosed blavatnik interest in possible transactions with lyondell.
in response to the schedule,the lyondell board immediately convened a special meeting.the board recognized that the signaled to the market that the company was in play,but the directors decided to take a wait and see approach.a few days later,apollo management,contacted smith to suggest a lbo,but smith rejected that proposal.in late june,basell announced that it had entered into a billion merger agreement with huntsman corporation huntsman,a specialty chemical company.basell apparently reconsidered,however,after hexion specialty chemicals,made a topping bid for huntsman.faced with competition for huntsman,blavatnik returned his attention to lyondell.
on july,blavatnik met with smith to discuss an deal at per share.smith responded that was too low,and blavatnik raised his offer to per share.smith told blavatnik that he would present the proposal to the board,but that he thought the board would reject it.smith advised blavatnik to give lyondell his best offer,since lyondell really was not on the market.the meeting ended at that point,but blavatnik asked smith to call him later in the day.when smith called,blavatnik offered to pay per share.under blavatnik proposal,basell would require no financing contingency,but lyondell would have to agree to a million fee and sign a merger agreement by july.
smith called a special meeting of the lyondell board on july,to review and consider basell offer.the meeting lasted slightly less than one hour,during which time the board reviewed valuation material that had been prepared by lyondell management for presentation at the regular board meeting,which was scheduled for the following day.the board also discussed the basell offer,the status of the huntsman merger,and the likelihood that another party might be interested in lyondell.the board instructed smith to obtain a written offer from basell and more details about basell financing.
blavatnik agreed to the board request,but also made an additional demand.basell had until july to make a higher bid for huntsman,so blavatnik asked smith to find out whether the lyondell board would provide a firm indication of interest in his proposal by the end of that day.the lyondell board met on july,again for less than one hour,to consider the basell proposal and how it compared to the benefits of remaining independent.the board decided that it was interested,authorized the retention of deutsche bank securities,deutsche bank as its financial advisor,and instructed smith to negotiate with blavatnik.
basell then announced that it would not raise its offer for huntsman,and huntsman terminated the basell merger agreement.from july the parties negotiated the terms of a lyondell merger agreement basell conducted due diligence deutsche bank prepared a fairness opinion and lyondell conducted its regularly scheduled board meeting.the lyondell board discussed the basell proposal again on july,and later instructed smith to try to negotiate better terms.specifically,the board wanted a higher price,a provision,and a reduced fee.as the trial court noted,blavatnik was incredulous.he had offered his best price,which was a substantial premium,and the deal had to be concluded on his schedule.as a sign of good faith,however,blavatnik agreed to reduce the fee from million to million.
on july,the board met to consider the basell merger agreement.lyondell management,as well as its financial and legal advisers,presented reports analyzing the merits of the deal.the advisors explained that,notwithstanding the provision in the merger agreement,lyondell would be able to consider any superior proposals that might be made because of the fiduciary out provision.in addition,deutsche bank reviewed valuation models derived from bullish and more conservative financial projections.several of those valuations yielded a range that did not even reach per share,and deutsche bank opined that the proposed merger price was fair.indeed,the bank managing director described the merger price as an absolute home run.deutsche bank also identified other possible acquirors and explained why it believed no other entity would top basell offer.after considering the presentations,the lyondell board voted to approve the merger and recommend it to the stockholders.at a special stockholders meeting held on november,the merger was approved by more than of the voted shares.
the first stockholders to litigate this merger filed suit in texas on july.walter ryan,the plaintiff in this action,participated in the texas litigation and filed suit in delaware on august.the texas court denied an application for a preliminary injunction on november,while the defendants in delaware were briefing their motion for summary judgment.the court of chancery issued its opinion on july,denying summary judgment as to the revlon and the deal protection claims.this court accepted the lyondell directors application for certification of an interlocutory appeal on september.
discussion 
the class action complaint challenging this billion cash merger alleges that the lyondell directors breached their fiduciary duties of care,loyalty and candor and put their personal interests ahead of the interests of the lyondell shareholders.specifically,the complaint alleges that the merger price was grossly insufficient the directors were motivated to approve the merger for their own the process by which the merger was negotiated was flawed the directors agreed to unreasonable deal protection provisions and the preliminary proxy statement omitted numerous material facts.the trial court rejected all claims except those directed at the process by which the directors sold the company and the deal protection provisions in the merger agreement.
the remaining claims are but two aspects of a single claim,under revlon macandrews forbes holdings,that the directors failed to obtain the best available price in selling the
