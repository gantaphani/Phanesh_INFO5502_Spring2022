ruben carnero carnero appeals from judgments of the united states district court for the district of massachusetts dismissing his federal and state law complaints against boston scientific corporation bsc.both complaints alleged that bsc had terminated him in retaliation for whistleblowing for telling bsc that latin american subsidiaries had created false invoices and had inflated sales figures.the district court determined that carnero,an argentinian citizen resident in brazil who worked for the two bsc subsidiaries and whose whistleblowing pertained to their alleged improprieties in latin america,could not sue bsc under the whistleblower protection provision contained in title viii,section,of the act of.in the district court view,that provision is without extraterritorial effect.the court also held that carnero could not pursue state law claims against bsc as he had no contact with the defendant in massachusetts and as defendant did not in any way direct or control his employment.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm.
background 
as said,carnero is a citizen of argentina and currently resides in brazil.the defendant,bsc,is a delaware corporation with headquarters in natick,massachusetts.bsc manufactures medical equipment and has operations in many countries throughout the world.
in,carnero,while residing in argentina,accepted employment with a bsc subsidiary in argentina,boston scientific argentina bsa,an argentinian company.his employment agreement,entered into in argentina although negotiated in various countries including the united states,provided that his place of work was bsa headquarters which is in buenos aires,that he would be paid in pesos,and that the employment agreement was governed by the laws of argentina.carnero initially worked for bsa as country manager for argentina and then served as the latin america business development director.in,he took an assignment as country manager for a brazilian subsidiary of bsc,boston scientific do brasil ltda.bsb,while still employed by bsa.carnero asserts that he was terminated from bsb in august,and from bsa in april,in retaliation for reporting to supervisors at bsc that bsc argentinian and brazilian companies,as well as other foreign companies,were engaged in accounting misconduct by,inter alia,improperly inflating sales figures.
it is undisputed that carnero was directly employed and paid by bsc argentinian and brazilian subsidiaries rather than by bsc itself.it is also undisputed that the alleged fraudulent conduct reported by carnero was instituted in latin america.but carnero also asserts he had an employment relationship with the united states parent,bsc,resulting from the extensive and continuous control bsc own massachusetts employees allegedly exercised over his work and duties in latin america.he says that he maintained contact with bsc,traveling frequently to massachusetts to meet with supervisors there.carnero does not dispute,however,that his employment duties were mainly performed outside of the united states,nor that his immediate employers were the two foreign subsidiaries.
in april,carnero pursued a conciliation proceeding in argentina,a prerequisite to filing suit in an argentinian court for statutory termination benefits from bsc and bsa.argentinian employees terminated without cause are entitled to such benefits.an argentinian mediator held a hearing with bsc,bsa and carnero,but a settlement could not be reached.on june,bsc and bsa brought their own claims in the argentinian court,alleging,inter alia,defamation based on carnero claims of billing irregularities.on june,the argentinian court denied a preliminary injunction,finding that carnero claims of operating irregularities had not been shown to be false or publicized to third parties.the argentinian action appears to be ongoing.
on july,carnero filed a complaint against bsc with the united states department of labor dol pursuant to the whistleblower protection provision contained in title viii,section,of the act of.b a providing for filing of complaint with the united states secretary of labor on august,carnero filed a complaint against bsc in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts based on diversity of citizenship under a supp,asserting state law claims,including breach of contract and retaliatory termination.
on december,the dol issued a preliminary decision dismissing carnero whistleblower claim.the dol found that bsc was covered by the whistleblower provision because it is a publicly traded company on the new york stock exchange.the dol ruled,however,that the whistleblower protection provision of the act did not apply to employees of covered companies working outside of the united states.carnero boston scientific,osha reg l adm r,citing foley,filardo.noting that it is well settled that legislation of congress,unless a contrary intent appears,is meant to apply only within the territorial jurisdiction of the united states.carnero then filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts on january,seeking de novo judicial review of his whistleblower claim.see b b providing that claimant may bring federal court action if secretary of labor has not issued final decision within days of filing of complaint and there is no showing that delay is due to claimant bad faith both of carnero district court complaints sought his reinstatement,among other relief.
bsc moved to dismiss both complaints.on march,the district court dismissed carnero state law claims,finding that carnero had no contact with the defendant in massachusetts and that defendant did not in any way direct or control his employment.carnero boston scientific,endorsed order.the court subsequently denied both carnero motion for reconsideration pursuant to.e and his motion to consolidate the state law action with the federal law action pursuant to.a.id.may,endorsed order.on august,the court dismissed carnero claim brought under the whistleblower protection provision of the act,after examining the language and legislative history of the law.carnero boston scientific,wl,citing foley,at.the court agreed with the dol preliminary determination that n othing in section a remotely suggests that congress intended it to apply outside of the united states.id.at,wl.carnero appeals from these rulings.
ii.the federal claim 
we turn first to the dismissal of carnero complaint brought under the whistleblower protection statute,of the act.insofar as we know,no court has yet determined if this provision protects foreign citizens working outside of the united states for foreign subsidiaries of covered companies.the interpretation of a statute engenders our de novo review.bonano caribbean airline,cir.
as noted,carnero initially filed a complaint against bsc the parent company with the united states department of labor pursuant to b a.the dol,acting through its agency,osha,rejected this in a preliminary report,on the ground that the whistleblower protection statute did not protect employees of covered companies working outside of the united states.carnero boston scientific,osha reg adm r,supra.no final agency report having issued within days,carnero brought a similar complaint against bsc in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts,seeking,under the provisions of the statute,de novo judicial review of his whistleblower claim.see b b.in its dismissal of that action,the district court echoed osha prior view that the whistleblower protection provision of the act does not apply outside of the united states.see supra.
whether carnero from the question of otherwise within the terms of the whistleblower protection provision 
before proceeding to ask whether the instant whistleblower protection provision of the act was meant by congress to provide extraterritorial relief,it is sensible to ask whether carnero claim is of the kind that would,if arising domestically,fit within that provision language.if not,little need would exist to explore the extraterritorial issue.we conclude as an initial matter,without deciding finally,that carnero claim aside the issue of generally within the whistleblower protection provision of.
the whistleblower protection provision codified in is a relatively small part of the act which is composed of many separate statutes and statutory schemes aimed at achieving the act goals.the instant whistleblower protection statute creates an administrative complaint procedure and,ultimately a federal civil cause of action,designed to protect the employees of publicly traded companies who lawfully provide information or otherwise assist in an investigation regarding any conduct which the employee believes constitutes a violation of the federal mail,wire,bank,or securities fraud statutes,any rule or regulation of the securities and exchange commission sec,or other provision of the federal law relating to fraud against the shareholders.a 
an individual complaining under this section of the act must,therefore,ordinarily carnero alleges he employee of a publicly traded company subject to the act.id bsc is a publicly traded company listed on the new york stock exchange although its two foreign subsidiaries,bsa and bsb,for which carnero directly worked,are not.companies subject to the act are those with a class of securities registered under section of the securities exchange act of or required to file reports under section d of the securities exchange act of d.id.these registration and reporting provisions apply to and foreign companies listed on securities exchanges.see,pinker roche holdings,cir noting that foreign securities listed on securities exchanges must abide by the exchange act registration and reporting requirements see also listing more than one thousand foreign companies registered and reporting with the sec as of.
as noted,carnero was directly in the employ of bsc foreign subsidiaries,bsa and bsb,not themselves listed foreign companies.he claims,however,that supervision by headquarters personnel of the parent made him an employee of bsc also.moreover,apart from that,the fact that he was employed by bsc subsidiaries may be enough to make him a bsc employee for purposes of seeking relief under the whistleblower statute.the dol regulations pertaining to the whistleblower provision of the act define employee as someone presently or formerly working for a company or company representative emphasis supplied.the latter term is defined as including a contractor or agent of a company.see.if bsa and bsb were agents of bsc,as seems quite possible,their own employee would fit this definition of the parent employee.hence carnero,by virtue either of his own asserted contacts with bsc or his direct employment by its subsidiaries,or both,may well be an employee of bsc for purposes of.neither party,indeed,contests that carnero was a covered employee of bsc for purposes of seeking whistleblower relief under.see collins beazer homes usa,d,holding that employee of subsidiary is covered employee within meaning of where officers of publicly traded parent company have authority to affect employment of subsidiary employees morefield exelon,alj,holding that subsidiaries,for purposes,are more than mere agents like an outside auditor or consultant they are an integral part of the publicly traded company.we shall,therefore,assume for present purposes,but without deciding,that carnero was a covered employee of bsc.we shall also assume,for purposes of this appeal,again without deciding,that there is evidence that carnero employment was terminated in retaliation for conduct protected against by.
the whistleblower statute also makes clear that the misconduct it protects against is not only that of the publicly traded company itself,but also that of any officer,employee,contractor,subcontractor,or agent of such company,who retaliates or otherwise discriminates against the whistleblowing employee.see a.thus,the statute can be read to embrace an retaliation against a protected employee.as carnero may be an employee of bsc,supra,his alleged retaliatory discharge by its subsidiaries for reasons forbidden in the act could putting aside any question of extraterritorial application violate the terms of the whistleblower protection provision of the act.
we conclude,therefore,that if carnero whistleblowing had occurred in this country relative to similar alleged domestic misconduct by domestic subsidiaries,he might well have a potential claim under the whistleblower protection provision of the act.this being so,we proceed to the next question,whether the whistleblower provision of the act has extraterritorial effect,so that a foreign employee such as carnero who complains of misconduct abroad by overseas subsidiaries,may bring suit under the whistleblower provision of against the listed united states parent company.we think not.
b.the presumption against extraterritorial application 
carnero argues that the whistleblower protection statute,should be given extraterritorial effect,so as to allow him to pursue in federal court his whistleblower claim brought under its provisions.he says his claim not only fits within the literal language of the statute,supra,but that to limit the operation of the statute to purely domestic conduct in the united states would improperly insulate the foreign operations of covered companies.this,he says,would frustrate the basic purpose of the act of which the whistleblower protection statute at issue is a part,to protect both the investors in securities markets and the integrity of those markets.
while carnero argument has some force,it faces a high and we think insurmountable hurdle in the presumption against the extraterritorial application of congressional statutes.where,as here,a statute is silent as to its territorial reach,and no contrary congressional intent clearly appears,there is generally a presumption against its extraterritorial application.arabian am.oil,d aramco it is a longstanding principle of american law that legislation of congress,unless a contrary intent appears,is meant to apply only within the territorial jurisdiction of the united states.quoting foley,at.see also small united states,d recognizing that presumption is alive and well.in the present case,whatever help to investors its overseas application might in theory provide is offset not only by the absence of any indication that congress contemplated extraterritoriality but by a variety of indications that congress thought the statute was limited to the territorial jurisdiction of the united states.
the supreme court stated in aramco that a court is to assume that congress legislates with an awareness of the presumption against extraterritorial application.at.thus,the presumption can be overcome only if there is an affirmative intention of the congress clearly expressed,quoting benz compania naviera hidalgo,d see smith united states,d requiring clear evidence of congressional intent to apply statute extraterritorially.in searching for clear evidence of congress intent,courts consider all available evidence about the meaning of the statute,including its text,context,structure,and legislative history.sale haitian ctrs.council,d.
the presumption serves at least two purposes.it protects against unintended clashes between our laws and those of other nations which could result in international discord,and it reflects the notion that when congress legislates,it is primarily concerned with domestic conditions.aramco,at,quoting foley,at.the supreme court has invoked the presumption in several cases involving the scope of broad regulatory statutes.see,sale,at.holding that section h of immigration and nationality act of did not protect aliens seized by authorities on high seas,despite broad language in statute referring to any alien aramco,at.holding that the version of title vii of civil rights act of then in force did not regulate employment practices of firms employing citizens abroad,even though the statute contained broad provisions extending its prohibitions to,for example,any activity,business,or industry in commerce foley,at.holding that federal labor statute requiring an day provision in e very contract made to which the united states is a party did not apply to contracts for work performed in foreign countries.
to be sure,in appropriate circumstances congress extraterritorial intent has on occasion been implied without explicit statement in the text or even history.courts,as noted,will examine a statute context and structure as well as its purpose and all available evidence in order to determine congress actual intent.sale,at.carnero would,as noted,have us find implicit evidence of congress intent to apply the act extraterritorially in the act purpose to protect investors and markets against frauds.frauds against foreign subsidiaries uncovered by foreign whistleblowers may,undoubtedly,threaten investors in the parent just as do domestic frauds.
carnero refers us to cases such as united states bowman.presumption against extraterritoriality held not to limit a federal criminal statute,the terms of which were violated by citizens when they conspired abroad to defraud a domestic company partly owned by the united states government.similarly,carnero notes that the supreme court has held the sherman act to apply to conduct abroad that was meant to produce and did in fact produce some substantial effect in the united states.hartford fire ins.california,d.see also,schoenbaum firstbrook,cir civil antifraud provisions of the exchange act given extraterritorial application to protect american investors who purchase foreign securities on american exchanges and to protect the domestic securities market from the effects of improper foreign transactions in american securities.
but while the purpose to protect investors and build confidence in securities markets may be a factor supporting extraterritorial application of the instant whistleblower protection provision,the other pertinent factors run strongly counter to finding an extraterritorial legislative intent.these contrary indicia prevent our determining that congress has evidenced its clear intent for extraterritorial application.not only is the text of silent as to any intent to apply it abroad,the statute legislative history indicates that congress gave no consideration to either the possibility or the problems of overseas application.in sharp contrast with this silence,congress has provided expressly elsewhere in the act for extraterritorial enforcement of a different,criminal,whistleblower statute.by so providing,congress demonstrated that it was well able to call for extraterritorial application when it so desired.also in the act,congress has provided expressly for the exterritorial application of certain other unrelated statutes,tailoring these so as to cope with problems of sovereignty and the demonstrating congress ability to provide for foreign application when it wished.here,however,while placing the whistleblower provision enforcement in the hands of the dol,a domestic agency,congress has made no provision for possible problems arising when that agency seeks to regulate employment relationships in foreign nations,nor has congress provided the dol with special powers and resources to conduct investigations abroad.furthermore,judicial venue provisions written into the whistleblower protection statute were made expressly applicable only to whistleblower violations within the united states and to complainants residing here on the date of violation,with no corresponding basis being provided for venue as to foreign complainants claiming violations in foreign countries.
these factors,and more,not only fail to imply a clear congressional intent for extraterritorial application,but indicate that congress never expected such application.we discuss them below.
provisions and structure of the act 
the whistleblower protection statute in is one part of the corporate and criminal fraud accountability act of.it is incorporated as title viii,section,within the act of,stat.july.the act itself is a major piece of legislation bundling together a large number of diverse and independent statutes,all designed to improve the quality of and transparency in financial reporting and auditing of public companies.the act increases criminal penalties for securities fraud and other violations and provides for the promulgation of codes of ethics and various other means for holding public companies to higher reporting standards.
a major part of the act is devoted to creating a new body,the public company accounting oversight board,which,serving under the securities and exchange commission,will supervise and regulate the activities of public accounting firms.the latter,in turn,are made responsible for auditing public companies.unlike the present whistleblower protection provision contained in section,which makes no reference to foreign entities,section of the act deals expressly with foreign accounting firms,requiring them to register with the board if they audit public companies but carving out exceptions tailored to difficulties inherent in regulation of overseas professionals.see c providing that the sec or the board may,as it determines necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors,exempt a foreign public accounting firm from the act.the accounting provision reflects congress recognition that the application of domestic regulatory statutes to persons abroad presents problems in addition to those of purely domestic application,and of the need to address those problems specifically.
besides the whistleblower statute here at issue,found in section of the act,two other separate provisions in deal with whistleblower protection.section of the act requires the audit committees of issuers which include foreign issuers to implement internal procedures that facilitate and encourage anonymous whistleblowing by employees concerning questionable accounting or auditing matters.see m section does not,however,purport to confer enforceable rights upon employees,hence does not implicate the foreign sovereignty and other concerns,infra,raised by a provision like section providing for an adjudicatory process and remedies 
the other whistleblower provision found in the act,section,is significant here by way of contrast to the instant section.section amended supp by adding subsection e providing criminal sanctions for retaliation against anyone giving truthful information to law enforcement officers relating to the commission of any federal offense there is express provision for extraterritorial jurisdiction of including subsection e.see d there is extraterritorial federal jurisdiction over an offense under this section.that congress provided for extraterritorial reach as to section but did not do so as to section the provision relevant here conveys the implication that congress did not mean section to have extraterritorial effect.see russello united states,d w here congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.citation omitted see also aramco,at.congress awareness of the need to make a clear statement that a statute applies overseas is amply demonstrated by the numerous occasions on which it has expressly legislated the extraterritorial application of a statute.
legislative history 
the legislative history of the instant section,gives no indication that congress meant to apply its civil whistleblower protections extraterritorially.the relevant congressional debate focused upon concern over the lack of whistleblower protection for private corporate employees in many states of the union.the original version of the statute was introduced by senator leahy and three cosponsors senators daschle,durbin and harkin on march,see cong.rec,wl,and reported by the committee on the judiciary on may,see,wl.senator leahy explained that the purpose of the statute was to provide federal protection to private corporate whistleblowers,as was already done with government employees,in light of the patchwork and vagaries of current state whistleblower protection laws.see,at emphasis added.senator leahy addressed the need to provide federal protection where state laws failed to protect certain private corporate whistleblowers,like sherron watkins,an employee at enron corporation in texas.it is pertinent to quote senator leahy statements at length 
in a variety of instances when corporate employees at both enron and arthur andersen attempted to report or blow the whistle on fraud,they were discouraged at nearly every turn.for instance,a shocking from enron outside lawyers to an enron official was uncovered.this responds to a request for legal advice after a senior enron employee,sherron watkins,tried to report accounting irregularities at the highest levels of the company in late august.the outside lawyer counseled enron,in pertinent part,as follows you asked that i include in this communication a summary of the possible risks associated with discharging or constructively discharging employees who report allegations of improper accounting practices.texas law does not currently protect corporate whistleblowers.the texas supreme court has twice declined to create a cause of action for whistleblowers who are discharged 
according to media accounts,this was not an isolated example of whistleblowing associated with the enron case.these examples further expose a culture,supported by law,that discourage employees from reporting fraudulent behavior not only to the proper authorities,such as the fbi and the sec,but even internally.this corporate code of silence not only hampers investigations,but also creates a climate where ongoing wrongdoing can occur with virtual impunity.the consequences of this corporate code of silence for investors in publicly traded companies,in particular,and for the stock market,in general,are serious and adverse,and they must be remedied.
corporate employees who report fraud are subject to the patchwork and vagaries of current state laws,although most publicly traded companies do business nationwide.thus,a whistleblowing employee in one state may be far more vulnerable to retaliation than a fellow employee in another state who takes the same actions.unfortunately,as demonstrated in the tobacco industry litigation and the enron case,efforts to quiet whistleblowers and retaliate against them for being disloyal or litigation risks transcend state lines.this corporate culture must change,and the law can lead the way.that is why is supported by public interest advocates,such as the national whistleblower center,the government accountability project,and taxpayers against fraud,who have called this bill the single most effective measure possible to prevent recurrences of the enron debacle and similar threats to the nation financial markets.
the bill does not supplant or replace state law,but sets a national floor for employee protections in the context of publicly traded companies.
other parts of the legislative history confirm the legislators focus on problems within the united states.see cong.rec,wl july,statement of daschle people like sherron watkins of enron will be protected from reprisal for the first time under federal law.this bill is going to help prosecutors gain important insider testimony on fraud and put a permanent dent in the corporate code of silence.id.statement of leahy emphasizing that the enron case demonstrates the vulnerability of corporate whistleblowers to retaliation under current law by pointing to outside counsel memorandum that texas law does not currently protect corporate whistleblowers cong.rec,wl july,statement of snowe t he leahy amendment grants important whistleblower protections to company enron sherron bravely report wrongdoing occurring within their own corporation.cong.rec,wl july,statement of leahy w e include meaningful protections for corporate whistleblowers,as passed by the senate.we learned from sherron watkins of enron that these corporate insiders are the key witnesses that need to be encouraged to report fraud and help prove it in court.enron wanted to silence her as a whistleblower because texas law would allow them to do it.cong.rec,wl july,statement of extends whistleblower protections to corporate employees whistleblowers in the private sector,like sh e rron watkins,should be afforded the same protections as government whistleblowers.cong.rec,wl july,statement of leahy repeating,almost verbatim,his may statements in relaying the legislative history of section emphasizing that private corporate whistleblowers need federal protection because of the patchwork and vagaries of current state laws.
carnero argues that the statute was meant to have extraterritorial reach by pointing to a later statement by senator leahy that the statute was intentionally written to sweep broadly,protecting any employee of a publicly traded company who took such reasonable action to try to protect investors and the market.see cong.rec,wl.senator leahy overall statements that day were directed to the white house incorrect interpretation that a whistleblower disclosure to congress would only be protected if made to a member conducting an investigation.the specific statement cited by carnero,however,was once again focusing on the need for federal protection where state law failed to protect corporate whistleblowers.here is the statement in context 
the law was designed to protect people like sherron watkins from enron from retaliation when they report fraud to federal investigators,regulators,or to any member of congress.the law was intentionally written to sweep broadly,protecting any employee of a publicly traded company who took such reasonable action to try to protect investors and the market.
the reason that senator grassley and i know so much about the legislative intent behind this provision is that we crafted it together last year in the judiciary committee and worked to make it part of the act on the senate floor.we had both seen enough cases where corporate employees who possessed the courage to stand up and do the right thing found out the hard way that there is a severe penalty for breaking the corporate code of silence.indeed,in the enron case itself we discovered an from outside counsel that noted that the texas supreme court had twice refused to find a legal protection for corporate whistleblowers and that implicitly gave enron the go ahead to fire watkins for reporting accounting irregularities.
id.emphasis added.
the legislative history thus suggests that congress was concerned about providing whistleblower protections for corporate employees in the various states.nowhere in the legislative history is there any indication that was drafted with the purpose of extending to foreign employees working in nations outside of the united states the right to seek administrative and judicial civil relief under the act.while the legislative history contains repeated references to the states,particularly texas,there are no parallel references to foreign countries see foley,at.holding that federal eight hour law did not apply overseas where legislative history revealed that congress was primarily concerned with domestic employment conditions.
by contrast,the legislative history of certain other provisions of the act shows that congress expressly considered the application of those provisions to foreign entities.for instance,section,whose text as already mentioned applies to foreign public accounting firms,also has history revealing congress thoughts in applying that statute abroad.see,at,wl july.senator sarbanes stated 
companies that sell shares to investors,and are subject to the federal securities laws,can be organized and operate in any part of the world.their financial statements are not necessarily audited by accounting firms,and the committee believes that there should be no difference in treatment of a public company auditors under the bill simply because of a particular auditor place of operation.otherwise,a significant loophole in the protection offered investors would be built into the statutory system.
thus,accounting firms organized under the laws of countries other than the united states that issue audit reports for public companies subject to the securities laws are covered by the bill in the same manner as domestic accounting firms,subject to the exemptive authority of both the public company accounting oversight board and the sec.
section of the act provides that a company principal executive officers and principal financial officers,or persons performing similar functions,must certify the material completeness and accuracy of sec filings.see.while the statute itself does not indicate whether officers of both and foreign companies are covered,its legislative history is suggestive on the subject.see cong.rec,wl july.senator graham stated 
if companies are being publically traded in the united states,regardless of where their headquarters are located,they ought to be required to meet the same level of accountability that we are establishing for everyone else in this legislation.
other parts of the legislative history reveal congress sensitivity to the application of some of the act provisions to foreign entities.some members of congress,for instance,were reluctant to impose corporate reforms on countries with adequate or superior corporate governance regimes.see cong.rec,wl july.senator enzi commented 
i believe we need to be clear with respect to the area of foreign issuers and their coverage under the bill broad definitions.while foreign issuers can be listed and traded in the if they agree to conform to gaap and new york stock exchange rules,the sec historically has permitted the home country of the issuer to implement corporate governance standards.foreign issuers are not part of the current problems being seen in the capital markets,and i do not believe it was the intent of the conferees to export standards disregarding the sovereignty of other countries as well as their regulators under the conference report,section a which was enacted gives the sec wide authority to enact implementing regulations that are necessary or appropriate in the public interest.i believe it is the intent of the conferees to permit the commission wide latitude in using their rulemaking authority to deal with technical matters such as the scope of the definitions and their applicability to foreign issuers.
the foregoing show congress keen awareness of the application of some of the act provisions to entities in other countries and of the associated problems.accordingly,congress complete silence as to overseas application of the instant whistleblower protection provision combined with congress repeated reference to the need for that provision to supplement state enforcement,provides significant indication that congress did not intend to apply extraterritorially.
other factors 
other factors lend support to the conclusion that the whistleblower protection provision in was not meant to apply extraterritorially.
problems of extraterritorial enforcement 
if the whistleblower protection provision is given extraterritorial reach in a case like the present one,it would empower courts and a agency,the dol,to delve into the employment relationship between foreign employers and their foreign employees.carnero,whose direct employers were two latin american corporations,has asked the united states district court for,among other relief,his reinstatement.the door would thus be opened for courts to examine and adjudicate relationships abroad that would normally be handled by a foreign country own courts and government agencies pursuant to its own laws.in enacting other laws that affect employment relationships extraterritorially,members of congress have recognized the principle of sovereignty that no nation has the right to impose its labor standards on another country.see,at,reprinted in,limiting age discrimination law extraterritorial reach to citizens employed by corporations or their subsidiaries in countries that do not have inconsistent laws see also foley,at.at noting that labor conditions of its own citizens are the primary concern of a foreign country.we believe if congress had intended that the whistleblower provision would apply abroad to foreign entities,it would have said so,and certainly would have considered,before enacting the law,the problems and limits of extraterritorial enforcement.yet congress did not at any time discuss the interest other countries would have in regulating these employment relationships,nor did congress include in the whistleblower provision any mechanism for resolving potential conflicts with foreign labor laws and procedures.congress complete silence suggests that it had no thought or intention to apply this provision to foreign employees and entities as now proposed.
further suggestive of congress lack of extraterritorial intent is its failure to provide any mechanism for enforcing the whistleblower protections in a foreign setting.congress did not grant,or even discuss the granting of,extraterritorial investigatory powers to the department of labor,the agency charged with administering whistleblower complaints see aramco,at.concluding that congress restrictive intent as to geographic reach of title vii was evidenced by lack of extraterritorial venue and other enforcement mechanisms in statute.no reference is made to providing for interpreters,for coordinating with the department of state,or for the utilization of foreign personnel.significantly,the dol is given only sixty days to complete its entire investigation of a complaint and to issue findings under the procedure mandated by b a see b.this short time frame seems unrealistic if the dol were expected to conduct investigations overseas moreover,if an administrative hearing is held,the hearing shall be conducted expeditiously under b a.see id.there is no provision either for the resources or the flexibility that might be needed in dealing with foreign matters and,as said,the legislative history contains no discussion of this or other problems likely to arise had congress meant this provision to apply outside the territorial united states.the statute,it must be remembered,protects a whistleblowing employee from retaliation or other discrimination by a publicly traded company,or any officer,employee,contractor,subcontractor,or agent of such company.id.a.if the statute has extraterritorial effect,this broad coverage would create an expansive class of potential whistleblowers by extending its protections to countless employees in countless areas around the world.and yet,there is no discussion about the increased administrative and logistical burdens that would fall on the dol to administer such a statute.these omissions are striking.they indicate that congress did not focus on the possibility of extraterritorial application,with its attendant problems.
b.the venue provisions contemplate domestic claims only 
the whistleblower provision in question includes venue provisions instructing as to the particular federal court within which judicial claims are to be brought.there is no venue provision specifically tailored to claims based on conduct abroad,and,significantly,two of the venue provisions for various stages of court review would exclude foreign claims of the instant sort.
for whistleblower complaints brought under,the act incorporates by reference the procedural structure for whistleblower complaints filed with the united states department of labor under the wendell ford aviation investment and reform act for the century.id.b a an action under paragraph a shall be governed under the rules and procedures set forth in section b of title united states code.contains nothing prescribing a federal venue for whistleblower complaints or appeals based on conduct abroad,brought by employees resident and working in a foreign country.while de novo review,such as in this case,may be sought in the appropriate district court of the united states,the appropriate court is not defined,b b.b and related provisions suggest that the appropriate court is one in the jurisdiction of which the whistleblower violation occurred or the complainant resided.hence b a provides that appeal from the secretary final order should be directed to the federal court of appeals for the circuit in which the violation,with respect to which the order was issued,allegedly occurred or the circuit in which the complainant resided on the date of such violation.section b provides that the secretary may enforce a final order by filing a civil action in the united states district
