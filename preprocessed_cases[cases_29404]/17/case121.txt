opinion of the court 
marcel windt and meijer,in their capacity as trustees in bankruptcy for kpnqwest trustees,appeal from the dismissal of their amended complaint on forum non conveniens grounds by the united states district court for the district of new jersey.the trustees asserted claims against qwest communications international,qwest,joseph nacchio,robert mcmaster and robert woodruff collectively referred to as defendants arising from the bankruptcy of a dutch company,kpnqwest kpnqwest.specifically,we must decide whether the district court abused its discretion in assigning the trustees choice of forum a low degree of deference,whether the district court abused its discretion in balancing the public and private interest factors implicated in this case,and whether the district court abused its discretion in determining that litigation in the trustees chosen forum was oppressive or vexatious to the defendants out of all proportion to the trustees convenience.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm the district court dismissal of the trustees amended complaint on forum non conveniens grounds.
in,qwest and kpn,a subsidiary of dutch multimedia company koniklijke kpn,engaged in a joint venture and formed kpnqwest.kpnqwest was organized as a dutch corporation,had its principal place of business in hoofddorp,netherlands,and was established to construct a european fiber optics telecommunications network.by,kpnqwest was insolvent and filed for bankruptcy in a dutch court.
as a result of the bankruptcy filing,windt and meijer were appointed by the dutch bankruptcy court as trustees in bankruptcy for kpnqwest pursuant to their official duties,the trustees investigated the cause of kpnqwest bankruptcy and brought this lawsuit on behalf of kpnqwest bankruptcy estate.in june,the trustees filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of new jersey.according to the complaint,the defendants deceived kpnqwest supervisory board about the financial solvency of kpnqwest in an effort to gain control of kpnqwest and manipulate its business to suit their objectives.the trustees complaint detailed a pattern of fraud,mismanagement and accounting improprieties that resulted in the ultimate failure of kpnqwest.specifically,the complaint alleged one claim under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,and one claim of mismanagement and breach of duty based upon violations of the dutch civil code.
the trustees complaint named qwest,nacchio,mcmaster and woodruff as defendants.qwest is a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in colorado.nacchio,a new jersey resident,previously served as chairman and chief executive officer of qwest and as chairman of the supervisory board of kpnqwest.mcmaster,also a new jersey resident,previously served as qwest executive vice president of international business and was named by the supervisory board as kpnqwest chief executive officer.woodruff,a colorado resident,previously served as chief financial officer of qwest and was a member of kpnqwest supervisory board.
on october,the defendants moved to compel arbitration of the trustees claims.the motion was denied by a magistrate judge on june,and the defendants appealed the denial to the district court.on february,while the appeal to the district court concerning the denial of the motion to compel arbitration was pending,the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the trustees complaint on forum non conveniens grounds.on august,the district court affirmed the magistrate judge denial of the defendants motion to compel arbitration 
on september,the trustees filed an amended complaint that asserted the same essential facts and claims as their original complaint.the defendants then notified the district court that they would file a new motion to dismiss the amended complaint.the district court deemed the prior motion to dismiss to be pending and,on october,dismissed the amended complaint on forum non conveniens grounds.the trustees now appeal the district court dismissal of their amended complaint.
in addition to this proceeding,other legal proceedings related to kpnqwest and the defendants are currently pending,or were pending at the time the trustees filed the instant complaint.three lawsuits stemming from qwest relationship with kpnqwest have been filed in various state and federal courts.taft ackermans,was a putative securities class action lawsuit filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york and settled in early.grand nacchio,no.pima county superior,is a securities action filed in in arizona state court that involved the purchase of shares of kpnqwest stock by a living trust.the trial court in grand granted partial summary judgment in favor of the defendants.the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the remainder of their claims and appealed.approximately one month after the district court dismissal in this case,the arizona appellate court affirmed the trial court in part,reversed in part,and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.grand nacchio,app.subsequent to the filing of this lawsuit,another securities action,appaloosa investment.i qwest commc ns int l,was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york and is pending in that court.
litigation and other proceedings related to kpnqwest also arose in the netherlands following the filing of the trustees complaint in new jersey.on august,several dutch kpnqwest shareholders petitioned the enterprise chamber,a branch of the civil court in amsterdam with jurisdiction over corporate mismanagement claims,to begin an inquiry into the cause of kpnqwest bankruptcy.the enterprise chamber granted the request,and all of the defendants named in this lawsuit are involved in the investigatory proceeding before the enterprise chamber.
several weeks before the district court dismissed this case,cargill financial sued three of the defendants named by the trustees and several other parties related to the formation operation of kpnqwest in the netherlands.in its complaint,cargill financial asserts that three of the defendants named here and others fraudulently procured credit in an attempt to avoid the bankruptcy from which this litigation arises.
insurance litigation is also pending in the netherlands.the insurance cases involve all of the parties to this lawsuit and concern the insurers nullification of directors and officers insurance policies covering various individuals associated with kpnqwest.in these cases,the insurers allege that the directors and officers insurance policies were fraudulently procured through the same mismanagement alleged in this lawsuit.in addition,kpnqwest bankruptcy proceedings are still ongoing in the dutch courts.
the district court had jurisdiction in this case pursuant to and.we have jurisdiction over final orders of the district court pursuant to.our review in this case,however,is limited.

the district court determination may be reversed only when there has been a clear abuse of discretion where the court has considered all relevant public and private interest factors,and where its balancing of these factors is reasonable,its decision deserves substantial deference.piper aircraft,at.thus,we do not perform a de novo resolution of forum non conveniens issues.lacey cessna aircraft lacey i,cir.a district court abuses its discretion in a forum non conveniens analysis when it fails to consider adequately and to determine the amount of deference due the foreign plaintiff choice of forum or when it clearly errs in weighing the factors to be considered.lony i,at internal citations omitted.
the supreme court has articulated precepts applicable in forum non conveniens cases.although a plaintiff choice of forum should rarely be disturbed,piper aircraft,at,a federal court may resist imposition upon its jurisdiction even when jurisdiction is authorized by the letter of a general venue statute.gulf oil gilbert.when an alternative forum has jurisdiction to hear the case,and when trial in the plaintiff chosen forum would establish oppressiveness and vexation to a defendant out of all proportion to plaintiff convenience,or when the chosen forum is inappropriate because of considerations affecting the court own administrative and legal problems,the court may,in the exercise of its sound discretion,dismiss the case.koster am.lumbermens mut.cas.
to guide the trial court exercise of discretion and its determination of oppressiveness and vexation,the supreme court has prescribed a balancing of private interest factors affecting the convenience of the litigants and public interest factors affecting the convenience of the forum.see gulf oil,at.factors pertaining to the private interests of the litigants include 
the relative ease of access to sources of proof availability of compulsory process for attendance of unwilling,and the cost of obtaining attendance of willing,witnesses possibility of view of premises,if view would be appropriate to the action and all other practical problems that make trial of a case easy,expeditious and inexpensive.
id.at.public interest factors bearing on the inquiry include administrative difficulties flowing from court congestion the local interest in having localized controversies decided at home the interest in having the trial of a diversity case in a forum that is at home with the state law that must govern the case the avoidance of unnecessary problems in conflict of laws,or in the application of foreign law and the unfairness of burdening citizens in an unrelated forum with jury duty.id.at.
applying these precepts to a particular case,when considering a motion to dismiss on forum non conveniens grounds,a district court must first determine whether an adequate alternative forum can entertain the case if such a forum exists,the district court must then determine the appropriate amount of deference to be given the plaintiff choice of forum.once the district court has determined the amount of deference due the plaintiff choice of forum,the district court must balance the relevant public and private interest factors.if the balance of these factors indicates that trial in the chosen forum would result in oppression or vexation to the defendant out of all proportion to the plaintiff convenience,the district court may,in its discretion,dismiss the case on forum non conveniens grounds.
we first consider whether the district court abused its discretion in assigning the trustees choice of forum a low degree of deference.ordinarily,a strong presumption of convenience exists in favor of a domestic plaintiff chosen forum,and this presumption may be overcome only when the balance of the public and private interests clearly favors an alternate forum.piper aircraft,at.when the plaintiff is foreign,however,this assumption is much less reasonable.because the central purpose of any forum non conveniens inquiry is to ensure that the trial is convenient,a foreign plaintiff choice deserves less deference.id.at.foreign plaintiffs,however,may bolster the amount of deference due their choice by making a strong showing of convenience.lony i,at.thus,in performing its forum non conveniens inquiry in a case filed by a foreign plaintiff,the district court must assess,and articulate,whether the considerable evidence of convenience has overcome any reason to refrain from extending full deference to the foreign plaintiff choice.id.
after considering the evidence of convenience to the trustees in filing their amended complaint in the district of new jersey,the district court accorded the foreign trustees a low degree of deference 
it is illogical for a bankruptcy trustee to assert that it would be more convenient to bring an action thousands of miles away,while this trustee a has to play a part in the related bankruptcy proceedings in his home forum,and b has his defendants already brought into his home forum on two other actions which are nearly identical in nature to the action the trustee desires to pursue,and in one of which the trustee has already been ordered to appear.since one can hardly perceive any convenience in having multiple massive litigations on both sides of the atlantic,this court discerns little evidence of convenience to plaintiffs in plaintiffs decision to file this action with this court and,thus,accords plaintiffs forum selection a low degree of deference.

the trustees contend that their filing of this action in the defendants home forum strongly supports a finding that their choice was a convenient one,and thus they should be accorded the same deference as a domestic plaintiff.the trustees direct our attention to our statement in lony i 
the foreign plaintiff is suing the defendant in the latter home forum where the latter corporate headquarters,headquarters of the division in question,and research laboratories are located.that in itself has considerable weight in showing that the plaintiff s choice of forum was based on convenience.in addition,the plaintiff has taken pains to show that much of the evidence it needs to establish liability is located in the forum it chose,and the conduct that caused the alleged injury issued from the chosen forum.
in determining the amount of deference due the trustees choice of forum,the district court properly considered the particular circumstances of this litigation,including the trustees and defendants connections with new jersey and the pending litigation in the netherlands.the facts of this case differ from those of lony i,in which the plaintiff,a german sole proprietorship,filed suit in the district of delaware against a delaware corporation that had its principal place of business in delaware.id.at.although two individual defendants in this case are residents of new jersey,that state is not the home forum of the corporate defendant or another individual defendant named in the trustees amended complaint.there is also no indication that evidence is concentrated in new jersey,nor is there an indication that a substantial amount of conduct giving rise to the instant dispute occurred in new jersey.thus,the forum chosen by the plaintiffs in lony i had a more substantial relationship to the parties and events involved in that case than new jersey has to the parties and events involved in this case.in the context of this particular issue,therefore,lony i is not a proper analogue.
furthermore,the trustees are dutch residents acting as representatives of an insolvent dutch corporation.beyond this litigation,the trustees have no connections to new jersey in their representative or personal capacities.at the time the trustees brought this suit,they were already immersed in the dutch bankruptcy proceedings involving kpnqwest.considering the particular circumstances of this case,we are satisfied that the district court did not abuse its discretion in according the trustees choice of forum a low degree of deference.
in this case,two defendants were located in new jersey and two were located in colorado.the trustees argue that these circumstances should not affect this court conclusion as to the convenience of filing in the district of new jersey because the forum non conveniens inquiry looks to contacts with the united states,not the state where the federal court is located.appellants br.at.the trustees misconstrue the flexible forum non conveniens analysis.although the relationship between the united states and a case generally should be considered,this does not mean that the relationship between the local federal court district and the case should not.indeed,considerations of local inconvenience may be so strong as to a dwarf considerations of national convenience.
this comment warrants a caveat.often,defendants,evidence and witnesses will be spread throughout numerous districts.it would be problematic if granting a motion to dismiss for forum non conveniens,based on local considerations,precluded a plaintiff from filing the suit in another,convenient district.thus,the conclusion we reach in this case does not necessarily mean that this action may not be maintainable in another federal district.whether an action dismissed by one federal court on forum non conveniens grounds is maintainable in another federal court would depend on various factors,including whether the possibility of a transfer under a was considered by the district court,see mizokami of arizona,mobay chemical,cir declining to apply res judicata or law of the case doctrine to a dismissal by a different district court on forum non conveniens grounds,when the other court did not consider whether transfer was appropriate,whether differences between the districts made one more convenient,see pastewka texaco,cir holding that a prior forum non conveniens dismissal in federal court in new york barred relitigation in federal court in delaware where the plaintiffs conceded that both the objective legal criteria and the material facts underlying the application of those criteria were identical,and whether the first federal court grounded its decision on national or local considerations,see villar crowley,cir,abrogated on other grounds by marathon oil ruhrgas,cir affirming the application of res judicata to a different court dismissal on forum non conveniens grounds when the other court found that no forum in the united states was convenient.
although the trustees choice of forum was accorded a low degree of deference,the defendants must nevertheless demonstrate that a forum non conveniens dismissal is warranted.to determine whether the defendants adequately demonstrated that dismissal was warranted,we turn to the district court analysis of the oppression and vexation prong of the forum non conveniens inquiry.when an alternative forum has jurisdiction to hear the case,and when trial in the plaintiff chosen forum would establish oppressiveness and vexation to a defendant out of all proportion to plaintiff convenience,or when the chosen forum is inappropriate because of considerations affecting the court own administrative and legal problems,the district court may,in the exercise of its sound discretion,dismiss the case.koster,at.to guide its exercise of discretion,the district court must balance the relevant public and private interest factors and determine whether the balance of these factors favors dismissal of the case.
a defendant seeking dismissal on forum non conveniens grounds must show that the balance of the public and private factors tips decidedly in favor of trial in the foreign forum.lacey cessna aircraft lacey ii,cir.if,when added together,the relevant private and public interest factors are in equipose,or even if they lean only slightly toward dismissal,the motion to dismiss must be denied.id.in this case,the district court decided that the balance tipped decidedly toward trial in the netherlands.we now review its analysis.
we first examine the local nature of the dispute and the public interest in resolving local disputes locally.the district court observed 
t he case at bar concerns the allegations of fraud and mismanagement of a dutch business entity by a board member and executives of that corporation,and by that corporation controlling holder.the fact that two of these defendants are domiciled in the state of new jersey does not transform the case into a local dispute,nor can the facts that four board meetings took place somewhere in the united states and defendants,while being present in the united states,took part in five international conference calls,can not transform the case into an american dispute.
windt,d at emphases in original.
we agree with the district court that the trustees complaint does not raise a local dispute.the trustees amended complaint alleges fraud and mismanagement perpetrated on a dutch company by executives,board members and a corporate shareholder of that dutch company.although two of the defendants are residents of new jersey,there are no allegations that actions or events occurring in new jersey gave rise to the fraud and mismanagement at issue in this case.moreover,without a dispute local to the community of new jersey,there is little public interest in subjecting that community to the burdens of jury service.dahl united techs,cir the only contact that delaware has with this case is that it is the defendant state of incorporation.indeed,the defendant principal place of business is in connecticut.we therefore conclude that the commitment of delaware judicial time and resources to this case is not justified by any nexus delaware has with what is essentially a norwegian case.
in can not be denied that the netherlands has a substantial interest in resolving this dispute as it involves the alleged mismanagement of a dutch company by supervisory board members and executives of that dutch company.indeed,dutch shareholders of kpnqwest have successfully petitioned the enterprise chamber in the netherlands to investigate the alleged mismanagement of the company.in light of new jersey lack of associations with this case and the netherlands substantial associations with this case,the district court reasonably concluded that the nature of the dispute and the burdens of jury service on the local community in resolving this dispute favored dismissal of the trustees amended complaint.
we next examine the necessity of applying foreign law and avoiding problems in its application.the trustees assert one claim under the rico statute and one claim of mismanagement and breach of fiduciary duty,implicating eleven provisions of the dutch civil code.federal courts have refused to afford rico claims special treatment in forum non conveniens inquiries and have found dismissal on this basis proper in cases involving rico claims.see,gemini capital group yap fishing,cir alfadda fenn,cir republic of panama bcci holdings luxembourg,cir kempe ocean drilling exploration,cir.were this case to remain in new jersey,the district court would be required to examine and apply eleven provisions of the dutch civil code.on this basis,we can not say that the district court was unreasonable in concluding that avoiding problems in the application of foreign law favored dismissal.
although we recognize that the united states has an interest in redressing wrongful conduct engaged in by a corporation and american executives,this general national interest does not outweigh the limited connection between new jersey and this dispute.see dahl,at this lawsuit has little connection to delaware and we believe the general national interest in aircraft regulation is not sufficient by itself to warrant retention of jurisdiction over an action when the other factors favor dismissal.allstate life ins.linter group,cir while united states courts have an interest in enforcing united states securities laws,this alone does not prohibit them from dismissing a securities action on the ground of forum non conveniens.considering all of the public interest factors implicated in this case,the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the balance of these factors favored dismissal.
turning to the private interest factors,we first examine the ease of access to evidence required in this case.based upon the parties representations to this court and to the district court,it appears that the physical evidence in this case consists of thousands of boxes of documents.the trustees do not challenge the district court finding that t he expenses and complexity associated with such production and examination appear to be the same regardless of whether the case is litigated in new jersey or in amsterdam.windt,d at.
we next examine the cost for willing witnesses to attend trial and the methods available for compelling the attendance of unwilling witnesses.many of the witnesses required in this case are already embroiled in investigations and litigation in the netherlands related to the insolvency of kpnqwest.thus,transportation and lodging costs may be save
