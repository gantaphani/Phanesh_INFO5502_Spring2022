this cause of action arises from the breach of a lease agreement executed between southeast texas inns,southeast,a tennessee corporation,and,a delaware limited partnership and subsidiary of prime hospitality corporation prime southeast sued prime,the alleged alter ego of,seeking to pierce corporate veil in order to hold prime liable for breach of contract.the district court granted prime motion to dismiss pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.southeast now timely appeals the order of dismissal.we affirm.
on july,southeast and executed an lease agreement the lease,whereby agreed to rent and operate three amerisuites hotels located in texas from july,until june,under the pertinent terms of the lease,was to pay per month as minimum rent,along with additional rent,if applicable,with respect to each property with respect to each lease year beginning with the lease year,in an amount,not less than zero,equal to eight percent of excess total hotel sales for such property.in addition,the parties agreed that obligations under the lease were to be secured by,inter alia,certain retained funds held by southeast,as well as the hotels personal property pursuant to of the lease,was to maintain a minimum net worth in an amount at least equal to the aggregate of one year minimum rent payable pursuant to this agreement it being expressly understood and agreed that the right to receive the retained funds,if assigned to tenant,may for such purpose be counted as equity at the full amount thereof.section of the lease further provides that southeast shall hold the retained funds as security for performance by of the terms of the lease and,in the event of default,southeast may apply the entire amount of the retained funds as may be necessary to compensate southeast toward the payment of rent or other damages sustained due to such breach by.
the lease,at,also contains a nonrecourse provision,which provides that n othing contained in this agreement shall be construed to impose any liabilities or obligations on tenant general partners,limited partners,agents or employees or any shareholders,officers,directors,agents or employees of any of the foregoing for the performance of the obligations of landlord or tenant hereunder.although prime signed the lease,its signature served only to acknowledge and agree to be bound by the provisions of section the trade area restriction of the foregoing lease agreement,and neither prime nor any company affiliated with prime signed a guaranty of the lease.in fact,although the original purchase agreement expressly contemplated that prime would provide a limited guaranty of the lease equal to one year base rent,the parties intentionally struck and deleted this prime guaranty provision when the amended purchase agreement was executed finally,of the lease provides that tennessee law governs its interpretation,construction,application,and enforcement.
both parties abided by the terms of the lease until march,when douglas vicari,prime chief financial officer and the president of,allegedly advised john buttolph,president of southeast,that planned to walk away from the lease for economic reasons and that the march rent payment would be its last payment when failed to pay rent for the month of april,southeast terminated the lease effective april.southeast alleges that,as a result of breach,it lost over million in gross minimum rent for the remainder of the lease term and that it is owed nearly million in liquidated damages.
the present case is an appeal from one of two cases that were consolidated in the district court.in june,southeast instituted an action case against ridgewood,and prime to recover damages caused by alleged breach of the lease southeast alleged that operated as a mere alter ego of prime and ridgewood and that the latter two defendants were thus legally responsible for breach.prime and ridgewood responded by moving to dismiss pursuant to fed.civ.b.thereafter,in accordance with an agreed order,southeast dismissed without prejudice its claims against prime and ridgewood,with leave to amend the pleadings after a designated period of discovery.rather than amending its pleadings after the discovery period,southeast commenced the present,separate lawsuit against prime case on essentially the same grounds,alleging that prime actually directed and controlled the operation of the texas hotels and that,now insolvent,is merely the of prime.southeast advances numerous allegations purportedly entitling it to pierce corporate veil and hold prime liable for damages incurred as a result of its subsidiary breach.the district court consolidated the cases 
prime promptly filed a rule b motion to dismiss in the instant case,contending that southeast allegations of undercapitalization or lack of corporate formalities do not rise to the level of fraud or something like fraud necessary to warrant the extreme measure of piercing corporate veil.
on january,the district court issued an opinion and order granting prime motion to dismiss.the district court concluded that southeast complaint failed to allege facts sufficient to state a claim against prime that would warrant piercing corporate veil.specifically,the court held that,although southeast adequately alleged that prime exerted complete dominion and control over and ridgewood,the complaint failed to allege circumstances evincing a fraud or similar injustice,a requisite element of an claim under delaware law.the court thus dismissed all claims against prime.the district court subsequently denied southeast motion to alter or amend the judgment.southeast timely appeals the judgment in favor of prime.

a threshold issue is whether tennessee or delaware law applies in determining if southeast complaint states a cognizable claim to pierce the corporate veil of.in assessing prime motion to dismiss,the district court held that issues pertaining to the lease and its construction,application,and enforcement were governed by tennessee law in accordance with the rules of the forum state and the express provision contained in of the lease see generally the andersons,consol,cir noting that,in diversity cases,a district court should apply the provisions of the forum state.
but the district court,citing the internal affairs doctrine recognized by the tennessee courts applied the law of delaware,where was formed and incorporated,for the limited purpose of determining whether the allegations in southeast complaint sufficiently provided justification to disregard the separate corporate entities of prime and its subsidiary,and to pierce corporate veil.southeast now challenges the court decision to apply delaware law to its alter ego claim.
according to southeast,the provision contained in of the lease can not be disregarded when it was made in good faith and the state chosen tennessee bears some reasonable relationship to the transaction.goodwin,at.plaintiff further disputes the district court application of the internal affairs doctrine as justification for applying delaware substantive law to the issue of piercing the corporate veil.underlying southeast argument that tennessee,not delaware,law should apply is its strenuous insistence that tennessee does not require a plaintiff to prove actual fraud in order to pierce the corporate veil.citing talkington anchor gasoline,stigall wickes,continental bankers life ins.of the south v.the bank of alamo,and boles.dev,app.denied,for the proposition that fraud is but one of several acceptable avenues of recovery in an alter ego action,southeast maintains that its allegations that prime exercised complete dominion over and used its control to perpetrate violations of certain positive legal duties suffices to state a claim to pierce the corporate veil under tennessee law.
we initially note that southeast argument that fraud is not a required element of an action to pierce the corporate veil under tennessee law has already been considered and rejected by this court in ibc velsicol chem,wl cir.july,in which we surveyed tennessee case law on this issue including the principal cases on which southeast now relies and concluded that tennessee law still requires an element of fraud in order to pierce a corporate veil.ibc,wl at emphasis added see also thomas,d at favorably citing ibc for the proposition that fraud is a requisite element of a claim to pierce the corporate veil under tennessee law.
moreover,insofar as the parties debate whether southeast must show actual fraud or fraud per se,this is largely a matter of semantics under the circumstances,and underscores that the issue is not pivotal,given that under both delaware and tennessee law,fraud or similar injustice must be demonstrated in order to pierce the corporate veil.see,mobil oil linear films,f raud or something like it is required under delaware law to sustain an alter ego claim,and cases cited therein lasalle bank perelman,d,in order to prevail on a claim to pierce the corporate veil a plaintiff must prove that the corporate form causes fraud or similar injustice.in re foxmeyer,quoting mobil oil.at,for the proposition that fraud or something akin to it is required,and cases cited therein outokumpu eng g,kvaerner enviropower,t he alter ego theory requires that the corporate structure cause fraud or similar injustice thus,m ere dominion and control of the parent over the subsidiary alone will not support alter ego liability.wallace wood,piercing the corporate veil under the alter ego theory requires that the corporate structure cause fraud or similar injustice.effectively,the corporation must be a sham and exist for no other purpose than as a vehicle for fraud.footnote and internal quotations omitted.accord continental bankers,at the control of the parent corporation over the subsidiary must have been used to commit a fraud or wrong.power bd.of chattanooga joseph valley structural steel,quoting the continental bankers test.racquetball investors,bell,citing continental bankers and noting that under an alter ego theory of liability,mere dominance,standing alone,does not render a corporate director liable for the corporate debts u se of control to commit fraud or wrong is also required to fix liability

in both tennessee and delaware,t he principle of piercing the fiction of the corporate veil is to be applied with great caution and not precipitately,since there is a presumption of corporate regularity,schlater haynie,citing d corporations,nn,and t he party wishing to pierce the corporate veil has the burden of presenting facts demonstrating that it is entitled to this equitable relief.oceanics schools,barbour,citing schlater,at.accord wallace,at persuading a delaware court to disregard the corporate entity is a difficult task.quoting harco ins.green farms,no.civ,wl,at.
beside the indispensable elements of complete dominion and control and the sanction of fraud or injustice by the corporate form,the courts of tennessee and delaware also consider certain common,factors in determining whether to disregard the corporate veil.the delaware courts,for instance,verify exclusivity of control by examining 
whether the corporation was adequately capitalized for the corporate undertaking whether the corporation was solvent whether dividends were paid,corporate records kept,officers and directors functioned properly,and other corporate formalities were observed whether the dominant shareholder siphoned corporate funds and whether,in general,the corporation simply functioned as a facade for the dominant shareholder.

simply put,given the striking parallels between delaware and tennessee law pertaining to the issue of piercing the corporate veil,the question is not in this case under the law of either state,southeast must sufficiently allege that corporate form was used to sanction a fraud or similar injustice in order to survive prime b motion to dismiss.
southeast sets forth numerous allegations ostensibly showing that and prime acted as a single economic entity and was in fact merely the alter ego of prime.southeast avers that a lthough executed the lease and was nominally the lessee of the hotels,prime actually directed and controlled the operation of the hotels.comp.in this regard,southeast alleges that the hotels were operated exclusively by employees of prime,who provided all management,front desk,maintenance,housekeeping,reservations,human resources,and other services necessary to operate the hotels prime provided all such services on its own behalf,not pursuant to any management or other agreement with,and without any franchise agreement pertaining to the amerisuites hotel chain prime bore all the risk of loss associated with the operation of the hotels and stood to benefit from any profits generated by the hotels from july,through the termination of the lease,prime purportedly received all revenues generated by the hotels and,on a weekly basis,prime swept all cash generated by the hotels from the local bank accounts maintained by the hotels and deposited all such funds into prime central bank account in new jersey.comp.
southeast further alleges that prime bypassed the legal operational structure of the hotels by never providing with any capital and by directly paying all of the hotels vendors and services.comp.according to southeast,prime so controlled the finances of that it was actually prime tax department which determined whether and to what extent was to pay a franchising fee to prime in connection with the three amerisuites hotels involved in this case.comp.in total,prime allegedly spent million in excess of the hotels revenues to operate the hotels,a sum which was neither a loan to nor an equity contribution.comp.
in addition,southeast avers that prime ceo,attilio petrocelli,was the person who had the authority to make,and in fact made,all significant decisions on behalf of,including decisions regarding compliance with the lease terms,even though he was not an officer or director of.comp.southeast alleges that the decision to default on the lease was made by petrocelli,who was advised by ridgewood officers,vicari and szymanski,to walk away from the lease,even though the latter two individuals did not have the authority to order default or to turn the hotels over to southeast and testified that they considered only what was in the best interests of prime.comp.
in addition,southeast alleges that has been rendered insolvent as a result of the default under the lease and has no assets with which to satisfy its legal obligations to southeast.comp.southeast contends that such insolvency is a direct result of prime use of its control of to inadequately capitalize the subsidiary.comp.southeast maintains that prime knew when it established that was going to operate at a loss for a substantial period of time and that it did not have sufficient available assets to meet its projected operating expenses.comp.prime allegedly failed to maintain net worth equal to one year base rent in accordance with of the lease.comp.
finally,with regard to the corporate structure of,southeast alleges that prime set up for the sole purpose of limiting its liability under the lease.comp.southeast avers that there were neither partnership meetings nor ridgewood board meetings.comp.prime allegedly exercised plenary control over and ridgewood and used this control to cause the officers and directors of ridgewood to violate their duties of loyalty to these entities to cause to default under the lease and to cause and ridgewood to have inadequate capital with which to finance foreseeable operating expenses,to the extent that n either nor ridgewood had any mind or will of its own.comp.southeast concludes that t o adhere to the fiction of separate corporate existence would promote injustice.comp.
reviewing these allegations,we agree with the district court that southeast has stated sufficient facts that,if true,establish the component of a claim to pierce the corporate veil.wallace,at continental bankers,at.southeast avers with detail that corporate formalities were ignored in various ways,prime directed operations of the hotels and provided all employees and services,prime financed the operations of the three hotels during the lease period and received and retained all revenues from the hotels,prime ceo made all significant decisions on behalf of,and prime bypassed the legal structure set up to operate the hotels.
however,as previously noted,m ere dominion and control of the parent over the subsidiary will not alone support alter ego liability.outokumpu,at.see also continental bankers,at to disregard the corporate entities requires,in the case of parent and subsidiary,more than a showing that they have similar corporate names and locations and the exercise of dominion through common officers and directors.likewise,southeast allegations that appropriate corporate formalities were not observed by prime and standing alone are insufficient for the alter ego theory to operate to pierce the corporate veil.mobil oil.at.
southeast nonetheless argues that two alleged violations of positive legal duties by prime supply the requisite fraud or injustice necessary to complete its alter ego claim prime failure to provide adequate capital to finance as required by of the lease comp,and prime use of its dominion and plenary control over and ridgewood to cause the officers and directors of ridgewood to violate their duties of loyalty to these entities.comp.in this latter regard,southeast asserts,in pertinent part,that 
the decision to default under the terms of the lease was made by prime chief executive officer,attilio petrocelli,who held no position of any kind with or ridgewood.vicari and szymanski,the directors and officers of ridgewood,recommended to petrocelli that the tenant walk away from the lease,but neither acting individually nor both acting collectively as the board of directors of ridgewood had the authority to default and turn the hotels over to the plaintiff.further,in recommending to petrocelli that default under the terms of the lease,neither vicari nor szymanski analyzed or considered what was in the best interests of either or ridgewood.both vicari and szymanski have testified that they considered only what was in prime best interests.
neither vicari nor szymanski,nor petrocelli,for that matter,approached the plaintiff to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the lease so that could continue to lease the hotels,even though to do so would have been in the best interests of and ridgewood.
it is significant,however,that southeast also acknowledges in its complaint that prime spent approximately million in excess of the hotels revenues to operate the hotels from july to april.comp.southeast avers that,in the wake of the events of september,the performance of the hotels suffered greatly.comp.the revenues which the hotels generated in and did not reach the levels which prime had projected at the time the lease was executed.from july,to the end of calendar year,prime lost approximately million in the operation of the hotels.id.
in light of these averments,southeast premise that it would have been in the best interests of and ridgewood to renegotiate the lease and that the officers breached their fiduciary duties to these entities by advising to walk away from the lease,is not only questionable from a business standpoint,but also is undermined by southeast own acknowledgment that the venture was unprofitable.in light of these contradictory assertions contained in the complaint that,on the one hand,the corporate officers breached their fiduciary duties to ridgewood by recommending that the lease be terminated and,on the other hand,that there were sound economic reasons to do so,we agree with the district court that the complaint does not plead sufficient facts establishing that the officers breached their fiduciary duties.
more importantly,these conclusory allegations,couched in terms of a contractual breach,are not tantamount to the fraud or injustice required to pierce the corporate veil.as we have already emphasized,t he injustice must be more than the breach of contract alleged in the complaint outokumpu,at.southeast does not plead with specificity that,in making the decision to walk away from the lease without renegotiating it,prime and the corporate officers misused the limited liability supplied to prime by and ridgewood corporate forms to sanction a fraud,injustice,or equivalent misfeasance.viewing this case from its proper consensual contractual agreement between sophisticated are not persuaded that southeast has pleaded extraordinary circumstances that justify piercing corporate veil 
southeast also avers in its complaint that prime did not capitalize with sufficient net worth as required by of the lease,pursuant to which shall at all times maintain net worth in an amount at least equal to the aggregate of one year minimum rent payable pursuant to this agreement.southeast claims that prime used its control of to cause this default.comp.according to southeast,had the net worth requirement been fulfilled,it could have recovered million of its million judgment against.
the district court held that this purported violation of a positive legal duty did not rise to the level of fraud or similar injustice,stating 
t he court disagrees with southeast characterization that was insufficiently capitalized,as the complaint alleges that the hotels operated with sufficient capital and revenues until the date of breach,that and ridgewood were rendered insolvent as a result of the default under the terms of the lease agreement,and the subsequent termination of the lease agreement.complaint at.
nor does the court find that southeast was injured as a result of this undercapitalization.southeast is entitled to retain in retained funds,which would have counted toward net worth calculation had prime assigned those funds to.even if,as southeast alleges,those funds were never formally assigned to,southeast is still entitled to mitigate its damages from breach of the lease agreement by retention of these funds.thus,even accepting southeast allegations as true,the court fails to discern any concrete injury suffered by southeast as a result of undercapitalization.
southeast views the court reasoning as flawed,arguing that,pursuant to of the lease,the retained funds could only be used to satisfy the requirement if such funds were assigned to and,because the complaint does not allege such an assignment,southeast holding of the retained funds therefore does not mitigate the damages caused by violation of the net worth requirement.curiously,southeast further asserts in its appellate brief that it was never paid retained funds of and that t he retained funds,although characterized as a deposit,were in fact a rebate of rent to be paid upon expiration of the lease agreement.
we,however,find the district court reasoning to be sound.first,even accepting as true the allegation that prime caused to breach the lease covenant,we reiterate that allegations pertaining to the mere breach of an underlying contract or undercapitalization,alone,do not warrant piercing the corporate veil in order to hold the parent corporation liable for such breach.mobil oil.at greene hill home,wl,at,failure of a business venture and resulting loss of capital does not constitute gross as that term is used to pierce the corporate veil.southeast does not allege that prime was involved in an elaborate shell game or was otherwise abusing the corporate form to effect a fraud.outokumpu eng g,at.there is no averment that the corporation is a sham and exist s for no other purpose than as a vehicle for fraud.in re sunstates.shareholder,citation omitted.in the present context involving a contract,southeast does not allege that it was misled at the time the lease was executed.indeed,southeast acknowledgment that prime effectively capitalized until the date of the funding the operations of the hotels from july through the termination of the lease and by spending over million of its own money during a period,despite significant losses in the existence of a fraudulent corporate shell game,and there is no allegation that prime was ever unjustly enriched as a result of the hotel operations.thus,the mere alleged breach of the lease covenant does not justify piercing the corporate veil.
second,southeast claim that its receipt of the retained funds does not mitigate the damages caused by alleged breach of the covenant defies the express language of the pertinent lease provisions.the final clause of the provision,states that the parties to the lease expressly understood and agreed that the right to receive the retained funds,if assigned to tenant,may for such purpose be counted as equity at the full amount thereof.section defines retained funds as a cash amount equal to,which was in excess of the annual minimum rent of due under the lease.section further provides that landlord southeast is holding the retained funds as security for the faithful observance and performance by tenant of all the terms,covenants and conditions of this lease,and that southeast may appropriate and apply the entire retained funds or so much thereof as may be necessary to compensate landlord toward the payment of rent or other sums or loss or damage sustained by landlord due to such breach on the part of tenant.these lease provisions clearly provide that the retained funds are to be counted as equity in satisfaction of the covenant.thus,as the district court properly concluded,southeast suffered no concrete injury as a result of alleged.
further,only if no default occurred would any unapplied balance of the retained funds be paid to tenant at the end of the term.lease.obviously,such an uneventful lease term did not occur.thus,any rights that prime or may have had with respect to the retained funds were relinquished when defaulted under the lease.southeast unsupported assertion that the retained funds were never paid to it or held as security for the lease obligations is contrary to the express language of the lease attached to and incorporated into southeast own complaint.
we therefore conclude that southeast has not alleged extraordinary circumstances that would warrant piercing corporate veil in order to hold prime liable for its subsidiary breach of the lease.in so holding,we underscore that this is a consensual contract setting in which sophisticated parties negotiated and entered into the lease with full knowledge of its terms.prime limited guaranty of the lease equal to one year base rent,contained in of the original purchase agreement,was struck from the amended purchase agreement executed contemporaneously with the lease.it is readily apparent that,in lieu of such a guaranty,obligations under the lease were to be secured by the retained funds held by southeast,as well as by the hotels personal property.
under similar circumstances,courts have been justifiably hesitant to pierce the corporate veil and hold a parent company liable for the breach of a commercial lease by its subsidiary or affiliate where the parent did not guarantee the tenant performance.see generally fletcher cyc.priv.see also telecom int l,v.at t,cir affirming summary judgment and holding that plaintiff has no grounds to pierce parent corporate veil where parent wanted to limit its potential losses by creating subsidiary as a separate entity with only as much capital as needed,declined to enter into any agreement with plaintiff or to guarantee subsidiary obligations to plaintiff under the agreements subsidiary signed schlater,at disallowing claim to pierce corporate veil where p laintiff only complaint is that he was unable to collect delinquent rent under a lease with a corporation which became insolvent because of unprofitable operations during which all of the corporation assets had been pledged to a bank to obtain operating funds.this,standing alone,is insufficient to establish liability for the debt against officers,stockholders,or the corporation which was permitted by the bank to use some of the mortgaged assets in an effort to pay the debt from profits of an operation which also proved unprofitable and where t here is no evidence that plaintiff was misled at the time the lease was executed.racquetball investors,at dismissing alter ego claim and emphasizing that it was not alleged or shown that at the time of the creation of lease there was any ground to believe that plaintiff was in reality dea
