plaintiff bruce roemmich brought an action against defendants eagle eye development,llc eagle eye,leland bertsch,jane bertsch,and jon wagner,alleging various violations of his rights as an eagle eye minority shareholder.he now appeals the district court partial grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants on their statute of limitations defense,as well as the district court resolution of most of the issues against him following a bench trial.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm.
background 
in early,leland and jane bertsch,husband and wife,began to bid on projects to construct and lease three post office buildings to the united states postal service usps,one in minnesota and the other two in cocoa beach and mims,florida.during the spring of,after leland secured the bids on the florida projects,the bertschs and jane brother,roemmich,agreed that roemmich would oversee the construction and development of the florida projects in exchange for a percent ownership interest in those projects,as well as a per week salary.
the bertschs formed eagle eye on june.according to the member control agreement signed on that date,leland made a percent capital contribution and therefore retained a percent financial and voting interest.jane made the remaining contribution and retained a percent financial and voting interest in eagle eye.shortly thereafter,on june,jane assigned her interest in eagle eye to roemmich.leland also conveyed a percent ownership interest to roemmich for value added,namely,the current and future performance of his job duties,resulting in percent ownership by leland and percent ownership by roemmich.roemmich also became a secretary,treasurer,and governor of eagle eye.later that year,the parties agreed to name wagner as secretary of eagle eye in place of roemmich.
around this time,roemmich was aware that eagle eye planned to rely on another of the bertschs companies,bertsch construction,bertsch construction to provide support services including accounting,secretarial support,and office space and equipment.further,although it is undisputed that leland told roemmich that he had made arrangements for interim financing,leland never represented that he would cover costs beyond what was originally contemplated as being necessary for financing the projects.financing became an issue for the cocoa beach project when the city refused to approve initial plans submitted by the usps,resulting in project delays and change orders that drove up the cost.as a result,the berstchs and roemmich secured additional financing through personal loans,which were eventually satisfied.these financial difficulties contributed to roemmich decision to leave the florida projects in june of.
when roemmich left florida,physical construction of the mims site was virtually complete,and the usps was scheduled to conduct a inspection the following week.the cocoa beach project was about a month behind the mims project,and required further construction,resolution of claims with contractors,preparation and negotiation of change orders with the usps,and amendment of the lease agreement.after roemmich left,leland hired donald haynes,the contractor of record for both the mims and cocoa beach projects,to complete roemmich tasks.
although relations between roemmich and the other officers of eagle eye had already begun to decline prior to roemmich decision to leave florida,they dropped precipitously after that point.during a june,meeting,roemmich became upset with wagner and physically and verbally threatened him.after the june meeting,leland scheduled a special meeting of the members,board of governors,and officers of eagle eye concerning the removal and election of governors and officers.that meeting was held on june.because roemmich did not attend the meeting in person,or through his attorney,leland was the only member in attendance.as a percent shareholder,he removed roemmich as governor,and appointed jane as roemmich replacement.the bertschs,in their capacity as governors,then removed roemmich as treasurer,although roemmich remained the executive vice president and retained his ownership interest in eagle eye.
throughout the remainder of,roemmich received eagle eye financial statements.in late november,roemmich began expressing his view that leland and eagle eye were committing fraud,tax violations,and other criminal conduct.roemmich contacted eagle eye bank,suggesting that litigation would be imminent if the bank did not place a freeze on eagle eye accounts and only allow withdrawals accompanied by his signature.the acrimony carried over to an annual meeting held on may.at that meeting,roemmich had the opportunity to inspect the and financial reports,review mortgage and lease information concerning the post office properties,and ask about certain payables and compensation to leland.the parties again squabbled over roemmich threatened legal challenges.
although roemmich was provided with notice of a february,annual meeting,he did not attend.thereafter,the string of meetings came to a stop,and eagle eye documentation of corporate decisionmaking grew sparse.the february,meeting was the last members meeting held,and there has not been a formal meeting of the board of governors since march.aside from repairs occasioned by hurricanes in,the primary activity of eagle eye after has been to collect rents,pay bills,file tax returns,and perform necessary maintenance and repairs.moreover,starting in,at leland instruction,wagner stopped forwarding any financial information to roemmich,except for schedule tax information forms.although roemmich has the right to request regular and special member meetings under eagle eye operating agreement,he has never exercised it.similarly,since,he has not requested detailed financial information.
in the meantime,several events occurred that anchor roemmich claims of against defendants.in april,eagle eye received from the usps as part of the renegotiation of the cocoa beach lease agreement.most of the money was paid to bertsch construction as reimbursement for various expenses,and roemmich learned about that disbursement at the may,annual meeting.bertsch construction also charged eagle eye approximately percent of project costs to provide support services including accounting and secretarial support.although there is no evidence that the percent management fee was formally approved by eagle eye board of governors or members,roemmich knew of this expenditure by the may,meeting.sometime after roemmich was removed as governor,leland instructed wagner to retroactively compensate him leland for his services beginning in april,at the rate of a week.these payments ended in april,and totaled.roemmich asked about these payments to leland at the may,meeting,and therefore had notice of them.eagle eye also hired bertsch construction to do repair work on the florida project caused by hurricanes that hit the state in,at a rate of a percent markup for profit and percent for overhead expenses.finally,the eagle eye made payments on behalf of the bertschs for eye expenses,although these payments were always credited against payables owed to the bertschs.
based on this conduct,roemmich filed suit against defendants on april,claiming that their actions were unfairly prejudicial,breached fiduciary duties and a duty to act in good faith owed to roemmich in his capacity as a member and minority shareholder,and denied his right to vote as a member of eagle eye.roemmich sought damages,dissenter rights,equitable remedies including a of his share of the llc,and costs and attorney fees.defendants brought a counterclaim based on roemmich decision to leave the florida projects.considering the parties for summary judgment,the district court held that north dakota statute of limitations for tort,contract,and statutory causes of action barred roemmich claims accruing prior to april,as well as defendants counterclaim.it also allowed roemmich suit against defendants in their individual capacity to go forward.see roemmich eagle eye,llc,d.the parties stipulated to a bench trial,which resulted in dismissal of most of roemmich claims.see roemmich eagle eye,llc,wl wl.the district court later awarded attorney fees to defendants,see roemmich eagle eye,llc,wl,a decision which roemmich also appeals.
ii.discussion 
the district court had jurisdiction based on the complete diversity of the parties.see.in diversity cases,we apply the substantive law of the state in which the district court sits.capital union planters bank,na,cir.we therefore look to north dakota law to resolve roemmich claims,and review de novo the district court interpretation of state law.see id.
statute of limitations 
we review de novo the district court grant of partial summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the issue whether roemmich claims accruing prior to april,were barred by the statute of limitations.see angelo iafrate,llc potashnick,cir.summary judgment is only warranted if the evidence,construed in the light most favorable to the party,establishes that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see capital,at.
roemmich contends that the district court erred in treating defendants allegedly wrongful conduct as a series of discrete acts,rather than as a continuing violation.because some of the conduct occurred after april,he argues that none of it is.he argues in the alternative that defendants conduct amounted to a shareholder and,as such,falls under the statute of limitations applicable to claims of relief otherwise not provided for in north dakota statute of limitations chapter.see.we disagree with both contentions.
we must first identify the appropriate statute of limitations for the causes of action roemmich pleads,and then,if necessary,determine whether the underlying acts complained of constitute a continuing wrong,thus tolling the statute of limitations as to those acts that would otherwise be.although roemmich variously describes his action as one for breach of fiduciary duty or,the north dakota supreme court has suggested that they are essentially the same.see schumacher schumacher,noting that a lthough the plaintiffs action is premised upon numerous theories of recovery,including claims of breach of contract,fraud,deceit,and negligence,the gravamen of their action is breach of fiduciary duty by a majority or controlling shareholder of a closely held corporation balvik sylvester,because of the predicament in which minority shareholders in a close corporation are placed by a freeze out situation,courts have analyzed alleged oppressive conduct by those in control in terms of fiduciary duties owed by the majority shareholders to the minority 
the north dakota limited liability company act the act does not establish a limitations period for claims arising thereunder,and,to our knowledge,no reported north dakota case has yet determined the appropriate statute of limitations to apply to a breach of fiduciary duty claim arising under the act.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the district court correctly applied the limitations period laid out in title of the century code,see,rather than the provision.see.first,an action for breach of fiduciary duty falls within the plain language of.that provision requires the following actions to be commenced within six years after the claim for relief has accrued 
an action upon a liability created by statute,other than a penalty or forfeiture,when not otherwise expressly provided.
an action for criminal conversation or for any other injury to the person or rights of another not arising upon contract,when not otherwise expressly provided.
roemmich breach of fiduciary duty claim appears to fall within both of these provisions.he grounds his breach of fiduciary duty claim in the provisions of the act creating both the duty of good faith on the part of defendants,as well as the equitable remedies he seeks.see.further,the act does not expressly provide a separate statute of limitations to govern claims arising thereunder.therefore,his claim meets the requirements of subsection above see brandt,at grounding an action for a in the business corporation act balvik,at tracing the action for or breach of fiduciary duty to a prior version of the business corporation act proscribing oppressive conduct.
an action for breach of fiduciary duty also falls within subsection,because it involves an alleged injury to roemmich not arising from contract,and also not provided for in the alternative by any other provision.although there is no north dakota case on point,the missouri supreme court interpreted a similar provision to encompass breach of fiduciary duty claims.see creative mktg.assocs.v.at t,cir citing,and klemme best.our interpretation is bolstered by the fact that breaches of fiduciary duty are sometimes conceptualized as sounding in tort.see,restatement second of torts cmt.b a fiduciary who commits a breach of his duty as a fiduciary is guilty of tortious conduct to the person for whom he should act.houle low,c orporate freeze out is a tort claim.and roemmich primarily argues that the actions of defendants constituted a continuing tort for the purpose of the statute of limitations.therefore,we conclude that the district court properly applied the statute of limitations to roemmich claims.concomitantly,we conclude that,providing a limitations period for relief not otherwise provided for,is simply inapplicable.
we now turn to the question whether the district court should have applied the continuing wrong doctrine to the conduct established by roemmich at the summary judgment stage.under north dakota law,t he statute of limitations for a continuing tort does not begin to run until the tortious acts cease.beavers walters,citing limitations of actions.a series of wrongs is only continuous for the purposes of this doctrine,however,when no single incident in a chain of tort i ous activity can fairly or realistically be identified as the cause of significant harm.limitations of actions.for this reason,the seventh circuit has recently observed that instead of continuity,the doctrine really focuses on cumulativeness the office of the misnamed doctrine is to allow suit to be delayed until a series of wrongful acts blossoms into an injury on which suit can be brought.limestone dev.village of lemont,cir.a paradigmatic example of such a series of violations is workplace sexual harassment,where t he first instance of a coworker offensive words or actions may be too trivial to count as actionable harassment,but if they continue they may eventually reach that level and then the entire series is actionable.id.in contrast,in cases presenting transactions that are separate,distinct,and could have been challenged by a plaintiff when they occurred,we have found that the continuing wrong doctrine does not apply.hope klabal,cir finding the doctrine inapplicable under minnesota law in an action for fraud based on separate sales of multiple paintings spanning the course of many years davies west publ g,applying a statute of limitations to breach of fiduciary duty claims based on financial distributions from the same fund occurring over a period beginning in.
roemmich has failed to point to any case identifying,or a series of breaches of fiduciary duties,as a continuing wrong.in fact,several decisions have held the opposite.in thorndike thorndike,the new hampshire supreme court considered a claim based on conduct taking place both in and outside of the limitations period.specifically,the plaintiff contended that in,after his brother gained control of management of the family business,his brother,inter alia,added new board members,removed him from his position as director,eliminated his salary,and diluted his voting powers.id.at.based on these events,he filed suit ten years later,in.id.applying a statute of limitations to bar his claims,the court rejected his contention that the continuing wrong doctrine applied,even assuming the following wrongs persisted his brother continued to exclude him from employment continued to deprive him of a salary continued to prevent him from participation in the management of the company and continued to ban him from the premises.id.at.because all of the ongoing harm resulted from decisions made in,the statute of limitations began to run at that time.id.the massachusetts supreme judicial court applied the same reasoning in houle.in that case,a minority shareholder in an ophthalmology practice sued his colleagues and the practice itself after they formed a new surgical center and voted to exclude him from sharing in the opportunity.at.considering his allegation that he was frozen out by the other shareholders,the court simply stated that harm to the plaintiff occurred when he was notified of the decision,and,as such,the statute of limitations barred the cause of action.id.at.
thorndike and houle do not necessarily settle this matter,however,because myriad wrongful acts may trigger a claim,and some could conceivably be continuing wrongs.schumacher,at describing various types of majority shareholder tactics falling under the umbrella of a.many of the wrongful acts described by roemmich occurring prior to april,were separate,distinct,and themselves the cause of significant harm,thus triggering a running of the limitations period roemmich removal as governor in loans made to eagle eye by the bertschs at a percent interest rate as of december,execution of an agreement on january,giving bertsch construction the right to manage eagle eye affairs at a rate of percent profit levying of a construction fee of percent of the total project cost in and payment to leland of a salary during and in each case,continuing harm to roemmich interests was caused by a discrete act that would give rise to a breach of fiduciary duty claim at the time the allegedly wrongful act was committed.
although it is possible that the district court erred in rejecting the continuing wrong doctrine as applied to roemmich claim that defendants engaged in commingling of personal and eagle eye funds,we need not reach that question because roemmich failed to provide any evidence establishing that the conduct occurred after april,therefore,the continuing wrong doctrine would not toll the statute of limitations as to this series of actions.for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that the district court correctly barred recovery based on acts and events occurring before april.
limitations period and the availability of equitable relief 
roemmich contends that the district court erred in barring his claims for equitable relief based on actions occurring outside the limitations period,then turning around and considering,conduct when determining an appropriate remedy under.we review these legal issues de novo.see pritchett cottrell,cir.
as to the first part of roemmich contention,we agree with the district court that the statute of limitations applies to roemmich causes of action,regardless of whether the relief requested is legal or equitable.the north dakota supreme court has previously applied a similar statute of limitations to claims for equitable relief arising out of actions falling within the statute.see diocese of bismarck trust ramada,applying a limitations period for an action upon a contract contained in any conveyance of land to an action seeking reformation of a ground lease.indeed,where a legal and equitable remedy exist for the same cause of action,equity will generally follow the limitations statute.estate of nicolas ocean plaza condo.ass n.to put it simply,parties who sleep on their rights can not resuscitate causes of action by seeking equitable remedies 
although the statute of limitations precludes liability based on stale claims,the act envisions that evidence of conduct from as far back as the beginning of the business relationship might be relevant in fashioning an equitable remedy once liability is established.the act provides 
i n determining whether to order relief under this section and in determining what particular relief to order,the court shall take into consideration the duty that all members in a closely held limited liability company owe one another to act in an honest,fair,and reasonable manner in the operation of the limited liability company and the reasonable expectations of the members as they exist at the inception and develop during the course of the members relationship with the limited liability company and with each other.
based on the language of the statute,the district court correctly allowed both parties to present evidence of events occurring prior to april,for the purpose of crafting a remedy.roemmich fails to point to any,evidence that was either admitted for some improper purpose,such as determining liability or excluded despite its relevance under therefore,the district court did not err in its treatment of,evidence.
district court findings of fact and conclusions of law 
when the district court conducts a bench trial as it did here,we review the district court fact finding for clear error,and we review legal conclusions and mixed questions of law and fact de novo.eckert titan tire,cir.under the clearly erroneous standard,we will overturn a factual finding only if it is not supported by substantial evidence in the record,if it is based on an erroneous view of the law,or if we are left with the definite and firm conviction that an error was made.richardson sugg,cir.
roemmich contends that the district court erred by looking at each alleged violation as a separate act,rather than considering the totality of the conduct and asking whether it constituted a.the record,however,does not support roemmich characterization of the district court decision.it is true that the district court made factual findings regarding each instance of misconduct alleged by roemmich,finding in most instances that the particular acts did not amount to a breach of fiduciary duties.after doing so,however,the district court then considered the totality of defendants,as well as roemmich,conduct,in order to determine whether the conduct amounted to a of the minority,a breach of fiduciary obligations imposed by the act,or an unfair deprivation of roemmich reasonable expectations.see roemmich,wl,at.
for example,the district court found that roemmich had no reasonable expectation of continued employment beyond the development of the florida projects,and that his abandonment of those projects justified the cessation of his salary he had no reasonable expectation of immediate or regular financial distributions the bertschs did not engage in improper and that he never had a reasonable expectation of an equal say in the decisionmaking of eagle eye.id.at.further,the district court found that although there was a mutual understanding that roemmich would be actively involved in managing eagle eye,and that he had a reasonable expectation that he would be provided with eagle eye financial information,his own inequitable conduct justified his removal as governor.id.at.
the district court order provides ample indication that the court considered the totality of the conduct.moreover,we are unaware of case law prohibiting the district court from first ascertaining what happened in given instances before drawing conclusions about their cumulative effect.in fact,the case law suggests that the district court proceeded properly.see,brandt,at describing a trial court separate analysis of various claims allegedly giving rise to a general action balvik,at noting various incidents found by the trial court justifying its conclusion that the defendant cumulative actions were oppressive under a former version of the business corporation act.
roemmich also contends that the district court findings of fact are contrary to the weight of the evidence presented at trial.however,the trial transcripts and exhibits indicate at least some support for every challenged material finding.because we must give ample regard to the district court credibility determinations,as well as its choice between two permissible views of the evidence,we hold that the district court findings of fact were not clearly erroneous.see richardson,at.
attorney fees and expenses 
roemmich appeals the district court decision to award defendants reasonable expenses,including attorney fees,under of the act.the act provides that i f a court finds that a party to a proceeding brought under this section has acted arbitrarily,vexatiously,or otherwise no
