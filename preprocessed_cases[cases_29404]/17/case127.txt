opinion of the court 
in,campbell soup incorporated a subsidiary,vlasic foods international,and sold it several food companies in exchange for borrowed cash.then it issued the subsidiary stock to campbell shareholders as an dividend,making vfi an independent company.within three years of this transaction,vfi filed for bankruptcy and sold the food companies for less than it had paid for them.vfi has since reorganized into the bankruptcy creature vfb,llc,and acting on behalf of vfi disappointed creditors claims that the transaction was a constructively fraudulent transfer and that campbell aided a breach of fiduciary duty by vfi directors.the district court,wl,entered judgment for campbell after a bench trial.vfb appeals both from the judgment and from the district court decision to strike a motion to amend the judgment.we affirm.
background 
in,campbell soup campbell decided to improve its stock price by disposing of certain underperforming subsidiaries and product lines,the largest and most prominent of the lot being vlasic,of pickle fame,and swanson,the tv dinner manufacturer.the companies in question were eventually organized into what campbell called its specialty foods division we will refer to the companies by that name or as the division.the division companies were not highly regarded within campbell.one consultant urged that all the relevant businesses other than vlasic and swanson had basically no growth potential and should be managed strictly for cash.op.at.vlasic and swanson were both troubled,but they were historically strong brands that,it was thought,might be turned around under new management.op.at.
campbell decided the best way to dispose of the division would be through a leveraged spin transaction.campbell would incorporate a new subsidiary and the subsidiary would take on bank debt in order to purchase the division then campbell would give the stock in the subsidiary to campbell shareholders as an dividend.campbell would remove underperforming businesses from its balance sheet and get cash campbell shareholders would own roughly the same assets as before,albeit in different corporate packages 
the terms of the spin were negotiated between campbell and a group of campbell employees who sought to manage the new subsidiary,named vlasic foods international,vfi,after the spin.campbell declared several basic terms of the agreement,among them the businesses to be transferred to vfi and vfi initial debt level that is,how much it would pay campbell for the division.the future vfi managers later testified that campbell did not give them the resources they needed to properly research the transaction.the resulting bargain contained various additional terms unfavorable to vfi.
the deal closed on march.on vfi end,the spin was approved by vfi directors,also major campbell officers,who understood their sole task to be approving the spin and resigning.they did not investigate the deal and made no effort to protect vfi interests as against campbell.
the district court called the bargain struck in the spin particularly hard for vfi,but further concluded that it was even harder than the public knew at the time.for two years before the spin,campbell massaged the specialty foods division operating results,ostensibly misleading the public about its operating record and prospects.the spin took place midway through campbell fiscal year division managers used a number of techniques in and to increase short term sales and earnings and to secure salary bonuses tied to meeting operating targets.but none of the techniques changed the companies prospects.for instance,vfb focuses on product loading as the chief tool used to prop up sales and earnings.this term refers to using bulk discounts and other promotional tools to encourage retailers to increase their inventory.while this technique increases sales in the short term,there is a corresponding decrease in sales in a later period as retailers allow their inventories to decline to normal levels.product loading and similar tactics in and early left vfi facing an imminent corrective decrease in its sales and earnings at the time of the spin.
vfb now urges and campbell does not argue the point that because of these tactics,campbell sec disclosures in the years leading up to the spin,and in particular the and earnings figures on the form sec filing describing the spin transaction itself,were unreliable.op.at.the filings misled not only the public securities markets,but also the banks providing the leverage for the transaction,which did not independently investigate the performance of the specialty foods division but instead relied heavily on pro forma financial statements and projections supplied by campbell.op.at.
after the spin,the specialty foods division inflated sales and earnings figures quickly corrected themselves.by june,vfi had lowered its earnings estimates from million to million.vfi feared that this would soon lead to a default of its loan agreement with the banks,so it sought to renegotiate the agreement.the banks,after thoroughly examining vfi finances,agreed to a new loan agreement on september.among other things,the agreement required vfi to reduce the banks exposure by issuing new bonds contractually subordinated to the bank debt.
despite these very public problems,vfi did not fold.the price of its shares on the new york stock exchange remained essentially steady.indeed,vfi outperformed the s p food index from the time of the spin,march,through january.op.at.more than a year after the spin,in june,vfi successfully completed its required issue of million in unsecured debt to institutional investors,despite disclosing discouraging financial data for the first nine months of,declining sales,limited advertising and product innovation,and other worrisome news.op.at.vfi market capitalization never dropped below billion until january.
while vfi did not suddenly collapse,it nonetheless slowly declined,presumably because of basic problems in its business declining sales,for example,a problem shared by most food companies during the period in question.op.at.vfi managers had hoped to reinvigorate the vlasic and swanson brands with aggressive advertising and expansion campaigns,but they lacked the cash for such an ambitious project after renegotiating vfi loan agreement with the banks.vfi needed all its available cash to service its debt.op.at.
in january,vfi discovered that it had underestimated its accrued trade spending in and is,its salesmen had granted discounts to various bulk purchasers throughout,but although ended in september,vfi did not accurately calculate the effect of those discounts until january.the discovery drove down vfi earnings,triggered a default under the new loan agreement and sent the public price of vfi unsecured debt below par value.op.at.one year later,vfi filed for bankruptcy.op.at.
vfi sold off the former specialty foods division piecemeal both before and during bankruptcy,in a period from roughly january to may.these sales brought in million,which discounts back to million at the time of the spin,million less than vfi paid for the division at that time.
vfi assigned all of its legal claims against campbell to the plaintiff vfb,llc,a delaware limited liability company whose members are vfi impaired creditors.the banks are not members they have already been made whole because of security interests and other protection granted by the renegotiated loan agreement.vfb members are the holders of the unsecured bonds issued in,the landlord of vfi headquarters and certain of vfi employees and trade creditors.vfb then brought the present action against campbell,seeking to set aside the spin as a constructively fraudulent transfer and claiming that campbell aided and abetted a breach of vfi directors duty of loyalty to vfi.
the district court held a lengthy bench trial.the chief factual dispute concerned the value of the specialty foods division on march,and specifically whether it was worth the million vfi paid for it.the parties offered three chief types of evidence on this point.first,there was the price of vfi publicly traded stock and bonds.the million outstanding shares of vfi stock traded at on the new york stock exchange at the close of trading on march.this put vfi equity market capitalization at billion,which,considering vfi million debt obligation,put the value of the specialty foods division at billion.vfb argued that the market price reflected the misleadingly high earnings figures in campbell sec reports rather than the true value of the division,but the district court noted that vfi market capitalization did not even drop below billion until,despite the market quickly learning the truth about vfi earnings prospects in.
second,the parties submitted various valuations of the specialty foods division and vfi,prepared before and after the spin for use by campbell and vfi.the estimated values of the division businesses were uniformly above million.
third and finally,the parties hired economic expert witnesses and had them estimate the value of the division.campbell presented timothy leuhrman,who estimated vfi value by comparing it to that of six other companies he considered comparable to vfi he guessed that the division businesses were worth billion at the time of the spin.vfb called three experts.henry owsley,comparing vfi to a different set of companies and performing a discounted cash flow analysis,estimated the division worth at million and million,respectively.sheridan titman and greg hallman performed a discounted cash flow analysis that produced a value for the division of million.
the district court concluded that the specialty foods division was worth well in excess of the million vfi paid for it on march.it relied primarily on the price of vfi stock,reasoning that as private traders seek to pay no more for an asset and sell an asset for no less than it is worth,the market price was a rational valuation of vfi in light of all the information available to market participants.although the price was infected by campbell manipulation of the division earnings at the time of the spin,vfi stock price remained high even after the truth about vfi prospects had been fully exposed.the district court concluded that the market capitalization was based on an accurate picture of vfi position as of march,indicating a value of well over million at that time.
the district court also addressed the expert witnesses valuations in some detail,finding leuhrman analysis convincing and owsley,titman and hallman analyses flawed,primarily due to hindsight bias,that is,their use of assumptions about vfi that were not shared by the informed public markets at the time of and after the spin.op.at.but basically the district court regarded the hired expert valuations as a to the disinterested evidence of vfi capitalization in one of the most efficient capital markets in the world 
vfb does not even attempt to show any market valuation of vfi contemporaneous with the that is anywhere close to the figures urged by vfb experts.there is simply no credible evidence to justify setting aside vfi stock price and the other contemporaneous market evidence of vfi worth.even if,as vfb implies,the market was suffering from some irrational exuberance in establishing vfi stock price,that gives me no basis for the value that was fairly established in open and informed trading.op.at.
in light of that conclusion,the court determined both that the spin was not a fraudulent transfer and that,because vfi had been solvent at the time of the spin,it owed no fiduciary duty to future creditors of vfi.
in the district court,campbell also brought certain bankruptcy claims against vfb successor in interest to vfi.vfb asked the court to disallow the claims because campbell did not offer any proof for them,but the court held that once campbell had submitted a facially valid claim,the burden fell to vfb to offer some evidence to rebut it.vfb had offered no such evidence into the record,so the district court allowed the claim.vfb then moved to amend the judgment under bankruptcy rule,which motion the district court struck as untimely.
ii.discussion 
vfb appeals from the district court judgment and the striking of its motion to amend the judgment.we review the district court legal determinations de novo,jean alexander cosmetics,usa,cir,but its findings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous.a in re fruehauf trailer,cir.
constructive fraudulent transfer 
vfb seeks to set aside the spin as a fraudulent transfer.the parties do not dispute whether vfb,as vfi successor,has the right to avoid any transfer of an interest of vfi in property or any obligation incurred by vfi that is avoidable under applicable law by a creditor holding an unsecured claim that is allowable.b.
both parties agree that new jersey law applies.under new jersey version of the uniform fraudulent transfer act 
a transfer made or obligation incurred by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor whose claim arose before the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred if the debtor made the transfer or incurred the obligation without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer or obligation and the debtor was insolvent at that time or the debtor became insolvent as a result of the transfer or obligation.stat.ann.a.
alternatively 
a transfer made or obligation incurred by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor,whether the creditor claim arose before or after the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred,if the debtor made the transfer or incurred the obligation w ithout receiving reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer or obligation,and the debtor 
was engaged or was about to engage in a business or a transaction for which the remaining assets of the debtor were unreasonably small in relation to the business or transaction or 
intended to incur,or believed or reasonably should have believed that the debtor would incur,debts beyond the debtor ability to pay as they become due.
to succeed under either of these provisions,vfb must at least show that the specialty foods division was not reasonably equivalent value for the million provided to campbell.the district court concluded that it was reasonably equivalent.new jersey law does not offer a universal definition of reasonably equivalent value,stat.ann.b addressing foreclosure sales,and neither does the case law,see,flood caro.this is probably as it should be,since reasonably equivalent value is not an esoteric concept a party receives reasonably equivalent value for what it gives up if it gets roughly the value it gave.in re fruehauf trailer,cir mellon bank,metro,cir.we think the new jersey supreme court would agree with the common sense approach we have used to determine reasonably equivalent value under the bankruptcy code similar fraudulent transfer provision,a b i.fruehauf trailer,at see also highlands ins.hobbs group,llc,cir w here the state highest court has not spoken definitively on a particular issue,the federal court must make an informed prediction as to how the highest state court would decide the issue.
clearly the division and vfi cash were both valuable assets,but was the division worth roughly the million that vfi paid for it in a meticulous and opinion the district court concluded that it was,reasoning primarily that in light of vfi billion market capitalization nine months after the spin,the division businesses were worth indeed far more than million.because the court focused on vfi market capitalization as evidence of its value,vfb now concentrates on attacking this approach.
some portions of vfb brief seem to argue that courts should never measure the value of a business by its market capitalization because the market price of a corporation stock is based on expectations projections of future income,which may turn out to be inaccurate.reply br.for appellant at.that contention is clearly wrong.equity markets allow participants to voluntarily take on or transfer among themselves the risk that their projections will be inaccurate fraudulent transfer law can not rationally be invoked to undermine that function.in re,cir presumably the creditors want a debtor to take some risks that could generate value.true,earnings projections must be tested by an objective standard anchored in a company actual performance,but such a test applies to information about a company performance available when the projection is made.moody security pacific bus.credit,cir.market capitalization is a classic example of such an anchored projection,as it reflects all the information that is publicly available about a company at the relevant time of valuation.basic levinson,d plurality peil speiser,cir.a company actual subsequent performance is something to consider when determining ex post the reasonableness of a valuation,see moody,at,but it is not,by definition,the basis of a substitute benchmark,at criticizing t he use of hindsight to evaluate a debtor financial condition.
we therefore move on to vfb chief argument,that the district court erred in holding that vfi market capitalization measured the value of its assets because campbell manipulated the specialty foods division sales and earnings prior to the spin the value of a business is a mixed question of fact and law,with the underlying factual findings reviewed for clear error and the court choice of legal precepts and application of those precepts to the facts reviewed de novo.in re fruehauf trailer,cir,at mellon bank,metro communications,cir.
vfb argues that whether vfi market capitalization reflected its value is a purely legal question because it concerns the proper method of valuation of vfi businesses,and should therefore be reviewed de novo,citing amerada hess commissioner of internal revenue,cir.vfb misreads amerada hess.we held in that case that the proper method of valuation in a particular factual context is a legal question.id.citing richardson commr.of internal revenue,cir see also moody security pacific bus.credit,cir.but the factual context is,naturally enough,a question of fact,and it is the context that the parties dispute in the present case.all agree that if the market capitalization was inflated by campbell manipulations it was not good evidence of value the question is whether it was so inflated.we review the court resolution of that question for clear error.see moody,at amerada hess,at.
were the market capitalization numbers on which the district court relied inflated vfb often attempts to confuse the nature of the district court reasoning on this point,for instance by stating that the court relied on vfi market capitalization at the time of the spin despite finding that investors were at that time misled by campbell manipulation.br.of appellant at.that is not what the court did.it explicitly chose not to rely on vfi market capitalization at the time of the spin,precisely because of campbell manipulation,and instead looked at market capitalization several months later,when the truth of vfi situation had become clear.op.at.nobody contends that vfi was worth more in september than at the end of march.consequently,if vfi september market capitalization reflected a value for the division businesses of at least million,despite no longer being affected by campbell operations,then the division must have been worth more than million at the time of the spin.
vfb fraudulent conveyance claim therefore fails unless vfb can show that the district court clearly erred in concluding that the market price of vfi stocks and bonds were no longer affected by campbell manipulations as of september,an issue that vfb seems reluctant to squarely address.its only argument is to point out that in january,during vfi,vfi discovered a million underestimation of trade spending that,when figured into earnings,triggered a default under vfi new loan agreement and caused its unsecured debt to trade below par value.vfb urges that this demonstrates that vfi was in fact insolvent in,when the underestimated trade spending was actually occurring.
this argument shows that vfi was insolvent in if the bondholders thought vfi solvent,they would have sold their debt so cheaply.this argument might also suggest that vfi was insolvent in,although that conclusion is speculative.additional trade spending alone might not have been enough to render vfi unable to pay its debts declining sales or some other worsening aspect of vfi condition between and might have contributed.
but what the argument clearly does not show is that vfi was insolvent in,at the time of the spin.even if the bondholders were unaware of the current state of vfi when trading bonds at par value in,they were still aware of everything campbell reportedly concealed about the specialty foods division prior to the spin.vfb cites to testimony indicating that some of the underestimated trade spending may have occurred before app.at,but it makes no effort to quantify how much,and both the evidence and the arguments suggest that the lion share occurred in see,app.at.again,nobody claims that vfi fortunes were improving,so the market valuation of vfi as solvent in was strong evidence that vfi was solvent at the time of the spin,and therefore received reasonably equivalent value for its million.
vfb makes additional arguments concerning its expert witnesses valuations,urging that it was clear error to dismiss them in favor of the market figures,but we do not think that the district court erred in choosing to rely on the objective evidence from the public equity and debt markets.to the extent that the experts purport to measure actual performance,as by,for example,discounted cash flow analysis,they are measuring the wrong thing.to the extent they purport to reconstruct a reasonable valuation of the company in light of uncertain future performance,they are using inapt tools.kool,mann,coffee coffey,cir noting that discounted cash flow analyses are imprecise and have value only in certain limited situations.absent some reason to distrust it,the market price is a more reliable measure of the stock value than the subjective estimates of one or two expert witnesses.in re prince,cir see also in re hechinger investment of,peltz hatten,metlyn realty esmark,cir t he price of stock in a liquid market is presumptively the one to use in judicial proceedings.
vfb has consequently not shown clear error in the district court finding that the specialty foods division was worth far more than its million in debt acquired at the time of the spin.we stress that,given the arguments vfb has made,the question is not even close.valuing an asset is a difficult task that depends upon detailed factual determinations,which may be overturned only if they are completely devoid of a credible evidentiary basis or bear no rational relationship to the supporting data.in re fruehauf trailer,cir quoting citicorp venture capital,comm.of creditors,cir.where the asset being valued is a speculative investment,a trial court factual determinations will be largely immune from attack on appeal.in re,cir.
for its appeal to succeed,vfb must show that on march,the specialty foods division was clearly worth less than million.yet it never engages with the relevant numbers in any detail,explaining by how much campbell various manipulation techniques affected its statistics,or by how much the statistical inflation affected vfi market capitalization.its approach is simply to note that campbell played with its operations and suggest that the market capitalization numbers may have been wrong to some undetermined degree.
they may have been,but only to the extent that the market was in the dark about the division operational prospects.vfb theory is that the potential for new management to turn around vlasic and swanson slow slide depended on ready access to sufficient capital to launch programs,and that in light of the early renegotiation of vfi loan agreement campbell never gave it a reasonable chance of having access to that capital,dooming it to eventual insolvency and bankruptcy.but the participants in the equity market were familiar with vfi business plan,knew about the renegotiated loan agreement and the likely trouble vfi would have getting access to capital,and still nonetheless valued the company at well more than million,apparently concluding that the company chances of success were good.vfb arguments may create some very meager doubt,but the district court task is to resolve doubts
