this dispute originated when gary electric service company gary electric violated a collective bargaining agreement cba fringe benefit provisions and then failed to honor a request for information from electrical worker pension trust fund of local union,international brotherhood of electrical workers,et the funds regarding the performance of gary electric representational duties.the funds first filed a grievance with the committee lmc based on gary electric failure to pay fringe benefits,requesting that the lmc enter an arbitration award ordering gary electric to file reports,pay contributions,and thereafter file and pay contributions as they became due.after the lmc entered the award,the funds filed an action in district court to secure gary electric compliance with the terms of the award.upon the funds motion,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the funds.when gary electric appealed,the appeal was consolidated with a national labor relations board nlrb petition seeking enforcement of an nlrb order finding that gary electric engaged in unfair labor practices.a panel of this court affirmed the district court decision and enforced the nlrb order.see workers local pension trust fund gary serv,cir.
thereafter,the funds brought contempt proceedings in the district court against gary electric and its owner,russell gary pipia pipia,alleging that they continually violated the terms of the arbitration award.the district court held a hearing and granted the contempt petition as to gary electric but denied it as to pipia.the district court explained that,among other reasons,pipia could not be held in contempt because he was not an actual defendant in the action.the funds then brought this appeal from the portion of the court order denying the contempt petition as to pipia.we vacate the decision of the district court and remand for additional proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
gary electric,a michigan corporation wholly owned by pipia,was a small electrical service company with primarily residential and customers.in,and again in,gary electric signed a letter of assent authorizing the southeastern michigan chapter of the national electrical contractors association neca to be its representative for all business matters between neca and the international brotherhood of electrical workers local union the union through its representative,neca,gary electric entered into a binding cba with the union.this cba required participating employers to pay their employees fringe,vacation,unemployment,annuity,and the funds.
on august,in accordance with the terms of the cba,the funds made a demand to the lmc for arbitration of their grievance,charging that gary electric failed to make its contractual payments into the funds and failed to submit the required fringe benefit reports.a hearing before the lmc was set for august,and gary electric was given notice.on august,the lmc found gary electric guilty of the charges in the grievance and ordered gary electric to pay the fringe benefit payments,produce the reports,and make future payments when due an additional award from the lmc,also dated august,found gary electric guilty of failing to secure a surety bond as required by the cba.
almost two months later,after gary electric failed to comply with the lmc awards,the funds filed a complaint in district court requesting that the court enter a judgment enforcing the lmc awards.on may,the district court granted the funds motion for summary judgment,and gary electric immediately filed an appeal a panel of this court heard the consolidated appeal on august,and issued an opinion on september,enforcing the nlrb order and affirming the district court grant of summary judgment for the funds.see workers local pension trust fund,at.
while gary electric appeal was pending the funds initiated contempt proceedings in district court against gary electric and pipia for failing to adhere to the district court orders to pay contributions,disclose fringe benefit reports,adhere to the rules in the cba for future contributions and reports,secure a surety bond,and pay the funds their costs and attorney fees a november,order of the district court temporarily disposed of the funds petition for contempt by ordering gary electric to produce,within one month,the fringe benefit reports from june through the present date and pipia to submit to a deposition within two months.the district court postponed its rulings on the other issues contained in the funds petition for contempt.
the instant appeal began when the funds reinitiated the deferred portions of their contempt petition against both gary electric and pipia in their motion for rehearing filed on december,the funds alleged that gary electric,with total disregard for this court decision,chose not to comply with the district court did not make delinquent payments,produce all the necessary fringe benefit reports make prospective payments as they became due,or comply with the bond award.according to the affidavit of a funds employee responsible for monitoring participating employers payments to the funds,from the district court judgment enforcing the lmc awards in may until october,fringe benefit contributions owed by gary electric amounted to,in the motion,the funds also allege that pipia began to waste the corporate asserts in an effort to avoid making the payments.according to the funds,pipia starting stripping the corporation of its assets after the nlrb and the funds initiated proceedings against it in late and early.appellants br.at.the evidence supporting the funds position that pipia flagrantly and deliberately disregarded the court judgment includes pipia more than tripling his gary electric salary within two years,pipia receipt of large bonuses and loans from gary electric,pipia use of funds from a corporate account to purchase a fur coat for his wife which he later claimed as a bonus,and pipia directives to pay in full every creditor except for the debt owed the funds.
at the motion hearing,the funds requested that pipia be ordered to purge himself of contempt by requiring him to pay to the funds the sum of a hundred thousand twelve dollars and cents,that being the amount of indebtedness that accrued after pipia was ordered to comply with the fringe benefit provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.at tr.of mot.hr g.ultimately,the district court granted the contempt petition with respect to gary electric,but denied it without prejudice with respect to pipia.the district court stated 
i will at this time enter an order finding the corporation in contempt of the order,the injunctive order of this court because it failed to do what it was ordered to do.i am unable to do that with pipia because although you have told me many very reprehensible things that he has done,there are no proofs of that on this record and he was not a defendant in this case and he was not ordered specifically to do anything other than give a deposition which he did do.

corporate officers can be held in contempt 
when a court seeks to enforce its order or supervise its judgment,one weapon in its arsenal is contempt of court.see nlrb cincinnati bronze,cir.recognizing that the power to punish for contempts should not be used lightly,the supreme court has stated that this power is a necessary and integral part of the independence of the judiciary,and is absolutely essential to the performance of the duties imposed on them by law.without it they are mere boards of arbitration,whose judgments and decrees would be only advisory.gompers buck stove range.contempt proceedings enforce the message that court orders and judgments are to be complied with in a prompt manner.cincinnati bronze,at.with respect to civil contempt proceedings,j udicial sanctions may,in a proper case,be employed for either or both of two purposes to coerce the defendant into compliance with the court order,and to compensate the complainant for losses sustained.united states united mine workers of.

in the present case,the funds petitioned for a contempt order against both gary electric and its principal officer and owner,pipia.the district court granted the motion for gary electric but denied the motion for pipia.the district court identified three reasons for dismissing the contempt motion with respect to pipia.first,the district court noted that pipia could not be held in contempt because he was not a defendant in the lawsuit.second,the court focused on the terms of the original order and stated that the only act pipia was specifically and individually ordered to do was to submit to a deposition and that he complied in full.third,the district court reasoned that although the funds identified pipia many reprehensible acts,there were no proofs of that on the record.at tr.of mot.hr g.in order to reverse the district court,we must find that the district court abused its discretion in that it either made clearly erroneous findings of fact,improperly applied the controlling law,or used the incorrect legal standard in dismissing the petition as to pipia.blue cross blue shield mut.of ohio,at.
the funds carry the initial burden to show contempt.that is,the funds must come forward with clear and convincing evidence showing that pipia violate d a definite and specific order of the court requiring him to perform or refrain from performing a particular act or acts with knowledge of the court order.cincinnati bronze,at quotation omitted.thus,an initial issue we must resolve is whether an unnamed party can be subject to a court order,whether a court order directed to a corporation ever could reach out to bind a,such as a corporate officer.the answer is clearly established in both this circuit and the supreme court.
many decades ago,in a case where a corporate officer who failed to comply with a subpoena duces tecum was held in contempt,the supreme court stated 
a command to the corporation is in effect a command to those who are officially responsible for the conduct of its affairs.if they,apprised of the writ directed to the corporation,prevent compliance or fail to take appropriate action within their power for the performance of the corporate duty,they,no less than the corporation itself,are guilty of disobedience,and may be punished for contempt.

other circuits have reasoned similarly.the eighth circuit in chicago truck drivers.labor leasing,cir,was faced with a case strikingly similar to the one presented on this appeal.in chicago truck drivers,a union pension fund and its trustees sued corporations for interim payments of withdrawal liability under erisa.id.at.the district court granted summary judgment in the union pension fund favor and ordered the commencement of payments.see id.amended judgments followed,ordering further payments but b oth the initial and amended judgments contained no reference to either the corporations sole officer and shareholder specifically or the corporations officers or other agents generically.id.when the union pension fund never received any of the payments,the fund filed a motion for contempt against both the corporations and their sole owner and shareholder in his personal capacity.id.the union pension fund rested its case after it presented evidence that no payments had been made although the payments were due and that at the time the payments became due,the corporate entities had the resources to pay.see id.at.the district court denied the motion for contempt stating that the union pension fund failed to produce evidence sufficient for a finding that the defendants have assets for making the judgment debt payments but did not do so.id.
on appeal,the eighth circuit remanded the case to the district court,stating that the district court abused its discretion by shifting the burden to the union pension fund to show that the corporation had the present ability to pay and by failing to make any specific findings as to whether the defendant officer committed acts that might support a contempt finding against him personally.id.at.in addition,the court of appeals instructed the district court on remand to make specific findings with respect to whether the parties satisfied their burdens.id.at.the court further noted that although a contempt finding against the corporations likely would not serve any useful purpose,since it appears they no longer have any assets,the union pension fund is entitled to further development of the record concerning the dissipation of the corporations assets,and an express finding from the court that the corporations have satisfied their burden on an defense.id.at.
the eighth circuit noted that although the supreme court in rylander stated that a present inability to comply is a defense to civil contempt,some circuits have refined that statement requiring that an alleged contemnor,asserting inability to pay,establish that they were unable to comply,explaining why categorically and in detail that their inability to comply was not and that they made in good faith all reasonable efforts to comply.chicago truck drivers,at quotations omitted.regarding the assertion that the defendant officer could be held in contempt individually,the eighth circuit compared the case before it to injunctions under federal rule of civil procedure d because the supreme court liberally applied rule d to any equitable decree compelling obedience under the threat of contempt including not only injunctions but also enforcement orders and affirmative decrees,the eighth circuit determined that a corporate officer can be bound by a court payment orders even when the orders make no specific reference to him.chicago truck drivers,at quoting int l longshoremen ass philadelphia marine trade ass n,d.thus,while a district court order setting a pay schedule may or may not be classified as an injunction,it nevertheless can be treated as one when it compel s affirmative,prospective obedience with it.id.
in the case before us,the district court order only referred to gary electric and did not mention its agents,officers,or owners at all.but,as is evident from the supreme court in wilson and our opinion in hochschild,whether or not pipia was a named defendant in the order,or even mentioned at all,is not controlling.see wilson,at.hochschild,at.pipia,as an officer of the corporation and the one responsible for the corporation affairs,was subject to the court order just as the corporation itself was.see chicago truck drivers,at.because pipia either prevent ed compliance or fail ed to take appropriate action within his power for the performance of the corporate duty,the district court had the authority to hold pipia in contempt.wilson,at.the funds only needed to show that gary electric did not comply with the district court judgment in order to meet their burden.that said,the funds met their initial burden for a contempt finding against pipia when they presented to the district court the previous order of the court affirming the lmc awards and pipia own deposition testimony admitting that he knew of the court order yet failed to observe it see,chicago truck drivers,at here,it is undisputed that the corporations have not made any payments pursuant to the court order.at that point,the burden should have shifted to the corporations to show an inability to comply.the funds presented clear and convincing,pipia,the sole owner and officer of gary electric,with knowledge of the court order,chose to violate the court order by not making the required contributions to the funds.cincinnati bronze,at quotation omitted.moreover,the district court order was in effect because gary electric did not file a supersedeas bond and because gary electric did not obtain a stay of the district court judgment pending appeal.thus,because pipia is bound by the district court order directed at gary electric and because the funds presented evidence that no payments had been made although the payments were due,the district court improperly dismissed the petition to hold pipia in contempt.
once the funds establish their prima facie case,the burden of production shifts to pipia,who may defend against an order of contempt by producing evidence to show that he is presently unable to comply with the court order.see rylander,at.however,as we stated previously,some courts have narrowed rylander by requiring either that the contemnor prove in great detail his inability to pay,show that he did not cause the inability,or prove that he unsuccessfully attempted compliance in good faith.see chicago truck drivers,at.we previously have required a contemnor to show categorically and in detail why he or she is unable to comply with the court order.rolex watch,at.we also have evaluated whether the defendant took all reasonable steps within his power to comply with the court order.peppers,at.until now,however,we have never decided whether we embrace the refinement on rylander that requires the contemnor to show that his present inability to comply is not his own fault or the result of inability.nor have we decided previously whether we would sanction the wrongdoer.today we choose to follow the lead of the eighth circuit and hold that the rylander present inability to comply defense to civil contempt requires that the contemnor show that he is not responsible for the present inability to pay if the contemnor can not make this showing,then the rylander defense is unavailable.thus,taking our cues from the supreme court in rylander and wilson,we determine that if a corporate officer avoids a court order to the corporation by failing to take action or attempt compliance,they,no less than the corporation itself,are guilty of disobedience,and may be punished for contempt.wilson,at.moreover,we hold that because a civil contempt ruling either attempts to coerce compliance or compensate the complainant for losses,it is fully appropriate to impose judicial sanctions on the nonparty corporate officer.see united mine workers,at.
turning then to the instant case,pipia clearly did not meet his burden of production.as the funds point out,pipia testified in his deposition that he did not abide by the judgment because he did not think gary electric was contractually obligated to do so.interestingly and without a court order,however,pipia paid off nearly all gary electric other creditors approximately between may,and december.at tr.of mot.hr g.moreover,according to the funds,gary electric had gross receipts of in,the year the company closed its doors.even assuming that all of pipia actions were taken in good faith and not to avoid paying the funds,pipia decision to pay all other creditors and refusal to pay the funds anything at all is ample evidence from which the district court could conclude that pipia did not take all reasonable steps to ensure gary electric compliance with the court order.see peppers,at.in addition,pipia testimony that the company affairs had wound up shortly after the contempt attempting to imply a lack of expendable hardly sufficient to show categorically and in detail why pipia is unable to comply with the court order rolex watch,at.
because we have decided that a showing of clean hands is essential to the rylander defense,we are impressed even more by pipia attempts to drain the corporate resources to avoid satisfying the court order.the first example cited by the funds is the doubling of gary electric rent that occurred after the funds moved for summary judgment.the office space that gary electric leased was owned by one of pipia other companies,krp,and thus the increased rent directly benefitted krp at the expense of gary electric and its creditors.another example of pipi
