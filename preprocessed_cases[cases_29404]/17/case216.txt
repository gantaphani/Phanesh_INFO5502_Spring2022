a class consisting of investors who purchased fruit of the loom stock between september,and november,class period,filed suit against defendants william farley,fruit of the loom chairman,chief executive officer,and chief operating officer william newton,fruit of the loom senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer and ernst young,fruit of the loom auditor,under section b of the securities exchange act of,and securities and exchange commission rule.the plaintiffs alleged in their original complaint that farley and newton had knowingly or recklessly misrepresented fruit of the loom condition during the class period in a successful effort to artificially inflate the price of the company stock.they also alleged that ernst young participated in the fraud by knowingly or recklessly issuing an unqualified audit opinion approving fruit of the loom financial statements and by consenting to that audit opinion inclusion in investor solicitation materials for a million securities offering.
all three defendants filed motions to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court denied farley and newton motions,holding that the plaintiffs had satisfactorily alleged that the two fruit of the loom officers had acted knowingly or recklessly,with scienter when they made public statements about fruit of the loom and its financial condition during the class period that did not accurately reflect the company condition.the district court granted ernst young motion to dismiss because the plaintiffs failed to adequately plead scienter.
subsequently,the district court granted leave to amend the complaint.after the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint,ernst young moved to dismiss it with prejudice.the district court granted its motion to dismiss and a motion for entry of final judgment under federal rule of civil procedure b.
in their appeal to this court,the class members contend that the district court erred in dismissing their complaint because the complaint sufficiently alleges a claim against ernst young under section b of the securities exchange act and rule.alternatively,the class members argue that the district court improperly denied their request to further amend the complaint.for the following reasons,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
fruit of the loom,a clothing manufacturer,experienced financial difficulties in the.the company undertook a major restructuring effort beginning in by outsourcing almost all of its sewing and manufacturing operations from the united states to maquiladora plants in the caribbean and south america.at the same time,it began upgrading its management information,inventory,and production control systems with the consulting assistance of ernst young.the restructuring and systems changes led to significant quality control and inventory management problems.fruit of the loom suffered losses of almost million dollars in,and its stock fell from a share in december to a share in december.
by,it appeared that fruit of the loom financial position was improving.its stock was selling at over a share in august.the company reported revenues of billion,net income of million,and earnings per share of for the nine months ending september.in addition to reporting these figures,fruit of the loom told investors that its inventory and production problems were resolved.
during this same period,fruit of the loom announced that it planned to reorganize as a corporation in the cayman islands,a move that would lower its corporate tax rate.in order to accomplish the reorganization,however,fruit of the loom needed to redeem million in senior notes that were due in october,but would have their maturity accelerated by the reorganization in the cayman islands.fruit of the loom did not have the money to repurchase or pay off these notes.it would later participate in a may securities offering in order to raise the funds necessary to move forward with the reorganization.
fruit of the loom stock fell sharply in september.although trading at over a share in august,the stock fell to just under a share in late september.investors voiced concern that fruit of the loom was accumulating excess inventories that would hurt future profits.
to address these concerns,fruit of the loom told investors that it would materially reduce levels of finished goods and raw materials inventory by slowing production for a few days at its plants.fruit of the loom attributed losses suffered during the fourth quarter of to this downturn in production,but told investors that the inventory reduction would have a favorable impact.the company predicted significant revenue and earnings growth during.
by january,fruit of the loom stock increased to a share.the company forecast continued financial recovery in the following months.william farley,fruit of the loom chairman and chief executive officer,told investors that the restructuring,started a few years prior,was essentially complete and that the company was making progress towards an acceleration of profitable growth.fruit of the loom also forecast earnings per share of over in and in.
on february,ernst young issued a report to fruit of the loom board of directors based on its audit of the company financial statements.it stated in pertinent part the following 
we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of fruit of the loom,and subsidiaries as of january,and december,and the related consolidated statements of operations,stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended january.these financial statements are the responsibility of the company management.our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
in our opinion,the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly,in all material respects,the consolidated financial position of fruit of the loom,and subsidiaries at january,and december,and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended january,in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
ernst young subsequently issued an unqualified audit report as to fruit financial statements.
in march,fruit of the loom privately placed million of new notes with investors.the private placement was designed to raise the money necessary to proceed with the cayman islands reorganization.in may,fruit of the loom exchanged the privately placed notes with freely tradeable notes registered with the securities and exchange commission.as part of the issuance of the freely tradeable notes,fruit of the loom filed a registration statement.ernst young consented to the incorporation by reference of its audit report reviewing financial data in the registration statement.it stated in a letter that 
we consent to the reference to our firm under the caption experts in the registration statement form and related prospectus of fruit of the loom,relating to the exchange offer of senior notes due and to the use of the report dated february,except for subsequent events note,as to which the date is march,with respect to the consolidated financial statements of fruit of the loom,and to the use of our report dated may,with respect to the balance sheet of fruit of the loom.
we also consent to the incorporation by reference therein of our report dated february,except for subsequent events note,as to which the date is march,with respect to the consolidated financial statements and schedule of fruit of the loom,included in its annual report form for the year ended january,filed with the securities and exchange commission.
the registration statement incorporating ernst young audit report dated february,was issued on may.
fruit of the loom experienced disappointing financial results throughout.for first quarter,the company reported that sales were million,down million from first quarter.as a result,the stock suffered a loss of per share during that time period.fruit of the loom explained the results as reflecting an inability to meet strong demand,but told investors that the capacity constraints had been addressed.the company forecast that its sales would be around billion and generate earnings per share of over.
despite these assurances,fruit of the loom financial results did not improve during the remainder of.second quarter yielded a loss of about a share,although the company represented to investors that it would have better results in the second half of the year and a third quarter profit.however,in november,fruit of the loom reported a loss of million during the third quarter,leading to a loss of a share.one month later,in december,the company filed bankruptcy proceedings.
in march,the brought suit against william farley,fruit of the loom chairman,chief executive officer,and chief operating officer william newton,fruit of the loom senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer and ernst young,fruit of the loom auditor,alleging securities fraud violations under section b and rule.
the class members brought suit against ernst young because fruit of the loom used ernst young during the class period to provide auditing,accounting,and consulting services.the class members alleged that ernst young was liable for securities fraud based on its actions in issuing an unqualified audit report on february,with regard to fruit of the loom financial statements and allowing this report to be incorporated by reference into a registration statement issued on may,in conjunction with the offering of new notes.also included in the registration statement were unaudited interim financial figures.the class members alleged that the report and the registration statement included false and misleading information in violation of section b and rule.
the defendants each filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court denied farley and newton motions to dismiss.it granted ernst young motion to dismiss because the plaintiffs had not met the private securities litigation reform act pslra pleading requirements.the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint and ernst young again filed a motion to dismiss.the district court granted ernst and young motion because the plaintiffs had not demonstrated that ernst young acted with the requisite scienter.it also denied plaintiffs leave to file a second amended complaint.plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal.
this court reviews the dismissal of a complaint under rule b for failure to state a claim de novo.miller champion,cir.dismissal of a claim is not proper unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.conley gibson,d.the facts set forth in the complaint must be accepted as true,so long as they are well pleaded.miller,at.while the standard for dismissal of a claim is quite liberal,more than bare assertions of legal conclusions is ordinarily required to satisfy federal notice pleading requirements.scheid fanny farmer candy shops,cir.thus,the plaintiff must provide either direct or inferential allegations respecting all the material elements necessary to sustain a recovery.id.internal quotation and alteration omitted.
in their complaint,the class members allege that ernst young violated section b of the securities exchange act and rule,promulgated under section b.section b makes it unlawful,directly or indirectly,t o use or employ,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the commission may prescribe b.rule provides 
it shall be unlawful for any person,directly or indirectly,a t o employ any device,scheme,or artifice to defraud,b t o make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading,or c t o engage in any act,practice,or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.
in order to state a claim under section b and rule,a plaintiff must allege,in connection with the purchase or sale of securities,the misstatement or omission of a material fact,made with scienter,upon which the plaintiff justifiably relied and which proximately caused the plaintiff injury.in re comshare.sec,cir.
the pslra imposes heightened pleading requirements on plaintiffs alleging violations of section b and seeking monetary damages.the complaint must specify each statement alleged to have been misleading,the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading,and,if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief,the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.b.in addition,the pslra mandates that for each act or omission alleged to have violated federal securities law,the complaint state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.id.b emphasis added.we have explained that the strong inference requirement creates a situation in which plaintiffs are entitled only to the most plausible of competing inferences,but that it does not mandate that the inference be irrefutable.helwig vencor,cir en banc.
the central dispute in this appeal is whether plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that ernst young acted with the required state of mind for a claim brought pursuant to section b and rule,the required state of mind is scienter,defined as a mental state embracing intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud.ernst ernst hochfelder,d.we have recognized that recklessness constitutes sufficient scienter for liability to attach under section b.mansbach prescott,ball turben,cir.recklessness is highly unreasonable conduct which is an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care.while the danger need not be known,it must at least be so obvious that any reasonable man would have known of it.id.at.it is a mental state apart from negligence and akin to conscious disregard.in re comshare,at.

id.at quoting in re worlds of wonder sec,cir.
the class members allege that ernst young first material misrepresentation subjecting it to liability under section b and rule was the unqualified audit report issued in february for the period ending january.the district court held that the class members failed to demonstrate that defendant ernst young acted with the requisite scienter with regard to the audit report.
on appeal,the class members rely on a number of facts to establish that ernst young acted with scienter.they allege that there were numerous red flags that should have placed ernst young on notice about financial improprieties occurring at fruit of the loom.further,they contend that the magnitude of the fraud perpetuated by fruit of the loom creates the inference that ernst young acted knowingly or recklessly in ignoring the company financial misstatements.the class members also argue that the following circumstances support the inference that ernst young acted with the requisite scienter the close temporal proximity between ernst young statements about the financial health of fruit of the loom and the subsequent financial collapse of the company the significant fees obtained by ernst young from its work with fruit of the loom and the proliferation of lawsuits against ernst young stemming from its audits of companies later found to have engaged in financial fraud.finally,the class members contend that these allegations,even if insufficient alone,when viewed in their entirety establish that ernst young acted with scienter.we address these allegations in turn.
the class members point to a number of red flags that should have alerted ernst young to likely improprieties and conveyed the need for it to engage in a more exacting audit.first,they allege that because ernst young worked as a consultant on several of fruit of the loom internal systems,ernst young was aware of specific problems with these systems.further,the consulting work allowed ernst young to maintain a presence at fruit of the loom headquarters,frequently talk to fruit of the loom management,and have unfettered access to documents and employees at all of fruit offices.second,they reference a securities fraud lawsuit filed against fruit of the loom before ernst young had completed its audit report for the period ending january.third,the class members allege that ernst young had knowledge of fruit of the loom demonstrated propensity to skirt financial rules.this knowledge stemmed from issues that arose during a audit.fourth,the class members contend that ernst young received an anonymous letter detailing financial misstatements occurring within fruit of the loom denim unit.fifth,they allege that ernst young had noted in audit papers that fruit of the loom demonstrated a trend of significant book to physical losses over the previous years.they also allege that the audit revealed that fruit of the loom reserve for inventory was understated by percent.according to the class members,these problems that surfaced first in contributed to many of the problems that developed in.sixth,the class members reference million in that occurred in as evidence of scienter because another accounting firm,pricewaterhousecoopers,discovered these within a few days of beginning a special audit.seventh,the class members contend that ernst young knew that fruit of the loom granted customers unlimited rights of returns as well as extended payment terms,yet neither of these fruit of the loom policies prompted ernst young to engage in a more demanding review during its audit.finally,the class members argue that fruit of the loom and its management demonstrated numerous risk factors that should have led ernst young to add audit procedures to evaluate these risks.the risk factors alleged by the class members include an excessive interest by management in maintaining or increasing fruit stock price or earnings trend through the use of unusually aggressive accounting practices,domination of management by one person or a small group,and a high dependence on debt.
we find that these red flags do not create an inference of scienter with regard to ernst young audit of financial data.it appears that as far as ernst young knew the financial results were not in question at the time it signed off on them.at least two of the red flags occurred in,two years before the audit in question in this case.another one of the red flags,the million in,occurred well after the audit report had been issued further,even with regard to red flags that may have occurred in,there is no indication that ernst young knew or could have known that these red flags affected the financial results.for example,although the class members allege that ernst young knew that fruit of the loom granted unlimited rights of returns to certain customers,they pleaded no facts with particularity suggesting that ernst young failed to take this factor into account when preparing its audit or that ernst young knew that the number of actual returns had increased over the previous year.these red flags simply do not create the inference,much less a strong inference,that ernst young,in preparing an audit report of financial results,acted with scienter.see b requiring facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.
further,the fact that ernst young served as a consultant to fruit of the loom on its computer systems and had access to both confidential documents and upper and management does not,without more,lend credence to the allegation that ernst young acted with scienter.our decision in pr diamonds is instructive.in that case,as in this one,the plaintiffs alleged that the accounting firm had personnel who were regularly present at the company corporate headquarters throughout the class period and had continual access to,and knowledge of,the company confidential financial and business information.at.we held that these types of allegations are not enough to raise a strong inference of scienter because such allegations are insufficiently concrete.id.at.however,the more an auditor is intertwined with a company business,the more support an inference of scienter takes on.id.quoting in re microstrategy,sec,d.
in this case,the class members allege that ernst young developed and consulted on internal systems for fruit of the loom and that ernst young had unfettered access to documents and frequent meetings with management.as in pr diamonds,we find these allegations are insufficiently concrete to raise an inference of scienter.nowhere do the class members allege what ernst young might have learned from its access to the company confidential information,what ernst young might have known based on its consulting engagement,or even what documents ernst young reviewed as part of its unfettered access.further,class members do not allege with particularity that ernst young had any greater access to fruit of the loom confidential information because of its auditing and consulting relationships than would any other auditor or consultant.kennilworth partners cendant,d,s tatement s that could be made in relation to the auditor of every corporation are not sufficient to raise the inference of scienter,because if it were sufficient,it might make every auditor liable in cases of securities fraud.ernst young consulting and auditing relationships with fruit of the loom do not create any inference of scienter on its part with regard to its audit of financial data.
the class members also suggest that the red flags should have alerted ernst young to perform a more exacting audit of fruit of the loom and that ernst young failure to do so was a conscious decision or a result of severe recklessness.in essence,the class members argue that ernst young did not follow proper audit procedures because it should have been aware that these red flags could affect fruit of the loom reported financial results.we find this argument unavailing.in pr diamonds,we held that a complaint alleging accounting irregularities fails to raise a strong inference of scienter if it allege s no facts to show that defendants knew or could have known of the errors,or that their regular accounting procedures should have alerted them to the errors sooner than they actually did.at quoting in re comshare,at.further,the failure to follow generally accepted accounting procedures does not in and of itself lead to an inference of scienter.in re comshare,at the failure to follow gaap is,by itself,insufficient to state a securities fraud claim.even if we assume that ernst young did not follow standard accounting practice in failing to perform a more rigorous audit of fruit of the loom financial results,we can not infer that it acted with the requisite scienter.the red flags that the class members raise were not so obvious that the strongest inference that can be drawn from them is that ernst young must have deliberately or recklessly ignored them in preparing its audit report.see id.at because plaintiffs have failed to plead facts that show that the revenue recognition errors should have been obvious to the company or that the company consciously disregarded red flags that would have revealed the errors,we conclude the complaint fails to allege facts that give rise to a strong inference of scienter.
in short,the class members do not allege with particularity any facts that would show that ernst young knew of or recklessly disregarded these red flags in undertaking the audit.as we have held previously,claims of securities fraud can not rest on speculation and conclusory allegations.id.at quoting san leandro emergency med.plan philip morris,cir.because the class members red flags rest on conclusory allegations of what ernst young must have known or should have known while preparing the audit report,we find that they do not create an inference that ernst young acted with scienter.
next,the class members contend that the magnitude of the financial fraud allegedly perpetuated by fruit of the loom bolsters the inference that ernst young acted with scienter.the class members observe that only after fruit of the loom completed the million sale of registered notes in did it belatedly write off million of overvalued and nonexistent inventory.in addition,they allege that fruit of the loom ultimately recorded over million of inventory in,that resulted from activities begun in prior years.
some courts have found an inference of knowledge or recklessness from allegations of accounting violations that are so great in magnitude,that they should have been obvious to a defendant.pr diamonds,at.for example,in in re microstrategy.securities litigation,the court held that the alleged gaap violations and the subsequent restatements are of such a great to a difference with regard to microstrategy representations of to compel an inference that fraud or recklessness was afoot.d at.other courts have similarly held that the magnitude of financial fraud can support the finding that a defendant acted with scienter.see,carley capital group deloitte touche,d,holding that a misapplication of gaap when combined with a drastic overstatement of financial results can give rise to a strong inference of scienter in re baan.sec,d,observing that the magnitude of the error can play a role in inferring scienter.
we decline to follow the cases that hold that the magnitude of financial fraud contributes to an inference of scienter on the part of the defendant.allowing an inference of scienter based on the magnitude of fraud would eviscerate the principle that accounting errors alone can not justify a finding of scienter.in re scb computer.sec,d,see also in re comshare,at holding that the failure to follow accounting standards is,by itself,insufficient to state a securities fraud claim.it would also allow the court to engage in speculation and hindsight,both of which are counter to the pslra mandates.as reasoned by the court in reiger price waterhouse coopers llp,
inferring scienter from the magnitude of fraud invites a court to speculate as to the existence of specific but unpled and unidentified warning signs that show the accountant acted with scienter.to travel from magnitude of fraud to evidence of scienter,the court must blend hindsight,speculation and conjecture to forge a tenuous chain of inferences 
further,the fact that fruit of the loom allegedly took over million in during in no way implies that ernst young acted with scienter while auditing the financial data.ernst young never issued a restatement with regard to the audit report,implying that even after the were taken the following year,ernst young did not believe the financial figures were inaccurate.even if ernst young had restated the figures used in its audit,this action would not have risen to the level of establishing scienter.we have held that a subsequent revelation of the falsehood of previous statements does not imply scienter,because m ere allegations that statements in one report should have been made in earlier reports do not make out a claim of securities fraud.in re comshare,at quoting stevelman alias research,cir.therefore,it follows that even if ernst young should have included the in its audit or that the audit report contained false statements because it did not include occurring during that year,ernst young actions do not create an inference that it acted with the requisite scienter.the class members simply have not alleged any concrete facts that would lead to a strong inference that the later inventory,even if great in magnitude,were indicative of ernst young scienter.
the class members further argue that the court can infer ernst young scienter through several other circumstances,including the close timing between the audit and fruit of the loom financial downturn,ernst young motivation to keep fruit of the loom as a client,and the lawsuits filed against ernst young stemming from its audit work of other clients being investigated for financial fraud.
the class members contend that the close proximity between ernst young review of fruit of the loom financial statements and fruit of the loom financial collapse is evidence that ernst young acted knowingly or recklessly during the audit.for example,the class members argue that ernst young should have included a qualification in the audit opinion dated february,that fruit of the loom might not last for another year as a going concern.
we reasoned in helwig that one factor of a list that could be indicative of a knowing or reckless misstatement is the closeness in time of an allegedly fraudulent statement or omission and the later disclosure of inconsistent information.at.in this case,however,the class members allegations rest on nothing more than hindsight.the class members appear to be assuming that because fruit of the loom experienced financial difficulties within a year after the audit report was issued,ernst young deliberately or recklessly ignored financial information that must have been present during its audit of financial data.however,this conjecture can not support the inference of scienter under the pslra pleading requirements because there is no indication from the class members allegations that ernst young knew or recklessly disregarded information it had before it at the time it issued its audit report.without more,inferring scienter from the temporal proximity between ernst young report and fruit of the loom financial downturn is nothing more than speculation.
in addition,the class members argue that ernst young desire to keep fruit of the loom as a client creates a strong inference of ernst young scienter.they allege that ernst young reaped significant fees from its relationship with fruit of the loom that it did not want to jeopardize by calling attention to fruit of the loom poor financial condition.however,allegations that the auditor earned and wished to continue earning fees from a client do not raise an inference that the auditor acted with the requisite scienter.at best,they set forth a motive for the auditor to have engaged in fraud.bare allegations of motive are insufficient to adequately plead scienter.as we observed in helwig,facts presenting motive and opportunity may be of enough weight to state a claim under the pslra,whereas pleading conclusory labels of motive and opportunity will not suffice.at.we further clarified in comshare that a plaintiff can not meet pslra pleading requirements by alleging facts that illustrate nothing more than a defendant motive and opportunity to commit fraud.at.the plaintiffs in this case do nothing more than state facts that establish ernst young had a motive to commit fraud their complaint alleges that fruit of the loom was a lucrative client from which ernst young earned millions of dollars each year.while this information suggests that ernst young benefitted from its relationship with fruit of the loom,it would be mere speculation to rely on this evidence to establish that ernst young acted knowingly or recklessly in preparing the audit report.see id.at a pleading under the pslra can not rest on speculation or conclusory allegations.
further,ernst young would always be motivated to maintain positive relations with a current client,and there is no indication that its motive to retain fruit of the loom as a client was any different than its general motive to retain business.absent any allegations that ernst young fees from fruit of the loom were more significant than its fees from other clients or that fruit of the loom represented a significant portion of ernst young revenue,it is difficult to surmise how ernst young desire
