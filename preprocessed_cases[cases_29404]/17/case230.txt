the plaintiff sued the members of the board of directors of the former equity office property trust charging that they had violated section a of the securities exchange act,a,and the sec implementing rule,which forbid material misrepresentations or omissions in soliciting a shareholder proxy vote.there is also a claim.the district judge dismissed the federal part of the suit for failure to state a claim.b.he ruled that the private securities litigation reform act,is applicable to suits under section a,which is correct,b,and that it required the complaint to state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind,b,which is incorrect.invoking the doctrine of abstention,he dismissed the claim as well and thus the entire suit.
there is no required state of mind for a violation of section a a proxy solicitation that contains a misleading misrepresentation or omission violates the section even if the issuer believed in perfect good faith that there was nothing misleading in the proxy materials.kennedy venrock associates,cir in re exxon mobil.securities litigation,cir shidler all american life financial,cir gerstle,cir alan bromberg lewis lowenfels,bromberg lowenfels on securities fraud commodities fraud,ed.the requirement in the private securities litigation reform act of pleading a state of mind arises only in a securities case in which the plaintiff may recover money damages only on proof that the defendant acted with a particular state of mind.b.section a requires proof only that the proxy solicitation was misleading,implying at worst negligence by the issuer.kennedy venrock associates,supra,at.and negligence is not a state of mind it is a failure,whether conscious or even unavoidable by the particular defendant,who may be below average in his ability to exercise due care,to come up to the specified standard of care,desnick abc,cir united states ortiz,cir page keeton et,prosser and keeton on the law of torts,ed negligence is conduct,and not a state of mind.that is a basic principle of tort law,though it is sometimes overlooked,as in dasho susquehanna,cir.
the problems with the complaint are profound,but lie elsewhere.bell atlantic twombly,d,teaches that a defendant should not be burdened with the heavy costs of pretrial discovery that are likely to be incurred in a complex case unless the complaint indicates that the plaintiff case is a substantial one.as the supreme court had earlier explained,a litigant must not be permitted to use a largely groundless claim to simply take up the time of a number of other people,with the right to do so representing an in terrorem increment of the settlement value,rather than a reasonably founded hope that the discovery process will reveal relevant evidence.blue chip stamps manor drug stores,d see also limestone development village of lemont,cir.he is not to be allowed to extort a settlement by reason of the defendant having to incur heavy litigation expenses if the suit proceeds beyond the pleading stage even if it is a groundless suit.
the essential facts in this case,either as alleged in the complaint or judicially noticeable,are with some simplification as follows.equity office property trust we abbreviate it to eo was a real estate investment equivalent of a the plaintiff was one of its shareholders.on november,eo board of directors signed an agreement with blackstone group,the firm,to sell eo to blackstone for per share,all cash,for a total of billion.the agreement,which was subject to approval by eo shareholders,allowed eo to terminate the agreement if it received a better offer,but in that event it would have to pay blackstone a termination fee of million.
a shareholders meeting to consider the deal with blackstone was scheduled for february.eo board mailed a proxy solicitation to its shareholders in the hope of collecting enough proxies to assure a favorable vote at the meeting.
a bidding war ensued,for on january,eo received an offer from vornado realty trust to buy eo for per share,payable percent in cash and percent in vornado stock the purchase would have to be approved by vornado shareholders.eo issued a press release describing the offer filed the press release electronically with the securities and exchange commission,which published it on its website and mailed its shareholders a supplemental proxy solicitation.
a week later,blackstone raised its offer to per share.eo board promptly accepted the offer and agreed to increase the termination fee to million.there was the same flurry of publicity,press release,filing with the sec,and mailing of a supplemental proxy solicitation to the shareholders.
vornado responded on february by raising its offer for eo to per share but reducing the percentage of payment that would be in cash rather than stock from percent to percent.there was the same flurry of publicity,filing,but in a supplemental proxy solicitation eo board continued to recommend that the shareholders approve the acquisition by blackstone.so on february vornado proposed a new deal an initial cash tender offer for up to percent of eo shares to be followed by the acquisition of the remaining shares by swapping vornado shares for them.the advantage to eo of this alternative would be speed a shareholder vote would not be required for acceptance of the cash tender offer.
blackstone counterattacked by raising its offer to.eo board responded by demanding,and blackstone agreed but on the condition to which the board acceded that the termination fee be raised from million to million.there was again a flurry of publicity,filing,and a supplemental proxy solicitation in which eo board recommended approval of the blackstone proposal.vornado threw in its hand.it announced that it was dropping out of the bidding for eo because the premium it would have to pay to top blackstone latest bid,protected by a twice increased breakup fee the million,would not be in its shareholders interest.on february,eo shareholders voted overwhelmingly to approve blackstone new bid.
the plaintiff intimates a possible impropriety in blackstone having demanded a stiff termination fee,which would have increased the cost to vornado of outbidding blackstone.that would not be a proper claim under section a of the securities exchange act,however,because it has nothing to do with misrepresentations and anyway blackstone is not a defendant.the fee was disclosed to eo shareholders and they could have voted against accepting blackstone final offer precisely because it would end the bidding war by making a higher bid too expensive for vornado to be willing to make.
as we noted in stark trading falconbridge,cir,the antifraud provisions of federal securities law are not a general charter of shareholder is not to suggest that termination fees in bidding contests are generally improper under any body of law with which we are familiar.see venture associates zenith data systems,cir cottle storer communication,cir brazen bell atlantic.blackstone was forgoing other investment opportunities in preparation for having to shell out billion in cash to buy eo.granted,if the fee were a high percentage of the bid,then,as the cases we have cited suggest,its acceptance by the board of the target company might disserve the target shareholders by ending the bidding war prematurely.that is not the case here or for that matter in most cases involving deal protection provisions of that sort,see micah officer,termination fees in mergers and acquisitions,fin.econ,but the essential point is that,to repeat,the termination fee had nothing to do with any representations or omissions in the proxy solicitations.
but the plaintiff also argues that had it not been for misleading proxy solicitations,eo shareholders would have rejected the merger and by doing so have reaped the economic benefits of continuing to own eo shares.that there would have been net benefits is proved,he argues,by the fact that vornado offer of in cash and stock was superior to blackstone final offer of,which shows that eo shares had been sold to blackstone for less than their market value.but the premise is incorrect.vornado off
