there are three corporate plaintiffs national market share,a delaware corporation national market share,a texas corporation and campaign tel,a delaware corporation collectively,nms or the company.all three appeal from a damages award of entered after a bench trial by the united states district court for the southern district of new york mckenna.
the district court conceded that defendant sterling national bank sterling had breached the duty of good faith and fair dealing owed to plaintiffs when,after agreeing to do so,it failed to honor approximately in payroll checks.the court found,nevertheless,it was not sterling breach that caused nms to go out of business rather,the actions of plaintiffs principal,steven goldberg,were an intervening cause of the company collapse.therefore,the court awarded plaintiffs only nominal damages.
on appeal,plaintiffs contend that the award should be vacated and the case remanded to recalculate damages.specifically,plaintiffs claim that in the first place,the district court should not have considered sua sponte the issue of intervening cause in any event,there was no evidence that goldberg actions caused nms damages and the district court erred in failing to award them damages equal to the value of the company.
because we conclude that the first two of nms contentions lack merit,we find the third to be moot and therefore decline to reach it.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court in its entirety.
background 
i.the facts 
this case arose when the business relationship between nms and sterling soured.we assume familiarity with the underlying facts set forth by the district court,see mkt.share,sterling bank,civ,mckenna,and we summarize the background only to the extent relevant to this appeal.
before its collapse,nms provided telemarketing services to corporations and political campaigns through seven call centers located across the united states.in april,sterling agreed to make loans to nms under a revolving line of credit secured by nms accounts receivable.this arrangement made sterling nms sole source of external financing.
in june,nms brought in robert stoloff as chief financial and operating officer.stoloff discovered that nms had been engaging in billing irregularities,and he arranged for nms principal steven goldberg and himself to meet two sterling representatives,senior vice president stanley officina and loan officer jonathan brand.in july,to assure steady financing from sterling in spite of the irregularities,goldberg gave sterling a mortgage on his manhattan town house.at the time,nms owed sterling an outstanding balance of between and million.
by the start of november,nms loan balance had been reduced to approximately million.nms was expecting to receive over million from one of its largest clients,satellite broadcasting ussb,in payment of a receivable generated in october.
november,was election day,which was one of nms busiest times of the year.
on november,goldberg and stoloff met again with officina at sterling offices,this time to confirm that sterling would honor payroll checks worth approximately which nms intended to distribute the next day.according to the district court,the following transpired 
officina inquired about the forthcoming ussb check,stoloff said he expected the check around the end of november or the beginning of december,officina requested that stoloff call ussb to accelerate delivery of the check,and stoloff responded that he was concerned about upsetting plaintiffs relationship with ussb if he were to do so.officina did not tell stoloff and goldberg that he would not advance funds unless he received the ussb check.
mkt.share,civ,at footnote omitted.
later that same day,having apparently been assured of sterling cooperation,nms sent the payroll checks to its call centers for distribution to employees.on november and,the checks were distributed to nms employees.on november,sterling declined to fund nms account,and the payroll checks began to bounce.
according to the district court 
on november,employees of the des moines,iowa,call center whose payroll checks had not been honored appeared,in an angry mood,some demanding cash,one accompanied by a police officer.plaintiffs director of field operations,present at the des moines location,heard reports of similar activities at other call centers.goldberg told him by phone to tell employees to come back the next day when more would be known and the problem would be taken care of.after some new checks were given out on november,payroll managers at plaintiffs locations were instructed by management not to give out any more checks to employees.
mkt.share,civ,at.
at around noon or on november,goldberg received the critical million check from ussb ussb check.he did not,however,notify sterling that the ussb check had arrived.rather,on november,goldberg flew to minneapolis where ussb was located and deposited the check into his own personal bank account.
although nms still owed sterling around million,goldberg used the ussb proceeds to pay off various corporate and personal debts not any part of it did he give to the nms employees whose paychecks had bounced.
on or around november,nms ceased operations.
ii.procedural history 
sterling sued goldberg in new york supreme court for conversion and replevin to recover the proceeds of the ussb check.goldberg,in turn,counterclaimed for,inter alia,breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing.
in february,while the state court litigation was pending,nms brought the present diversity action against sterling in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.see a.nms alleged breach of contract,breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing,fraud,wrongful dishonor of checks,and wrongful impairment of collateral.
in january,the new york supreme court ramos,granted sterling motion for summary judgment,finding principally that goldberg had illegally converted the proceeds of the ussb check,in which sterling had a secured interest.the appellate division,first department,affirmed this finding and,in large part,the grant of summary judgment.sterling bank goldberg,dep t.however,finding issues of fact as to whether sterling breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing when it precipitously cut off the debtors line of credit without notice,the appellate division reinstated goldberg counterclaim for breach of the implied covenant.id.
in march,judge mckenna in the southern district of new york,in turn,granted sterling motion for summary judgment on each of nms claims brought in federal court,except its claim for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing.see mkt.share sterling bank,wl.in december,judge mckenna began an bench trial on that issue.
in february,judge mckenna rendered his decision.applying new york law,the district court held that sterling had acted in bad faith in dishonoring nms payroll checks and thus breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing.mkt.share,civ,at.however,the court concluded that nms had not demonstrated that sterling breach caused nms demise.rather,the court found,its collapse was caused by another intervening cause,namely,goldberg failure to deliver the ussb check to sterling on november.id.at.in the court view,sterling could not be held liable for damage occurring after goldberg received the ussb check.id.finding further that t he damages that occurred on november and,prior to goldberg act,were so uncertain,the court concluded that they,too,could not be recovered.id.at.thus,the court awarded nms only nominal damages of.id.at.
this appeal by nms followed.

under new york law,a duty of good faith and fair dealing is implied in every contract,united states fid.guar.braspetro oil servs,cir.the duty comprises any promises which a reasonable person in the position of the promisee would be justified in understanding were included in the contract.dalton educ.testing,internal quotation marks omitted.neither party disputes on appeal that sterling breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing by failing to fund nms payroll checks the only issues before us concern damages.
in new york,breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing is merely a breach of the underlying contract.fasolino foods banca nazionale del lavoro,cir quoting geler westminster bank usa,citations omitted.
to establish a prima facie case for breach of contract,a plaintiff must plead and prove the existence of a contract a breach of that contract and damages resulting from the breach.rij pharm.ivax,d,see also first investors liberty mut.ins,cir.one who violates his contract with another is liable for all the direct and proximate damages which result from the violation.wakeman wheeler wilson,accord losei realty city of new york,quoting wakeman.

in arguing for damages arising from nms collapse,plaintiffs make three related claims the district court should not have considered sua sponte the issue of intervening cause because it was an affirmative defense which sterling waived by failing to plead assuming arguendo that the court properly considered the issue of intervening cause,the evidence was insufficient to show that it was goldberg who caused nms demise and the court should have used one of the three reliable methods for calculating the value of the company that plaintiffs presented at trial.we address each argument in turn.
governs general pleading rules.rule c provides that a defendant,i n pleading to a preceding pleading,shall set forth affirmatively any matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense.c listing as examples,accord and satisfaction,arbitration and award,assumption of risk,contributory negligence,discharge in bankruptcy,duress,estoppel,failure of consideration,fraud,illegality,injury by fellow servant,laches,license,payment,release,res judicata,statute of frauds,statute of limitations,waiver.generally,a failure to plead an affirmative defense results in a waiver.travellers int l,trans world airlines,cir.
according to.b,w hen issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties,they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings.if an affirmative defense is neither pled nor tried with the parties consent,the defense is usually waived.see luria alliance assurance,cir.
nms relies on the principles embodied in rules c and b to persuade us that the issue of intervening cause in this case was an affirmative defense that sterling waived by failing to plead it.as a result,nms contends,the district court erred in considering sua sponte whether goldberg failure to hand over the ussb check to sterling constituted an intervening cause of nms demise.moreover,nms argues that the court ruling was prejudicial because,had the issue been raised earlier,it would have offered additional testimony showing that its complete collapse occurred on november,the day its payroll checks began to bounce and the day before goldberg received the ussb check.
we are not persuaded,however,by nms procedural claim.because a plaintiff may recover only for damages that are direct ly and proximate ly caused by a defendant breach of contract,causation is an a crucial the plaintiff prima facie case.wakeman,at,accord kenford,at.accordingly,in order to prevail,nms had to show that the bank breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing directly and proximately caused the company collapse.
the impact of goldberg act of november,the intervening cause,which the district court found had broken the causal link between sterling breach and the damages,was an integral part of the proximate cause analysis.seen in context,the intervening cause was not an affirmative defense that sterling had to plead,fed.deposit ins.haines,d,finding,under connecticut law,that the defense of intervening causes,that is causation,was necessarily an element of the plaintiff case in chief because it was so plainly put into issue by being embraced by the existing pleadings and thus was not a rule c affirmative defense resolution trust kpmg peat marwick,finding a defense that claims were barred by causation in fact,proximate cause,intervening cause was not an affirmative defense but merely an assertion that plaintiff can not prove a necessary element of its claim du pont de nemours mccain,cir the theory of new and independent cause is not an affirmative defense it is but an element to be considered by the jury in determining the existence or of proximate cause.quoting dallas ry.terminal bailey.
luria alliance assurance,cir,does not change our analysis.in luria,this court reversed a district court decision that plaintiff had to pay restitution for a gratuitous payment because the questions of rescission and restitution were not even mentioned,let alone discussed below and defendant had not sought restitution at trial.id.at.although evidence of the payment was introduced at trial,this court held as follows that such evidence,relevant to both pled and unpled issues,was introduced without objection does not imply consent to trial of the unpled issues,absent some obvious attempt to raise them.id.however,luria is inapposite to the facts before us.indeed,the question of proximate cause,encompassing as it does goldberg intervening cause,was part of plaintiffs prima facie case.having alleged in their pleadings that sterling breach caused nms to go out of business,plaintiffs necessarily consented to the included issue of goldberg intervening cause.
nor does the statement in haven associates donro realty,dep t,that i t was plaintiff burden to show that defendant breach contributed in a substantial measure to its damages,whereupon the burden shifted to defendant to prove that some intervening cause,such as economic recession,contributed to the damages,persuade us to the contrary.see also special prods.douglass,dep t same.in haven,the plaintiff had already established proximate causation,and the court therefore shifted to the defendant the burden of proving the extent to which economic recession,rather than defendant breach,had contributed to plaintiff loss of future profits.haven,at.here,in contrast,no such occurred nms never proved proximate causation.
we thus hold that the district court committed no error in considering whether goldberg failure to hand over the ussb check to sterling,rather than sterling breach,was the direct and proximate cause of nms collapse.quite the contrary,the district court analysis would have been incomplete without addressing the issue.
ii.sufficiency of the evidence 
nms next argues that there was insufficient evidence to show that goldberg actions,rather than sterling breach,caused nms to go out of business.this contention is meritless.
we review a district court factual findings for clear error.a.we will not reverse simply because we are convinced that we would have decided the case differently.anderson city of bessemer city,d.nor may we either the trial court credibility assessments or its choice between permissible competing inferences.ceraso motiva,llc,cir.
