opinion of the court 
in this appeal we consider a question of first impression under pennsylvania law whether a may be compelled to arbitrate her civil rights claims pursuant to corporate bylaws to which she has not explicitly assented.when first presented with this issue,we petitioned the pennsylvania supreme court to certify the question because we found that it exposed tension between corporate law principles and arbitration contract principles.the pennsylvania supreme court denied the petition,so we shall answer the question.
alyson kirleis practices law with the pittsburgh firm of dickie,mccamey chilcote,firm.she worked at the firm as a summer associate in and became a associate the following year.in,kirleis became a class b shareholder and was promoted to class a in.since she became a,kirleis relationship with the firm has been governed by the firm corporate bylaws.
kirleis filed two complaints against the firm in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania alleging sex discrimination,retaliation,and hostile work environment in violation of federal and state law the firm filed a motion to compel arbitration pursuant to,citing a mandatory arbitration provision in its bylaws.the district court denied the motion and the firm filed this timely appeal 
the district court had jurisdiction under.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a b.our review of the district court order denying the motion to compel arbitration is plenary.first liberty inv.group nicholsberg,cir.we apply the same standard as the district court,compelling arbitration only where there is no genuine issue of fact concerning the formation of the agreement to arbitrate.see mills,stockbridge fabrics,cir in making this determination,the party opposing arbitration is entitled to the benefit of all reasonable doubts and inferences that may arise.id.
the firm motion to compel arbitration was based on the following provision of its bylaws 
section.arbitration.
a general rule any dispute arising under these including disputes related to the right to indemnification,contribution or advancement of expenses as provided under these,shall be decided only by arbitration in pittsburgh,pennsylvania,in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the american arbitration association,before a panel of three arbitrators,one of whom shall be selected by the corporation,the second of whom shall be selected by the shareholder,director,officer,or indemnified representative and the third of whom shall be selected by the other two arbitrators.
as relevant to this appeal,kirleis averred in her affidavit 
i was never provided with a copy of the of defendant firm at the time that i was made a class b shareholder or at anytime thereafter.in fact,i only saw the documents which wiley purports to be firm for the first time when i received wiley affidavit in connection with this case,approximately years after being made a class b and years after commencing the practice of law with the firm.
i was never informed of the presence of the arbitration provision in the which firm is now seeking to enforce against me.
i never signed any agreement or document which refers to or incorporates the arbitration provision in the.
i never agreed to arbitrate my claims against firm.
at this stage of the litigation,the firm has not challenged the veracity of kirleis averments.instead,the firm argues that her status as a charged kirleis with constructive knowledge of the terms of the bylaws and manifested her acceptance of the arbitration provision.in support of this argument,the firm notes that kirleis accepted compensation and perquisites pursuant to the bylaws.for example,section g of the bylaws provided kirleis with,inter alia,a car allowance of per month,a parking lease at the firm ppg place office complex,an annual trip to a legal seminar or convention with airfare included reimbursement of of her annual dues at clair country club,and a life insurance policy with a death benefit of.in addition,kirleis accepted compensation pursuant to section h of the bylaws a position on the board of directors pursuant to section and a right to vote on all firm matters reserved to the board,pursuant to section b.finally,kirleis held various management positions,including chairperson of the associate review committee,member of an ad hoc committee charged with administering an executive committee election,and member of the shareholder review committee.
in sum,the firm argues,as it did before the district court,that kirleis can not have it both ways by selectively accepting the benefits of the bylaws under sections,and while refusing to be bound by the arbitration clause of section.
to determine whether the parties agreed to arbitrate,we turn to ordinary principles that govern the formation of contracts.first options of,kaplan,d.see also blair scott specialty gases,cir.kirleis and the firm agree that pennsylvania law applies here.because arbitration is a matter of contract,john wiley sons,livingston,d,before compelling arbitration pursuant to the federal arbitration act,a court must determine that a valid agreement to arbitrate exists,and the particular dispute falls within the scope of that agreement.trippe niles audio,cir quiles fin.exch.
it is well established that the federal arbitration act faa,reflects a strong federal policy in favor of the resolution of disputes through arbitration.alexander anthony int l,cir.but this presumption in favor of arbitration does not apply to the determination of whether there is a valid agreement to arbitrate between the parties.fleetwood,gaskamp,cir.
under pennsylvania law,contract formation requires a mutual manifestation of an intention to be bound,terms sufficiently definite to be enforced,and consideration.blair,at.in the employment context,arbitration agreements will be upheld when they are specific enough unambiguous to cover the employee claims and the employee has expressly agreed to abide by the terms of the agreement.quiles,at emphasis added.the pennsylvania supreme court has held that an agreement to arbitrate must be clear and unmistakable and can not arise by implication.emmaus mun.auth.eltz.likewise,we have held that b efore a party to a lawsuit can be ordered to arbitrate there should be an express,unequivocal agreement to that effect.mills,at emphasis added.
in support of her argument that no arbitration contract was formed,kirleis relied heavily on the pennsylvania superior court decision in quiles,which held 
because the employee was never given the handbook that included the information explaining the company policy to exclusively arbitrate any workplace disputes,she was unable to accept the terms of the agreement to arbitrate.without her acceptance,there was no agreement formed between the parties and,thus,no grounds to compel arbitration.
at.the district court agreed and held that the firm argument that kirleis must have known or should have asked falls short of the standard required by pennsylvania law that plaintiff actually agree to arbitrate her claims.kirleis dickie,mccamey chicolte,pc,wl,at.july.because the bylaws were not distributed to kirleis,she could not have agreed to arbitrate her claims.id.
the firm claims that the district court erred by finding kirleis and conclusory affidavit sufficient to establish a genuine issue of fact as to the existence of an agreement to arbitrate ignoring the corporate law principle that members of the corporation are presumed to know and understand the bylaws relying on quiles and allowing kirleis to accept benefits of the bylaws without honoring her responsibilities thereunder.we consider these arguments seriatim.
the firm first argues that kirleis and conclusory affidavit can not create a genuine issue of material fact regarding the existence of an arbitration agreement.
it is true that conclusory,affidavits are insufficient to withstand a motion for summary judgment.blair,at.instead,the affiant must set forth specific facts that reveal a genuine issue of material fact.id.collecting cases maldonado ramirez,cir see also.e when a motion for summary judgment is properly made and supported,an opposing pa
