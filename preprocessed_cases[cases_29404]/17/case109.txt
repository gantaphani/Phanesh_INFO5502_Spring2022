opinion of the court 
a receiver for a corporation through which a ponzi scheme was run brought suit against various alleged to have assisted the scheme,ultimately winning a jury verdict.the receiver theory of the case was that the defendants,in concert with the corporation chief officer,had harmed the corporation by saddling it with additional liability to the scheme victims.following a verdict in the receiver favor,the defendants unsuccessfully moved for judgment as a matter of law,arguing,among other things,that the receiver lacked standing to bring the claims submitted to the jury and that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury verdict.we agree with the receiver that,under our case law,he had standing to bring the claims presented to the jury.but we agree with the defendants that they can not be liable to the corporation on the facts presented at trial.accordingly,we vacate the district court denial of the defendants motion for judgment of law and remand with instructions to enter judgment in their favor.
facts and procedural history 
a.the bentley scheme 
in,robert bentley established bentley financial services,bfs,a pennsylvania corporation,through which he brokered certificates of deposit cds in,bentley formed the entrust group entrust,a pennsylvania sole proprietorship,to act as custodian on transactions.in the industry,the broker is responsible for connecting cds available for purchase from banks with particular investors.the custodian then collects the money from each investor,wires it to the issuing bank and holds onto the cd,while issuing a safekeeping receipt to the investor indicating that it has title to the cd held by the custodian.
the cd seller profit often called the spread comes from the difference between the terms of the cd purchased from the bank and the terms on which the cd is sold to the investor.in a simple case,a cd offered by a bank might provide a interest rate on a maturity,which the broker would then offer to the investor as a cd at interest,taking the difference as profit.
a more complex,and risky,way a cd broker can profit is by mismatching maturity dates.in one form of maturity mismatching a broker locks in a particular interest rate for a cd and then,rather than selling it as a cd to an investor,sells it as a series of cds,hoping to profit from the difference between the market rate for interest in cds and the rate the broker locked in however,if a purchaser of one of these cds wants the investment back at the end of the shortened maturity period rather than rolling over the investment,the broker can not simply get the principal back from the bank from whom the broker purchased the cd.in those circumstances,the broker typically has three options find another investor for a new cd and return the outgoing investor principal from the proceeds of that sale warehouse the cd with a cooperating bank that agrees to purchase the cd temporarily until an investor for a new cd can be found,thus allowing the broker to pay the outgoing investor out of the money loaned by the cooperating bank or require the investor to stay locked in to the cd until its actual maturity date or until a substitute investor can be found to provide the money to pay the outgoing investor.this form of mismatching is legal as long as the mismatch is disclosed to the investor including the fact that the investor may not be able to reclaim its principal at the maturity date stated in the investment contract.
bentley operation deviated from the standard business model described above in at least two crucial respects first,and most dramatically,in bentley started selling fictitious cds.as his own custodian,he could fool investors by issuing bogus safekeeping receipts.according to bentley,the decision to sell fake cds traced back to or,when entrust obtained a million credit line,secured by commissions,for cash flow management.in an act that bentley would later describe as rooted in impatience,he forged his accountant signature in a letter certifying the collateral.the bank discovered the forgery in and called the balance on the credit line,threatening bentley business.to repay the loan,bentley created and sold the fictitious cds.because bentley used the proceeds of the sales to pay down the than to purchase cds that would generate interest while retaining the initial could only pay the investors the interest and principal owed on the fake cds by obtaining money from new investors money that,in turn,could not all be used to buy new cds.
that was the birth of bentley ponzi scheme his ability to meet his obligations to past investors depended on his ability to obtain money from new investors,forcing bentley to continue the scheme or default.
trying to escape the financial hole he was digging,bentley pursued a strategy of aggressive maturity mismatching.he purchased cds,hoping that,if interest rates on cds went down,he could generate enough from the mismatch that he would no longer need to sell fictitious cds to meet his obligations as they came due.
that led to a second way in which bentley enterprise deviated from an cd brokerage operation.because bentley customer base comprised primarily conservative investors such as credit unions,he failed to disclose the mismatching thus,investors who purchased mismatched cds did not know they were actually purchasing interests in cds.if such an investor wanted its principal back at the end of the stated that is,shortened maturity date,bentley could not force the investor to stay with the cd without revealing its true nature.instead,he quickly had to find some way to generate the cash necessary to return the principal,often when he guessed wrong about the direction of interest rates by selling another mismatched cd to a new investor at a higher rate of interest than the one he initially got from the bank on the cd.
thus,though bentley was in fact purchasing than simply recycling,or embezzling,the money he obtained from scheme still embodied some of the classic features of a ponzi.in many cases,investors were not purchasing what they thought they were purchasing.either as in the case of the fictitious cds there was no underlying cd,or as in the case of the cds used as part of bentley mismatching strategy the terms of the underlying cd did not match what had been disclosed to the investor.and bentley ability to make good on his obligations to his investors depended in significant part on his finding new investors.
benghiat and marzouca 
this appeal centers on the relationship between bentley scheme and two figures who would later become defendants in this benghiat and joseph marzouca.benghiat owned two florida firms sfg financial,sfg,a cd broker with whom bfs frequently served as a with sfg acting as the wholesale broker,locating available cds from banks,and bfs acting as the retail broker,connecting those cds to particular clients and southeastern securities,ssi,a securities firm.marzouca was of peninsula bank,a florida bank that had an ongoing relationship with sfg as a warehouser of its cds,and that later served as a custodian along with entrust on a number of bfs sales.when peninsula bank and entrust worked together as custodians,peninsula bank acted as the superior custodian,while entrust acted as the.that means that peninsula bank would purchase the cd from the bank and hold it,while issuing a safekeeping receipt to entrust,which would then issue a separate safekeeping receipt to the investor.graphically depicted,the relationship between the issuing banks,sfg,peninsula bank and bentley two firms bfs and entrust went as follows 
the primary issue in dispute at trial was whether,and to what extent,benghiat and marzouca knew about bentley scheme.bentley testified that benghiat knew bentley was mismatching maturities without telling his investors and had urged him to disclose it he did not,but bentley did not claim to have told either benghiat or marzouca directly about his sale of fake cds.what is undisputed is that knowingly or not benghiat and marzouca helped the scheme stay afloat in at least two ways.first,bentley investors would sometimes call issuing banks listed on their safekeeping receipts to confirm that the banks really issued the cds.because the banks only knew the identities of the superior custodians to which they issued the cds,they referred questions to marzouca at peninsula bank.he forwarded them to benghiat,who called bentley with the names of curious investors.bentley would then cash the investors out immediately,waiving any penalty associated with early withdrawal,to avoid further questions.
second,on three occasions benghiat and marzouca helped bentley obtain the cash necessary to keep bentley operation afloat.the first of these occasions took place in late.investors spooked by rumors of a computer refused to roll over their cds,forcing bentley to return million in principal.rates on cds were rising,souring his gamble on cds and forcing him to pay higher rates to attract money.bentley raised most of the cash he needed by finding new investors and liquidating between million and million of his risky cds on the open market.but he also turned to benghiat for help.
benghiat spoke with marzouca,and together the three parties engineered what they styled as a warehousing transaction between bentley operation and peninsula bank under the arrangement,peninsula bank agreed to purchase temporarily up to million in cds from bentley in exchange for a fee to be split between marzouca and benghiat,interest on the cds plus any shortfall between such interest and the prevailing prime rate of interest,and a million security deposit from entrust intended to cover the difference if any between the purchase price of the cds and the amount for which peninsula bank resold them.the deposit was subject to forfeiture if the bank failed to sell all the cds within days.bentley sold million in cds to peninsula bank under this arrangement in october and november,repurchasing them within days at a total loss in fees and interest of approximately.two more warehousing transactions at virtually the same terms followed in and.
finally,bentley had a side business brokering securities,such as bonds.for about months starting at the end of,he brokered securities for ssi benghiat firm on a commission basis.because of this relationship,the national association of securities dealers nasd,of which ssi was a member,required ssi to supervise bentley operation.but,based on legal advice it received,ssi concluded that it was not responsible for bentley cd business because the securities and exchange commission does not regulate cds.benghiat therefore limited ssi supervision to the much smaller aspects of bentley operation.when lawyers for ssi started to worry that the sec would regulate cds,ssi through benghiat terminated bentley in august,citing bentley other activities.
in september,a texas bank that had purchased fake cds from bentley tried to confirm its ownership.as usual,marzouca forwarded the request through benghiat to bentley,who ultimately bought back the fake cds from the texas bank after acquiring million from peninsula bank in the final of the three warehousing transactions to do it.but the texas bank alerted regulators,and,shortly thereafter,the scheme was exposed.bentley later pled guilty to one count of mail fraud for selling worthless certificates of deposit and one count of bribery relating to an aspect of the scheme not at issue in this appeal.he was sentenced to months imprisonment and ordered to pay million in restitution.
c.the civil proceedings 
in october,the sec filed a civil action against bentley,bfs and entrust collectively,the bentley defendants in the eastern district of pennsylvania.in november,the district court appointed david marion as receiver for the bentley defendants pursuant to,giving him complete jurisdiction over,and control of all the property,real,personal or mixed,wherever located,of bentley,bfs,and entrust.in august,marion brought an action on behalf of bfs only against,among others,benghiat,sfg and ssi collectively referred to hereinafter as benghiat and marzouca and peninsula bank collectively referred to hereinafter as marzouca as amended,the complaint characterized the action as one to recover damages from defendants for injuries,losses,obligations and liabilities suffered by and imposed upon bfs as a result of,inter alia,a fraudulent scheme orchestrated by bentley,and others including the defendants.the complaint alleged that the defendants had allowed the scheme to succeed for as long as it did by,among other things,failing properly to supervise bentley in the face of a duty to do so,and infus ing the bentley scheme with additional cash despite knowledge of the precarious financial condition of bfs and its inability to honor its investment contracts.
the case was tried in june.on the claims presented to the jury,there were three separate bases for finding liability.the jury could find that,in arranging the three warehousing transactions with bentley,benghiat and marzouca had either aided and abetted,or conspired in,bentley fraud or the jury could find with respect to benghiat only that he was liable for bentley fraud under a respondeat superior theory for failing to exercise adequate supervision during the period in which bentley sold securities for ssi.
in addition,marion submitted three separate measures of damages to the jury.the first,which came to,corresponded to the sums owed on the new money invested in the scheme after august,when bentley first enlisted the aid of benghiat and marzouca.the second measure,which came to,corresponded to bfs total insolvency the difference between its assets and its liabilities as of october,the day before the receiver was appointed.the final measure corresponded to the amount by which bfs insolvency increased between august,and october.
the jury found both benghiat and marzouca liable it assigned damages in the amount of to marzouca and to benghiat,sums that,when added up,equal the under the first measure of damages listed above the new money damages.
benghiat and marzouca moved for judgment as a matter of law,arguing both that marion lacked standing to bring the claims presented to the jury and that,at any rate,the evidence did not support the verdict marion moved to mold the verdict to reflect joint and several liability.the district court denied all the parties motions.benghiat and marzouca later moved for relief from judgment,after discovering that marion purportedly had prevented one of his experts from stating his opinion that there were no damages in the case.the court denied that motion as well,and both parties appeal from the denial of their various motions.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to a over marion claims against benghiat and marzouca because those claims were ancillary to a suit obtaining judgment against the bentley defendants under federal securities law.see pope louisville,new albany chicago.donell kowell,cir.we have jurisdiction under.

iii.discussion 
benghiat and marzouca challenge the jury verdict against them on multiple grounds,including whether marion had standing to bring the claims on which they were found liable and whether the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict against them.our case law requires that we side with marion on the standing issue,but we agree with benghiat and marzouca that neither can be liable to marion as bfs receiver for the actions over which the jury passed judgment 
to begin,we must confront benghiat and marzouca argument that marion lacked standing to bring the claims presented to the jury.see steel citizens for a better env t,d explaining that the issue of standing,because it implicates a federal court authority to hear a case,must be addressed as a threshold matter.benghiat and marzouca argue that marion lacked standing because the injuries for which he sought compensation were those of the investors victimized by bentley scheme,not bfs.marion concedes that,acting as the receiver for bfs,he could only bring suit to address injuries to bfs.marion br.at.his argument is that,appearances to the contrary,the harm over which he asked the jury to pass judgment was to bfs.
intuitively,benghiat and marzouca seem correct.that is,this action certainly has the look and feel of an effort to avoid the general rule that an equity receiver may sue only to redress injuries to the entity in receivership.scholes lehmann,cir posner,see also donell,at eberhard marcu,cir javitch first union,cir.dep t of ins.chase bank of,cir goodman fcc,fleming,cir.that is the impression left by some of the remarks made by marion counsel to the jury over the course of the trial.
in his opening statement at trial,marion attorney asserted that the purpose of this case is to obtain a verdict so that all the victims of the bentley scheme can be paid what they are owed.in that same statement,he described marion job as a receiver as being to help the victims of the scheme by first collect ing the money still existing in the scheme,and then investigat ing to see if claims should be made against all those who worked with bentley so that all the obligations to the victims can be paid.in asking the jury for damages in his closing argument,marion counsel contended that f undamental fairness requires that at a minimum the investors get back the full amount of their principal and the interest they were promised,and described the measure of damages ultimately new money what the receiver needs in order to repay the investors what they are owed.
marion retorts that more important than these remarks was the district judge actual jury charge,to wit 
the receiver has an obligation to take over the assets of the business,and also is empowered to collect any monies that might be due the businesses.
the lawsuit is an attempt by the receiver to collect money which the receiver claims should be paid to the receivership as due the receivership because of the implication of the defendants in some of bentley activities.
in this context,we do not take the remarks of marion counsel as necessarily decisive for standing purposes moreover,it is undisputed that marion was acting for the benefit of the investors even though he lacked authority to bring claims directly on their behalf.see wuliger mfrs.life ins,cir t he purpose of a receiver is to marshal the receivership entities assets so that the assets may be distributed to the injured parties in a manner the court deems equitable.sec hardy,cir a primary purpose of equity receiverships is to promote orderly and efficient administration of the estate for the benefit of creditors.as we have explained in the analogous bankruptcy context,it is irrelevant to the issue of standing that a successfully prosecuted cause of action will result in an inflow of money to the estate that will immediately flow out again to repay creditors.official comm.of unsecured creditors lafferty,cir.
we thus turn to the heart of the standing a distinct injury to bfs underlay marion claims.in his supplemental briefing before us,marion describes his theory of liability as follows benghiat and marzouca,through their actions and,in benghiat case,omissions as well,allowed bentley scheme to continue,and this damaged the responsible corporation bfs because it is inevitable in a ponzi scheme that there will be obligations that the corporation is unable to pay when the scheme is exposed.marion supp l br.at.in other words,the claim is that benghiat and marzouca helped bentley,and that help harmed bfs because it caused bfs to enter into more losing investment contracts than it otherwise would have.that according to marion is why it was appropriate for the damages awarded to compensate bfs to equal the money owed to investors who came on board after benghiat and marzouca harm to bfs was essentially the harm in taking on additional liability to the defrauded investors 
this claim,if plausible and for purposes of this opinion we assume it is,steps over the relatively low standing threshold.a receiver no doubt has standing to bring a suit on behalf of the debtor corporation against third parties who allegedly helped that corporation management harm the corporation though bentley controlled bfs,its separate corporate form makes it possible under our precedent to allege that bentley and those who helped him harmed bfs.see lafferty,at in pennsylvania,as in almost every other state,a corporation is a distinct and separate entity,irrespective of the persons who own all its stock.quoting barium steel wiley.we found standing to bring a suit with that basic structure in lafferty albeit in the bankruptcy context,id.at,and other courts have done so specifically in the receiver context.see,donell,at scholes,at.
we confess to being less comfortable with what marion theory identifies as the actual harm to the harm of being responsible for the injury caused in the first instance to the investors.that seems to eliminate the cogency of any distinction between harm to the debtor and harm to the creditors.yet we recognize that marion theory of injury finds support in the law of our court.in lafferty,we held that a creditors committee,acting on behalf of a corporation,had standing to bring suit against professionals who had allegedly conspired with the corporation management to prolong the ponzi scheme operated through it.at.we based standing on the notion that,under pennsylvania law,the defendants,by offering professional opinions that were alleged to have wrongfully helped the scheme evade detection,had injured the corporation by deepening its insolvent condition.id.at.
thabault chait,cir,is even more helpful to marion.there we held that a corporation suffered injury separate from an injury to its creditors when allegedly negligent auditing allowed it to write insurance policies that it lacked the reserves to cover,a conclusion we based on the notion that an increase in liabilities is a harm to the company.id.at see also id.at t he damages here are losses incurred on insurance policies that would not have been written but for the auditor negligence.that seems to be more or less the theory on which marion benghiat and marzouca injured bfs because their actions led it to take on additional liability to the investors.
with our case law framing the context,we conclude that marion sufficiently alleged an injury distinct to bfs suffered at the hands of benghiat and marzouca to get past the standing threshold.see lujan defenders of wildlife,d explaining that standing requires a cognizable injury suffered by the plaintiff,that is fairly traceable to the challenged actions of the defendant,and redressable by a court.probing marion theory any further would,we believe,take us into a discussion of the merits of his claims,something separate from the standing inquiry.see warth seldin,d s tanding in no way depends on the merits of the plaintiff contention that particular conduct is illegal.
b.the merits 
we turn to the merits directly,and here the outcome is less happy for marion.there are two factual determinations that the jury could have made in finding both benghiat and marzouca liable that benghiat and marzouca helped bentley infuse cash into his operation knowing that the money would be used to keep the scheme afloat and in benghiat case only that he failed to exercise adequate supervision over bentley operation during a time in which bentley sold securities for ssi 
neither of those findings,however,could give rise to liability to marion standing in bfs shoes.in the case of the first finding,the requisite causal link between benghiat and marzouca actions and the harm bfs allegedly suffered,economic lo
