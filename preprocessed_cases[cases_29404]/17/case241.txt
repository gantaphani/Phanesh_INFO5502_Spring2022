does richard schmidt status as a in a closely held professional corporation preclude him from being considered an employee entitled to bring suit under the age discrimination in employment act applying a functional economic realities test,which this court adopted in eeoc dowd dowd,cir,and recently discussed in eeoc sidley austin brown wood,cir,the district court interpreted the relationship between schmidt and ottawa medical center as more like that of a partner to a partnership,rather than that of an employee to an employer.as such,the district court held that schmidt could not entertain suit under the adea and granted summary judgment in favor of ottawa medical center.schmidt appeals,arguing that the economic realities dictate that he be treated as an employee under the act.we affirm.
ottawa medical center omc was originally incorporated under the illinois medical practice act,before it reorganized itself in as a professional corporation under the illinois professional service corporation act.ilcs et.schmidt,a family practice physician,began his practice with omc in and,upon omc reorganization,became a founding shareholder.he has remained a shareholder at all relevant times since.
including schmidt,there are eight of omc.each has the right to an equal vote on compensation plans,on proposed amendments to employment agreements,on the hiring of and any other matter put to shareholder vote.while being a of omc,schmidt has also frequently served as one of its corporate officers,holding at different times and secretarial positions.most recently in,schmidt was the corporation secretary.during those periods that he was a corporate officer,schmidt also had a seat on omc board of directors.and in march,the shareholders voted to amend omc bylaws to provide that all shareholders,by virtue of their shareholder status,would be directors of the corporation.accordingly,schmidt is once again a director of omc.
omc compensates its in two ways.first,every has executed employment agreements with omc.under his employment agreement,schmidt draws a base salary of a month.second,each is also eligible to share in omc profits via shareholder compensation in addition to whatever base salary his or her employment contract provides.
the formula for determining the amount of that additional compensation has been amended multiple times by the,and schmidt has had the opportunity to vote on each of those proposals.most recently in december,the considered a plan whereby a compensation would equal his or her net medical receipts after deducting his or her pro rata share of overhead expenses,pension allocation,and contributions.because schmidt net medical receipts would not have entitled him to any additional compensation under the proposed plan,he voted against it.he lost.moreover,a majority of voted in to adopt new shareholder employment agreements to supercede their outstanding employment agreements with omc.every besides schmidt has since entered into this new agreement.as a result of the new compensation structure,schmidt has since drawn only the base salary.
an appellate court reviews motions de novo,viewing the record and all inferences from it in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.mccoy wgn cont l broad,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and where the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.here,no material facts are in dispute the parties contest only whether the facts require schmidt to be treated as an employee of omc for purposes of the adea.
the adea unhelpfully defines employee as an individual employed by an employer,and an employer as a person who has twenty or more employees.f,b.to determine whether an organization has enough employees to qualify as an employer under the adea,we have already decided that the economic realities of the workplace,rather than mechanical adherence to corporate forms,shall define the relationship between the parties.eeoc dowd dowd,cir.in dowd,we found that the role of a shareholder in a professional corporation is far more analogous to a partner in a partnership than it is to the shareholder of a general corporation.id.we noted that the economic reality of the professional corporation in illinois is that the management,control,and ownership of the corporation is much like the management,control,and ownership of a partnership.id.since we did not consider bona fide partners as employees for purposes of title vii actions,see burke friedman,cir w e do not see how partners can be regarded as employees rather than as employers who own and manage the operation of the business,we saw no reason to treat shareholders differently,and thus determined that those shareholders should be excluded from the adea employee count.dowd,at.
we must now decide whether dowd applies when we are asked to classify an individual as an employee entitled to bring suit under the act.if it does,and if economic realities control here as well,we must then ask,does dowd require us always to treat illinois shareholders as employers if not,what factors will determine the actual role of the in the operations of the involved entity see fountain metcalf,zima,cir.
we recently asked similar questions in eeoc sidley austin brown wood,cir,where we held that the eeoc was entitled to continued enforcement of requests in a subpoena,when those requests could not be deemed unreasonable given continuing doubt over whether demoted partners should be deemed bona fide partners and thus employers or de facto employees of a law firm in which ultimate decisionmaking authority rested solely with a few Ã¼berpartners.in so ruling,we expressly refused to decide the question of the status,noting that while they possessed many qualities indicative of bona fide partners in a partnership under illinois law that is,their income included a share of firm profits,they made capital contributions to the firm,they were liable for firm debts,and they had some administrative or managerial responsibilities,their individual fates at the firm were controlled entirely by a executive management committee,which on a whim could fire,promote,demote,or raise and lower the pay of the.id.at.
although we reserved the question of the status,had we been prepared to accept a mechanical the use of the partnership form as recognized under illinois state law precluded finding the as anything but partners and,thus,employers under the would have been no need to continue the eeoc investigation into the circumstances of the actual role in the firm.id.at listing additional information sought by the eeoc that would bear on the unavoidably multifactored determination of whether the should be treated as employers or employees.our holding in sidley,therefore,must be read to apply dowd functional test of employee status to determinations of whether an individual claimant qualifies as an employee under the adea 
what remains is deciding which factors,in what we anticipated would be a multifactored analysis,see id.at,shall be important to determine whether schmidt should be treated as an employer or an employee.dowd provides little,we observed that the economic reality of the professional corporation in illinois is that the management,control,and ownership of the corporation is much like the management,control,and ownership of a partnership.dowd,at.while that may be true,as we observed in sidley,all partnerships are not created equal,and,because of this,all partners may not always be employers for purposes of the statutes.sidley,at see also burke,at finding only bona fide partners exempt from the statutes.we will not,therefore,interpret dowd to require us always to treat shareholders in illinois professional corporations as employers such a result would stand dowd on its head,favoring,in the end,labels over realities.
if not to dowd,then where are we to look an exhaustive discussion of the relevant case law in sidley revealed alternate lines of precedent suggesting this multifactored analysis could be conducted either with an eye towards statutory purpose,see sidley,at citing robinson shell oil,d looking to consistency with a primary purpose of antiretaliation provisions in deciding whether former employees were employees under title vi,or under the general common law of agency,see id.at citing nationwide mutual ins.darden,d resolving the circularity of erisa definition of employee by incorporating into federal law agency criteria for identifying relations.but we could not fairly decide which approach should govern on the facts of the case then before us our task was only to decide whether continued enforcement of the requests in the eeoc subpoena was justified.the observation that the law regarding coverage was unsettled led us to conclude that the eeoc was entitled to investigate the issue further.id.at.
the supreme court may ultimately resolve this tension between statutory purpose and agency principles since it has granted certiorari in wells clackamas gastroenterology,in which the ninth circuit rejected dowd test in holding that the conscious adoption of the corporate form dictated that in closely held professional corporations be treated as employees,cir,cert.granted,d.citing the broad purpose of the federal statutes,the ninth circuit refused to allow the shareholders to reap the tax,employment benefits,and advantages of the corporate form,while avoiding federal liability by asserting that they were really partners in a partnership.id.citing hyland new haven radiology,cir rejecting dowd.but the ninth circuit admitted it would not in all instances adhere mechanically to forms echoing justice powell concurrence in hishon king spalding,d,it would not allow a firm to avoid liability for discrimination by labeling the bulk of its employees partners.clackamas,at see also hishon,at.powell,concurring a n employer may not evade the strictures of title vii simply by labeling its employees as partners.the ninth circuit did not discuss what approach it would take to separate true partners from fake ones,nor did it discuss the presumption announced in darden that traditional agency principles define who is an employee unless congress speaks otherwise.sidley,at easterbrook,concurring 
in any event,we need not attempt to resolve this tension here.it makes little difference in this case whether we are guided in our analysis of the economic realities by adherence to agency principles or by attention to statutory purpose.under either approach,we must conclude that schmidt role was akin to that of a bona fide rather than that of an employee.
it is beyond reproach that both principles and statutory purpose would consider control over employment opportunities to be a relevant factor.certainly,in describing the relationship,agency law focuses on control the defining characteristic of the relationship is the possession in the one of the right to control the work of the other.that is,the relation presupposes the right of the master to have the work executed in such manner as he directs and a correlative duty on the part of the servant to perform as expressly or impliedly directed by the master.harold gill reuschlein et,the law of agency and partnership at ed.conversely,t he essence of a partnership is the common conduct of a shared enterprise,and as a result the recognition that decisions important to that enterprise are made by common agreement.hishon,at.powell,concurring.which is to say,the sharing of the control of the enterprise,and by extension each other fate in it,is the sine qua non of partnership.unif.partnership act a,cmt.t he attribute of distinguishes a partnership from a mere agency relationship ownership involves the power of ultimate control.to state that partners are of a business is to state that they each have the power of ultimate control.citing unif.partnership act cmt.
as for statutory purpose,the supreme court has opined that the congressional intent behind the federal antidiscrimination laws was to prohibit those entities where control over access to the job market may reside from exerting any power they may have to foreclose,on invidious grounds,access by an individual to employment opportunities otherwise available to him.ex rel.doe joseph,cir discussing sibley mem.hosp.wilson.perhaps it was this recognition of statutory purpose that led justice powell to conclude in hishon that bona fide partners can not be considered employees for purposes of title vii because a relationship among the partners that contemplates that decisions will be made by common agreement or consent,has a governance structure different from one contemplated or assumed by title vii.sidley,at emphasis added quoting hishon,at.powell,concurring.
here,schmidt throughout his career has shared in the management and control of omc.he was a founding of the corporation and has remained one at all relevant times since.during most of the last decade he was also a corporate officer and held a seat on omc board,and he once again holds a director seat now by virtue of his enduring status as a shareholder.as a shareholder,he possesses an equal vote in all matters put to shareholder vote,including the hiring of and shareholder compensation.presumably as a director,he has in the past and now also enjoys a voice in all matters put before the board.throughout his relationship with omc and continuing to the present day,schmidt thus has had ample opportunity to share in the management and control of omc.
and the mere fact that lately his preferences on proposals have not secured the majority opinion of his fellow shareholders does not alter the fact that with each vote he has exercised this right to control.even though schmidt rejected the current plan because he would be affected adversely by its passage,he nevertheless had the opportunity to participate in revising and voting on it.it is hornbook law that majority rules dictate the governance of partnerships in the absence of an act in contravention of the partnership agreement or extraordinary matters,and thus partnership law anticipates that individual partners may be bound by adverse majority decisions of the partnership as a whole.reuschlein et,supra,at.it is common for partners to vote on compensation that reflects each partner economic contributions to the firm.see hishon,at.powell,concurring divisions of partnership profits,unlike common shareholders rights to dividends,involve judgments as to each partner contribution to the reputation and success of the firm.that appears to be what has happened in this case.
against this conclusion,schmidt argues that his employment agreement,which repeatedly refers to him as an employee,signifies a relinquishment of control over his employment since,among other things,it vests sole authority of patient assignment in omc board.but schmidt is also a member of the board,which confers upon him decisionmaking authority with respect to these matters,including patient assignments.moreover,his employment agreement vests in him absolute authority for the treatment of his patients once assigned to him.therefore,while schmidt may not possess sole authority over the conditions of his employment that is,he only shares that complete authority in equal parts with other members of the board,he does exercise significant control.and since each of the seven other are governed by similar employment agreements,schmidt exercises as much control over his employment as any other member of omc.by contrast,the have no ability to exercise any control over patient assignments or any other matter put to the directors or shareholders.
conclusion 
we need not determine here whether the absence of control in and of itself will distinguish bona fide from disguised employees when the presence of other factors may favor partnership.compare sidley,at discussing the absence of control as a factor weighing in favor of classifying the demoted partners as employees,with id.at easterbrook,concurring relying on the presence of and the spectre of unlimited liability as characteristics in favor of treating the as bona fide,and reuschlein et,supra,at many decisions permit management to be centralized in one partner,or a small committee of partners.where this is done,is still found to exist frequently but only if the other factors are consistent with partnershi
