the issue in this case is whether the district court abused its discretion in denying an award under of attorneys fees and costs to two taxpayers,cecil moulton and gregory pratt,one of whom initiated the underlying lawsuit in this case.the united states the irs would be liable for such sums if it were not substantially justified in its earlier tax assessments,and in the underlying lawsuit in asserting counterclaims,against the two men as responsible persons liable under for the unpaid federal withholding taxes of a company with which they had been involved.
moulton and pratt were shareholders and officers of a company which failed to pay withheld income and fica taxes for five quarters.the government succeeded in holding them responsible for only one of the quarters moulton and pratt won on the other four quarters.moulton and pratt then sought their fees and costs for defense on those quarters.several of their arguments rest on a fundamental misreading of the standards set by this court for responsible person liability,and more particularly on a misreading of vinick commissioner,cir vinick i and vinick united states,cir vinick ii.we clarify and affirm.
background 
william glick founded enterprises,in.the company,which did business as spectrum thin films,made specialized coatings for computer chips,glass,and auto trims.the company did not survive for long,and its assets were sold in.
glick recruited cecil moulton,gregory pratt,and two others to invest in his company.from january through november,the board of directors,which met monthly,consisted of these five stockholders.
among them,the shareholders and directors held a variety of offices.from april through december,glick was the president and chief executive officer of.he was also the chairman of the board until november,when pratt succeeded to that position pratt had become vice president earlier in,after glick had a heart attack.moulton was treasurer and secretary.
by,if not earlier,began to have difficulty paying its taxes.it negotiated a payment plan with the irs,but even with that modified schedule,it began to fall behind in october.entered a tailspin,accumulating large debts.the board employed a variety of unsuccessful measures,which we do not detail here,and glick quit as president and ceo.eventually the company wound down.its assets were sold in march,and the proceeds went to pratt,leaving with at least one unpaid creditor the united states government.all told,the company had failed to pay withheld income and fica taxes for the last quarter of and all four quarters of.
in late,the government assessed the unpaid taxes against moulton,pratt,and glick as responsible persons,pursuant to.it assessed all three of the men for all four quarters of,and it assessed pratt and glick for the last quarter of as well moulton and pratt contested liability,pointing the finger at glick instead.moulton paid just over to the irs and,in february,filed administrative claims for a refund and requests for abatement.when the irs had not taken any action on his refund and abatement claims by october,moulton filed suit in the district court.the government counterclaimed,seeking the amount still unpaid on moulton assessment for.it also impleaded pratt and glick as counterclaim defendants,seeking the amount that remained unpaid on the assessments against each,as the two had been assessed for the last quarter of in addition to all of 
the district court held a bench trial on november and.on december,it issued a memorandum and order concluding that moulton and pratt exercised significant control over the financial affairs of in the fourth quarter of,and are responsible persons under the totality of the circumstances for that quarter.the court also concluded that w ith respect to the earlier quarters,the evidence does not support the government claim that they were engaged in management.citing vinick i and vinick ii,the court stated that o ccasional involvement in business affairs is insufficient to create liability and emphasized that even though moulton and pratt both had authority for some quarters during and,no taxes were overdue in those quarters.the court stated that t here is scant to no evidence of actual exercise of control in or the first two tax periods of.it acknowledged that there was some evidence of an increasing role in financial management in the third quarter of,but not enough to persuade it that moulton and pratt could have paid the taxes at that time.the court ordered entry of judgment in favor of the government for the fourth quarter of.
on march,moulton and pratt moved under for an award of their reasonable litigation costs on march,the district court denied this motion.the order stated,in its entirety denied as premature.in addition,moulton and pratt were not prevailing parties for one quarter and the government had a reasonable basis for the action.
on april,the court entered judgment.on july,after entry of judgment,moulton and pratt again filed a motion for an award of litigation costs under they fared no better than they had before.the district court denied the motion on august.its order was succinct the government position was substantially justified.this was a close case.moulton and pratt now appeal from this order denying the application under 
ii.discussion 
we review for abuse of discretion the district court determination that a taxpayer is or is not entitled to costs under.see jean united states,cir.
under,reasonable administrative and litigation costs,including attorneys fees,may be awarded to the prevailing party in any proceeding involving the determination,collection,or refund of any tax,interest,or penalty under the internal revenue code.a.under c a,a prevailing party is defined as any party who has substantially prevailed with respect to the amount in controversy or the most significant issue or set of issues presented.
there is a key exception which poses the issue here a party shall not be treated as the prevailing party if the united states establishes that the position of the united states in the proceeding was substantially justified.id.c b i.the government position is substantially justified if it has a reasonable basis in both law and fact,a determination made on a case by case basis.jean,at omission in original quoting united states bisbee,cir.
moulton and pratt argue on appeal that the government position that they were responsible for tax debts during the first four quarters in question was not substantially justified.their argument rests,in part,on a misunderstanding of two aspects of this circuit law on responsible person liability.
standard for liability as a responsible person 
the internal revenue code code requires employers to withhold federal social security and income taxes from the wages of their employees and to remit the amounts withheld to the united states.stuart united states,cir citing a,b.the amounts withheld are held in trust for the united states the employer must report the amounts quarterly,and is liable for them from the time the wages are paid.thomsen united states,cir citing.further,the code imposes personal liability not only upon employers but upon their officers and agents who are responsible for collecting,accounting for,and paying over to the government the taxes withheld.id.the provision for personal liability is set forth in,which states,in part 
any person required to collect,truthfully account for,and pay over any tax imposed by this title who willfully fails to collect such tax,or truthfully account for and pay over such tax,or willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any such tax or the payment thereof,shall,in addition to other penalties provided by law,be liable to a penalty equal to the total amount of the tax evaded,or not collected,or not accounted for and paid over.
moulton and pratt argue that the government counterclaim alleging that they were responsible persons for the quarters as to which they were held not liable was not substantially justified.one of their primary arguments is that to be deemed responsible,a person must have actually not simply to pay creditors.this theory rests on a misreading of a phr
