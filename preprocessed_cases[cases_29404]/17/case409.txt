this is a pleading case masquerading as a summary judgment case.employees of a car dealership sued the corporation and its sole shareholder,alleging causes of action for age discrimination and violation of the california family rights act.the trial court granted the shareholder motions for summary judgment on the ground that only the corporation as the employer could be held liable for discrimination,and an alter ego theory was not pleaded in the complaint.the court further granted the shareholder motion for attorney fees and costs pursuant to government code section,subdivision b.
plaintiffs claims regarding the merits of the summary judgment motion are twofold.they do not deny that only an employer may be liable to an employee for discrimination under the california fair employment and housing act feha or for violation of the family rights act.they claim that cooper was an employer under the statutes,the proper test for determining who is an employer being the degree to which that person controls the employee.they also claim that cooper is liable for the wrongdoing of the corporate employer under an alter ego theory.
the alter ego theory was tendered in a motion to amend their pleading to assert it as a ground of cooper liability.the plaintiffs did not make an offer of proof in support of the motion.rather,they offered the facts tendered in opposition to the motion for summary judgment as grounds justifying an amendment.the trial court denied the request on the ground the facts,if true,did not establish cooper liability as an alter ego of the corporation.
we shall conclude that cooper control over the employees is not the proper test to determine whether he was the actual employer.the essence of the alter ego doctrine is not that the individual shareholder becomes the corporation,but that the individual shareholder is liable for the actions of the corporation.mesler bragg management cal d.the proper method for determining whether the sole shareholder of a corporate employer is liable for the wrongdoing,is by the application of an alter ego theory.we agree with the trial court that plaintiffs did not adequately plead an alter ego theory of recovery in their complaint.this being the case,defendant cooper was under no duty to negate an alter ego claim.
plaintiffs attempted to raise the issue of alter ego in their opposition to the summary judgment motion.because the facts they claimed to be undisputed were insufficient to state a claim of alter ego,it is not reasonably possible that they could amend their complaints to allege the theory,and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying leave to amend.
we shall reverse the portion of the judgment awarding attorney fees to cooper because we do not find the action unreasonable,frivolous,meritless or vexatious.likewise,we deny cooper motions for sanctions on appeal because we do not find the appeal frivolous.
factual and procedural background 
we deal with two separate actions,which we have consolidated for purposes of oral argument and for this opinion.in the first action,plaintiffs donna leek,john borden,and cindy buschmann alleged that they were employed by auburn honda,a california corporation,and cooper in the second action leonardo also alleged that he was employed by auburn honda and cooper.all plaintiffs alleged that cooper is the sole owner of auburn honda,owning all of its stock and making all of its business decisions.
at the time of their terminations,leek was,buschmann was,borden was,and leonardo was.all allege that they were replaced by substantially younger employees,and that cooper told leonardo he planned to get rid of older employees in order to reduce payroll expenses.both actions alleged age discrimination pursuant to feha,et.
leonardo complaint additionally contained a cause of action for violation of the california family rights act,et the factual basis for this claim was that just prior to his termination leonardo informed cooper he needed to take leave to care for his terminally ill mother,that cooper became enraged at the request,and that he informed leonardo he had a business to run,which did not include taking care of old sick people.
cooper filed an answer to each complaint that consisted of a general denial and numerous affirmative defenses,including the defense that he had no relationship with the plaintiffs.
cooper then filed a motion for summary judgment in both actions.the basis for the motions for summary judgment was that government code section,barring discrimination against employees,limits liability for discrimination to the employer,not to management personnel.with respect to the leonardo complaint,cooper argued the family rights act and feha contain the same definition of an employer.thus,he asserted the same argument with respect to his claim based on the family rights act.
the plaintiffs responded to the summary judgment motion,arguing that cooper was the alter ego of auburn honda on the apparent theory that cooper was their employer.they pointed to evidence that cooper was the president of auburn honda,and that there were no directors of the corporation,that cooper individually fired the plaintiffs,that cooper individually makes all policy,procedure,and management decisions for auburn honda,that cooper individually owns the land on which the dealership is located,and that he raises the rent as he sees fit.
the trial court granted summary judgment as to both complaints.it ruled that pursuant to reno baird cal th reno,an individual manager or supervisor could not be held liable for discrimination under the feha.it further ruled that plaintiffs had not alleged alter ego liability in their complaint,thus the evidence proffered to that effect was unavailing.the court denied plaintiffs request to amend the complaint to allege alter ego liability,finding that the evidence proffered was insufficient to establish alter ego liability.
the trial court granted cooper motions for attorney fees pursuant to government code section,subdivision b,providing that the court may,in its discretion,award reasonable attorney fees and costs to the prevailing party.cooper was awarded a total of in attorney fees.
discussion 
iemployer liability 
in reno,supra,the california supreme court held that only the employer,not individual supervisory employees,may be held personally liable under feha for discriminatory hiring,firing,and personnel practices.cal th at.by contrast,individuals may be held liable under feha for harassment.ibid.in so holding,the supreme court agreed with an earlier court of appeal decision,janken gm hughes electronics th janken,which reasoned that discrimination claims arise out of the performance of necessary personnel management duties.id.at.by contrast,harassment is not conduct necessary to personnel management,but is instead conduct outside the scope of necessary job performance,conduct presumably engaged in for personal gratification,because of meanness or bigotry,or for other personal motives.ibid.
it is thus settled that only an employer may be liable for discrimination under feha,and leonardo does not argue that anyone other than an employer may be liable for violation of the family rights act.
notwithstanding plaintiffs agreement with the conclusion that liability under the statutes in question extends only to employers,they argue that the policy reasons cited in reno and janken,supra,are inapplicable here.leonardo argues a distinction must be made because cooper is the sole shareholder of the corporate employer and makes all of its management decisions.specifically,he claims that this situation does not result in any conflict of interest between an individual supervisory employee and the employer that would have a chilling effect on management decisions.
janken and reno,supra,expressed the opinion that imposing personal liability on individual supervisory employees would impair the exercise of supervisory judgment,creating conflicts of interest and chilling effective management.janken,supra,th at reno,supra,cal th at.they reasoned that holding supervisory employees liable would coerce the supervisory employee not to make the optimum lawful decision for the employer.instead,the supervisory employee would be pressed to make whatever decision was least likely to lead to a claim of discrimination against the supervisory employee personally,or likely to lead only to that discrimination claim which could most easily be defended.the employee would thus be placed in the position of choosing between loyalty to the employer lawful interests at severe risk to his or her own interests and family,versus abandoning the employer lawful interests and protecting his or her own personal interests.janken,supra,th at,quoted in reno,supra,cal th at.
we agree that these policy reasons are not applicable in this case.nevertheless,the supreme court has made clear that liability for discrimination extends only to the employer,and not to individual employees.plaintiffs make no argument that liability rests with anyone but the employer.instead,they argue that cooper was in fact the employer because of the control he exercised over them.they point to tests other courts have employed to determine whether a person is an employee or independent contractor,whether a shareholder in a professional corporation is an employee for purposes of the americans with disabilities act,or whether two corporations should be considered a single employer for title vii purposes,and argue that those methods are appropriate for determining when a sole shareholder of an employer corporation may be considered an employer.
we disagree.a determination that a person is the alter ego of a corporation does not make the alter ego an employer.rather it makes the alter ego liable for the obligations of the corporation.in this instance,where a third party seeks to hold the sole shareholder liable for the wrongdoing of the corporation,an alter ego theory is the appropriate way to determine whether the shareholder is liable.as demonstrated below,the cases cited by plaintiffs for determining who is an employer for other purposes are distinguishable.
citing vernon state th,plaintiffs argue that cooper is an employer under the totality of the circumstances test.the goal of the totality of the circumstances test is to determine whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor.see lambertsen utah of corrections cir,fn,cited in vernon state,supra.many of the factors to be considered simply make no sense in the context of this case.
thus,determining whether plaintiffs are paid a salary or other employment benefits,where the work is performed,the skill required of the work,the extent to which the work is done under the direction of a supervisor,whether the work is part of the defendant regular business operations,the duration of the relationship of the parties,and the duration of the plaintiffs employment,does not provide any meaningful assistance in resolving whether cooper as an individual was plaintiffs employer.see vernon state,supra,th at.
likewise,the test used by the united states supreme court to determine whether a shareholder in a professional corporation was an employee for purposes of the americans with disabilities act is not helpful in resolving the question of a sole shareholder liability as an employer.that test,taken from the equal employment opportunities commission guidelines,considers the following factors 
whether the organization can hire or fire the individual shareholder or set the rules and regulations of the individual work 
whether and,if so,to what extent the organization supervises the individual work 
whether the individual shareholder reports to someone higher in the organization 
whether and,if so,to what extent the individual shareholder is able to influence the organization 
whether the parties intended that the individual shareholder be an employee,as expressed in written agreements or contracts 
whether the individual shareholder shares in the profits,losses,and liabilities of the organization.eeoc compliance manual.
clackamas gastroenterology associates,wells,d,fn.omitted.
whether the corporation can hire or fire a shareholder is logically related to the question of whether the shareholder is an employee,but not to the question whether the corporation and the shareholder can both be considered employers.again,this is a determination best made by the alter ego doctrine.
leonardo also asserts the integrated enterprise test is relevant.this is a test federal courts have developed to determine whether two corporations should be considered a single employer for title vii purposes.laird capital,th.it looks at the two corporations to determine whether there is an interrelation of operations,common management,centralized control of labor relations,and common ownership or financial control.ibid.again,these factors have little relevance when the issue is whether a sole shareholder should be held liable for the corporation wrongdoing.
ordinarily,a corporation is regarded as a legal entity,separate and distinct from its stockholders,officers and directors,with separate and distinct liabilities and obligations.citations.sonora diamond superior court th,sonora diamond.t he corporate form will be disregarded only in narrowly defined circumstances and only when the ends of justice so require.mesler bragg management,supra,cal d at.before a corporation obligations can be recognized as those of a particular person,the requisite unity of interest and inequitable result must be shown.arnold browne d,overruled on other grounds in reynolds metals co alperson cal d.these factors comprise the elements that must be present for liability as an alter ego.
the various tests asserted by plaintiffs are useful for determining who may be considered an employer or employee in other contexts,but for determining whether cooper may be held to answer for the wrongdoing of the corporation is the alter ego doctrine.
burdens of the parties on summary judgment 
a defendant moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that one or more elements of the cause of action at issue can not be established,or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th.the moving party bears the initial burden of making a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of a triable issue of material fact,and only if the moving party carries the initial burden does the burden shift to the opposing party to produce a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact.ibid.
we must determine whether defendant showing was sufficient to entitle him to a summary judgment.defendant showing on summary judgment was that plaintiffs could not prevail on their claims against him because only an employer may be liable for discrimination or violation of the family rights act.since auburn honda,the corporation,was the employer,there could be no liability attributed to defendant cooper.
plaintiffs response was that cooper was liable under an alter ego theory,or because he was the actual employer by virtue of his control over the employees of auburn honda.they argue the defendant showing was insufficient because there were triable issues of fact as to his liability as an alter ego.thus,before we can determine whether defendant showing was sufficient,we must determine whether the complaint adequately alleged that cooper was liable to plaintiffs on an alter ego theory.only if the allegations were adequate to apprise cooper that he was being held accountable as an alter ego,was it necessary for him to produce evidence that he could not be held liable under such theory.
the function of the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues citations.fpi development,nakashima d,quoting orange county air pollution control dist.superior court d.the pleadings are the outer measure of materiality in a summary judgment proceeding.ibid.the summary judgment procedure presupposes that the pleadings are adequate to put in issue a cause of action or defense thereto.citation.however a pleading may be defective in failing to allege an element of a cause of action or in failing to intelligibly identify a defense thereto.in such a case,the moving party need not address a missing element or,obviously,respond to assertions which are unintelligible or make out no recognizable legal claim.the summary judgment proceeding is thereby necessarily transmuted into a test of the pleadings and the summary judgment motion into a motion for judgment on the pleadings.in these circumstances it has been said that a defendant motion for summary judgment necessarily includes a test of the sufficiency of the complaint and as such is in legal effect a motion for judgment on the pleadings.citation.id.at.
in this case,the plaintiffs do not contend that anyone other than an employer is liable for employment discrimination under feha or for violation of the family rights act.in fact,plaintiffs pleaded that cooper was their employer defendant summary judgment motion adduced facts showing that plaintiffs were employed by auburn honda,rather than cooper.the question is whether the complaint contained sufficient factual allegations to inform the defendant that plaintiffs were seeking relief on the basis of cooper liability as an alter ego.we conclude it did not.
although california courts take a liberal view of inartfully drawn complaints,i t remains essential that a complaint set forth the actionable facts relied upon with sufficient precision to inform the defendant of what plaintiff is complaining,and what remedies are being sought.signal hill aviation stroppe d.fairness dictates that a complaint give the defendant sufficient notice of the cause of action stated to be able to prepare the case.bradley hartford acc.indem.d,overruled on another point in silberg anderson cal d.
auer frank d,auer,noted a split of authority whether the alter ego doctrine must be pleaded in the complaint.some cases say that it must be,while others state that if a defendant is charged with liability,the denial of liability is sufficient to place the alter ego doctrine at issue.ibid.auer,supra,sided with those cases holding that the alter ego theory need not be pleaded in the complaint.ibid.
having reviewed those cases holding that the alter ego doctrine need not be pleaded in the complaint,we conclude they were presented in a different posture than the case before us,and are not compelling authority in this case.in auer,supra,d,the complaint lacked alter ego allegations yet the case went to trial,and plaintiff counsel informed the court during the opening statement that plaintiffs intended to rely on an alter ego theory,that they had not been aware of such a theory when the complaint was filed,but had been made aware of the issue after taking depositions.id.at.the trial court allowed introduction of the alter ego evidence.
likewise in pan pacific sash door greendale park,d,cited in auer,no alter ego allegations appeared in the complaint,but the case went to trial and alter ego evidence was admitted over objection.the court held that the charge of liability and denial was sufficient to authorize the reception of evidence on the alter ego theory,or that the reception of such evidence was not reversible error.id.at.the court noted that the defendants were apprised in advance of trial that plaintiff intended to rely on the doctrine,that both defendants in that case both were corporations were parties to the action and represented by the same counsel.id.at.the court concluded that u nder these circumstances conceding that the plaintiff complaint was deficient in the particular above referred to,it may not be said that defendants were misled to their prejudice by any variance between the pleading and the proof.id.at.
also in gordon aztec brewing cal d,cited by auer,supra,the appeal was after judgment upon a jury verdict.although the complaint did not allege alter ego,alter ego evidence was admitted and an alter ego instruction was given.id.at.in response to the argument that no alter ego relationship was pleaded,therefore it was not before the trial court,the court of appeal reasoned that even if the pleadings were to be considered deficient in this respect,it is clear that the defendant has not been misled to its prejudice by any variance between pleadings and proof from the beginning of the proceedings it was prepared to maintain,and did maintain throughout the trial,that the liabilities of the partnership could not be fastened upon the corporation.id.at.
finally,in marr postal union life ins.d,cited by auer,supra,the case was tried to a jury,and alter ego evidence was presented.the court held that appellant had not been surprised or misled by presentation of the alter ego theory at trial.not having actually misled appellant to its prejudice in presenting its defense,the variance,if any,between the allegations of the complaint and the proof can not be considered as a material variance.id.at.
however,when the court is asked to take some action upon an alter ego theory at the pleadings stage,more is required than was pleaded here.for example,in norins realty consolidated abstract title guaranty d,the action against the corporation was filed in los angeles county,where the individual defendants resided.id.at.defendants motion for change of venue to san bernardino county,where the corporation principal place of business was located,was granted.the court of appeal affirmed,concluding that the action was not triable in los angeles county because although the individuals were named defendants,no facts were alleged from which alter ego liability could be inferred.id.at.the allegation that a corporation is the alter ego of the individual stockholders is insufficient to justify the court in disregarding the corporate entity in the absence of allegations of facts from which it appears that justice can not otherwise be accomplished.ibid.
in sheard superior court d,the issue was whether service on the individual,stockholder defendants should be quashed because the complaint did not allege sufficient facts to support jurisdiction over them.the court found that neither the complaint nor the declaration in opposition to the motion to quash contained sufficient allegations to support the two requirements unity of interest and inequitable result to the application of the alter ego theory.id.at.
here,even though the case arises on motion for summary judgment,it is in fact a pleading case because the pleadings delimit the scope of the issues in a motion for summary judgment,and the question on appeal from this judgment is whether the alter ego theory was sufficiently pleaded to put it at issue for purposes of the summary judgment motion.see fpi development,nakashima,supra,d at.
a complaint must set forth the facts with sufficient precision to put the defendant on notice about what the plaintiff is complaining and what remedies are being sought.signal hill aviation,stroppe,supra,d at.to recover on an alter ego theory,a plaintiff need not use the words alter ego,but must allege sufficient facts to show a unity of interest and ownership,and an unjust result if the corporation is treated as the sole actor.vasey california dance d.an allegation that a person owns all of the corporate stock and makes all of the management decisions is insufficient to cause the court to disregard the corporate entity.meadows emett chandler d.
here,the pertinent allegations of the complaints were that the plaintiffs were employed by auburn honda and jay cooper that auburn honda is a corporation that defendant cooper is the sole owner of auburn honda,owning all of its stock and making all of its business decisions personally and that all defendants were the agents,servants and employees of their,and in doing the things hereinafter alleged were acting within the scope and authority as such agents,servants and employees and with the permission and consent of their.all of said acts of each of the defendants were authorized by or ratified by their.
these allegations neither specifically alleged alter ego liability,nor alleged facts showing a unity of interest and inequitable result from treatment of the corporation as the sole actor.furthermore,although plaintiffs alleged cooper was the employer,the complaint contains no allegations that he should be held liable for the corporation wrongdoing.the essence of the alter ego doctr
