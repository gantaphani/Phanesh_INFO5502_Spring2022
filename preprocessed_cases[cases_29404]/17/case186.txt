having been granted leave to pursue an interlocutory appeal,see.f,defendants challenge an order certifying a single class of plaintiffs.relying largely on central bank,first interstate bank,d,and its progeny,we reverse and remand.
the facts are difficult to detail but easy to summarize.plaintiffs allege that defendants credit suisse first boston credit suisse,merrill lynch company,merrill lynch,and barclays bank plc barclays bank collectively the banks entered into partnerships and transactions that allowed enron corporation enron to take liabilities off of its books temporarily and to book revenue from the transactions when it was actually incurring debt.the common feature of these transactions is that they allowed enron to misstate its financial condition there is no allegation that the banks were fiduciaries of the plaintiffs,that they improperly filed financial reports on enron behalf,or that they engaged in wash sales or other manipulative activities directly in the market for enron securities.
for example,plaintiffs allege that merrill lynch engaged in what they dub the nigerian barges transaction.according to plaintiffs,enron wanted to sell its interest in barges off the coast of nigeria by the end of so that it could book revenue and meet stock analysts estimates for the calendar quarter.it could find no legitimate buyer,so it contacted merrill lynch and guaranteed that it would buy the barges back within six months at a premium for merrill lynch.
six months later,enron made good on its guarantee an partnership bought the barges from merrill lynch at a premium.when enron reported its results for,instead of booking the transaction as a loan,the characterization that enron outside accountants state would have been appropriate had they known of the to buy back the barges,enron booked the transaction as a sale and accordingly listed the revenue therefrom in its financial statement.
plaintiffs allege that the banks knew exactly why enron was engaging in seemingly irrational transactions such as this.they cite certain of the banks internal communications they characterize as proving that the banks were aware of the personal compensation enron executives received as a result of inflating their stock price through the illusion of revenue and that the banks intended to profit by helping the executives maintain that illusion likewise,plaintiffs allege that,although each defendant may not have been aware of exactly how each other defendant was helping enron to misrepresent its financial health,the defendants knew in general that other defendants were doing so and that enron was engaged in a scheme to defraud investors and maximize executive compensation by inflating revenue and disguising risk and liabilities through its partnerships and transactions with the banks.
this suit followed enron collapse in.the first action was filed on october of that year by december,the district court had consolidated over thirty actions relating to enron securities and had designated the regents of the university of california as the lead plaintiff.years of discovery have ensued,and tens of millions of documents have been produced.
early in the litigation,the banks filed motions to dismiss,but the district court denied them in a december,opinion.the court reconsidered some of the issues relevant to those motions in its opinion regarding class certification,issued on june,in light of intervening developments in appellate caselaw.the court justified its reconsideration,stating that it had 
the power to reconsider such interlocutory decisions,especially in light of the limited and much of it recent case law emerging on scheme liability.moreover at class certification,especially after such substantial discovery as has been done here,the court may look behind the pleadings at evidence to determine whether a class should be certified.
the court determined that a deceptive act within the meaning of rule c includes participating in a transaction whose principal purpose and effect is to create a false appearance of revenues.
the district court decided that rule a prohibition of any scheme to defraud gives rise to joint and several liability for defendants who commit individual acts of deception in furtherance of such a scheme.implicit in that ruling is the conclusion that plaintiffs have alleged that just such a scheme existed.
the court theory of scheme liability considerably simplified finding commonality among the plaintiffs with respect to loss causation.the court stated that a reasonable argument can be made that where a defendant knowingly engaged in a primary violation of the federal securities laws that was in furtherance of a larger scheme,it should be jointly and severally liable for the loss caused by the entire overarching scheme,including conduct of other scheme participants about which it knew nothing.
the district court concluded that plaintiffs are entitled to rely on the classwide presumptions of reliance for omissions and fraud on the market the court held that the affiliated ute presumption applies because the facts indicate that the banks had failed in their duty not to engage in a fraudulent scheme.the court concluded,with respect to the presumption of reliance,that no preliminary finding of market efficiency or investors reliance thereon need be made where plaintiffs plead under rule a forbidding deceptive devices,schemes,and artifices and c prohibiting deceptive acts,practices,and courses of business rather than under the more usual cause of action,rule b proscribing misrepresentation.
a month after issuing its opinion on class certification,the district court,after reviewing plaintiffs revised class definition and trial plan,issued its class certification order,dated july.it determined that,although the proportionate liability provisions of the private securities litigation reform act pslra are generally problematic,there is no necessary conflict between the court theory of liability and that statute.see b,f.the court ordered defendants to prepare a list of to whom they intend to assign responsibility and declared that defendants will bear the burden to prove responsibility by a preponderance of the evidence.
the district court certified a class of all persons who purchased enron securities between october,and november,and were injured thereby.the class seeks damages of billion,against which losing defendants would be entitled to offset roughly billion obtained by plaintiffs in previous settlements with former.on november,a motions panel of this court granted defendants leave to appeal the class certification order,and we sua sponte expedited the appeal.
plaintiffs point out that we are not bound by the motion panel decision to grant leave to appeal they urge that leave to appeal was improvidently granted we disagree.
this is a legally and practically significant class certification decision,and the motions panel properly allowed the appeal.the commentary to rule f indicates that it is appropriate to grant leave to appeal an adverse determination where a certification decision turns on a novel or unsettled question of law or a n order granting certification may force a defendant to settle rather than incur the costs of defending a class action and run the risk of potentially ruinous liability.f advisory committee note.
plaintiffs contend that,even if we are entitled to address defendants arguments,those arguments are sufficiently intertwined with the facts to counsel against interlocutory appeal before a complete factual record is established.plaintiffs reason that the banks have not yet been cowed into settling,nor are they likely to be the district court has afforded procedural fairness to all parties and the panel should defer to its judgment by declining to hear this appeal until after the district court has entered a final judgment.
the fact that the banks have not yet been persuaded to settle is no reason to decline a rule f appeal it means only that the litigation continues.as we have recognized,class certification may be the backbreaking decision that places insurmountable pressure on a defendant to settle,even where the defendant has a good chance of succeeding on the merits.see castano am.tobacco,cir.here,where plaintiffs seek to hold the banks liable for nearly the entirety of securities losses stemming from the enron collapse,settlement pressure appears to be particularly acute,so it is appropriate to provide appellate review before settlement may be coerced by an erroneous class certification decision.
moreover,although the legal issues underlying the certification decision are intertwined with the merit of plaintiffs theory of liability,these broad legal issues are not especially contingent on particular facts likely to be further developed in the district court.this case gives rise to unsettled questions of law concerning the entanglement of the merits with the class certification decision,as well as the district court theory of deceptive act liability underlying its finding that common issues of reliance predominate.both of the advisory committee criteria are met here,so we proceed to consider the rule f appeal.
we review class certification decisions for abuse of discretion in recognition of the essentially factual basis of the certification inquiry and of the district court inherent power to manage and control pending litigation whether the district court applied the correct legal standard in reaching its decision on class certification,however,is a legal question that we review de novo.allison citgo petroleum,cir citations omitted.where a district court premises its legal analysis on an erroneous understanding of governing law,it has abused its discretion.see unger amedisys,cir.albeit with the best of intentions and after herculean effort,the district court arrives at an erroneous understanding of securities law that gives rise to its application of classwide presumptions of reliance.
we first consider the scope of our jurisdiction.plaintiffs accuse the banks of repackaging this rule f appeal as a demurrer.they point out that the scope of our review is bridled by rule f.they urge us to refuse to consider the banks arguments concerning the interpretation of b and the prohibition of aiding and abetting liability under that statute they contend that we should accept the district court view of the underlying theories of liability as valid for purposes of this appeal.
the scope of our review is limited,but it is not quite so circumscribed as plaintiffs say.although we may not conduct an independent inquiry into the legal or factual merit of this case as though we were reviewing a motion under federal rule of civil procedure b or,we may address arguments that implicate the merits of plaintiffs cause of action insofar as those arguments also implicate the merits of the class certification decision.
rule f states that a court of appeals may in its discretion permit an appeal from an order of a district court granting or denying class action certification under this rule if application is made to it within ten days after entry of the order.f.the text of the rule makes plain that the sole order that may be appealed is the class certification no other issues may be raised.bell,at.the fact that an issue is relevant to both class certification and the merits,however,does not preclude review of that issue.
after all,the supreme court has refused to designate class certification decisions as collateral orders subject to interlocutory appellate review,precisely because the class determination generally involves considerations that are enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiff cause of action.coopers lybrand livesay,d internal citations omitted.the analysis under rule must focus on the requirements of the rule,and if findings made in connection with those requirements overlap findings that will have to be made on the merits,such overlap is only coincidental.bell,at.see also unger,at.
our circuit conclusion that review of the factual and legal analysis supporting the district court decision is appropriate on review of class certification enjoys widespread acceptance in the courts of appeals and neither the supreme court authority nor the fifth circuit caselaw that plaintiffs cite for the proposition that no merits inquiry is permitted is to the contrary miller and eisen which cited miller to establish the no merits inquiry rule addressed cases in which district courts had conducted inquiries into the merits of claims as part of the class certification decision without reference to the criteria for class certification as the bell rule cited above suggests,the prohibition against looking into the merits applies only to such inquiries,not to evaluations of the merits that overlap with consideration of the requirements for class certification.id.in a rule f appeal,this court can,and in fact must,review the merits of the district court theory of liability insofar as they also concern issues relevant to class certification 
two of the banks arguments on appeal have considerable implications for the substantive legal merit of plaintiffs complaint.first,the district court definition of deceptive act underlies its application of the classwide presumption of reliance on fraud on the market.likewise,its broad theory of scheme liability allows it to certify a single class of plaintiffs whose losses were caused in common by the scheme rather than to certify subclasses whose losses were caused by the actions of individual defendants.both of these arguments are also highly relevant to class certification,but we address only the definition of deceptive act,because it is dispositive of this appeal.
the district court definition of deceptive act is integral to its conclusion that the requirements for class certification are met.federal rule of civil procedure a requires plaintiffs seeking class certification to satisfy four criteria that we have previously summarized as numerosity,commonality,typicality,and representativeness because no defendant seriously challenges whether these prima facie requirements are met,we do not discuss them further.
once the rule a requirements are satisfied,a class may be certified if the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.rule b.we refer to these two requirements respectively as the predominance and superiority criteria 
the district court theory of liability implicates primarily the predominance requirement.to succeed on a claim of securities fraud,a plaintiff must prove a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant,scienter on the part of the defendant,reliance,and due diligence by the plaintiff to pursue his or her own interest with care and good faith.unger,at cir citations omitted.a plaintiff must prove not only that the fraud occurred but that it proximately caused his losses.see dura,broudo,d.
without its broad conception of liability for deceptive acts,the district court could not have found that the entire class was entitled to rely on basic theory,because the market may not be presumed to rely on an omission or misrepresentation in a disclosure to which it was not legally entitled the plaintiffs are likely correct that the market for enron securities was efficient and that inherent in that conclusion is the fact that the market price reflected all publicly available information but the factual probability that the market relied on the banks behavior omissions does not mean that plaintiffs are entitled to the legal presumption of reliance.
market efficiency was not the sole condition that the court in basic required plaintiffs to prove existed to qualify for the classwide presumption the defendant had to make public and material misrepresentations.see basic,at.if the banks actions were,immaterial,or not misrepresentative because the market had no right to rely on them in other words,the banks owed no duty,the banks should be able to defeat the presumption.see gariety,at.
without a classwide presumption of reliance,plaintiffs would have to prove individual reliance on defendants conduct.a fraud class action can not be certified when individual reliance will be an issue.castano,at.because,as we will explain,the district court misapplies the affiliated ute presumption,the presumption is the only presumption potentially available in this case.accordingly,the meaning of deceptive act is critical to classwide certification classwide reliance stands or falls with it.
erroneous presumptions of reliance were at the heart of the supreme court concern when it ruled that b does not give rise to aiding and abetting liability it is essential for us to ensure that the district court does not misapply liability under the guise of primary liability,through an overly broad definition of deceptive act s,and thereby give rise to an erroneous classwide presumption of fraud on the market.
we proceed to the merits of this limited rule f appeal.with all respect for the district court diligent efforts,its determination that the affiliated ute presumption applies to the facts of this case is incorrect.in affiliated ute,the court considered whether a group of investors was required to prove reliance affirmatively where it alleged that bank officers bought their restricted stock without disclosing the bank creation of a secondary market in which the stock would be resold for profit.see at.the court ruled that the investors allegations were not based on misrepresentation under what is now rule b,but instead on a course of business or a device,scheme or artifice that operated as a fraud under what are now rule a and c.id.at.the court determined that,unlike a mere transfer agent,these bankers had a duty to disclose the existence of this secondary market to the plaintiffs.id.at.
where liability is premised on a failure to disclose rather than on a misrepresentation,positive proof of reliance is not a prerequisite to recovery this obligation to disclose and the withholding of a material fact establish the requisite element of causation in fact.id.at.in basic,at,the court later summarized the rule of affiliated ute thusly w here a duty to disclose material information had been breached the necessary nexus between the plaintiffs injury and the defendants wrongful conduct had been established.
for us to invoke the affiliated ute presumption of reliance on an omission,a plaintiff must allege a case primarily based on omissions or and demonstrate that the defendant owed him a duty of disclosure the case at bar does not satisfy this conjunctive test.
assuming arguendo that plaintiffs case primarily concerns improper omissions the banks were not fiduciaries and were not otherwise obligated to the plaintiffs.they did not owe plaintiffs any duty to disclose the nature of the alleged transactions.the district court agrees that the banks lacked any specific duty,but,citing our caselaw,the court finds that the presumption applies because the banks omitted their duty not to engage in a fraudulent scheme neither smith nor any other of this circuit cases is authority for that proposition.
as we will explain in more detail,deception within the meaning of b requires that a defendant fail to satisfy a duty to disclose material information to a plaintiff.merely pleading that defendants failed to fulfill that duty by means of a scheme or an act,rather than by a misleading statement,does not entitle plaintiffs to employ the affiliated ute presumption.in smith,this court discussed only the first element of the abell test recounted above smith stands for the straightforward proposition that a case brought under rule a or c is more likely to be based primarily on omission than is a case under rule b,which requires that a defendant affirmatively make a misleading representation in smith,we never reached the second prong of the abell test,because we determined that,even if there had been an omission,any presumption of reliance was rebutted because the plaintiff would have behaved identically had he been aware of the omitted information.see smith,at.
abell is the law of this circuit,and smith is not to the contrary.when it determined correctly that the banks owed no duty to the plaintiffs other than the general duty not to engage in fraudulent schemes or acts that is,the duty not to break the law,the district court should have declined to apply the affiliated ute presumption.instead,it presumed what the plaintiffs had only alleged that reliance,which is a specific,defining element of the relevant legal violation,had in fact occurred.
the logic of affiliated ute is that,where a plaintiff is entitled to rely on the disclosures of someone who owes him a duty,requiring him to prove how he would have acted if omitted material information had been disclosed is unfair.basic,at.it is natural to expect a plaintiff to rely on the candor of one who owes him a duty of disclosure,and it is fair to force one who breached his duty to prove that the plaintiff did not so rely.here,however,where the plaintiffs had no expectation that the banks would provide them with information,there is no reason to expect that the plaintiffs were relying on their candor.accordingly,it is only sensible to put plaintiffs to their proof that they individually relied on the banks omissions.
having determined that the affiliated ute presumption is inapplicable,we proceed to review the district court determination that basic presumption applies.it does not the court predicates its ruling on an erroneous interpretation of b.
the banks launch a attack on the district court ruling with respect to fraud on the market.first,they argue that the presumption was never properly established the district court overly broad definition of deceptive act led it inexorably to the mistaken conclusion that the banks actions constituted misrepresentations on which the market was legally presumed to rely.second,the banks assert that,even if the plaintiffs did establish the presumption,it was rebutted according to this court standards because the district court erred in ruling that the presumption had been established,we do not address whether it was rebutted.
in basic,at,the court accepted the theory that courts could presume reliance where individuals who had traded shares did so in reliance on the integrity of the price set by the market,but because of defendant material misrepresentations,that price had been fraudulently altered.the presumption is founded on the economic hypothesis that the market is transposed between seller and buyer,and ideally,transmits information to the investor in the processed form of the market price the market is acting as the unpaid agent of the investor,informing him that given all the information available to it,the value of the stock is worth the market price.id.at.citing in re ltv sec.
to qualify for the presumption,however,a plaintiff must not only indicate that a market is efficient,but also must allege that the defendant made public and material misrepresentations,the type of fraud on which an efficient market may be presumed to rely these plaintiffs have not alleged such fraud.
the district court conception of deceptive act liability is inconsistent with the supreme court decision that does not give rise to aiding and abetting liability.an act can not be deceptive within the meaning of b where the actor has no duty to disclose.presuming plaintiffs allegations to be true,enron committed fraud by misstating its accounts,but the banks only aided an abetted that fraud by engaging in transactions to make it more plausible they owed no duty to enron shareholders.
section b does not give rise to aiding and abetting liability in central bank,the court emphasized that securities fraud liability is an area of the law that demands certainty and predictability.secondary liability brings neither instead it gives rise to confusion about the extent of secondary actors obligations and invites vague and conflicting standards of proof in divers courts.see cent.bank,at.unfortunately,the court has left some uncertainty in this regard.
though the court conclusively foreclosed the application of secondary liability under b,it stated that secondary actors such as investment banks and accountants can be liable as primary violators in some circumstances.id.at.the court has never,however,precisely delineated the boundary between primary and secondary liability.as the district court noted,the lower courts have struggled to do so,and our circuit has not previously announced a standard that conclusively governs this case.
although plaintiffs try to reconcile the cases,the eighth and ninth circuits have split with respect to the scope of primary liability for secondary actors the district court adopts a rule advocated by the securities and exchange commission sec,in an amicus curiae brief before the ninth circuit,under which primary liability attaches to anyone who engages in a transaction whose principal purpose and effect is to create a false appearance of revenues.we agree with the eighth circuit that the sec proposed test by which we are not bound is too broad to fit within the contours of b.
the appropriate starting point is the text of the statute.see cent.bank,at.decisions interpreting the statutory text place a limit on the possible definitions that can be ascribed to the words contained in the sec rule promulgated thereunder it is by losing sight of the limits that the statute places on the rule,and by ascribing,natural,dictionary definitions to the words of the rule,that the district court and likeminded courts have gone awry 
central bank was informed by a series of decisions construing the statute and narrowly defining the scope of fraud in the context of securities.in ernst ernst,at,d,for example,the court rejected the sec notion that securities fraud can be committed negligently it has to be knowing.even more significantly for purposes of this case,the court later stated that the language of b gives no indication that congress meant to prohibit any conduct not involving manipulation or deception.santa fe indus.green,d.the court had already discussed manipulation in ernst ernst use of the word manipulative is especially significant.it is and was virtually a term of art when used in connection with securities markets.it connotes intentional or willful conduct designed to deceive or defraud investors by controlling or artificially affecting the price of securities.ernst ernst,at.
the court further refined that definition by stating that manipulation refers generally to practices,such as wash sales,matched orders,or rigged prices,that are intended to mislead investors by artificially affecting market activity.santa fe,at.finally,when evaluating the scope of liability for deceptive omissions of disclosure in the context of insider trading,the court stated,when an allegation of fraud is based upon nondisclosure,there can be no fraud absent a duty to speak.chiarella united states,d.
the eighth circuit,unlike the ninth,has correctly taken these decisions collectively to mean that deceptive conduct involves either a misstatement or a failure to disclose by one who has a duty to disclose.charter,at.that court quoted the technical definition of manipulation from santa fe and stated that any defendant who does not make or affirmatively cause to be made a fraudulent statement or omission,or who does not directly engage in manipulative securities trading practices,is at most guilty of aiding and abetting and can not be held liable under b or any subpart of rule.id.at.
by this holding the court in charter found that there was no liability against vendors of cable boxes who had sold their boxes to charter at inflated prices subject to a kickback agreement whereby they would direct the value of the price inflation back to charter in the form of advertising purchases.see id.at.the vendors were alleged to have known that charter was doing this to falsify its accounts by depreciating its expenses,as capital investments,from the purchase of the boxes,but was booking the increased advertising fees as recurring revenue.see id.in other words,the court dismissed the case on facts extraordinarily similar to the facts that are present here 
the ninth circuit came to a different conclusion.in simpson,the defunct company bought revenue by engaging in the same type of transactions that took place in charterand are alleged to have occurred here.simpson,at.it paid inflated prices for shares or services from thinly capitalized companies looking to generate liquidity so they could go public,in return for which it extracted side agreements that the companies would pay back the value of the inflation by buying advertising from aol to be displayed at homestore website.like charter,homestore would then list its payments to the other companies as capital investments but would characterize its advertising income from them as recurring revenue.see id.
although the defendants were dismissed because they did not meet the standard for liability that the ninth circuit announced,the court promulgated a standard very similar to the one the instant plaintiffs urge us to adopt.the court concluded 
c onduct by a defendant that had the principal purpose and effect of creating a false appearance in deceptive transactions as part of a scheme to defraud is conduct that uses or employs a deceptive device within the meaning of b.furthermore,such conduct may be in connection with the purchase or sale of securities if it is part of a scheme to misrepresent public financial information where the scheme is not complete until the misleading information is disseminated into the securities market.finally,a plaintiff may be presumed to have relied on this scheme to defraud if a misrepresentation,which necessarily resulted from the scheme and the defendant conduct therein,was disseminated into an efficient market and was reflected in the market price.
id.at.see also in re parmalat sec,d.
the ninth circuit relied in part on a law review article that had questioned the assertion that a defendant could be liable only for its own statements because b forbids the use of a device and rule condemns those who act indirectly.what this reasoning overlooks is that the supreme court had appeared to limit the scope of deception rather than the scope of device.
the supreme court has defined device by referring to a dictionary but has pointedly refused to define deceptive in any way except through caselaw d evice means t hat which is devised,or formed by design a contrivance an invention project scheme often,a scheme to deceive a stratagem an artifice,and contrivance in pertinent part as a thing contrived or used in contriving a scheme,plan,or artifice.in turn,contrive in pertinent part is defined as t o devise to plan to plot t o fabricate design invent to scheme ernst ernst,at.citing webster international dictionary ed.having established the meaning of device and relying on it to hold that b requires scienter,the court,in its other cases interpreting b,has established that a device,such as a scheme,is not deceptive unless it involves breach of some duty of candid disclosure 
for this reason,defining deceptive by referring to the same dictionary the court used to define device the approach taken by the court in parmalat,d at,and approvingly cited by the district court a improperly to substitute the authority of the dictionary for that of the supreme court.likewise,plaintiffs reference to the common law meaning of deceptive is fruitless where the supreme court has authoritatively construed the pertinent language of the statute giving rise to the plaintiffs cause of action,the common law meaning of that language is irrelevant.
although some of our securities cases have considered the common law where the supreme court has placed no gloss on the relevant terms,none of this court decisions has contradicted either the fundamental principle just stated or the supreme court interpretation of deceptive.because device is modified by deceptive,no device can be illegal if it is not deceptive within the meaning of the statute.similarly,because the rule may not be broader than the statute,this conclusion as to the meaning of deceptive device precludes an interpretation of indirectly that contradicts the accepted meaning of deception.
the district court definition of deceptive acts thus sweeps too broadly the transactions in which the banks engaged were not encompassed within the proper meaning of that phrase.enron had a duty to its shareholders,but the banks did not.the transactions in which the banks engaged at most aided and abetted enron deceit by making its misrepresentations more plausible the banks participation in the transactions,regardless of the purpose or effect of those transactions,did not give rise to primary liability under b.
having determined that the banks alleged actions were not misrepresentations in the sense of deceptive acts on which an efficient market may be presumed to rely,we proceed to consider whether they constituted manipulation they did not.
manipulation requires that a defendant act directly in the market for the relevant security.the supreme court has cited a dictionary definition of the word but,at the same time,has attached the caveat that,as used in securities fraud law,it is virtually a term of art.ernst ernst,at.although the court has not precisely defined the term beyond providing a few examples such as wash sales,matched orders,and rigged prices,judge higginbotham,in an influential opinion issued shortly after santa fe,exhaustively analyzed the meaning of manipulation and concluded that f rom this study,the following definition emerges practices in the marketplace which have the effect of either creating the false impression that certain market activity is occurring when in fact such activity is unrelated to actual supply and demand or tampering with the price itself are manipulative.hundahl united benefit life ins.
in hundahl,judge higginbotham carefully emphasized that such activity could not take place outside the market for the relevant security and retain the title of manipulation conduct that affects the marketplace indirectly can violate b only if it constitutes deception.id.at.like the eighth circuit,we adopt judge higginbotham reasoning and definition in full,and we are aware of no circuit that recognizes a broader definition.see charter,at.
plaintiffs argue that this course is foreclosed to us by schreiber burlington northern,d,and shores.we disagree.in schreiber,at,the court declared only that its definition of manipulation,insofar as it had defined that term in ernst ernst,is consistent with both the dictionary and the common law.so is judge higginbotham.
in hundahl,judge higginbotham thoroughly analyzed the common law history of the term and concluded that the manipulation cause of action was primarily concerned with keeping free markets clear of interference but does not reach all conduct that might constitute deception or breach of fiduciary duty.see hundahl.at.the court in schreiber,at,citing santa fe,adopted a similar limited construction to determine that not all breaches of state law fiduciary duty constituted manipulation for purposes of the federal securities laws.the fact that the supreme court definition of manipulation is consistent with the dictionary does not mean that it is coextensive with it manipulation is a term of art,and it applies only to conduct that takes place directly within the market for the relevant security.
our holding in shores requires somewhat more explanation.in that case,we adopted the theory,whereby actors who introduced an otherwise unmarketable security into the market by means of fraud are deemed guilty of manipulation,and a plaintiff can plead that he relied on the integrity of the market rather than on individual fraudulent disclosures.shores,at.we determined that lawyers and other secondary actors involved in preparing the fraudulent statements that facilitated introduction of the otherwise unmarketable security could be liable for the plaintiff security purchaser loss.see id.
shores does not preclude the decision we reach in this case.the basis of the theory is that the fraudster directly interfered with the market by introducing something that is not like the others an objectively unmarketable security that has no business being there this is qualitatively different from what the banks are alleged to have done,namely engage in transactions elsewhere that gave a misleading impression of the value of enron securities that were already on the market moreover,in shores the manipulation happened when the bogus security was introduced into the market lawyers and other secondary actors were rendered liable for having conspired to achieve that end in the wake of central bank,however,conspiracy is no longer a viable theory of b liability,so that aspect of shores has been overruled 
nothing in today decision contradicts our precedent.applying the hundahl definition of manipulation,we conclude that the banks actions are not alleged to be the type of manipulative devices on which an efficient market may be legally presumed to rely because the banks did not act directly in the market for enron securities.
as the supreme court did in central bank,it may be worth taking into account certain policy considerations to determine whether our interpretation of b plausibly accords with the will of congress.defendants do,after all,escape liability for alleged conduct that was hardly praiseworthy.according to plaintiffs,defendants could have pulled the plug on the enron fraud instead they profited from it while large numbers of people eventually lost an aggregate sum in the tens of billions of dollars.
ultimately,however,the rule of liability must be either overinclusive or underinclusive so as to avoid what hundahl called in terrorem settlements resulting from the expense and difficulty of,even meritoriously,defending this kind of litigation.hundahl.at strict construction of b against inputting aiding and abetting liability for secondary actors under the rubric of deceptive acts or schemes gives rise to the type of certainty that the court sought in central bank.the banks may exaggerate the length of the parade of horribles they present wherein defendants are continually taken out of and put back into endless securities cases based on,shifting,ad hoc,perceptions of liability influenced by plaintiffs skill at artful pleading.
but the fact that the banks may be on to something serious might be best demonstrated by the fact that in simpson,at,the court attempted to distinguish charter as addressing an transaction not subject to primary liability,a ruling consistent with its own.if there is a distinct difference between the culpability of defendants actions based on the pleadings in those two cases,it is not apparent to us and is likely beyond the understanding of financial professionals who are attempting to avoid liability.
this is not to say that the instant matter should be decided in accord with this court policy preferences.we mention policy only to demonstrate that,even considering the scope of the enron disaster,congress was not irrational to promote plain legal standards for actors in the financial markets by limiting secondary liability.as the eighth circuit has said,
to impose liability for securities fraud on one party to an arm length business transaction in goods or services other than securities because that party knew or should have known that the other party would use the transaction to mislead investors in its stock would introduce potentially duties and uncertainties for those engaged in business dealings.decisions of this magnitude should be made by congress.
charter,at.
the necessity of establishing a classwide presumption of reliance in securities class actions makes substantial merits review on a rule f appeal inevitable.a classwide presumption of reliance is not only crucial to class certification,it prima facie establishes a critical element of the substantive tort.reliance provides the requisite causal connection between a defendant misrepresentation and a plaintiff injury.basic,at.where the plaintiffs several interactions with the market are alleged to supply the basis for their joint reliance on defendants conduct,we must examine carefully the third leg of that metaphorical triangle the legal nature of defendants interactions with the market.
if,as is probably the case here,that legally appropriate examination makes interlocutory appeals in securities cases practically dispositive of the merits,we take comfort in two observations.first,the availability of broad presumptions in this area means that the legal merit of securities cases is somewhat less likely than that of other cases to be contingent on facts that have been only incompletely developed at the time of class certification.second,as we observed in castano,at,class certification is often practically dispositive of litigation like the case at bar.if the certification decision is so entangled with the merits as to make interlocutory appeal dispositive of the substantive litigation,it is incidentally but perhaps happily more likely that the legal merit and practical outcome of securities cases will coincide.
we recognize,however,that our ruling on legal merit may not coincide,particularly in the minds of aggrieved former enron shareholders who have lost billions of dollars in a fraud they allege was aided and abetted by the defendants at bar,with notions of justice and fair play.we acknowledge that the courts interpretation of b could have gone in a different direction and might have established liability for the actions the banks are alleged to have undertaken.indeed,one of our sister that it did.we have applied the supreme court guidance in ascribing a limited interpretation to the words of,viewing the statute as the result of congress balancing of competing desires to provide for some remedy for securities fraud without opening the floodgates for nearly unlimited and frequently unpredictable liability for secondary actors in the securities markets.
in summary,the affiliated ute presumption of classwide reliance can not apply here.likewise,the district court,albeit with the best of intentions,misapplied the presumption the facts alleged do not constitute misrepresentations on which an efficient market may be presumed to rely.
because no class may be certified in a b case without a classwide presumption of reliance,our analysis of reliance disposes of this appeal.we decline to address whether,had defendants actions been misrepresentations on which the market was presumed to rely,they would have been appropriately grouped together as a unitary scheme giving rise to common issues of loss causation among the class members.likewise,we abstain from addressing the manageability of the district court plan to implement the proportionate liability provisions of the pslra.
the order certifying a class is reversed and remanded for further proceedings as appropriate.the motion to stay the trial is denied.the mandate shall issue forthwith.
i concur in the judgment reversing the district court certification order,but i do so on grounds different from those assigned by the majority.i respectfully disagree with the majority as to the issues upon which it decides the case.although i ultimately agree that the certification order must be reversed,i do not believe that the law necessarily prevents the plaintiffs from prosecuting this case as a class action,and,as i explain below,i would remand the case to the district court for further consideration of whether the criteria for certification have been satisfied.
the majority today holds that secondary actors such as the investment banks involved in this case who act in concert with issuers of securities in schemes to defraud the investing public can not be held liable as primary violators of section b or rule unless they directly make public misrepresentations owe the issuer shareholders a duty to disclose or directly manipulate the market for the issuer securities through practices such as wash sales or matched orders.in doing so,the majority aligns this court with the eighth and immunizes a broad array of undeniably fraudulent conduct from civil liability under section b,effectively giving secondary actors license to scheme with impunity,as long as they keep quiet 
although,as i explain below,i can not agree with the majority cramped interpretation of the statutory language of section b,in my view,the majority commits a significant error by even reaching this issue.because the issue on which the majority opinion bases its decision significant and unsettled question about the scope of primarily liability under section b is unnecessary to a determination of whether the plaintiffs have satisfied the prerequisites for maintaining a class action under federal rule of civil procedure,we should not consider it on this interlocutory appeal of class certification.
the investment banks have,however,raised two substantial issues that are related to the district court rule inquiry.the banks argue that the plaintiffs are not entitled to the presumption of reliance because they have not satisfied the requirements of this court decision in greenberg crossroads systems,cir and that the district court erred when it concluded that any defendant found to have knowingly violated the securities laws could be held jointly and severally liable for all of the plaintiffs losses in connection with enron fraudulent scheme.greenberg,in my view,is inconsistent with prior precedents of the supreme court and this court insofar as it purports to relieve securities defendants of the burden of rebutting the presumption.on the latter point,however,i conclude that the district court erred by construing too broadly the joint and several liability provision of the private securities litigation reform act of the pslra.i would remand the case to the district court to determine whether,applying the correct legal standard,common damages issues continue to predominate over individual issues and whether the case can be tried in a manageable fashion.
our inquiry on this interlocutory appeal under rule f is limited to determining whether the district court erred in certifying the case as a class action.see bell ascendant solutions,cir stating that rule f permits a party to appeal only the issue of class certification no other issues may be raised quoting bertulli indep.ass of cont l pilots,cir.we are not permitted to go beyond the issues necessary to class certification and rule on the merits of plaintiffs claims.see unger amedisys,cir class certification hearings should not be on the merits of the class or individual claims.see also eisen carlisle jacquelin,d noting that courts can not conduct a preliminary inquiry into the merits of a suit on class certification.
it is clear,though,that a district court can not certify a class action unless it finds that the plaintiffs have satisfied all of the requirements of rule a and of one of the three subsections of rule b.to fulfill that obligation,it is often necessary for the district court to go beyond the pleadings and understand the claims,defenses,relevant facts,and applicable substantive law in order to make a meaningful determination of the certification issues.castano am.tobacco,cir.in addition,to the extent that issues relevant to the ultimate merits of the case are also necessary to the district court determination of one or more of the requirements of rule,the district court can,and must,consider those issues at the class certification stage.see bell,at see also in re initial pub.offering sec,cir t here is no reason to lessen a district court obligation to make a determination that every rule requirement is met before certifying a class just because of some or even full overlap of that requirement with a merits issue.by the same token,any such issues are also necessarily within the scope of our review on an interlocutory appeal of a district court decision to certify a class.like the district court,however,this court can consider issues relevant to the merits of the plaintiffs claims only to the extent that such consideration is necessary to determine whether the proposed class satisfies the requirements of rule.see initial pub.offering,at a district judge should not assess any aspect of the merits unrelated to a rule requirement.emphasis added.
in the majority view,one of the issues that this court can review on this interlocutory appeal is the district court conclusion that a secondary actor can be held liable as a primary violator of section b and rule for its participation in a scheme to defraud,even though it does not make a direct public misrepresentation or have a duty to speak according to the majority,the district court determination that secondary actors can violate section b and rule by engaging in deceptive acts without making a public misrepresentation or having a duty to speak implicates rule b requirement that questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.b.without that finding,the majority states,the district court could not have concluded that the plaintiffs were entitled to a classwide presumption of reliance,and individual issues of reliance would overwhelm the common,classwide issues,rendering class treatment inappropriate.thus,the majority variously characterizes the district court ruling on the scope of section b liability as integral or critical to its class certification decision.
the majority opinion labors to create the impression of a relationship between the district court decision that securities plaintiffs can state a section b claim against a secondary actor who did not make any affirmative misstatements and the issue of whether the plaintiffs are entitled to rely on the presumption of basic levinson,d.according to the majority,because the banks did not make public misstatements and had no duty to disclose enron shareholders,their participation with enron in fraudulent transactions that lacked any independent business purpose is beyond the reach of section b because the banks conduct is not actionable under section b,the plaintiffs can not invoke a classwide presumption of reliance and because reliance can not be presumed on a classwide basis,individual issues of reliance predominate over common issues.in sum,the upshot of the majority reasoning is that plaintiffs are not entitled to maintain a class action because the conduct for which they seek to take the majority example,merrill lynch alleged conduct in connection with the nigerian barges transaction is not actionable under section b.
with the reasoning that underlies the majority view set out in this manner,it becomes apparent that any link between the district court liability ruling and its application of the presumption is tangential at best.the question of whether the banks can be subject to section b liability without making public misrepresentations is by no means necessarily related to the applicability of the presumption of reliance.although it is true that the presumption requires that there be a public misrepresentation upon which the market can rely,in this case,there were certainly public misrepresentations that arose out of the banks allegedly fraudulent transactions with enron the rub,of the banks primary argument for why they are not subject to section b that enron,not the banks,conveyed the misrepresentations to the market.according to the banks,because they made no public statements,they are,at worst,aiders and abettors of enron fraud.the plaintiffs counter by asserting,among other things,that the banks allegedly fraudulent conduct is not immunized simply because their joint scheme to defraud affected the market only through enron public statements.
the majority leap to reach and resolve this is strictly a question about the substantive reach of section b at the certification stage overlooks a key fact regardless of whether this court ultimately agrees with the district court that the banks alleged actions are deceptive acts within the meaning of section b,those actions affected the market via enron public misrepresentations.thus,this court can determine whether the plaintiffs are entitled to the presumption without delving into the district court decision that the banks conduct is covered by section b.viewed in this light,there is little doubt that in this case the element of transaction causation,or reliance,can be satisfied by the market reliance on enron public representations of its financial health its statements about the transactions in question.see simpson aol time warner,cir a plaintiff may be presumed to have relied on th e scheme to defraud if a misrepresentation,which necessarily resulted from the scheme and the defendant conduct therein,was disseminated into an efficient market and was reflected in the market price.in re parmalat sec,d,applying presumption to claims against secondary actors even though only issuer made public misrepresentations to the market.accordingly,this court can assess whether a classwide presumption of reliance applies in this case without first considering the district court merits ruling on the scope of section b liability.i would therefore find that the latter issue is beyond the permissible scope of our limited,interlocutory review under rule f.
the majority is,of course,correct in some the banks engaged in no conduct within the reach of section b,then the plaintiffs can not prevail against them in a class action.but the plaintiffs inability to proceed under such circumstances would have nothing to do with the need to prove reliance on an individual basis.when this court decides,on a common,classwide basis,as the majority does today,that the banks alleged conduct is as a matter of law,it is dubious to then claim that we are actually finding only that individual issues of reliance predominate over common issues.under the majority reasoning,individual questions of reliance do not predominate rather,reliance is simply irrelevant,because no plaintiff can,on an individual or a class basis,establish that the banks engaged in any actionable conduct.
the mere fact that the resolution of a merits issue against a putative class of plaintiffs would,by definition,preclude the maintenance of a class action simply can not be sufficient to warrant review of that issue on an interlocutory appeal.under such a rule,the resolution of any rule b issue would then become fair game for rule f review.the circuit has rejected just such a approach to rule f appeals.in in re lorazepam clorazepate antitrust litigation,the court refused to grant a rule f appeal despite the petitioner assertions that the plaintiff class members lacked antitrust standing to maintain the suit.in a passage that is particularly pertinent to this case,the court explained that rule f does not permit review of every issue that,if resolved against the plaintiffs,would destroy the class action 
mylan effort to recast its rule b arguments as a challenge to class certification on the ground that a class of direct purchasers lacks antitrust standing,is to no avail.that mylan argument as to antitrust standing may dispose of the class as a whole and thereby preclude a lawsuit by direct purchasers goes well beyond the purpose of rule f review because it is unrelated to the rule requirements.the fact that mylan challenge would be dispositive of the class action is not unlike a variety of issues of law on the merits of a class action because of the very nature of commonality review of such issues would expand rule f interlocutory review to include review of any question raised in a motion to dismiss that may potentially dispose of a lawsuit as to the class as a whole.this result would inappropriately mix the issue of class certification with the merits of a case,which do not warrant interlocutory review pursuant to rule f.what matters for purposes of rule f is whether the issue is related to class certification itself 
id.internal citation omitted.
the relationship between the banks potential section b liability and class certification in this case is no closer than the relationship between antitrust standing and class certification described in lorazepam.despite the majority claims to the contrary,as i explained above,whether the banks conduct can give rise to a section b action under any circumstances need not be decided in order to determine whether the plaintiffs are entitled to invoke basic presumption of reliance,and it is therefore not sufficiently related to any of rule class action requirements to warrant interlocutory review.
even were it appropriate for this court to consider whether the banks alleged conduct can constitute a primary violation of section b and rule,the majority errs by defining the term deceptive in section b in an unduly restrictive fashion.
based on language gathered from inapposite supreme court decisions,the majority opinion concludes that the supreme court has defined deceptive in a manner that both departs from the plain meaning of the word and reduces section b flexible prohibition on directly or indirectly using or employing any deceptive device or contrivance to a much more circumscribed prohibition that applies only to specific misrepresentations or omissions in breach of an affirmative duty to speak.having arrived at this narrow definition of deceptive acts,the majority opinion then finds that,because the banks did not make misrepresentations or have a duty to speak,section b does not reach their conduct,and imposing liability on them would be indistinguishable from the type of aiding and abetting liability barred by central bank of denver,first interstate bank of denver,d 
such a narrow interpretation of section b is neither compelled nor justified by supreme court precedent.the majority conclusion hinges almost entirely on its determination that a court considering the reach of section b can not give the term deceptive in the phrase manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance its commonly understood,or dictionary,meaning because the supreme court has told us that a defendant acts deceptively only if it makes a misrepresentation or remains silent in the face of a duty to disclose.the majority opinion relies primarily on chiarella united states,d,and united states,d,to support this narrow view of the statutory language.the majority view is not statements in chiarella,and other cases can be read together to support the majority but neither is it compelling,and the passages upon which the majority relies fall far short of establishing that the supreme court has limited section b prohibition on deceptive practices exclusively to misrepresentations or omissions.
neither chiarella nor purported to hold that a person can never engage in deceptive action through conduct,rather than speech or nondisclosure.in those cases,the court held that a person who trades on information violates section b only if he breaches a duty to disclose,either to the source of the information or to the other party to the trade.see,at.chiarella,at.those cases,however,dealt only with insider defendants in those cases were prosecuted only for their silence,their failure to disclose that they possessed material information that other investors in the market did not possess.neither of those cases involved allegations of a scheme to defraud.here,by contrast,the plaintiffs assert that the banks engaged in a scheme with enron whereby they structured and entered into wholly fraudulent transactions that were designed for the sole purpose of falsifying enron financial results.nothing in chiarella or forecloses the conclusion that section b can reach deceptive conduct that is not in the form of a misrepresentation or omission in cases,like this one,that involve schemes to defraud.
nor do any of the supreme court other decisions establish that fraudulent conduct is beyond the reach of section b simply because it affects the market only through the misrepresentations of another participant in the fraudulent scheme.as noted above,central bank itself did not reach this question because the plaintiffs in that case asserted only that the defendant conduct amounted to aiding and abetting.moreover,language from other of the court opinions affirmatively indicates that deceptive conduct need not always be in the form of a misrepresentation or an omission.see santa fe,green,d explaining that the court prior cases all included some element of deception,and did not support the proposition that a breach of fiduciary duty by majority stockholders,without any deception,misrepresentation,or nondisclosure,violates the statute and the rule emphasis added.
because the supreme court has not,as the majority opinion maintains,narrowly defined the term deceptive to capture only direct misrepresentations or omissions,this court must construe the disputed statutory language not technically and restrictively,but flexibly to effectuate its remedial purposes.sec zandford,d internal quotation marks omitted.in light of this canon of interpretation,i see no basis for the majority opinion strict,narrow reading,and i agree with the district court,the ninth circuit,judge kaplan,and the sec that section b prohibition on directly or indirectly employing any deceptive device or contrivance can reach secondary actors who,with scienter,engage in fraudulent transactions that are used to inflate an issuer financial results.see simpson,at if a defendant conduct or role in an illegitimate transaction has the principal purpose and effect of creating a false appearance of fact in the furtherance of a scheme to defraud,then the defendant is using or employing a deceptive device within the meaning of b.enron,wl,at,dist.lexis,at adopting sec view that a deceptive act includes a transaction whose principal purpose and effect is to create a false appearance of revenues,which can be accomplished by acts as well as by words internal quotation marks omitted parmalat,d at 
the investment banks also assert that the district court erred by failing to apply this court decision in greenberg crossroads systems,cir,to determine whether the plaintiffs could proceed under the theory.in greenberg,a panel of this court held that plaintiffs who seek to invoke the presumption of reliance must show both that the misrepresentations made to the market were,that they did not simply confirm the market expectations,and that the misrepresentations actually affected the market price of the securities in question.see id.at 
in its june,opinion,the district court declined to apply greenberg to this case.the district court concluded that greenberg applies only to cases under rule b involving misrepresentations,not to cases like this one involving a scheme to defraud under rule a or c.see enron,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.on appeal,the plaintiffs proffer several additional reasons why greenberg does not mandate reversal.plaintiffs assert that greenberg does not apply to cases like this one,where the alleged scheme to defraud stems from the defendants fraudulent efforts to conceal from the market information that would show that the issuer is not actually meeting the market expectations greenberg should not be read to saddle plaintiffs with the burden of showing that the alleged misrepresentations actually changed the market price of the issuer securities and greenberg requirements have,in any event,been satisfied in this case.
i agree with the plaintiffs that this court can not use greenberg to relieve the defendants of the burden,allocated to them in basic and in subsequent decisions of this court,of rebutting the presumption.in basic itself,the supreme court was unmistakably clear that the defendant has the burden of rebutting the presumption of reliance 
any showing that severs the link between the alleged misrepresentation and either the price received or paid by the plaintiff,or his decision to trade at a fair market price,will be sufficient to rebut the presumption of reliance.for example,if defendants could show that the market makers were privy to the truth about the merger discussions here with combustion,and thus that the market price would not have been affected by their misrepresentations,the causal connection could be broken the basis for finding that the fraud had been transmitted through market price would be gone.
basic,at.see also id.at.arising out of considerations of fairness,public policy,and probability,as well as judicial economy,presumptions are also useful devices for allocating the burdens of proof between parties.the clear import of basic was not lost on this court.in fine american solar king,cir,this court recognized that the defendant could rebut basic presumption of reliance only by showing that the nondisclosures did not affect the market price,or that the plaintiffs would have purchased the stock at the same price had they known the information that was not disclosed or that the plaintiffs actually knew the information that was not disclosed to the market.
this court more recent decisions,including greenberg,have at least professed fidelity to basic approach.in greenberg,the court described the presumption as follows 
under this theory,reliance on the statement is rebuttably presumed if the plaintiffs can show that the defendant made public material misrepresentations,the defendant shares were traded in an efficient market,and the plaintiffs traded shares between the time the misrepresentations were made and the time the truth was revealed.the defendants may rebut this presumption by a ny showing that severs the link between the alleged misrepresentation and either the price received or paid by the plaintiff,or his decision to trade at fair market price.
greenberg,at quoting basic,at.alterations in original internal citations and footnote omitted.in parts iv and v of its opinion,however,the greenberg panel changed course and found that it is actually the plaintiffs affirmative burden to show,as a prerequisite to the application of the presumption,that the defendant misrepresentation actually moved the market price of the security in question 
we are satisfied that plaintiffs can not trigger the presumption of reliance by simply offering evidence of any decrease in price following the release of negative information.such evidence does not raise an inference that the stock price was actually affected by an earlier release of positive information.to raise an inference through a decline in stock price that an earlier false,positive statement actually affected a stock price,the plaintiffs must show that the false statement causing the increase was related to the statement causing the decrease.
id.at see also id.at referring to the plaintiffs burden in a case to show that a stock price was actually affected by an allegedly false statement.
greenberg appears to have mistakenly relied on this court earlier decision in nathenson zonagen,cir,as the authority for its decision to relieve securities defendants of the burden of rebutting the presumption.in nathenson,a panel of this court held that where the facts properly considered by the district court reflect that the information in question did not affect the price of the stock then the district court may properly deny based recovery.nathenson,at.nathenson did not,however,expressly purport to convert the defendant burden of rebutting the,for example,showing that the alleged misrepresentation had no effect on the market price of the a burden on the plaintiff to show that the misrepresentation did affect the price of the security.rather,the panel in nathenson simply determined that a district court did not err when it found that the allegations of the plaintiffs complaint affirmatively demonstrated that the misrepresentations in question did not affect the price of the issuer stock.id.at.in other words,the plaintiffs in nathenson affirmatively pleaded themselves out of the presumption.thus,nathenson lends no support to the view that securities plaintiffs can invoke the presumption only if they first affirmatively demonstrate that the market moved in response to the alleged misrepresentation.
because the greenberg panel decision to reallocate the burdens in cases conflicts not only with basic,but also with earlier decisions of this court,such as fine,i would follow those decisions and hold that the defendant retains the burden of rebutting basic presumption of reliance.see,modica taylor,cir when panel opinions appear to conflict,we are bound to follow the earlier opinion.quoting tire,pitney bowes,cir unger,at i t is the supreme court job to overrule basic,in the absence of outright conflict with the private securities litigation reform act.citation omitted.the banks do not appear to have satisfied that burden on the record before us 
the banks argue that the district court erroneously determined that any defendant found to have knowingly violated the securities laws could be held jointly and severally liable for all of the losses caused by enron entire overarching fraudulent scheme.the banks assert that without this erroneous legal conclusion,the district court could not have found that the proposed class satisfied rule b predominance requirement or the manageability aspect of rule b superiority requirement 
before the enactment of the pslra,the general rule in section b actions was that defendants found to have violated section b or rule were jointly and severally liable for all of the plaintiff damages.see,musick,peeler garrett employers ins.of wausau,d noting that violators share joint liability for that wrong under a remedial scheme established by the federal courts tbg,bendis,cir thompson partridge,cir ross licht,the legislative history of the pslra suggests that congress was concerned about the unfairness that could result from the application of the traditional joint and several liability rule in many cases.see,at,under current law,a single defendant who has been found to be liable may be forced to pay of the damages in the case,at,under joint and several liability,each defendant is liable for all of the damages awarded to the plaintiff.thus,a defendant found responsible for only of the harm could be required to pay of the damages.to combat this perceived unfairness,as part of the pslra,congress enacted f,which replaced the existing joint and several liability regime with one of proportionate liability and limited joint and several liability to defendants who knowingly violate the securities laws.f a provides that any defendant against whom a final judgment is entered in a private action shall be liable for damages jointly and severally only if the trier of fact specifically determines that such covered person knowingly committed a violation of the securities laws.if no knowing violation is found,the statute provides that the defendant shall be liable solely for the portion of the judgment that corresponds to the percentage of responsibility of that defendant.id.f b.
the banks assert that,under these statutory provisions,a defendant who knowingly violates section b can be jointly and severally liable only for the damages caused by conduct in which that defendant knowingly participated.anything more,the banks argue,would run afoul of the pslra requirement that the plaintiff must prov e that the act or omission of the defendant alleged to violate this chapter caused the loss for which the plaintiff seeks to recover damages,id.b,and would be tantamount to imposing liability for conspiracy to violate section b.see dinsmore squadron,ellenoff,plesent,sheinfeld sorkin,cir stating that,bank,there is no cause of action for conspiracy to violate section b.as the banks would have it,then,even if they were found to have knowingly violated section b,they could be held jointly and severally liable for only those damages that the plaintiffs suffered specifically as a result of the transactions in which the banks participated with enron.the plaintiffs,on the other hand,assert that because the alleged conduct of the banks,enron,and others was all part of a single fraudulent scheme,any knowing violator can be held jointly and severally liable for harm caused by the other scheme participants.
in considering whether the proposed class satisfied the requirements of rule b,the district court rejected the banks argument and determined that the pslra permits courts to broadly impose on knowing violators joint and several liability for all of the damages caused by a fraudulent scheme as a whole 
the court finds that a reasonable argument can be made that where a defendant knowingly engaged in a primary violation of the federal securities law that was in furtherance of a larger scheme,it should be jointly and severally liable for the loss caused by the entire overarching scheme,including conduct of other scheme participants about which it knew nothing.indeed,express joint and several liability in the statute is a meaningless concept if it is limited to a defendant own wrongdoing.this court acknowledges that it has previously questioned whether liability for conduct caused by all the scheme participants is compatible with the knowing requirement under f a.nevertheless,the court observes that the pslra not only replaced joint and several liability with proportionate liability except when the conduct was knowing,but established a right to contribution under f to provide a remedy for unfairness,and,with a similar result,the judgment reduction formula embodied in f a sic.accordingly this court concludes that lead plaintiff may pursue its claims for joint and several liability against those defendants found to be primary violators in the scheme,as a whole.
enron,wl,at,dist.lexis,at emphasis added internal citation omitted 
the text of the pslra joint and several liability provision does not,on its own,resolve this issue.section f a does not purport to define the scope of joint and several liability rather,that provision simply places limits on who can be subject to joint and several liability.the statute legislative history,however,indicates that congress intended that the potential scope of joint and several liability would remain the same as it was under the law.see,at,at the conference report imposes full joint and several liability,as under current law,on defendants who engage in knowing violations of the securities laws,at,at same.
under the practice described above,any defendant found to have violated section b or rule was jointly and severally liable for all of the damages suffered by the plaintiff no distinction was made based on what portion of the plaintiff damages were caused by,or traceable to,any specific defendant conduct.see tbg,at liability in rule cases is strictly joint and several and is never allocated among individual defendants in deciding the plaintiff claim.ross.at finding joint and several liability for section b claim because the participation of each defendant was essential to the success of the scheme and there is no way to apportion guilt see also alan bromberg lewis lowenfels,bromberg lowenfels on securities fraud and commodities fraud ed.a ny person found to have any liability whatsoever,no matter how insignificant,could be liable to plaintiffs for the total damages caused by all the misconduct.accordingly,there appears to be no support for the banks assertion that any joint and several liability must be limited to joint and several liability for only the damages caused directly by the specific transactions in which they participated with enron.therefore,if the plaintiffs could succeed in proving at trial that the conduct alleged amounted to a single,overarching fraudulent scheme as opposed to,as the banks assert,a number of separate and distinct fraudulent schemes,they should be permitted to recover damages jointly and severally from any knowing violator,and the scope of that joint and several liability should not be limited to the damages caused directly by that defendant participation in the scheme 
the banks are correct,however,that the scope of joint and several liability for a knowing violation of section b must be informed by the reach of section b itself.in particular,it seems fundamental that a defendant can not be jointly and severally liable to a plaintiff unless that defendant is,in fact,primarily liable to that plaintiff.in other words,assuming that a jury finds that the banks knowingly violated section b through their alleged participation with enron in a scheme to defraud enron investors,they can be held jointly and severally liable for all of the losses suffered by any investor who was harmed in some way by their conduct,but the banks can not be held responsible for the losses of any investors to whom they are not primarily liable under section b.
in a securities class action such as this one,where presumably thousands of investors were harmed by a number of different acts committed by different defendants over a period of several years,not every plaintiff will have been harmed by every defendant.for example,if a particular defendant,who was previously uninvolved with the scheme,first structured or participated in a fraudulent transaction to falsely inflate enron financial results near the end of the class period,that defendant could not be held liable under section b to any investors who purchased enron stock the price of which may have already been inflated by the fraudulent acts of other defendants before that transaction.since those investors purchased their stock before the defendant engaged in any fraudulent conduct,they could not state a section b claim against it,because they would be unable to show either that the defendant conduct caused them to purchase enron stock at an inflated price the element of reliance,or transaction causation or that it caused them any harm the element of loss causation.to make the defendant jointly and severally liable for the damages of those investors would,therefore,effectively expand the defendant underlying section b liability to encompass plaintiffs who could not otherwise state a claim against it it would simply be inconsistent with the elements of a section b claim to hold a knowing violator jointly and severally liable for the damages of any plaintiff to whom it is not primarily liable under section b 
that the fraud in this case is alleged to have been the result of a single,overarching scheme to defraud does not alter this conclusion.after central bank,a defendant can be liable under section b only if it commits a primary violation of the statute.see central bank,at.under the district court interpretation of the pslra joint and several liability provision,however,a defendant knowing violation of the securities laws could not only increase the damages for which it can be liable,but could also make that defendant responsible for the damages of plaintiffs who were harmed exclusively by the conduct of others,and to whom that defendant could not otherwise be liable at all.this,in my view,exceeds the permissible bounds of primary liability under section b and amounts to the impermissible imposition of conspiracy liability.see dinsmore,at.
because the district court class certification decision was based,in part,on this legal error,i would reverse the decision to certify the class on this ground only and remand the case to the district court to consider whether,in light of the proper interpretation of the pslra joint and several liability provision,the proposed class still satisfies the predominance and superiority requirements of rule b.
conclusion 
consequently,i concur in the judgment reversing the district court certification order,but i do so only for the reasons assigned herein.i would remand the case to that court for additional consideration of whether,in light of this opinion,this case meets rule requirements for class certification.
