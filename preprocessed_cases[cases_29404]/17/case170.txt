the archdiocese of milwaukee supporting fund,filed this putative securities fraud class action as lead plaintiff against halliburton company and david lesar,the chief operating officer and then ceo during the class period,alleging violations of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of and securities exchange commission rule b.the district court denied the plaintiff motion for class certification under,and plaintiff appeals that order.finding no abuse of discretion by the district court,we affirm the denial of class certification.
this is a private securities case.under the theory,it is assumed that in an efficient,market all public information about a company is known to the market and is reflected in the stock price.when a company has publicly made material misrepresentations about its business,we may presume that a person who buys the company stock has relied on the false information.the stockholder then suffers losses if the falsity becomes known and the stock price declines.see basic levinson it is the response of the market to the correction that proves the effect of the false information and measures the plaintiff stockholder loss.
plaintiff here claims that halliburton made false statements about three areas of its business halliburton potential liability in asbestos litigation,halliburton accounting of revenue in its engineering and construction business,and the benefits to halliburton of a merger with dresser industries.it contends that investors lost money when halliburton issued subsequent disclosures correcting the false statements and the market declined following the negative news.in order to obtain class certification on its claims,plaintiff was required to prove loss causation,that the corrected truth of the former falsehoods actually caused the stock price to fall and resulted in the losses 
the district court denied class certification because it found that plaintiff failed to prove this causal relationship.we review the district court certification decision for an abuse of discretion,but we review de novo the legal standards employed by the district court.fener operating eng rs constr.indus.miscellaneous pension fund local plaintiff contends that the district court applied an erroneous standard for loss causation and required it to prove more than is required under law.our review of the district court order and the evidence leads us to conclude,however,that the district court fully understood loss causation under our precedent and correctly applied the legal standard.as we explain,the district court decision was well supported and was not an abuse of discretion.
before discussing the plaintiff specific allegations against halliburton,we first set forth the appropriate framework for a private securities fraud case and consider the district court application of that framework.a securities fraud claim under b of the securities exchange act and rule requires a plaintiff to show a material misrepresentation or omission scienter a connection with the purchase or sale of a security reliance economic loss and loss causation.dura,broudo in the case of a putative class,a plaintiff may create a rebuttable presumption of reliance under the theory by showing that the defendant made public material misrepresentations,the defendant shares were traded in an efficient market,and the plaintiffs traded shares between the time the misrepresentations were made and the time the truth was revealed.greenberg crossroads,a defendant may rebut the presumption by a ny showing that severs the link between the alleged misrepresentation and either the price received or paid by the plaintiff,or his decision to trade at fair market price.
here,the parties contest only the alleged misrepresentations and do not dispute the efficiency of the market or plaintiff trading activity.in order to take advantage of the presumption of reliance,plaintiff must prove that the misrepresentation or omission materially affected the market price of the security.alaska pension fund flowserve in other words,plaintiff must show that an alleged misstatement actually moved the market.thus,we require plaintiffs to establish loss causation in order to trigger the presumption.and we require this showing at the class certification stage by a preponderance of all admissible evidence.
the district court explicitly recognized the need for plaintiff to establish a causal link between the alleged falsehoods and its losses in order to invoke the market presumption.see nathenson zonagen,the court also correctly recognized that the causal connection between an allegedly false statement and the price of a stock may be proved either by an increase in stock price immediately following the release of positive information,or by showing negative movement in the stock price after release of the alleged truth of the earlier falsehood plaintiff here relies only on stock price decreases following allegedly corrective disclosures by halliburton.
that being the case,the district court correctly noted that plaintiff has an added burden because it is not enough merely to show that the market declined after a statement reporting negative news we must bear in mind that the main concern when addressing the presumption of reliance is whether allegedly false statements actually inflated the company stock price by relying on a decline in price following a corrective disclosure as proof of causation,a plaintiff need prove that its loss resulted directly because of the correction to a prior misleading statement otherwise there would be no inference raised that the original,allegedly false statement caused an inflation in the price to begin with in other words,the decline in price following a corrective disclosure must raise an inference that the price was actually affected by earlier alleged misrepresentations we therefore require plaintiffs to show that a loss occurred from the decline in stock price because the truth ma de its way into the marketplace,rather than for some other reason,such as a result of changed economic circumstances,changed investor expectations,new or facts,conditions,or other factors independent of the fraud.similarly,if a company releases multiple items of negative information on the same day,the plaintiff must establish a reasonable likelihood that a subsequent decline in stock price is due to the revelation of the truth of the earlier misstatement rather than to the release of the unrelated negative information in this way,the plaintiff must satisfy the court that its loss likely resulted from the specific correction of the fraud and not because of some independent reason.a subsequent disclosure that does not correct and reveal the truth of the previously misleading statement is insufficient to establish loss causation 
causation therefore requires the plaintiff to demonstrate the joinder between an earlier false or deceptive statement,for which the defendant was responsible,and a subsequent corrective disclosure that reveals the truth of the matter,and that the subsequent loss could not otherwise be explained by some additional factors revealed then to the market this requirement that the corrective disclosure reveal something about the deceptive nature of the original false statement is consistent with liability in a securities fraud action,where it is those who affirmatively misrepresent a material fact affecting the stock price that are held responsible for losses 
it is also necessary that the earlier positive misrepresentation not be confirmatory.confirmatory information is already known to the market and,having been previously digested by the market,will not affect the stock price 
after surveying our precedent,the district court correctly summed up plaintiff burden in this case by stating that because plaintiff presented no evidence that a false,positive statement caused a positive effect on the stock price,plaintiff would have to show that an alleged corrective disclosure causing the decrease in price is related to the false,positive statement made earlier,and that it is more probable than not that it was this related corrective disclosure,and not any other unrelated negative statement,that caused the stock price decline.this was the correct standard 
plaintiff argues that the district court misapplied our precedent,however,because it incorrectly required plaintiff to prove actual fraud at the class certification stage.plaintiff asserts that this requirement runs afoul of our recent decision in flowserve we do not agree with the plaintiff reading of flowserve or its characterization of the district court opinion.
in flowserve,certain alleged misstatements by the defendant concerned projected earnings guidance released in october for the company fiscal year.the subsequent alleged corrective disclosures were downward revisions to the earnings guidance released in july and september.the defendant argued that the standard for loss causation required plaintiffs to show a disclosure that fully corrected prior misstatements,which had not occurred in either of the alleged corrective disclosures we rejected that approach,but we also insisted that plaintiffs need to show more than that a subsequent disclosure reveals the defendant true financial condition we held that the disclosure must reflect part of the relevant truth the truth obscured by the fraudulent statements.the flowserve court found erroneous the district court belief that the defendant revised earnings guidance in july and september was not relevant to any prior alleged misrepresentations,and we therefore reversed the district court denial of class certification 
but flowserve did not eliminate the requirement at class certification that plaintiffs must prove the corrective disclosure shows the misleading or deceptive nature of the prior positive statements we have previously explained that the relevant truth necessary in an alleged corrective disclosure is such that the truth disclosed must simply make the existence of the actionable fraud more probable than it would be without that alleged fact taken as true.lormand unwired,when confronted with allegedly false financial predictions and estimates,the district court must decide whether the corrective disclosure more probably than not shows that the original estimates or predictions were designed to defraud.as we held in flowserve,i f plaintiff can not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the market learned more than that defendant earnings guidance was lower and so its business seemed less valuable,it can not establish that its loss was caused by defendant misstatements thus,the truth revealed by the corrective disclosure must show that the defendant more likely than not misled or deceived the market with earnings misstatements that inflated the stock price and are actionable.otherwise,the misstatements would do little more than touch upon the alleged loss rather than cause the loss 
we are satisfied that the district court here understood the need for the corrective disclosures to reveal the actionable truth about prior misstatements the district court correctly stated that i mportantly,it is the misrepresentations themselves,not the corrective disclosures,which form the basis of a valid securities fraud claim unless actionable statements,which were later corrected,are identified,plaintiffs can not establish loss causation.the court went on to conclude that plaintiff largely failed to identify disclosures that had a corrective effect linked to a specific misrepresentation,as opposed to simply a negative effect,and that many of the alleged corrective disclosures constituted confirmatory information.we therefore conclude that the district court did not apply an incorrect legal standard,and we turn to the specific statements and corrective disclosures alleged in plaintiff complaint.
plaintiff contends that it has identified specific misrepresentations by halliburton and linked those misrepresentations to partial corrective disclosures.it asserts that the allegations of its complaint together with the report of its expert,jane nettesheim,demonstrated that those disclosures are related to the misrepresentations and proximately caused its losses.upon examining the alleged corrective disclosures and the evidence,we remain unpersuaded.
plaintiff relies on three general categories of alleged misstatements by halliburton made during a class period of june,to december.the first category of statements concerns halliburton exposure to liability in asbestos litigation and the company stated reserves for such litigation.the allegedly corrective statements were made in press releases and sec filings on june,august,october,and december.
halliburton asbestos liability derived from its merger with dresser industries and from a former subsidiary of dresser known as refractories company.as of may,halliburton reported that its reserves were approximately million to cover liability.on june,halliburton reported in a press release that had asked halliburton to provide financial assistance for asbestos claims that had previously agreed to assume when it spun off from dresser in.the release reported that this was a new development,as had previously reaffirmed its responsibility for those claims.halliburton reported in the press release that in response it would need to increase its asbestos reserves by million to million,after tax.on august,halliburton filed a form with the sec reporting that its asbestos reserves were million.on october,halliburton announced in a press release that a mississippi jury had returned a plaintiff verdict in an asbestos suit on october,for which halliburton was responsible for million.then on december and,halliburton reported in a sec filing and press release additional judgments against dresser in other asbestos cases.halliburton stock price declined following each of these statements.plaintiff contends that the filings and press releases related directly to and corrected halliburton previous misrepresentations that its asbestos reserves were adequate.we find no merit to this contention.
the june,press release does not correct any specific misrepresentation by revealing a previously obscured truth nowhere in the release is there any mention of prior asbestos reserve estimates,and plaintiff makes no argument that halliburton made prior statements about exposure from claims related to at most,the release relates to prior estimates that asbestos reserve levels were adequate generally,but it does not correct a specific prior alleged misstatement just as merely lowering earnings estimates does not reveal that a defendant previously misrepresented those estimates,merely raising the asbestos reserves does not show that those prior reserve estimates were intentionally market must learn more than that halliburton business was potentially less valuable because of erroneous estimates of asbestos liability we agree with the district court that the situation could be different if plaintiff had alleged that halliburton previously stated it was including claims in its asbestos reserve estimates but actually did not do so,or if halliburton had previously stated it had no exposure from claims and that it would not cover them,when in fact that was not true.instead,plaintiff asks us to draw an inference that the june,press release corrected prior allegedly false estimates of asbestos reserves merely because those reserves changed.but a company is allowed to be proven wrong in its estimates,and we can discern no indication from the june,press release that halliburton prior asbestos reserve estimates were misleading or deceptive it follows that the june,press release was not an actionable corrective disclosure.
the same is true for the august,october,and december,sec filings and press releases.although halliburton reported a much larger reserve for the asbestos litigation on august,this information was actually confirmatory because halliburton had previously reported that it would need to increase its reserves by an additional amount of approximately million,after tax.the august,form reported,consistent with halliburton prior statements,that the company recorded as discontinued operations an accrual of million million,after tax.
the announcements of various jury verdicts were also not actionable corrections.as noted by the district court,halliburton actually repeated in a series of public filings the warning about the uncertainties of litigation and the possibility that a series of adverse court rulings could materially impact the expected resolution of asbestos claims.we are not moved by plaintiff suggestion that these warnings,which appeared in at least five of halliburton and filings,constituted mere boilerplate disclaimers of the risks associated with litigation 
neither the announcement of the mississippi verdict nor the verdicts in other states demonstrated that halliburton previous estimates of asbestos liability obscured the relevant truth about the asbestos estimates while plaintiff cites news reports about the asbestos verdicts and has shown that halliburton stock price reacted to the negative news,a decline in price following negative news does not prove loss causation we see in the evidence concerning the asbestos litigation a pattern of halliburton keeping the market abreast of asbestos developments as they occurred and its necessary adjustments to the litigation reserves.we think this undermines any conclusion that the statements corrected prior misrepresentations or that the company acted with deception.
we reach a similar conclusion with respect to the second and third group of alleged public misrepresentations by halliburton.these alleged misrepresentations concern the benefits to halliburton of its merger with dresser industries,and the company accounting of revenue from on construction and engineering contracts unapproved claims.the alleged corrective disclosures occurred on october,january,october,and december.
halliburton announced on october,that it was selling its interest in two dresser joint ventures and that it expected its third quarter earnings to be less than previously expected,due in part to lower than expected profits from joint ventures and other business units of the dresser group.on january,two analysts reduced their earnings estimates for halliburton after discussions with company executives.according to plaintiff,the october announcement and the analyst reports exposed the inaccuracy of halliburton previous positive statements about merging with dresser,particularly statements in july and september that halliburton expected annualized cost savings of million from the merger.
even if it were possible to say that the prior statements were more than erroneous expectations,both the october,announcement and the analyst reports contained multiple pieces of negative news.this required plaintiff to demonstrate that there is a reasonable likelihood that the cause of the decline in price is due to the revelation of the truth and not the release of the unrelated negative information.this showing of loss causation is a rigorous process and requires both expert testimony and analytical research or an event study that demonstrates a linkage between the culpable disclosure and the movement 
plaintiff expert failed to do this.the october,announcement reported that the dresser equipment group was experiencing lower than expected profits that there had been a decline in the downstream engineering and construction business segment and that the earnings of the energy services group would be flat or only slightly higher because of low spending levels by energy industry customers.as a result of these items,the release then reported lower guidance on halliburton third quarter earnings per share.nettesheim indicated in her expert report that the decline in halliburton stock price following the october,release was due to the reduction in the earnings guidance and recognized that the lower guidance in turn was based on more than one factor.when questioned about the report,however,nettesheim testified that she did not perform any statistical or econometrical analyses of the three different pieces of information in the release because she was not asked to do so.nettesheim report indicated that her conclusions were based on statements from news commentary and analysts.we have characterized such evidence as merely speculation.
similarly,the january analyst reports indicated that the earnings estimate was reduced because of less powerful synergies from the dresser merger and because of reduced expectations for offshore construction and a reduced growth estimate for oilfield spending.although she recognized that the reports included information,especially the decline in oilfield spending,nettesheim presented no evidence to show that news related to dresser more probably affected the stock price than the other negative information 
plaintiff also argues generally that several alleged corrective disclosures demonstrated the falsity of former ceo dick cheney statement about dresser that t he merger with dresser industries is now behind us and t he potential rewards to our shareholders are vast.we think,however,that this statement,appearing in a letter in halliburton annual report,is the kind of generalized positive statement about a company progress that is not a basis for liability.
turning to alleged misstatements about halliburton accounting methodology,plaintiff contends that halliburton improperly recorded in construction contracts as revenue by misleadingly deeming the probable of collection,even if a customer had not agreed to pay the additional amount.plaintiff argues that halliburton revealed the falsity of its previous accounting methods when it announced on october,that it would undertake a massive restructuring of its construction business and it announced on december,that it would take a fourth quarter charge of million as a result of the restructuring.
plaintiff fails to show these announcements corrected any prior misleading statements and revealed deceptive practices in halliburton accounting assumptions.the october press release does not mention fixed price contracts,unapproved claims,or the method for recognition of revenue from such claims.rather than revealing the truth about unapproved claims,the release attributes a large drop in the group revenue to a decline in customer spending.nettesheim expert opinion that the october disclosure concerned the company booking of unapproved claims is also conclusory.she admitted in her deposition testimony that she did not match the october statements to any particular prior misrepresentations by halliburton.
nettesheim report shows that she relied for her conclusions on her examination of news reports and statements from analysts and the subsequent stock price movement.but the news reports nettesheim cited discuss only problems and weak results generally in halliburton engineering and construction business.nettesheim makes too great a leap in her conclusion that because analysts reduced earnings estimates based on weakness in halliburton construction business as a whole,the downgrades to estimates were due to halliburton improperly recognizing revenue from unapproved claims.we see no such relationship evident in the statements.
finally,we find no loss causation evident from the december,announcement,which indicated that the million fourth quarter charge would include million for reorganization costs,leaving approximately million for project specific matters as with other alleged corrective disclosures,the december announcement included clearly negative information.for example,the release informed the market about the poor near term market outlook for the downstream engineering and construction business,which halliburton attributed to a consolidating customer base,difficult relationships with certain customers,and some financially stressed competitors and a fiercely competitive environment.the negative information constituted changes in market conditions and the competitive environment that halliburton faced,which plaintiff expert failed to differentiate from any allegedly culpable information.
the market recognized that halliburton business faced general economic difficulties and pressures.one reporting service,cibc world markets,noted the following after the december release 
the customer base for engineering and construction is consolidating and financially pressured
