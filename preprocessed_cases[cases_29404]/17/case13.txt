this stockholders class action suit challenging the fairness of a corporate merger raises the issue of whether the district court precipitately granted summary judgment in light of plaintiffs rule d affidavit outlining the discovery they needed to respond to the dispositive motion.after a thorough and careful review of the entire record,we find that plaintiffs should have been afforded the opportunity to conduct additional discovery,and,therefore,remand this matter for further proceedings below.
background 
plaintiffs maz partners,lp maz and peter blakeslee were holders of class a common stock of phc,phc.they filed separate but similar class action suits in massachusetts,alleging that an announced merger between phc and acadia healthcare company,acadia was the result of an unfair process that provided them with too little compensation.plaintiffs sued phc,acadia,and acadia merger sub,llc merger sub,an entity created to facilitate the merger,as well as phc chairman,several directors,and a board member collectively,the individual defendants.maz filed in state court,while blakeslee filed in federal court.plaintiffs claims included breaches of fiduciary duty,aiding and abetting those breaches,and a disclosure violation.
plaintiffs claim that defendants breached their fiduciary duty to class a stockholders because the announced merger between phc and acadia gave them only one quarter of one share of acadia common stock for each share of phc stock they owned.in contrast,in addition to the one quarter of one share of acadia common stock,a million cash payment was made to the holders of phc class b common stock,of which was owned by defendant bruce shear,phc president,chief executive officer,and chairman.shear negotiated the merger terms.
in the maz case,a massachusetts superior court judge entered a discovery order allowing discovery in connection with maz filing of a preliminary injunction motion to stop the merger.defendants then removed the case to federal court.the parties reached an agreement plaintiffs would not seek remand and defendants would provide expedited discovery.maz alleges that defendants only produced limited and redacted materials.after the day period for remand expired,defendants filed a motion to stay discovery.although the court ultimately denied the stay of discovery,defendants produced only a handful of documents and no depositions were taken.
plaintiffs filed amended complaints and all defendants moved to dismiss those complaints under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.at the hearing on the motions to dismiss,the federal district court consolidated the two and took the motions to dismiss under advisement.after the hearing and while the motions to dismiss were pending,the merger was consummated.
the district court granted in part and denied in part the motions to dismiss.in re phc,civ.gao,wl,at.the claims against phc,the corporation itself,were dismissed,as was the disclosure claim.id.at.plaintiffs remaining claims breach of fiduciary duty against the individual defendants,and aiding and abetting against acadia and merger sub all survived.id.at.
remaining defendants again sought to dismiss the complaints,this time by filing a motion for judgment on the pleadings under rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure.at that hearing,the district court denied the motion for procedural reasons and then stated that a motion for summary judgment may be appropriate but the court did not know whether we at the stage yet where there would be agreement on both sides that the factual record is so clear that that appropriate.the district court went on to anticipate the possibility of a motion under rule d of the federal rules of civil procedure and said i think we should maybe just permit some discovery before the summary judgment motion is filed and head that off.
a month after the denial of their rule c motion,defendants moved for summary judgment.apparently ignoring the district court caution about the need for discovery first,defendants argued that plaintiffs had no viable claims.regarding the breach of fiduciary duty and aiding and abetting claims,defendants argued that plaintiffs lacked evidence.plaintiffs opposed the motion,arguing that it was entirely premature and,just as the district court predicted,submitted an affidavit pursuant to rule d of the federal rules of civil procedure rule affidavit.the rule affidavit chronicles plaintiffs attempts to obtain discovery and defendants failure to provide it.it delineates the categories of information about which the identified witnesses are likely to have information and specifies the essential information,in defendants hands,that would support plaintiffs opposition to the motion for summary judgment.in addition to arguing that it was premature for the district court to entertain a summary judgment motion,plaintiffs also opposed the motion on its merits.
the district court granted summary judgment without addressing the lack of discovery or the rule affidavit.instead,the district court concluded that the case could be framed as a lack of standing or as the absence of proof of an essential element of the claims.in either event,the fact that the plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate that they have suffered an actual injury is fatal to their claims.in re phc.s holder,civ,wl,at.judgment entered in favor of defendants.
plaintiffs appealed,asserting various substantive errors in the district court ruling and arguing that the district court abused its discretion by effectively denying their invocation of rule d by granting summary judgment.defendants argue that the rule affidavit was legally insufficient and they seek affirmance on other grounds.in light of the rule affidavit,we hold that the district court abused its discretion by not allowing discovery before ruling on the motion for summary judgment we need not delve into any other assertions of error.
standard of review 
ordinarily,a review by this court of the grant of summary judgment is de novo.morelli webster,cir.however,because we ultimately conclude that the district court erred in not affording appropriate consideration to the rule affidavit,our review is for abuse of discretion.see rivera almodóvar instituto socioeconómico comunitario,cir we review a district court denial of a rule d motion for abuse of discretion.under the abuse of discretion standard,we will not reverse a district court discovery order unless it appears that the order was plainly wrong and resulted in substantial prejudice to the aggrieved party.sánchez rodríguez v.at t mobility p,cir quoting universal commc,lycos,cir.
discussion 
the district court summary judgment decision addressed neither plaintiffs invocation of rule d nor their assertion of the lack of discovery.the district court grant of summary judgment,however,necessarily denied plaintiffs request for relief pursuant to rule d.
although our review of the decision below as it relates to rule d is for abuse of discretion,this court has been clear and concordant in its direction to district courts regarding how to analyze rule d issues consistent with the salutary purposes underlying rule f district courts should construe motions that invoke the rule generously,holding parties to the rule spirit rather than its letter.resolution trust bridge,cir.
under rule d,i f a nonmovant shows by affidavit or declaration that,for specified reasons,it can not present facts essential to justify its opposition to a motion for summary judgment,then the district court may defer considering the motion or deny it allow time to obtain affidavits or declarations or to take discovery or issue any other appropriate order.d.
