d j tire appellant appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of hercules tire rubber company and lawrence seawell,a hercules officer collectively,appellees.appellant,a former hercules minority shareholder,sued appellees for breach of fiduciary duty arising out of seawell failure to disclose that hercules was in talks to be acquired by fd g associates fd g when seawell served as a mandatary on appellant behalf to redeem appellant shares,and that hercules is vicariously liable for seawell breach.appellant also sought rescission of its stock redemption based on fraud by hercules directors for not disclosing the acquisition discussions.appellant claims that had it known of fd g impending purchase,it would not have redeemed its stock.because we find that the grant of summary judgment was premature,we vacate and remand to the district court.
factual and procedural background 
hercules is a connecticut corporation with its principal place of business in ohio.during the relevant time period,seawell served as hercules chief financial officer cfo,and resided in ohio.hercules operated a sales cooperative for tire retailers in louisiana and other states.appellant,a tire retailer,incorporated and domiciled in louisiana,was one of hercules stockholders,owning fourteen shares.
in september,hercules engaged morgan keegan company to conduct a business valuation,and to identify and approach potential buyers.by january,morgan keegan reported that the equity value of the business was roughly million,or per share,and that there were several interested buyers.on january,appellant informed hercules that it wished to redeem its stock and apply the proceeds to the outstanding balance it owed hercules.seawell responded,in a letter dated february,that in order to complete the transaction,appellant would need to execute a stock power of attorney to seawell.seawell also informed appellant that hercules would honor redemption at percent of book value because it considered appellant redemption a hardship withdrawal.james greer,an officer and agent for appellant,executed the stock power of attorney on behalf of appellant on february.the document read 
i,james greer,hereby sell,assign and transfer unto the hercules tire and rubber company shares of common stock of the hercules tire rubber company standing in their name on the books of said corporation represented by of sic certificate no.herewith and do hereby irrevocably constitute and appoint lawrence seawell attorney to transfer the said stock on the books of the company with full power of substitution in the premises.
on february,seawell sent an directing redemption of appellant stock for percent of the book value of per share the indicated that hercules board of directors the board had approved the redemption by consent.hercules issued a credit memo applying the proceeds of the stock redemption to appellant outstanding balance,but the final director did not fax written consent until march,
on march,the board voted to move forward with the proposal by fd g,giving them an exclusive agreement to perform due diligence before a target sale date of april.the board voted to approve the merger on april.the board recommended that shareholders approve the merger,and,after receiving proxies,approved the merger by shareholder vote on may.fd g and hercules executed the merger on may,and publicized the merger via press release.pursuant to the merger agreement,the hercules shareholders received more than per share.on june,appellant sent seawell a letter accusing him of securities violations,fraud,and breach of fiduciary duty by failing to inform appellant of the possibility of the fd g acquisition.
greer and appellant filed this lawsuit on may,in louisiana state court.the complaint alleges that seawell breached his fiduciary duty by failing to disclose the material fact of the merger discussions that hercules was vicariously liable for seawell breach and that hercules suppressed the fact that fd g was actively pursuing the acquisition of its shares,rendering appellant consent to redemption invalid and entitling appellant to rescission.hercules and seawell removed the case to federal court.
appellees filed a motion to dismiss and a motion for partial summary judgment which the district court converted into a motion for summary judgment.the district court found that the stock power of attorney created only a limited mandate,without fiduciary duties,because the mandate only gave seawell power to effect the actual transfer of property to the board upon consent,and because the parties had agreed to the terms of the redemption before appointing seawell as mandatary.
as a result,the district court reasoned,any breach of fiduciary duty must stem from seawell duty to shareholders as an officer of hercules.the district court did not specifically address appellant rescission claim,but found that all claims for breach of the directors general fiduciary duty to shareholders were prescribed under louisiana corporations law,because shareholder suits against officers and directors for breach of their fiduciary duties must be brought within two years.see.ann.the district court also found that greer lacked individual standing to maintain his claims.the district court granted appellees summary judgment on all claims.this appeal followed 
ii.discussion 
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standards as the district court.hill carroll county,cir citing mack city of abilene,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when no genuine issue of material fact exists and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fact questions are viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and questions of law are reviewed de novo.floyd amite county sch,cir citations omitted.
choice of law 
we must first determine whether the district court properly applied louisiana law to appellant claims.because appellant filed this case in louisiana,we apply louisiana choice of law rules.see torch liquidating trust stockstill,cir citing klaxon stentor.in a diversity action,a federal court must apply the choice of law rules of the state in which the district court where the complaint was filed sits.we must determine as best we can what louisiana highest court would decide regarding the appropriate choice of law rule.patin thoroughbred power boats,cir citing howe scottsdale ins,cir.louisiana choice of law statutes mandate that we apply the law of the state whose policies would be most seriously impaired if its law were not applied to that issue.see.ann.we have recently held that louisiana law requires that the law of the place where the corporation was incorporated governs disputes regarding the relationship between the officers,directors,and shareholders and the officers and directors fiduciary duties.torch liquidating trust,at citations omitted.
we find that because hercules is a connecticut corporation,the district court should have applied connecticut law to determine the scope of the fiduciary duties the directors owe to corporate shareholders.however,louisiana law applies to appellant claim for breach of fiduciary duty based on seawell duties as mandatary because seawell and appellant entered into the mandate in louisiana,and louisiana policies would be most seriously impaired if another state law applied to actions by louisiana citizens for breach of mandates entered into in louisiana.louisiana policies would also be most seriously impaired if another state law applied to actions by louisiana citizens for rescission of contracts based on fraud.therefore,we find that while connecticut law controls the scope of the board duties,louisiana law controls both the applicable prescriptive period and the question of whether a failure to fulfill those duties constitutes fraud warranting rescission of the contract.
rescission claim 
prescription 
under louisiana law,actions for rescission of a contract based on fraud must be brought within five years after the plaintiff discovers the fraud.ann.appellant filed its complaint on may,just over three years after hercules announced its merger with fd g.this was the prescriptive p
