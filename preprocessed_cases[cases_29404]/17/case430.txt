appellant john heurlin appeals from the judgment entered in the voluntary dissolution of fairwagelaw fairwage,a professional corporation of which he was a shareholder.he challenges the court finding he was not a party to the voluntary dissolution proceeding,which led the court to deny his efforts to secure discovery,obtain summary judgment,and call witnesses at the dissolution hearing.
heurlin further contends the court violated his right to due process by entering judgment against him.the dissolution judgment assessed fairwage dissolution litigation expenses against heurlin shareholder interest,and ordered him to pay fairwage the deficiency of.
on this latter issue,we reverse.like shareholders generally,heurlin was not a party to the dissolution proceeding.the dissolution petition did not give heurlin notice fairwage would seek to recover its litigation expenses from him.and because heurlin was a nonparty,the dissolution hearing did not afford him the opportunity to be heard on these claims.the court and counsel,mired in an infrequently invoked proceeding for judicial supervision of the voluntary winding up of a corporation,lost sight of fundamental due process principles while adjudicating the respective rights of the adverse parties.we publish this opinion to assist future litigants and the courts in devising procedures to preserve these fundamental guarantees when the principal shareholders and the corporation are making claims against each other during court supervision of a winding up under corporations code section of course,not all judicial supervisions of a corporate winding up will involve claims by the principal shareholders against each other or against the corporation.but where,as here,the principals are,to understate it,not getting along,the essentially supervisory role of the court under sections,and can not be utilized to summarily adjudicate competing claims without affording the parties the benefits and burdens of our normal rules of civil procedure.
heurlin and two other lawyers,respondents david fuller and henry schrenker,formed fairwage as shareholders intending to prosecute wage and hour class actions.fuller and schrenker voted to voluntarily dissolve fairwage in february,when they discovered heurlin would be suspended for two years from practicing law.heurlin filed notices of attorney liens in two of fairwage class actions in august,claiming an interest in any attorney fee payments to the firm.
after heurlin filed his attorney fee liens,fairwage petitioned the court to take jurisdiction over the voluntary dissolution.fairwage asked for an order directing all shareholders,creditors,and claimants to show cause why the court should not make orders and adjudge as to any and all matters set forth and permitted in california corporations code sections and,after a hearing,to enter an order assuming jurisdiction over the winding up of the affairs of fairwagelaw.it served the petition on heurlin.the court granted the petition in october.it ordered fairwage to publish notice to creditors and claimants that they would have six months to present their claims.fairwage served the order granting the petition and the order for notice to creditors on heurlin.
heurlin attempted to obtain discovery in the voluntary dissolution proceeding.he served written discovery requests on schrenker and fuller,which he followed by filing motions to compel responses.schrenker and fuller opposed the motions on the ground heurlin was not a named party to the voluntary dissolution proceeding,had not intervened in it,and thus lacked standing to seek discovery.the court apparently agreed and denied the motions in february.
in march,heurlin submitted a claim against fairwage in the voluntary dissolution proceeding.the claim stated,in accordance with the order of this court entered october,respondent john heurlin makes a claim against fairwage law,a professional corporation,its officers,agents,and shareholders of not less than.
also in march,heurlin filed a separate civil action against fairwage and respondents,asserting various direct and derivative claims against respondents and fairwage.the court stayed litigation in that case.on heurlin motion,the court consolidated heurlin action with the voluntary dissolution in march,while continuing the stay on litigating heurlin complaint.the court continued the stay in april and denied heurlin motion to lift the stay in january,all in apparent disregard of the consolidation order which had expressly ruled that only one set of findings of facts and conclusions of law if appropriate,or jury decision,will be filed and only one judgment will be entered.
in the meantime,heurlin appeared at case management conferences in the voluntary dissolution proceeding and continued,futilely,to request discovery.he also moved for summary judgment on his claim in the voluntary dissolution proceeding in september.he contended the undisputed evidence showed the reasonable value of his legal work on fairwage class actions was at least,and that he was entitled to this sum in quantum meruit as a matter of law.
the court heard argument on heurlin summary judgment motion and denied it,finding he lacked standing to file it.it noted in its minute order,service of notice of a hearing per section does not make heurlin a respondent in these proceedings.further,he has not filed a formal response to the petition.
fairwage moved for an order ratifying its rejection of heurlin claim.the court granted the motion in january.its order stated fairwage properly rejected the claim because heurlin,a shareholder of fairwage,had no contract to be paid fees and that his compensation,if any,arose exclusively through his status as a shareholder of fairwage.it further stated all known debts owed by fairwage to heurlin have been paid even though just two weeks prior,the court effectively severed heurlin civil action and reverted it to a separate proceeding by continuing to stay it.
the court held a bench trial on the voluntary dissolution in april.at the start,it granted schrenker and fuller motion in limine to exclude heurlin from the proceeding,noting that heurlin was not a party and had a history of disrespecting the court.it also quashed heurlin notice to schrenker and fuller to appear at trial and produce documents.the court stated it would allow heurlin to remain in the courtroom and testify.after the court announced these rulings,heurlin left the courtroom.the trial proceeded without him.
the court entered a judgment of dissolution later that month.it declared fairwage was duly wound up and all debts had been paid or provided for.the court noted heurlin claim had been rejected earlier because he failed to properly intervene in the dissolution action to raise and assert any causes of action he might have against the corporation or its shareholders.it ordered fairwage to set aside as a legal reserve for any appeal,and to defend john heurlin consolidated action which had been effectively severed due to the perpetual stay.the court found heurlin was entitled to of fairwage assets as of the date of his suspension,but was not entitled to any legal fees fairwage earned after his suspension.heurlin shareholder interest was approximately.
against this,the court assessed heurlin approximately in litigation expenses fairwage incurred in prosecuting the voluntary dissolution and defending against heurlin civil action.it found the litigation expenses were incurred solely at the instigation of john heurlin,whose deplorable conduct regarding fairwage included his refusal to surrender his shares of stock in fairwagelaw,his failure to negotiate a resolution of that issue in good faith,breach of his fiduciary duties to the corporation,his failure to appropriately disclose to the corporation the likelihood of his actual suspension shortly after the formation of the corporation,his abuse of the legal process in filing meritless liens in the class action cases,taking frivolous appeals and his tactics of harassment because fairwage litigation expenses exceeded heurlin shareholder interest,the court ordered heurlin to pay the sum of to the corporation.
