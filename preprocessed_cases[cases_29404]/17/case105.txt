in this case,denominated a securities fraud action,alice lawrence,suzanne lawrence,richard lawrence,and marta jo lawrence,individually and on behalf of the estate of sylvan lawrence collectively,the plaintiffs or the estate,ask this court to plumb the vagaries of new york law concerning estates and fiduciary relationships,an area ordinarily within the sole purview of state courts,to determine the nature and extent of plaintiffs legal entitlement to purchase additional shares in a partnership.plaintiffs contend that inasmuch as they were legally entitled to purchase all of the available shares under both new york common law and the partnership agreement,their release of this right in a settlement agreement in alleged reliance on misrepresentations concerning the financial prospects of the partnership satisfied the requirements of securities fraud under section b of the securities and exchange act of,b,the exchange act.
we conclude that because the common law rights asserted by plaintiffs are not contractual and,in any event,are conjectural and uncertain in scope,they do not fall within the exchange act definition of security as required to bring a claim for damages based on securities fraud.see blue chip stamps manor drug stores,d.we further conclude,as did the district court,that plaintiffs did not have a contractual right to purchase all of the shares at issue.accordingly,their purported release of that right pursuant to the settlement agreement they entered into with defendant did not constitute the sale of a security.finally,we reject plaintiffs assertion that their actual purchase of half of the additional partnership shares satisfies the in connection with requirement of section b,as enunciated in superintendent of ins.bankers life and cas,d,because there was no causal connection between that purchase and the alleged fraud.because plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for securities fraud,we affirm the may,judgment of the united states district court for the southern district charles haight,district judge granting summary judgment in favor of seymour cohn and dismissing the complaint.
background 
the facts of this case have been provided in detail in the district court published opinions,familiarity with which is assumed.see,lawrence cohn,d lawrence iv lawrence cohn.lawrence iii lawrence cohn.lawrence ii lawrence cohn.lawrence i.accordingly,we recite only those facts relevant to this appeal.
the decedent,sylvan lawrence sylvan,and defendant cohn were brothers who had a longstanding oral partnership through which they engaged in various real estate ventures over the years.in,following several months of negotiations and drafts,they entered into a limited partnership the lp with jack aron and several of his family members and business associates the aron group for the purpose of purchasing property at wall street and constructing a building there for lease or sale.the limited partnership agreement the lpa designated sylvan and cohn as the general partner in the ownership of of the lp,while the aron group,designated the limited partners,owned,in the aggregate,the aron group interest.
this case centers on a dispute between sylvan successors in interest and cohn concerning their relative rights with respect to the aron group sale of the aron group interest after sylvan death.paragraph of the lpa is entitled assignability of partnership interest.section b of that paragraph provides,in pertinent part 
in the event that any one or more of the limited partners hereinafter called offering limited partner shall receive and wish to accept a bona fide offer for the purchase of his interest in the partnership hereinafter called the outside offer,the limited partner shall promptly notify the other limited partners thereof giving them a right of first refusal to purchase the interest of the limited partner on the same terms as the outside offer in the proportion of their respective interests if the limited partners do not exercise their right to purchase then the offering limited partner shall advise the general partner of the outside offer,giving to the general partner a right of first refusal to purchase the interest of the offering limited partner at the same price and terms as contained in the outside offer 
joint app.at emphasis added.paragraph b goes on to provide that if neither the other limited partners nor the general partner exercises their rights of first refusal,the offering limited partner is free to accept the outside offer.
paragraph c provides,in pertinent part 
in the event the general partner shall receive and wish to accept a bona fide offer for the purchase of its interest in the partnership hereinafter called the outside offer,then the general partner shall inform the limited partners of the outside offer and shall offer to sell its interest to the limited partners or any of them the limited partners may purchase such interest in the proportion that their respective interests in the partnership bears to the total interests of the limited partners 
joint app.at emphasis added.
thus,at the time the lpa was executed,any member of the aron group receiving an offer to sell his interest in the lp would first have to offer it proportionately to the other members of the aron group.if none of them chose to purchase the interest,then the selling aron group member would have to offer it to the general partner,sylvan and cohn before selling it to an outside third party.by contrast,the corresponding provision applicable to the general partner,c,does not establish a right of first refusal as between sylvan and cohn.rather,the general partner is,as elsewhere in the lpa,referred to in the singular,and the only right of first refusal that is triggered by an outside offer to the general partner is a right of first refusal among the limited partners.
paragraph of the lpa,entitled termination of the partnership,provides,in part,that if one of the limited partners dies,the partnership will continue with the limited partner heirs succeeding to his right to distributions and obligations for losses,but that the successor will not become a limited partner.the day before the lpa was to be signed,the attorney representing the aron group,who had acted as the primary draftsman of the agreement,sent a final draft to cohn and sylvan attorney,noting that he had added a provision to about continuance of the partnership if one of the general partners dies.this new provision stated that if either cohn or sylvan retired,became incompetent,or died,
t he retired general partner or the legal representative of the deceased or incompetent general partner shall be and become a limited partner and the share of such retired partner or of such representatives in the profits and losses shall be.the interest of the remaining general partner shall thereafter be.
joint app.at.this provision contains the only reference to individual interests held by sylvan and cohn as distinct from their collective identity as the general partner.
in,shortly before sylvan death from a protracted illness,the brothers reduced their longstanding oral partnership to a written partnership agreement.although this agreement specified the nature of the partnership as,and encompassed approximately properties owned by the brothers,it did not encompass the lpa,perhaps because that partnership was one of the rare ventures that included individuals other than cohn and sylvan.
sylvan died in and cohn became the executor and trustee of his estate and residuary trust collectively,the estate in accordance with the terms of sylvan will.in addition to bestowing upon cohn broad discretionary powers in the management and disposition of the estate,sylvan will expressly provided that t he powers granted by this article shall not be affected or impaired by the fact that my executor or trustee may be a part owner of the property involved or a partner or managing partner of one or more partnerships which own the property or business involved.
during sylvan illness,cohn and jack aron had begun negotiating the possible sale of the aron group interest.lawrence iv,d at.that deal was realized in march of,when cohn purchased the entire aron group interest as nominee for himself,for the estate,and for any combination thereof.id.at.shortly thereafter,cohn brought an advice and direction proceeding in surrogate court to determine how the aron group interest should be allocated between the estate and cohn.in january,cohn submitted an affidavit to the surrogate court stating that in his opinion any further investment by the estate in the lp would be imprudent because of the speculative and uncertain nature of the real estate venture,referring to the risks inherent in expiring leases,balloon payments on mortgages,inflation,and the uncertainties of the rental market.plaintiffs,as the beneficiaries of the estate,obtained an independent appraisal of the partnership,which was largely consistent with cohn appraisal.
in may,before the surrogate had issued a decision concerning the appropriate allocation of the aron group interest,cohn and the plaintiffs entered into a settlement agreement under which cohn and the estate each purchased half of the aron group interest,an additional each.as part of the settlement,the plaintiffs released any claim to a greater percentage of the aron group interest.plaintiffs also released any claim that might arise out of a diminution in value of the aron group interest and any claim that the investment was otherwise unsound or unwise.in addition,cohn represented in the agreement that he had not failed to disclose any material information that would adversely affect the value of of the aron interests.the surrogate approved the settlement as being in the best interest of the estate.see in re estate of lawrence,decree approving settlement agreement,slip op.at surr.county may.
four months after the settlement agreement was signed,the lp entered into a profitable lease with chemical bank for the entire building at wall street.plaintiffs assert that some years later they learned that the chemical bank lease had been agreed to in principle in april,before the settlement was signed,such that cohn failure to disclose the advantageous pending lease constituted a material misrepresentation about the future prospects of the lp.plaintiffs initiated litigation in surrogate court to obtain an accounting and a winding up of the affairs of the estate,including a dissolution of the partnership.see lawrence i.at in re estate of lawrence,memorandum decision,slip op.at surr.county.
in,while the state court litigation was still ongoing,plaintiffs filed this suit in federal court alleging,inter alia,claims under section b of the exchange act and rule on the theory that but for cohn failure to disclose the impending chemical bank lease,plaintiffs would not have agreed to the settlement equalizing the distribution of the aron group interest,and would instead have purchased the entire interest.see lawrence i.at.
ii.the district court proceedings 
the district court initially dismissed plaintiffs section b and rule claims as under the reasoning of lampf,pleva,lipkind,prupis petigrow gilbertson,d.see lawrence i.at.after plaintiffs filed an appeal,this court granted plaintiffs request for a remand in order to allow them to file a motion with the district court pursuant to.rule b.see lawrence cohn,civ.csh,wl,at,lawrence cohn,civ.csh,wl,at.in response to that motion,the district court reversed its earlier decision in the wake of congress passage of section of the exchange act,which reinstated cases that had been dismissed as under lampf.see lawrence ii.at,the district court then denied defendant motion to dismiss,holding that plaintiffs had standing to bring a securities fraud claim and that plaintiffs complaint had stated a viable claim upon which relief could be granted.see lawrence iii.at.
following discovery,cohn moved for summary judgment and plaintiffs for partial summary judgment seeking,inter alia,a declaration that they were sellers of a security for purposes of section b and rule.judge haight,in a typically careful and thoughtful opinion,then granted the defendant motion following a detailed analysis of whether plaintiffs had a right of first refusal,either under the lpa or at common law,entitling them to purchase the entire aron group interest.see lawrence iv,d at.concluding that they had no such right,the district court held that plaintiffs could not establish securities fraud because they could not establish the element of loss causation.see id.at.the plaintiffs appealed.

ii.section b and rule 
in order to state a claim for securities fraud under section b of the exchange act and rule promulgated by the sec thereunder collectively,b,a plaintiff must establish that the defendant,in connection with the purchase or sale of securities,made a materially false statement or omitted a material fact,with scienter,and that the plaintiff reliance on the defendant action caused injury to the plaintiff.ganino citizens utils,cir see also in re.sec,cir san leandro emergency med.group profit sharing plan philip morris,cir acito imcera group,cir.
in blue chip stamps,the supreme court addressed the circumstances under which a plaintiff has standing to bring a private cause of action under b.see at.adopting a rule previously announced by the second circuit,the court held that in order to bring an action for damages under b,the plaintiff must be an actual purchaser or seller of a security.id.at.the blue chip stamps court concluded that application of this rule serves to bar three classes of potential plaintiffs from bringing actions under b,including,most pertinent to this case,the class of 
potential purchasers of shares either in a new offering or on the nation trading markets,who allege that they decided not to purchase because of an unduly gloomy representation or the omission of favorable material which made the issuer appear to be a less favorable investment vehicle than it actually was.
noting that the definition of security found in of the exchange act,a includes any contract to purchase or sell a security such as a put,option,or call,the court further held that plaintiffs who have contractual rights or duties to purchase or sell securities could also maintain an action under b.see id.at.the court cautioned,however,that it was including contractual rights not because of a judicial conclusion that such plaintiffs were similarly situated to purchasers or sellers,but because the definitional provisions of the act themselves grant them such status.id.
the blue chip stamps case involved an antitrust consent decree entered into between the government and blue chip stamps that had conferred upon the class plaintiffs a proportionate right of first refusal to purchase certain shares of blue chip stock in a stock offering.id.at.the class plaintiffs did not exercise this right in the offering.later,the class plaintiffs filed a claim under b alleging that the defendants had purposely provided them with materially misleading information that was overly pessimistic about the future prospects of the stock,causing them not to purchase it.see id.at.the court held that the class plaintiffs lacked standing under b because they did not have an enforceable contract right to purchase the stock and,thus,were not purchasers of a security as required by b.id.at.
in denying cohn motion to dismiss on the pleadings,the district court had ruled in that plaintiffs had standing as purchasers or sellers under b on two theories that the estate asserted right of first refusal to purchase the entire aron group interest constituted an option,hence a security,that was sold by plaintiffs when they entered into the settlement agreement with cohn and that the estate purchase of half of the aron interest was the purchase of a security sufficient to satisfy the requirements of b.see lawrence iii.at.in later granting summary judgment in cohn favor,however,the district court held that plaintiffs had failed to establish that they were legally entitled to purchase the entire aron group interest and,thus,had failed to qualify as either a purchaser or seller of a security.
the primary issue in this case is whether,following discovery and the motions for summary judgment,there exists a genuine factual dispute as to whether the plaintiffs were actual purchasers or sellers of a security.plaintiffs maintain that they were sellers of a security because they had a a contractual right of first refusal to purchase the entire aron group interest b a common law right of first refusal arising from cohn fiduciary duties to the estate c a common law right to purchase the entire aron group interest under the best interests of the estate standard,all of which were forfeited,and thus sold,pursuant to the settlement agreement.in addition,plaintiffs assert that they also satisfy the rule announced in blue chip stamps because they purchased one half of the aron group interest pursuant to the settlement agreement.we address each of these contentions in turn.
iii.contractual right of first refusal 
plaintiffs renew their claim that the estate,as a limited partner,had a right of first refusal under the lpa to purchase the entire aron group interest.although our reasoning differs somewhat from that of the district court,we agree that plaintiffs did not have a contractual right of first refusal with respect to the entire aron group interest.
for purposes of deciding the motion for summary judgment,the district court assumed,without deciding,that the beneficiaries of the estate had become limited partners upon sylvan death by virtue of of the lpa.see lawrence iv,d at.the district court then examined whether b provision creating a proportionate right of first refusal was triggered by cohn offer to purchase the aron group interest.id.at see generally id.at.the district court looked to the conduct of the parties at the time the lpa was drafted and when cohn purchased the aron group interests ordinary custom and usage of the terms bona fide offer and outside offer case law and common sense based on the overall contractual scheme.id.at.the district court held that none of the foregoing supported plaintiffs contention that the lpa granted them a right of first refusal with respect to the entire aron group interest.we agree.
as an initial matter,the district court found that b was ambiguous because it referred to both bona fide offer and outside offer without defining the types of offers to which these terms applied.id.at.this ambiguity permitted the district court to turn to extrinsic evidence to construe the provision.plaintiffs contend that resort to extrinsic evidence was unnecessary because the term bona fide offer is not ambiguous and the term outside offer was merely an abbreviation for convenience that carried no substantive meaning.we reject this argument.paragraph b used the term outside offer substantively,as the definitional term for bona fide offer.thus,there is an ambiguity as to whether b is triggered by any bona fide only by an offer coming from someone outside the lp.in light of this ambiguity,the district court resort to extrinsic evidence was proper.
to determine the parties intent in drafting the lpa,the district court considered contemporaneous memoranda written by the aron group attorney,the conduct of the parties at the time of the sale of the aron group interests,and the business relationship between cohn and sylvan.specifically,the district court observed that a memorandum written by robert steefel,the attorney representing the aron group and the principal draftsman of the lpa,stated that the lpa would contain a provision such that b efore either group,the arons or sylvan and cohn can sell its interest,it must give the other side a right of first refusal.one entity shall represent each of the two interests in this connection.there shall be the normal right of transfer between families.id.at.
the district court also noted that at the time the aron group interest was purchased by cohn on behalf of himself and the estate,no right of first refusal had been offered to the estate nor had the issue been raised by either of the able attorneys representing cohn and the aron group.id.at.both attorneys stated that they had not believed at the time that b applied to the transaction.see id.the district court found that this militate d in favor of cohn interpretation of the lpa.id.at.plaintiffs argue that the district court consideration of the parties conduct at the time of the sale was improper because it had no bearing on the proper construction of b,which was drafted in.we agree that this evidence,standing alone,would not have provided sufficient evidence of the parties intentions in.when viewed together with the other circumstantial evidence,however,it strongly supports the district court conclusion that the late addition in of a succession provision for the general partner was not intended to permit a change in the proportional ownership interests either between the arons and the general partner or between cohn and sylvan.
turning to custom and usage,the district court relied on an affidavit from lauris rall,a partner at thacher profitt wood who had expertise based on his extensive experience in partnerships and subspecialty in limited partnerships.id.at.rall stated that use of the terms bona fide offer and outside offer in a partnership agreement,absent express words to the contrary,invariably means offers from a third party because the purpose for such provisions is to exclude outsiders from entering the partnership absent full agreement by the remaining partners.id.he further stated that he had never seen a partnership agreement in which the term bona fide offer included offers from partners.id.at.the district court found that rall interpretation was supported by new york case law,which provides that because a right of first refusal constitutes a restraint on transfer,it should be construed narrowly as applying only to offers from outsiders unless the agreement contains express language to the contrary.see globe slicing mach.hasner,cir citing storer ripley,misc d,lane albertson,allen biltmore tissue,construing similar provisions as requiring a shareholder to provide corporation or fellow shareholders an opportunity to buy his shares before he is free to offer it to outsiders.
although plaintiffs have not offered any new york cases that contradict rall affidavit or the district court limiting construction,they argue that it was error for the district court to consider rall affidavit because there was no evidence that cohn,sylvan,or their attorney none of whom had much experience with respect to written limited partnership agreements knew or should have known of any supposed specialized meaning of the term bona fide offer or outside offer there is no credible evidence that these terms have a fixed,invariable meaning as required by new york law to constitute custom and trade usage and there is no evidence that these terms carried such meaning in,given that rall has been a practicing attorney only since.we find no error in the district court reasoning.rall affidavit constituted credible evidence of the invariable meaning of the terms,and it was not contradicted by any evidence proffered by the plaintiffs.the possibility that cohn,sylvan,and their attorney were not familiar with the common usage meaning of outside offer carries little weight because the principal draftsman of the lpa was steefel,the aron group attorney.finally,while rall may have begun practicing in,his expertise necessarily is based on agreements and case law that time.
the district court also employed what it termed common sense to construe b,noting that the purpose of b was to prevent the dilution of the aron group interest by outsiders and then to allow the general partners the opportunity to exclude outsiders in the event none of the limited partners did.lawrence iv,d at.viewing this purpose against the fact that the changes to the succession provisions of were made the day before the agreement was sig
