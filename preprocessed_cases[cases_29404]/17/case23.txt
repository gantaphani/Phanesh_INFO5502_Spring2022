this case arises from two transactions in which wahlcometroflex,wmi or the company issued equity shares as compensation for agreements made by most of its shareholders to guaranty personally loans made to wmi.alexander baldwin,one of seven shareholders and founders of wmi,filed suit alleging that wmi directors breached their fiduciary duties to him by issuing the two sets of shares,each of which diluted his stake in wmi.the district court ruled on summary judgment that wmi directors were liable to baldwin on the second transaction but not the first,and both sides now appeal.
wmi is a delaware corporation based in lewiston,maine,that manufactures emissions control equipment used in power generation and other industries.the company was formed in after baldwin and six other investors acquired the assets of a predecessor company in a bankruptcy proceeding.all made capital contributions to wmi in the amount of approximately each,and,in exchange,received the company shares in equal amounts percent each.the seven shareholders also comprised wmi board of directors for much of its existence,and baldwin served as chairman and president until,when he resigned his positions in management and on the board.
at the outset,wmi operations were financed primarily by wells fargo business credit wells fargo,which provided both a loan of to fund the acquisition of assets from the bankrupt predecessor and a line of credit up to for future operations.these loans were backed not only by wmi assets,but also by personal guaranties from all seven founders baldwin and one of the other directors,john bader,provided unlimited guaranties while the remaining shareholders provided limited guaranties capped at percent of any outstanding principal and interest due.no compensation was provided to any of the seven for giving the guaranties.
the wells fargo financing contained several limitations unfavorable to wmi.the bank,for example,agreed to advance funding based only on the value of existing assets and not on works in process,which in practice limited wmi to drawing only about half of the line of credit face value.needing more funding,wmi in early borrowed roughly from the finance authority of maine,the androscoggin valley council of governments avcog,and coastal enterprises.these loans too were backed by the shareholders personal guaranties,again without compensation.
despite these additional loans,wmi operated at a net loss in each of its first three years and during this period its management and board sought either to sell the company or find new investors,and also to replace wells fargo as its bank lender.by early,poulin,who acted as director of materials,told bader that wmi needed at least to fund an additional project for a which wmi would have to cease its operations.avcog provided a loan of,conditioned on guaranties from all of the shareholders but,the company being now precarious,three of them balked at providing uncompensated guaranties absent a commitment from all to do so.
lacking cash to pay for guaranties,the board acting with legal advice determined at a march meeting that shareholders that guarantied the avcog or any future financing would be issued wmi common shares equaling percent of the company outstanding equity for each of corporate debt guarantied.the six directors later provided unlimited personal guaranties for the avcog financing,and avcog made the loan without a guaranty from baldwin,which baldwin had declined to provide.because of counsel concern that baldwin might have had insufficient notice or information,however,no compensatory shares were issued to anyone for the avcog transaction.
even after the avcog loan,the company continued to incur losses and,by the beginning of august,wmi had in accounts payable over days past due and liabilities in excess of assets by more than.concluding that it was on the verge of forced liquidation,the company in the same month secured a commitment from androscoggin savings bank asb to provide approximately million in financing,partly in loans and partly in a line of credit,to extinguish the company existing bank debt contrast to the wells fargo loan allow limited draws on the line of credit based on works in process.however,asb required personal guaranties from wmi shareholders,and because of the large and more flexible line of credit,these guaranties carried greater risk for the guarantors.
on august,had succeeded baldwin as baldwin a letter outlining the general terms of the asb refinancing,including the guaranties required,and informing him that,under the formula earlier adopted,his equity in wmi would be diluted if he chose not to provide a guaranty.baldwin objected to the short period allowed to him to decide,so the asb refinancing went ahead on august with compensation for the guaranties being deferred.the refinancing repaid wells fargo and extinguished the earlier guaranties of baldwin and the others to wells fargo.
the board deferred issuing compensatory shares while baldwin pondered whether to provide a guaranty,and,when he failed to meet a deadline,the directors on january,voted unanimously to issue compensatory shares to themselves in exchange for having guarantied the asb financing.the board used the same formula as had previously been adopted for the more modest loan from avcog but not then utilized.as a result of the share issuance,baldwin stake in wmi was diluted from percent to percent.this is the first of the two transactions later challenged by baldwin law suit.
wmi financial condition began to improve after the refinancing.it earned a profit in and was now able to finance more and bigger projects,and it soon drew down nearly all of the available line of credit.the board then unanimously voted in late to increase by wmi revolving line of credit with asb and to increase by a preexisting term loan.asb again asked for personal guaranties from wmi shareholders,and on december,baldwin was advised that his guaranty would be required to receive new compensatory shares.although provided current financial information about the company,baldwin eventually declined to guaranty the new loan.
the asb financing closed on january,with all wmi shareholders except baldwin providing unlimited personal guaranties.on january,the board voted to issue themselves compensatory shares although the company prospects had substantially improved,the board used the original percent per formula in determining compensation.the new shares were issued on february,and their issuance further diluted baldwin equity interest in wmi from percent to percent had baldwin instead provided a guaranty,his interest would have increased from percent to percent.the directors,in their capacity as six of the seven shareholders of wmi,later ratified the issuance of the new shares at an april,shareholder meeting.
baldwin filed suit in the federal district court in maine in march.he claimed that both issuances of compensatory shares comprised a breach by the directors of their fiduciary duties as directors and shareholders,and he asked for damages and that the shares be voided.baldwin then moved for summary judgment as to both transactions,and the directors for summary judgment as to the first of the two.based on a recommendation by the magistrate judge,the district judge in september granted the directors summary judgment on the first transaction and baldwin summary judgment as to liability on the second.
each side now appeals from the judgment so far as it favored the other.although the district court decision did not determine the relief to be afforded to baldwin on the second transaction,the parties thereafter arrived at an agreement as to the relief,roughly,if the judgment of the district court were affirmed.because both transactions were disposed of on summary judgment,our review on all issues presented on this appeal is de novo.
the parties agree that delaware law applies to the was incorporated in that the pertinent precepts are familiar that in the ordinary case there is a presumption that the directors have acted properly and the business judgment rule provides substantial latitude for the directors judgment,cede technicolor,that directors owe a triad of fiduciary duties good faith,loyalty and care,id.at emerald partners berlin,that a breach of duty can displace the business judgment rule protection,emerald partners,at and that even a breach of duty is not fatal if the directors can show that a transaction was fair,see also weinberger uop.
but delaware law also provides more ambiguous guidance about how fairness is determined and the relationship of fair price to other fairness factors,see weinberger,at and it gives weight depending on the circumstances to such variables as emergency conditions,in re nvf,wl,at.ch.lexis,at,unpublished,and to the fact that benefits accruing to the directors as shareholders are also made available to other shareholders on equal terms 
our case turns on two care and fairness.nothing in the facts provides a triable issue on the charge that the directors acted in bad faith as to either transaction or that they were disloyal in their duty to foster the best interests of the company and its shareholders.patently,both issuances of shares were actions by the board that benefitted the board members as principal shareholders but the company needed funding in each instance and the opportunity to acquire the same shares on the same terms was provided to the only remaining shareholder,baldwin.
nor,as events transpired,did the directors discriminate unfairly against baldwin by giving him too little time or too little information.admittedly,baldwin being no longer an inside figure was at a disadvantage in assessing the terms offered.but the initial deadlines for the first transaction were extended,and baldwin brief does not effectively argue that necessary information that he sought was withheld from him in either case.given the incentives to secure his guaranty and to avoid litigation,the other directors had good reason to accommodate baldwin as to both time and information and appear to have done so.
nevertheless,in issuing shares to themselves as compensation for their guaranties,the directors had a duty of care to seek a fair valuation true,baldwin had the same opportunity to acquire shares.yet he was not obliged to take it up while the directors remained obliged to avoid overpaying and thereby diluting unnecessarily other stockholders interests.it is not clear that the directors dispute that they had this duty.in all events,we agree with them the first had the burden of showing that the directors were careless in setting the formula for each of the challenged transactions.
as to the first one,no refinement of the duty of care is needed in order to acquit the directors of liability.by early,the company was in serious trouble it had a record of losses,restrictive bank credit,and a looming prospect of failure even after the initial modest loan from avcog.the offer from asb in august thus created a major opportunity to refinance on terms that would allow growth of the business.but the opportunity was juxtaposed with a lender demand for shareholder time guaranties made more risky by the large line of credit,which might entail greater personal liability if the shareholders ever had to pay.
certainly rescuing the company provided prospects of rewards in the future,but those would accrue to all shareholders.to provide incentives for individual shareholders to give the guaranties,added shares for those who cooperated were proper the only issue is whether reasonable terms were fixed.ordinarily,one would try to calculate the current value of the company and the value of the guaranties,and then price the compensation in shares accordingly but,based on bader advice as chief financial officer and the directors own knowledge,the board had a basis for fearing that wmi was insolvent and had a negative forced liquidation value.
there was no easy way to determine a perfect compensation formula but the one adopted at the march board percent grant of shares for each of corporate debt not quite plucked out of the air.in late or early,negotiations had occurred between wmi and cei,a potential investor.cei never made a formal offer for wmi shares but the directors came to believe that offering cei up to a percent ownership stake in wmi might have been sufficient to entice it to invest in the amount that wmi ultimately secured from avcog.the percent formula adopted at the march meeting conformed to this belief but,as the directors have conceded,the formula was also the only number that all guarantors could agree upon a market test although not very reliable because of the incentive to be generous.
in theory,the board could have hired an outside consultant,but consultants cost money,the company was operating on a shoestring,and time was of the essence.if all the shareholders gave guaranties,there would be no dilution and pricing would not matter and at the time,the directors had no assurance that the loan would be provided unless all of the existing shareholders signed guaranties.when avcog relented and made the loan without baldwin guaranty,it was because the current directors had all agreed to go along,knowing that everyone on the board would share in the risk.some compensation for doing so while baldwin held out was reasonable.
it is true that the shares were not issued until later and the company fortunes were now improving.but the extra time was provided so that baldwin,now with an extended option provided to no one else,could review data and reflect.the other directors had signed on specific terms,and it would hardly have been fair,even if the company prospects improved between march and december,to deprive them of their bargain for the original risk.nor is it clear how a much better estimate of fair compensation could have been least without spending money to secure it.even without the business judgment rule,no jury could reasonably find that the directors in emergency conditions breached their duty of care as to the first transaction.
the second transaction poses a harder problem for the directors.by late,when they voted to increase their loan and substantially increase their line of credit,the company prospects were much improved.it was on its way to completing its first year of achieving net profit rather than a loss it had a book of business that had almost exhausted its line of credit and it had sufficient promise of more business to seek additional financing.the company was no longer on the verge of collapse.so,when the directors proceeded with the new loan arrangements and issuance of shares,the circumstances were quite different.
on december,the directors advised baldwin that he would be required to provide a guaranty in order to receive compensatory shares for the enlarged loan and line of credit he declined several days later.the loan closed on january,all other shareholders providing unlimited personal guaranties and on january,the board voted to issue themselves compensatory shares,thus diluting baldwin proportionate ownership even further.the original compensation formula,percent of wmi equity for each,was again employed.the directors were entitled to some compensation the question is whether they exercised due care in determining the amount.
seemingly,the directors made no documented effort to determine whether the old formula was justified under current conditions,and that is the opening problem for them.worse still,at this point the board had available a valuation study that the company had commissioned for insurance purposes in early.this valuation report,which was written by wmi accounting firm purdy powers and released in june,estimated that the fair market value of percent of the common equity interest in wmi was.by the end of the same year,when the new financing was secured,the situation might well have looked even better for reasons already described.
it is difficult to value the equity in a company but it can not easily be argued that percent of wmi equity at the end of was worth no more than an equivalent percentage of the same company in when it appeared on the verge of collapse.further,the new financing surely did not need to be achieved on so tight a as the previous transaction,and,in any case,the directors could have agreed to provide
