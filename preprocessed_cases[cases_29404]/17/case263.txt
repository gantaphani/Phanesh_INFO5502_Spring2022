donna brown brought claims under title vii and the equal pay act epa against fred stores of tennessee,fred of tennessee and its parent company,fred.brown appeals the district court grant of summary judgment to fred,on her title vii claim.fred of tennessee the district court denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law on the epa claim,and the court ruling on liquidated damages.we affirm.
in,fred of tennessee,which operates a chain of retail stores,hired donna brown to work as a cashier in its store in white hall,arkansas.in the spring of that year,fred of tennessee promoted brown to assistant manager of the white hall store,and several months later,fred of tennessee promoted her again,this time to manager.fred of tennessee eventually terminated brown for reasons unrelated to this lawsuit.
following her termination,brown brought suit against fred,the parent company of fred of tennessee,alleging that fred,violated title vii and the epa by paying brown less than her male counterparts in the assistant manager and manager positions.brown later amended her complaint to add fred of tennessee as a defendant on her epa claim.the district court granted summary judgment to fred,concluding that brown had failed to present sufficient evidence that fred,was her employer.the suit continued against fred of tennessee,and following a trial,a jury returned a verdict for brown on the epa claim and awarded her in lost wages.the district court awarded an equal amount in liquidated damages pursuant to,denied fred of tennessee motion for judgment as a matter of law,and entered judgment for brown.
brown claims that the district court improperly granted summary judgment to fred,after concluding that fred,was not brown employer.summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.
title vii and the epa apply to an employer.d.brown concedes that her lists fred of its parent company,fred,her employer.nonetheless,she points to other documents and alleged representations of fred,that she says establish that fred,employed her.
there is a strong presumption that a parent company is not the employer of its subsidiary employees,and the courts have found otherwise only in extraordinary circumstances.frank west,cir see also johnson flowers indus,cir.a parent company may employ its subsidiary employees if a the parent company so dominates the subsidiary operations that the two are one entity and therefore one employer,see johnson,at,or b the parent company is linked to the alleged discriminatory action because it controls individual employment decisions.leichihman pickwick int l,cir see also johnson,at.
brown submitted insufficient evidence of either circumstance to create a genuine issue for trial.fred,processed payroll and performed other services for fred of tennessee in exchange for a fee,and fred,appears on brown payroll check and other documents,such as the employee handbook.but nothing suggests that fred,and fred of tennessee were a single entity.the only evidence connecting fred,to decisions about brown salary was the misinformed testimony of ted west,who hired brown and set her salary as an assistant manager.west testified that he believed he worked for fred,and that fred,and fred of tennessee were the same company.west mistaken belief about the corporate family tree,however,is insufficient to show that fred,actually controlled individual employment decisions regarding brown,and brown offers no other evidence to support this conclusion.finally,brown argues that fred,should be estopped from denying that it was brown employer,because fred,responded on the merits to brown eeoc complaint and identified itself as respondent.far from representing that fred,was brown employer,however,the response to the eeoc stated clearly that fred,was not the employer.therefore,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to fred,on the title vii claim.
on,fred of tennessee hereafter fred asks us to reverse the district court denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law on the epa claim.judgment as a matter of law is appropriate only where the evidence is such that no reasonable juror could have found for the nonmoving party.we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict,and give the nonmoving party all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the evidence.christensen titan distrib,cir.
to establish liability under the epa,an employee must prove that her employer discriminated on the basis of sex by paying different wages to men and women who performed equal work.d tenkku normandy bank,cir.equal work means work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill,effort,and responsibility,and which are performed under similar working conditions.d.if a plaintiff meets this burden,then she has made a prima facie case under the epa.see tenkku,at.the employer may avoid liability by proving any of four affirmative defenses,one of which is that the pay difference between men and women was based on a factor other than sex.d tenkku,at.
in support of her prima facie case,brown offered evidence that fred promoted her to assistant manager of the white hall store at a salary of per week,which was later increased to per week.two male assistant managers at the white hall store,brett ward and jeffrey dunbar,made per week.when fred promoted brown to manager of white hall,it paid her per week.fred employed two male managers at white hall,tim scholes and allan beatty,at a rate of per week.ted west,the district manager who initially promoted brown and set her salary,testified that male and female managers and assistant managers at white hall were held to the same performance standards,that their jobs required the same skill,effort,and responsibility,and that they worked under similar conditions.this evidence was sufficient to establish a prima facie case by showing pay differences between men and women who perform equal work.
fred challenges brown prima facie case with respect to brett ward,an assistant manager who made per week,as compared to brown.fred argued at trial that ward and brown did not perform equal work because ward salary was set when he became assistant manager of the store in pine bluff,which was a higher volume store than brown store in white hall.a reasonable juror could have rejected this argument.first,fred provided scant evidence to show that the difference in sales volume created a substantial difference in working conditions or job demands.the epa forbids pay disparities based on differences that are insubstantial or minor,hunt nebraska pub.power,cir a,and the jury reasonably could have concluded that the difference in sales volume did not make the jobs unequal.hunt,at.second,ward retained his higher salary even after he left pine bluff and transferred to the white hall store,where there was an even stronger case that the work he performed was equivalent to brown.fred argues that brown supervised fourteen employees at white hall while ward supervised as many as eighteen,but the jury could reasonably have rejected this distinction as insubstantial.lawrence cnf,cir holding that a reasonable juror could have found that two employees performed substantially equal work when one had accounts and the other had one hundred accounts and a assistant.
the explanation offered by fred for the salary disparity between ward and brown is that they performed substantially different work during their time at the white hall store.ward worked as an assistant manager at white hall for about two months,at a time when there was no other managerial employee in the store.fred argues that ward was essentially functioning as a manager during this time,even though his title was only assistant manager.according to fred,this explains why ward made per week,while brown,who was an ordinary assistant manager,made per week during most of her tenure at white hall.fred also argues that when brown was performing duties of a manager for four weeks at the end of,she was paid per week by virtue of a retroactive pay r
