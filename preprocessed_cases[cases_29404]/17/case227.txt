this appeal in a suit against a group of affiliated corporations charges that in violation of the plaintiff federal tariffs,filed with the federal communications commission,its state tariffs,filed with the illinois commerce commission,and the interconnection agreement between it and one of the defendant affiliates,global naps illinois,the defendants failed to pay for telecommunications services that the plaintiff had sold to that company.
questions about our jurisdiction led us to invite supplemental briefs.the plaintiff points out that a suit to enforce a tariff filed with the fcc is deemed to arise under federal law and is therefore within the jurisdiction of the district court.louisville nashville rice.thurston motor lines,jordan rand,d per curiam cahnmann sprint,cir.it argues that the suit is within the diversity jurisdiction as well because,while illinois bell is an illinois corporation,none of the defendants either is incorporated in illinois or has its principal place of business there.that the case is within the diversity jurisdiction as well as the jurisdiction is potentially important.the plaintiff has at least one,and possibly two,claims under state for failure to comply with its state tariffs and the other for violation of the interconnection agreement.although both are within the supplemental jurisdiction conferred on the federal courts by,the exercise of that jurisdiction is,as the statute makes clear,discretionary the exercise of diversity jurisdiction is not.
an exhibit to the plaintiff supplemental brief contains an admission by global naps illinois that to the extent global naps illinois denied that it is a delaware corporation with its principal place of business at merrymount road,quincy,ma that denial was inadvertent and in error.the defendants supplemental brief says,in a reversal of their previous position,that global naps illinois obviously has its principal place of business in illinois,the only state in which it is licensed and has established interconnection facilities.but its being licensed to do business in illinois and having established interconnection facilities are not evidence that it is a citizen of illinois.at t is licensed to do business in illinois and has established interconnection facilities,but is not a citizen of illinois.
when the facts that determine federal jurisdiction are contested,the if it is a case that has been removed to federal court,the establish those facts by a preponderance of the evidence.meridian security ins.sadowski,cir gafford general,cir.global naps illinois has not mounted a sufficiently colorable challenge to diversity jurisdiction to require the plaintiff to present additional evidence of diversity.global naps illinois does not have an illinois corporate charter.nor is illinois where it has its principal place of business.it admits that it has no employees other than its corporate officers,and they are all in massachusetts.
a company principal place of business is where its nerve center is located,or,more concretely,where its executive headquarters are located.krueger cartwright,cir metropolitan life ins.estate of cammon,cir dimmitt owens financial,united states,cir.there are no nerves in all but the simplest animals without a brain,and there is no human brain without a human being.an executive headquarters without any executives is similarly oxymoronic.we can imagine an automated company that has no office anywhere but consists of pieces of equipment operated by telecommuting employees scattered across the globe.but what we have in this case is commonplace a company located in one state massachusetts that has contracts with firms in other states,including illinois.
a corporation whose center of gravity is in the same state as the opposing party even though it may be incorporated elsewhere is sufficiently local sufficiently identified with the avoid the obloquy that may attach to a foreign corporation in litigation with a local resident and that provides the modern rationale of the diversity jurisdiction.the words principal place of business are to be construed with this purpose in mind.dimmitt owens financial,united states,supra,at.there is nothing local about a corporation chartered in another state,managed in another state,administered in another state,headquartered in another state,its local presence actually a ghostly absence of living bodies.
but the defendants argue that even if there is prima facie federal jurisdiction,whether based on a federal question or diversity of citizenship,the telecommunications act of,et,withdraws that jurisdiction from a suit of this kind.
to understand the argument one must understand the two types of charge that one telecommunications carrier can extract from another pursuant to the telecommunications act.iowa network services,qwest,cir.first,an incumbent local exchange carrier a carrier that provided local phone service when the act was passed,such as illinois bell is required to interconnect on demand with other carriers that provide local telecommunications services within its service area.c.a carrier demanding interconnection must negotiate with the incumbent local exchange carrier on price and other terms.if the two carriers can not reach agreement,their disagreement is submitted to what is called arbitration but is really the first stage in a regulatory proceeding,as the arbitration decision must be submitted to the state regulatory commission for its approval,as must an agreement reached by negotiation,a,b,e illinois bell.box,cir illinois bell.box,cir.
the interconnection agreement between the plaintiff and global naps illinois was approved by the illinois commerce commission.a party aggrieved by the state commission decision,whether imposing or altering the terms of an interconnection agreement,can seek judicial review in federal district court on the ground that the decision violates sections or of the telecommunications act.e.but so far as appears both parties were content with the agreement and neither sought judicial review of the commission order approving it.nor did anyone else.
if as in this case the incumbent local exchange carrier sues merely to collect the interconnection charge specified in the approved interconnection agreement,the suit is not based on federal law in any realistic sense,but on a price term in a contract.just as a suit to enforce a copyright license is held to arise under state rather than federal law even though the grant of a copyright is governed by federal law,gaiman mcfarlane,cir harms eliscu,cir friendly,so likewise,while section c authorizes a federal court to determine whether the agency decision departs from federal law,a decision interpreting an agreement contrary to its terms creates a different kind of under the law of contracts,and therefore one for which a state forum can supply a remedy.illinois bell.worldcom technologies,cir see also connect communications southwestern bell,cir southwestern bell.public utility comm n,cir.

we are mindful that verizon maryland,global naps,cir,says that interconnection agreements are so important to the federal regulation of telecommunications that suits to enforce them arise under the telecommunications act.but that was a very different case from this.verizon was suing state commissioners to block their order requiring it to pay compensation to another carrier,and while it was doing so in part because it thought they had misinterpreted the interconnection agreement,according to verizon complaint,whether it must pay reciprocal compensation on traffic under the terms of the agreement depends in substantial measure upon the requirements of the act and the fcc regulations and interpretations.on its face,then,verizon contract claim is tied directly to federal law,and its asserted basis in federal law is not insubstantial or frivolous.id.at emphasis in original.
bellsouth telecommunications,mcimetro access transmission services,cir en banc,was a similar the majority opinion drew a powerful dissent by judge tjoflat,see id.at we need not take sides,as our case is distinguishable.illinois bell is seeking merely to collect charges specified in the interconnection agreement.
the second type of charge that one carrier can levy against another is a charge for transmission of a carrier telecommunications.such a charge must be embodied in and collected pursuant to a tariff filed with the federal communications commission.a.carriers file similar tariffs with state commissions such as the illinois commerce commission for the transmission of intrastate communications,and the plaintiff other claim is based on such a tariff.
the defendants argue that the federal tariff can not create federal jurisdiction over this suit,as the plaintiff claims it does,because,they say,the interconnection agreement between the plaintiff and global naps illinois includes an integration clause,whereby all the terms and conditions of the interconnection to which global was entitled by the telecommunications act were acknowledged by the parties to be set forth in the interconnection agreement.thus,whatever the parties might owe one another on account of the traffic passing by virtue of their interconnection was plainly acknowledged to be set forth in the agreement and not elsewhere in compliance with the regime created by the act.tariff claims presented as alternative pleading do not create federal subject matter jurisdiction.
but the clause is more limited than the defendants claim.it reads entire agreement.this reciprocal compensation appendix is intended to be read in conjunction with the underlying interconnection agreement between ilec illinois bell,the incumbent local exchange carrier,to which reciprocal compensation is due from competing local exchange carriers that interconnect with it,b in re core communications,and clec global naps illinois,the competitive local exchange carrier,but that as to the reciprocal compensation terms and conditions,this appendix constitutes the entire agreement between the parties on these issues,and there are no other oral agreements or understandings between them on reciprocal compensation that are not incorporated into this appendix.the entire agreement to which the clause refers is thus the appendix,and a number of the plaintiff claims are unrelated to reciprocal compensation.the duty to provide such compensation is only one of the duties created by the interconnection provisions of the telecommunications act.see b,c.
we can not find the underlying interconnection agreement in the record,but the plaintiff concedes that some of the payments that it claims global naps illinois owes it are based solely on the interconnection agreement,and we have just ruled that a suit for nonpayment in violation of such an agreement does not arise under federal law.and we suppose an integration clause though not this one,which is narrow in scope could make all claims for payment to a carrier arise under the agreement rather than under filed tariffs.an ordinary agreement could do obligation created by a filed tariff can not be altered by an agreement of the parties.maislin industries,primary steel,d louisville nashville central iron coal.but telecommunications common carriers are authorized to make binding interconnection agreements setting forth the prices of the services agreed upon.a.
the possibility of turning a federal tariff claim into a simple contract claim does not affect jurisdiction,however.a suit to enforce a federal tariff arises under federal law even if the defendant has a good defense to the claim,such as that the plaintiff had agreed not to make it.that is the implication of the complaint rule.caterpillar,williams,d.for its application to a case similar to this,involving one of the defendants in this case,see verizon new york global naps,at.only if the complaint invocation of federal law is frivolous does the rule forbid access to federal court under the jurisdiction,saturday evening post rumbleseat press,cir.
the integration clause is a reminder,however,that if an interconnection agreement specifies a particular price for a particular service,the seller can not,simply by filing a tariff,prevent the buyer from challenging the price in the tariff as discrepant with the price in the interconnection agreement.global naps illinois argues that the plaintiff claim is based on a misinterpretation of the agreement.such a disagreement should normally be referred to the state regulatory agency,in this case the illinois commerce commission,before the federal court decides the case.the agency had to approve the parties agreement and had the authority to impose a different agreement on them,or,what amounts to the same thing,to modify the agreement they had negotiated.e.if a dispute over the meaning of the agreement arises,the agency will usually be in the best position to resolve it.
true,the telecommunications act does not expressly authorize a state commission,after it approves an interconnection agreement,to resolve disputes arising under it.nor does the act expressly authorize a federal court to refer such a dispute,if the dispute arises in a suit in federal court,to the state commission,either.but such authority is a sensible corollary to the allocation of state and federal responsibilities made by the act.core communications,verizon pennsylvania,cir bellsouth telecommunications,mcimetro access transmission services,supra,at peter huber,michael kellogg john thorne,federal telecommunications law,ed the telecommunications act of directly controls intrastate issues that were once the exclusive province of the states.to that extent,the act federalizes these local interconnection issues.but the respective roles of the state and federal agencies in implementing these provisions have been a matter of considerable dispute as a backstop to its primary reliance on privately negotiated agreements congress enlisted the aid of state public utility commissions to ensure that local competition was implemented fairly and with due regard to the local conditions and the particular historical circumstances of local regulation under the prior regime leon knauer,ronald machtley thomas lynch,telecommunications act handbook.
regulatory agencies do usually engage in contract interpretation.but since interconnection agreements are complex and have to be approved by a state commission and disputes over their meaning are very likely to present issues related to the commission federal statutory example whether the contractual interpretation urged by one of the parties would result in price discrimination,d a ii the referral of interpretive disputes to the state commission,unless they seem contrived or are otherwise easy to resolve,is a sensible procedure and there is nothing in the telecommunications act to forbid it.and if this is right,then a carrier seeking to enforce an interconnection agreement must not be permitted to prevent referral by filing a tariff and suing to enforce it rather than the interconnection agreement.west communications,hix,d,see global naps,fcc.
to give the referral procedure a label,we are saying that issues that arise in the course of a federal suit to enforce an interconnection agreement may sometimes be within the primary jurisdiction of the state regulatory agency.as explained in united states western pacific,d,the doctrine of primary jurisdiction,like the rule requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies,is concern
