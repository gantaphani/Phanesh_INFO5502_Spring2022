defendants appellants labatt brewing company limited labatt,its subsidiary labatt holdings,its subsidiaries lf holdings i lf i and labatt usa lusa,and its parent company interbrew,interbrew collectively appellants appeal from the judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york john martin,judge entered on may,granting the motion of plaintiff appellee wisdom import sales company,wisdom for a preliminary injunction and enjoining appellants from proceeding further with the integration of the beer brands of beck beck into lusa the beck integration.in granting injunctive relief,the district court ruled that appellants breached a contract governing terms and conditions of a joint venture between wisdom and appellants.the district court found that appellants breach denied wisdom the benefit of certain minority rights of corporate governance and that such denial constituted irreparable harm.
for the reasons set forth herein,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it granted wisdom motion for injunctive relief.accordingly,we affirm.
background 
general corporate relationships 
through the seemingly complex maze of various business entities in this case lies a most palatable enterprise beer distribution.in,labatt and various of its subsidiaries entered into a year joint venture with femsa cerveza,de femsa of mexico and its subsidiary wisdom.the principal purpose of the joint venture was to establish a single distribution infrastructure through which labatt and femsa could distribute in the united states their current and future brands of beer and beverages,as well as the brands of their current and future affiliates.the joint venture was primarily governed by a joint venture agreement.
established in connection with the joint venture was lf i,a delaware limited liability corporation.labatt,through two of its subsidiaries,owns of lf femsa,through wisdom,owns of lf lf i,in turn,owns substantially all of lusa,an operating subsidiary created in connection with the joint venture.from its formation,lusa has served as the exclusive distributor of the labatt and femsa brands of beer,importing,marketing and selling those brands in the united states.interbrew,a belgian corporation,became a party to the joint venture after acquiring labatt in.pursuant to this acquisition,lusa began distributing interbrew beer brands in addition to the labatt brands already distributed by lusa in the united states.
in conjunction with the joint venture agreement itself,and pertinent to this appeal,the terms and conditions of the joint venture are further governed by three additional agreements an amended and restated limited liability company agreement of lf holdings i,lf i agreement a principal owners and members agreement pom agreement and an exclusive distributor agreement between lusa and labatt labatt distributor agreement.
the lf i agreement is between the two labatt subsidiaries that partially own lf i and wisdom.it sets forth corporate governance principles for lf i.according to this agreement,the business and affairs of lf i shall be managed by or under the direction of the board of directors.lf i.the lf i board consists of seven directors,five of whom are appointed by a labatt subsidiary labatt directors and two of whom are appointed by wisdom wisdom directors.pursuant to section of the lf i agreement,ordinary business decisions are determined by simple majority vote of the board which,it is agreed by all parties,accords the labatt directors virtual unlimited control over business operations of both lf i and lusa however,decisions involving certain fundamental matters,as delineated by section of the lf i agreement,require a vote for approval,that is,no fewer than six members of the lf i board.as negotiated for by wisdom,these fundamental matters require the favorable vote of at least one wisdom director for approval.section,thus,effectively vests wisdom with a minority veto power over fundamental matters.as relevant to this appeal,fundamental matters includes agreements,described in section v as the entry by lf i or any of its subsidiaries into or material modifications of any agreement with any member or any of their respective affiliates,lf i,v.
just as the lf i agreement governs operation of lf i,the pom agreement sets forth the manner in which lusa will be managed,including principles regarding the marketing of beer brands within lusa portfolio.with respect to lusa marketing efforts,the pom agreement requires a balanced approach in connection with each brand lusa distributes and provides minority owner femsa with protections against unfair discrimination in lusa marketing efforts.although section c i of the pom agreement requires balanced marketing efforts by lusa,ultimately,such efforts are to be based on the best interests of lf i without regard to the financial interests of any principal owner in any supplier pom,c i.
finally,lusa entered into the labatt distributor agreement with labatt and its affiliates the labatt distributor agreement grants lusa exclusive year united states distribution rights to labatt current brands,defined as beer brands brewed by labatt and its affiliates at inception of the distribution arrangement.the labatt distributor agreement also contemplates that new brands,defined as brands that labatt and its current and future affiliates may in the future manufacture outside the united states,might be added to lusa portfolio.it specifies procedures for such developments,including granting lusa a right of first refusal with respect to the distribution rights for any such new brands and,if exercised,lusa right to be appointed as exclusive distributor of such new brands in the united states according to the terms and conditions agreed upon by lusa,labatt,and the supplier of the new beer brand.
of particular significance to the integration of any new brands into lusa portfolio is section of the labatt distributor agreement.section imposes a mandatory good faith negotiation requirement on lusa if it or one of its affiliates acquires a brewing company whose brands have a significant market presence in the united states.in the event that such a transaction presents itself,lusa,labatt and the new brand supplier 
a gree that they shall negotiate in good faith for such brands to become labatt brands on terms and conditions consistent with the then applicable terms and conditions of the labatt brands and such other consideration as importer and suppliers or labatt,as the case may be,shall deem equitable and appropriate under the circumstances.
labatt distrib.therefore,lusa right of first refusal is not absolute with respect to new brands with a significant market presence.the parties to any proposed integration of such new brands must negotiate in good faith,but need not agree upon,the terms of a new distribution arrangement.it is undisputed that the beck brands,which account for approximately of total beer and malt beverages imports into the united states,are considered new brands having a significant market presence.
b.the dispute brews 
in august,interbrew announced a deal to purchase beck,a german brewer.at the time interbrew acquired beck,beck north america beck na,a subsidiary of beck,was,and continues to be,the exclusive united states distributor of the beck brands of beer.initially,interbrew considered an acquisition of beck na,but abandoned the idea when femsa voiced opposition to the proposal.interbrew then sought to terminate the distribution arrangement between beck and beck na and,instead,have lusa distribute beck brands directly.since acquiring beck,however,interbrew has been operating two parallel united states distribution operations for the imported brands it owns lusa and beck na.
in the months following interbrew august announcement,femsa attempted to obtain more information about the deal in order to enable wisdom to make an informed decision about whether or not to approve the beck integration.it is clear that,even in these early stages,the parties disagreed regarding the degree to which wisdom could veto the integration.femsa and wisdom posited that such an acquisition would require,at a minimum,lusa agreeing to distribute beck brands which,in turn,constitutes a fundamental matter under section of the lf i agreement requiring a vote.despite these concerns,appellants proceeded with preliminary steps to effectuate the beck integration.
in april,wisdom requested a meeting of the lf i board to vote on the proposed integration.on april,a board meeting convened during which labatt,on behalf of its parent interbrew,presented a resolution to integrate beck brands into lusa portfolio the resolution.the resolution stated 
the addition by lf i of all beck brands currently distributed by beck na the beck brands to the exclusive distribution agreement between labatt,lusa,et al,dated as of december,is hereby approved,ratified and confirmed.
any two officers or directors of lf i are authorized and directed to execute and deliver for and in the name of and on behalf of lf i and under its corporate seal or otherwise,all such certificates,instruments,agreements,amendments,bills of sale,notices,affidavits,and other documents and to do all such other acts and things as,in the opinion of such persons,may be necessary or desirable in connection with the integration of beck brands and with the performance by lf i of its obligations hereunder.
four labatt directors one labatt directorship was vacant at the time of the vote voted in favor of the resolution,while the two wisdom directors voted against it.
labatt and interbrew perceived the vote as a success,continuing to maintain that only a simple majority vote was required to approve the action.wisdom,on the other hand,continued to believe what it had urged in the months preceding the vote on the resolution that the beck integration involved fundamental matters,thereby requiring the approval of six lf i directors.however,labatt intimated an intent to proceed with the beck integration despite not having obtained wisdom approval.after the vote,the wisdom directors included in the lf i board meeting minutes a statement reiterating wisdom position.appellants nonetheless proceeded with the integration which included,among other things,a general restructuring and reorganization of lusa as outlined in lusa long range plan long range plan.
on april,wisdom filed a complaint alleging breach of the lf i agreement.wisdom sought a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to enjoin the beck integration.
district court ruling 
on the date wisdom filed its complaint,the parties agreed to a standstill of any action in furtherance of the beck integration pending a may,hearing before the district court.at the may hearing,the parties presented oral arguments,but the district court postponed rendering a decision until an evidentiary hearing could be held on may.in the interim,the district court permitted each party to take three depositions prior to the hearing,which could then be used in lieu of live,direct testimony at the evidentiary hearing.
at the may evidentiary hearing,the district court permitted of several witnesses,as well as introduction of documentary evidence and the deposition testimony.the district court examined whether integrating beck brands into lusa portfolio required an agreement between lusa and an affiliate such as interbrew,labatt,or beck and whether wisdom had established irreparable harm.after receiving all documentary and testimonial evidence,the district court found the beck integration involved the type of agreement that section v of the lf i agreement contemplated as a fundamental matter.it concluded that proceeding with the beck integration over wisdom objection breached the lf i agreement and that denying wisdom the opportunity to exercise its minority rights constituted irreparable harm in and of itself,thereby warranting injunctive relief the district court enjoined appellants from taking further action on the beck integration during the pendency of proceedings.this timely appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
the present appeal calls upon us to review the propriety of the district court grant of preliminary injunctive relief to wisdom.appellants contend that such relief is not warranted because wisdom failed to identify any agreement in which lusa and an affiliate had entered or anticipated entering in furtherance of the beck integration.approving the resolution and proceeding with the beck integration,they contend,did not violate wisdom minority veto power under section v and,therefore,did not breach the lf i agreement.appellants also contend that,even if a breach occurred,wisdom failed to demonstrate that it would suffer irreparable harm for which no adequate remedy at law would compensate.
standard of review 
we review the district court grant of a preliminary injunction for an abuse of discretion.the bronx household of faith board of educ.of city of new york,cir.a district court abuses its discretion in granting preliminary injunctive relief when it bases its ruling on an incorrect legal standard or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the facts.id.we have previously noted that the highly deferential clearly erroneous standard is particularly appropriate when assessing a district court factual findings due to that court expertise as a.zervos verizon new york,cir.the fact that we may disagree with the district court factual findings,in itself,does not render those findings clear error.rather,in order to clear this threshold,any disagreement on our part must be accompanied by a firm belief that the district court was mistaken.id.citing united states united states gypsum.
preliminary injunctive relief 
preliminary injunctive relief is appropriate when a plaintiff establishes the likelihood of irreparable injury in the absence of such an injunction,and either a likelihood of success on the merits or b sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation plus a balance of hardships tipping decidedly in plaintiff favor.see tcpip holding,haar communications,cir.
because,in this case,the existence of irreparable harm,vel non,turns on wisdom rights under the lf i agreement,we invert the usual injunctive relief analysis.we first address whether wisdom is likely to show that appellants breached the lf i agreement,specifically,section v.if answered in the affirmative,we then examine whether such breach constituted irreparable harm for purposes of justifying preliminary injunctive relief.
likelihood of success 
appellants principal argument is that there has been no breach of the lf i agreement because there has been and will be no new agreement between lusa and an affiliate,and even if one or more new agreements will be entered,such agreements would not be considered fundamental matters under section v so that wisdom could exercise its minority veto power.we hold that the district court findings are not clearly erroneous and that it did not err when it concluded wisdom was likely to succeed on the merits of its breach of contract claim.in so holding,we address,and reject,each of appellants arguments in turn.
new agreement s 
according to appellants,neither wisdom nor the district court identified a specific agreement that has been or will be entered in furtherance of the beck integration primarily because no such agreement has been or will be needed.because lusa,lf i,labatt,interbrew,and beck are parties to,and operate under,the labatt distributor agreement,the reasoning goes,and this agreement contemplates lusa distributing new brands acquired by labatt or interbrew such as beck brands,lusa need not enter into any new agreement in order to effectuate the beck integration.appellants contend that settling the details of the beck integration entails interbrew,as the ultimate parent of both lusa and beck,simply acting unilaterally without the need for formal,commercial agreements.absent a new agreement between lusa and one of its affiliates,wisdom minority veto power is inapplicable.
we reject appellants contention that no new agreement has been identified and,particularly,appellants implication that failure to identify a specific written document compels the conclusion that no such agreement exists as we discuss below,the series of events occurring in connection with the beck integration,including discussions and negotiations between the parties thereto,supports the district court finding that one or more agreements which may not have been independently reduced to writing have or,in all likelihood,will be entered.and,our caselaw instructs that,at least under new york law,oral agreements are binding and enforceable absent a clear expression of the parties intent to be bound only by a writing.group,v.the horn hardart,cir.likewise,an agreement does not lack formality simply because the parties may not have reduced its terms to writing.
that wisdom was unable to identify a tangible document resembling an agreement during the abbreviated discovery period establishes nothing.wisdom veto power is conditioned only upon lusa entry into a agreement,without regard to its form.for guidance,we naturally turn to the operative documents,primarily the lf i agreement,governed by delaware law,and the labatt distributor agreement,governed by new york law.as an initial matter,we note that the law of delaware and new york are identical regarding principles of contract construction,as both follow the common law rule.thus,under either state law,each operative agreement in this case is to be construed as a whole,giving full meaning and effect to all unambiguous terms and provisions therein according to their plain meaning and the parties intent.see gertrude stephen,discussing delaware law painewebber,bybyk,cir discussing new york law.
the evidence supports the district court finding that lusa entered into an agreement albeit not resulting in a written document in furtherance of the beck integration.reading the lf i agreement according to its plain language,section v deems fundamental any matter which necessitates lf i or lusa entering an agreement with an affiliate.after its acquisition by interbrew,beck became one such affiliate.beck,or interbrew on behalf of beck,agreed to shift beck distribution rights to lusa and to use the same transfer pricing mechanisms as applied to other labatt brands.lf i agreed,on behalf of lusa,to accept those distribution rights.this is made clear by the resolution itself which specifically approved,ratified and confirmed t he addition of all beck brands to the exclusive distribution agreement between labatt an affiliate and lusa.in other words,the resolution presupposes a prior agreement separate from the labatt distributor agreement to integrate beck brands into lusa portfolio and to adopt the labatt distributor agreement as controlling beck distribution arrangement.
as we discuss in more detail below,appellants concede that section of the labatt distributor agreement requires good faith negotiations when a new brand with a significant market presence like beck brands is sought to be added to lusa portfolio.appellants admit that,presumably prior to presenting and voting on the resolution,lusa and interbrew negotiated in good faith over terms and conditions on which the beck brands will be added to lusa portfolio and agreed to add beck to the existing labatt distributor agreement on the same terms applicable to other brands.appellants can not and do not explain why this activity did not amount to making an agreement.
moreover,the resolution also authorized action in furtherance of the beck integration and,at a minimum,contemplated that the parties would execute additional agreements in the course of that integration sufficient evidence supports the district court findings that the beck integration necessarily would include other formal,commercial agreements between lusa and an affiliate,thereby triggering wisdom minority veto power in section v of the lf i agreement.indeed,lusa itself characterized the beck integration as a significant component of lusa planned reorganization and restructuring,which has been described by several witnesses as involving complex and complicated transactions 
the testimony of both bryan semkuley,lusa vice president of marketing,and john lennon,president of beck na,echo the notion that fully effectuating the beck integration either had required,or would likely require in the future,some formal agreement in connection with the transfer of distribution rights,the transfer price,the termination or reassignment of various lusa and beck employees,beck appointment of lusa as its united states importer,beck reassignment of,and lusa acceptance of,beck wholesaler agreements and lusa assumption of beck media contracts.the shifting of substantial assets,together with evidence regarding the complex reorganization of lusa in order to accommodate the addition of brands with a significant market presence in the united states and to integrate the operations of beck na and lusa,support the district court finding that one or more agreements between lusa and an affiliate have been entered or,in all likelihood,will be entered.as the district court aptly noted at oral argument,such complex matters are not accomplished with the snap of a finger.
appellants concede that the right to distribute beck beer and the transfer price associated with this distribution arrangement require an agreement.however,appellants contend that a new agreement was unnecessary because the labatt distributor agreement,effective since,dictates the terms of the exclusive distribution arrangement,including the transfer price for a new brand.appellants erroneously assume that lusa has only one of two choices to exercise its right of first refusal and decline to act as a new brand supplier,beck exclusive distributor or distribute the new brand under the labatt distributor agreement.however,under the labatt distributor agreement,if beck has a significant market presence,which appellants concede it does,the parties are required to negotiate in good faith on terms and conditions as the parties deem equitable and appropriate under the circumstances.labatt distrib,at by its terms,then,the labatt distributor agreement expressly contemplates that certain parties to a proposed brand integration and distribution arrangement will negotiate but not necessarily agree upon whether to use the existing terms of the labatt distributor agreement or to fashion different terms.thus,lusa could have negotiated for different terms than those in the labatt distributor agreement.
the mere existence of the labatt distributor agreement imposes no obligation to ultimately distribute beck brands through lusa nor does it obviate the need for negotiation and agreement on the precise terms and conditions governing a new distribution arrangement.we find no evidence suggesting that acceptance of the labatt distributor agreement lock,stock,and barrel is a foregone conclusion in a proposed integration of a new brand with a significant market presence.the only circumstance contemplated by the labatt distributor agreement and one which we find is a foregone conclusion is that the parties to integration of a new brand with a significant market presence will negotiate in good faith over the terms and conditions of that integration.as in this case,lusa and interbrew negotiated,as required,and ultimately agreed to incorporate beck brands into lusa portfolio on the same terms as applicable to other brands.that constitutes an agreement,at least insofar as is necessary to support the district court finding that the beck integration has required lusa and an affiliate to enter an agreement.this agreement does not stand alone,however,as the beck integration is far from complete.as we stated above,other agreements will,in all likelihood,be necessary.
appellants counter that any such agreements that have been or will be entered are nothing more than informal or colloquial agreements,which lack the degree of formality required in order to be covered by section v.we disagree.beneath the simplistic garb in which appellants adorn the beck integration lies a complicated,endeavor.fully integrating beck brands into lusa portfolio is not equivalent to an ordinary,business venture by a parent in addition to striking an agreement regarding the distribution rights and the transfer price,lusa and an affiliate will need to
