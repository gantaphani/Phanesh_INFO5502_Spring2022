in this appeal we consider again the meaning and scope of the bankruptcy code fraudulent transfer provisions in a.in particular,we review the district court determinations that a debtor right to a surplus generated by a pension plan is a property interest an amendment to that pension plan that irrevocably decreases the surplus is a transfer of the property interest and the value surrendered and the value gained as a result of the transfer need not be precisely calculated in this instance in order to conclude that they are not reasonably equivalent.we also review the district court assignment of the burden of proof.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
facts and procedural background 
fruehauf financial problems 
fruehauf trailer corporation fruehauf or the company,a delaware corporation,operated facilities throughout the united states that designed,manufactured,sold,distributed,and serviced truck trailers and related parts.fruehauf expanded its business rapidly in the,leading to overextension of capital and related cash flow problems.by the early fruehauf liabilities such as employee health care and pensions exceeded revenues,and by fruehauf had a negative net worth of approximately million.the company sought to address this problem by reducing its work force to approximately employees about half of them union members,closing facilities,and selling assets.it also froze the calculation of retirement benefits for all employees at salary levels.
in the early the fruehauf board of directors the board began exploring a possible sale of the company,in whole or in part.in fruehauf entered into contracts with several of its top executives that would pay them significant benefits if the company or its assets were sold.these contracts sought to ensure that top executives would remain with the company until the sale,as the benefits would not accrue to the beneficiaries unless they were still employed by fruehauf at that time.in,fruehauf also instituted a key employee retention program kerp under which it agreed to pay bonuses totaling million to forty key employees if they agreed to remain until the sale or march,whichever came first.
b.the emergency board meeting 
fruehauf continued to have financial difficulties,and on september,with the company lacking sufficient cash to meet its payroll and other operating expenses,its board held an emergency meeting.although the parties dispute what was considered at this meeting,the district court concluded that the board and fruehauf outside counsel discussed three things.first,they considered the possibility of a chapter bankruptcy filing.second,they discussed a modified retention plan that would distribute immediate cash payments to twelve of the kerp beneficiaries if they agreed to remain with the company until at least march,the kerp modification.finally,they discussed an amendment known as the third amendment to the company pension plan 
the third amendment was drafted by fruehauf outside counsel and reviewed by geraldine tigner fruehauf vice president of human resources and greg fehr a senior fruehauf executive,both of whom were members of the company pension administration committee.limited to fruehauf employees almost all of them managers or executives,and none union members or workers,it provided two things.first,it lifted the benefit freeze for those employees who were vested in the pension plan and calculated benefits based on salaries hereafter the pension thaw provision.second,it granted all covered employees a cash contribution to their pension account equal to of annual salary plus annual interest hereafter the cash benefit provision if they were employed by the company or its successor on,or were laid off prior to,march.because the cash benefit provision was available to all employees covered by the third amendment,it included even those not vested in the pension plan.notably,tigner and fehr,who were the only fruehauf executives to review the third amendment and who were also beneficiaries of the kerp,stood to reap substantial benefits from its adoption.fehr pension benefits increased by,while tigner benefits increased by fruehauf later calculated the cost of the third amendment as million.
the source of funding for the third amendment was a surplus on the union side of fruehauf pension plan,the funds designated to pay benefits for union members exceeded the cost of those benefits.those surplus funds would otherwise revert to the company after benefits were paid.
with this backdrop,the board approved the third amendment at the september,emergency meeting.it became effective on october.
proceedings in the bankruptcy court 
on october,fruehauf filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in the district of delaware.fruehauf debts and liabilities totaled over billion at this time,and it was liquidated to satisfy its creditors.several purchasers bought fruehauf assets in the united states and europe.the most significant purchaser was wabash national,wabash,which bought two manufacturing plants and distribution centers in the united states for million.although the asset purchase agreement between fruehauf and wabash did not contain a commitment on wabash part to retain any of fruehauf employees after the sale,it did rehire approximately unionized employees.fruehauf remaining assets were placed in a liquidation trust known as the end of the road trust,and the pension plan was taken over by appellee pension transfer corporation ptc,a subsidiary of the trust.
during the course of the bankruptcy case,fruehauf sought and received the bankruptcy court approval of payments to key employees who had participated in the kerp.it did not seek bankruptcy court approval of disbursements under the third amendment.
on january,fruehauf as began an adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court against the pension plan,alleging that payouts under the third amendment would result in a fraudulent transfer in violation of.the bankruptcy court granted fruehauf request for a preliminary injunction against the pension plan and enjoined the plan from distributing payments under the third amendment.on october,the bankruptcy court approved fruehauf amended reorganization plan and substituted ptc as the administrator of the pension plan.ptc thus replaced fruehauf in the adversary action,which was transferred to the district court.
proceedings in the district court 
on april,the district court granted ptc motion to reclassify the pension plan as a nominal defendant and add the individual beneficiaries of the third amendment as defendants.on may,the court certified a mandatory defendant class,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure,consisting of all beneficiaries of the third amendment the class defendants.the court held a bench trial in march.
at trial,ptc called three witnesses to testify chriss street,an independent director of fruehauf and trustee of the end of the road trust lawrence wattenberg,the actuary for the fruehauf pension plan and irving becker,the head of the compensation advisory services group of the accounting firm kpmg,who testified as an expert on employment compensation in general and kerps in particular.
street testified that he and worth frederick,the other independent director on the fruehauf board,strenuously objected to the kerp modification at the september,meeting because it prepaid the kerp bonuses of many top executives at a time when it was difficult for those executives to find work elsewhere in the industry resulting in little concern they would leave the company.he also testified that the board was not given any substantive information about the third amendment and that it was presented at the board meeting as an administrative change that would have no cash effect on the company.moreover,street testified that the third amendment was never presented as a part of the kerp or for the purpose of employee retention.although street and frederick abstained,the board approved both the kerp modification and the third amendment.later,street and frederick objected to the minutes of the meeting,which stated that the third amendment was part of the kerp and that both of them had voted in favor.the minutes were only corrected after the company entered chapter and street and frederick became the sole remaining board members.
wattenberg testified that his review of the third amendment revealed that,on average,it nearly doubled the pension benefits of salaried employees,and that c ertain senior executives increased their benefits by to percent.he also calculated that,as of september,the cost of the third amendment rose to over million.on,however,he admitted that he did not calculate how much of a surplus existed in september or how much money fruehauf might have recovered without the third amendment.
becker testified that the third amendment was not part of the kerp or otherwise for the purpose of employee retention.he noted that,in his experience,he had never seen pension benefits used as part of a kerp,and that the reasonable norm for kerps would include payments to key employees of between and of revenue to retain them for twelve to eighteen months.he calculated that the fruehauf kerp apart from the third amendment was at the high end of those norms because it paid about of revenue to retain key employees for only eight months.if the third amendment was viewed as part of an employee retention plan,however,fruehauf plan the kerp plus the third amendment would cost of annual,in becker expert opinion,was not reasonable and did not provide additional value to fruehauf.
the class defendants called two witnesses to testify geraldine tigner as noted above,fruehauf vice president of human resources and one of the fruehauf executives to review and benefit from the third amendment and mark holden,wabash chief financial officer.tigner testified that the pension thaw provision of the third amendment was designed to improve morale and the cash benefit provision was intended to benefit those who were not yet vested in the pension plan and thus could not benefit from the pension thaw provision.she testified that both provisions were meant to help retain personnel while fruehauf was searching for a buyer,and that this understanding was communicated in an october,letter she sent to fruehauf salaried employees,which stated that the third amendment was intended to reward our loyal employees whose dedication will provide the basis for a successful transition.
on,however,tigner conceded that the pension thaw provision was intended to bring the pension plan up to date and take into account salaried employees past service.she further testified that the third amendment was not made applicable to unionized employees because their collective bargaining agreements prohibited unilateral changes in benefits.she did not,however,ask the unions if their members wanted a pension increase despite the fact that the surplus used to pay for the third amendment had been generated on the union side of the pension plan.
holden testified that wabash was interested in purchasing fruehauf as an ongoing business and was very concerned about the flight risk of management within those businesses as well as the people underneath management.he further testified,however,that he was not sure wabash paid more money for fruehauf because it was an ongoing business,and agreed with plaintiff counsel characterization of the asset purchase agreement as assigning no value to fruehauf employees.holden also stated that wabash expressly refused to make any promises to hire any of fruehauf employees.
district court decision 
on january,the district court issued a comprehensive opinion finding that the third amendment was a fraudulent transfer under.the court determined,as a factual matter,that the amendment was never presented to the board as part of the kerp,and even if it had been,the total kerp would have constituted of annual revenue,which would have exceeded the amount that a reasonable company in fruehauf position would spend to retain employees.the court also found that the class defendants offered no evidence that wabash paid more money because the assets it purchased were ongoing operations.
turning to the legal question of whether the third amendment was a fraudulent transfer,the district court analyzed the factors set forth in.it concluded that fruehauf had a future ownership interest in any surplus generated by the pension plan,and that the third amendment irrevocably transferred this interest to the class defendants by allocating a portion of the surplus to increased pension benefits for salaried employees.the court agreed with the class defendants that ptc failed to prove that fruehauf received no value from this transfer,but nonetheless concluded that the value was not reasonably equivalent to the costs of the transfer.specifically,the court rejected the class defendants contention that the third amendment helped retain key personnel and assure that fruehauf remained an ongoing business so that it was easier to sell.it concluded that fruehauf received considerably less than the cost of the third amendment because,coupled with the kerp,the class defendants purported retention goals cost fruehauf twice the norm and the class defendants failed to rebut adequately ptc evidence that the million projected cost of the third amendment did not help assure the million wabash purchase.indeed,the court noted that holden did not testify with certainty that wabash would not have purchased the fruehauf assets if they were not ongoing concerns,and tigner was not able to offer factual support for the conclusion that the third amendment had the effect of retaining fruehauf employees.the district court therefore determined that payments under the third amendment would be a fraudulent transfer that ptc could avoid.
the class defendants raise three issues on appeal.first,they contend that the district court erred in determining that ptc had a cognizable property interest in the pension plan surplus that was transferred as a result of the third amendment.second,they argue that the court erred in not applying the correct test for determining whether a transfer is fraudulent,and that error is not harmless because ptc did not satisfy its burden of proving the value surrendered and received.third,they assert that the court erred in assigning the burden of proof

iii.analysis 
section a allows a trustee to avoid any transfer of the debtor interest in property made within one year before the filing of a bankruptcy petition if the transfer was the result of actual or constructive fraud this provision aims to make available to creditors those assets of the debtor that are rightfully a part of the bankruptcy estate,even if they have been transferred away.in re pws holding,cir.
actual fraud is prohibited by a a,which allows a trustee to avoid a transfer made with actual intent to hinder,delay,or defraud any entity to which the debtor was or became indebted.constructive fraud,the subject of this appeal,is prohibited by a b although it contains no intent requirement,fraud on the creditors is presumed once the plaintiff establishes the requisite elements.mellon bank,metro communications,cir hereafter metro communications.those elements are the debtor had an interest in property a transfer of that interest occurred within one year of the bankruptcy filing the debtor was insolvent at the time of the transfer or became insolvent as a result of the transfer and the transfer resulted in no value for the debtor or the value received was not reasonably equivalent to the value of the relinquished property interest.see a bfp resolution trust,d.the party bringing the fraudulent conveyance action bears the burden of proving each of these elements by a preponderance of the evidence.see mellon bank,official comm.of unsecured creditors in re,cir hereafter.there is no dispute here that the alleged transfer was made within one year of the filing of fruehauf bankruptcy petition and that fruehauf was insolvent at that time.therefore,the relevant issues are whether ptc satisfied its burden of proving that fruehauf had a property interest,that the interest was transferred,and that the gains and losses as a result of the transfer were not of reasonably equivalent value.
property interest 
the bankruptcy code defines property interests broadly,encompassing all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property.a.the supreme court has noted that t he main thrust of the bankruptcy code is to secure for creditors everything of value the bankrupt may possess in alienable or leviable form when he files his petition.to this end the term property has been construed most generously and an interest is not outside its reach because it is novel or contingent or because enjoyment must be postponed.segal rochelle,d.property of the estate includes all interests,such as contingent interests and future interests,whether or not transferable by the debtor.in re prudential lines,cir quoting.it is also well established that the mere opportunity to receive an economic benefit in the future is property with value under the bankruptcy code,at.
under erisa,an employer who sponsors a qualifying retirement plan is entitled to recoup any surplus upon termination of the plan.see d ashenbaugh crucible,salaried retirement plan,cir.this recoupment right is a transferable property interest.see,creasy coleman furniture,cir u nder the terms of the contract any assets of the pension fund were to be paid over to the company t he excess,if any,would be property of the debtor estate.the trustee acquires the rights that the corporate bankrupt possessed therefore,the excess funds would be an asset in the bankrupt estate.in re wingspread,a lthough the right to recover the surplus from an retirement plan is a future estate,the reversion itself is a present,vested estate.as a result,the employer reversionary interest falls within the broad reach of section a of the bankruptcy code and is considered property of the debtor estate.not only does the employer have a present interest in those reversionary assets,but that reversionary interest is transferable and alienable.internal citations omitted.in this context,the district court was correct that fruehauf potential future recoupment of the surplus from its pension plan was a transferable property interest for purposes of.
the district court also correctly found that a property interest under the third amendment was transferred.the bankruptcy code defines transfer in the broadest possible terms each mode,direct or indirect,absolute or conditional,voluntary or involuntary,of disposing of or parting with property or an interest in property.d.under erisa provision,benefits accrued in a qualified plan are irrevocable an administrator or sponsor may not decrease them once they are granted.see g central laborers pension fund heinz,d see also hoover cumberland.area teamsters pension fund,cir defining accrued benefit as an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age quoting a.there is no question here that,upon ratification of the third amendment by the board,the benefits of the pension thaw and cash benefit provisions accrued to the class defendants.because erisa prohibited fruehauf from decreasing or revoking those benefits,the district court correctly concluded that the irrevocable allocation of part of the company future interest in the pension plan surplus in the form of increased benefits was a transfer for purposes of the bankruptcy code.
reasonably equivalent value 
the class defendants concentrate most of their attention on the district court determination that the value gained by fruehauf from the third amendment was not reasonably equivalent to the value surrendered.specifically,they contend that the district court erred in finding that ptc satisfied its burden of proof even though it did not conclusively establish either the value that fruehauf gave up as a result of its commitment to fund the third amendment or the value that fruehauf gained.this,the class defendants assert,runs afoul of metro communications calculation requirement.
before considering a plaintiff obligation to define with precision the value surrendered and gained as a result of a transfer,we need to understand the general structure of the reasonably equivalent value analysis.we have interpreted value to include any benefit,whether direct or indirect,at.as noted above,the mere opportunity to receive an economic benefit in the future constitutes value under the bankruptcy code.id.at.thus,fruehauf gave up something of value when the board ratified the third amendment.
the next question is whether the debtor received any value from the transfer.see id.at.although,as explained below,the totality of the circumstances is considered in determining whether the values surrendered and gained as a result of a transfer are reasonably equivalent,a court should not consider the totality of the circumstances in evaluating the threshold question of whether any value was received at all.id.at.rather,a court must consider whether,based on the circumstances that existed at the time of the transfer,it was legitimate and reasonable to expect some value accruing to the debtor.id.at internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted.although ptc argued before the district court that the third amendment did not confer any value on fruehauf,the court disagreed because ptc had not excluded the possibility that the third amendment was effective in retaining the services of at least one fruehauf employee.ptc does not challenge this determination on appeal.
if a court determines that the debtor gained at least some value as a result of the transfer,what follows is a comparison whether the debtor got roughly the value it gave.see a a metro commc ns,at.in conducting this factual analysis,a court does look to the totality of the circumstances,including the fair market value of the benefit received as a result of the transfer,the existence of an arm length relationship between the debtor and the transferee,and the transferee good faith,at.
calculation requirements 
as noted above,t he value of consideration received must be compared to the value given by the debtor.metro commc ns,at.calculating direct benefits such as an investment of cash that yields a cash return is typically easy,but becomes more difficult when benefits are indirect.see,at.nonetheless,t hese indirect economic benefits must be measured and then compared to the obligations that the bankrupt incurred.metro commc ns,at see in re richards conover steel,cir.bap i n deciding whether value has been transferred the court must examine all aspects of the transaction and carefully measure the value of all benefits and burdens to the debtor,direct or indirect.citation and internal quotation marks omitted in re bcp,same,citing metro communications.
metro communications does not,however,require a precise calculation of value in all circumstances.there,mellon bank mellon provided total communications systems tcs with a million loan to acquire metro communications,metro.metro guaranteed tcs debt to mellon and,to secure that guaranty,it granted mellon a security interest in its assets.as a result of this transfer,metro as part of tcs was eligible for substantial advances of credit and had the opportunity to synergize its operations with those of tcs.yet metro went bankrupt shortly thereafter,and the unsecured creditors committee argued that the security interest conferred no value on metro because metro did not receive the proceeds of the acquisition loan,and thus did not receive any direct benefits from extending the guaranty and security interest collaterizing that guaranty.metro commc ns,at.in holding that the security interest was not a fraudulent transfer under,we noted 
the value of the synergy obtained in the corporations affiliation and the value of obtaining the credit a
