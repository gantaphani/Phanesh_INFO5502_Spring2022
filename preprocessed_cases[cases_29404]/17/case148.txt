opinion of the court 
in these two cases,which have been consolidated on appeal,irvin lieberman lieberman and communications instituted federal securities fraud actions after the enactment of section of the public company accounting reform and investor protection act of that provision extended the applicable limitations period for private securities fraud claims from the earlier of one year after discovery of the wrongdoing or three years after the unlawful transaction to the earlier of two years after discovery or five years after the unlawful transaction.see a.
section of applies to all proceedings commenced on or after its enactment date,or july.b.were section applicable here,as lieberman and contend,the two actions would be timely,as they were filed within the limitations structure.both actions,however,had earlier been under the limitations scheme,inasmuch as the alleged wrongdoing in each case occurred approximately four years before the enactment of section.put simply,while the actions were filed after the enactment of section,they were already extinguished by then.
at issue in these cases is whether the amended limitations period of revives previously expired securities fraud claims.we hold that it does not,and in doing so,join the other courts of appeals that have addressed this same question.see in re enterprise mortg.acceptance,llc sec,cir holding that does not revive stale claims foss bear,stearns,cir same in re adc.sec,cir same.accordingly,we will affirm the district courts respective orders dismissing the actions.
the facts relevant to the disposition of these,those pertaining to the timing of not contested.we recount them below.
irvin lieberman 
on or about april,irvin lieberman filed a putative securities fraud class action against hanauer company hanauer in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania in effect,lieberman alleged that hanauer,as underwriter of certain debt securities issued in a public offering on april,induced investors to purchase the securities by misrepresentation,deceit and fraud,in contravention of the federal securities law.lieberman claimed that the investors became aware of the alleged misrepresentations only in march.
the complaint was subsequently amended,and thereafter,hanauer moved to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to state a claim under.b.hanauer argued,inter alia,that all of lieberman claims were as of april,three years after the date of purchase april.lieberman argued that his claims,filed within five years of the date of purchase,were timely under the extended limitations period of.he argued that the amended limitations scheme was applicable because he instituted the action on april,and hence after effective date of july.
the district court granted hanauer motion and dismissed the amended class action complaint in its entirety,declining to apply to revive lieberman expired claims lieberman appealed.
communications.
on july,communications,a leading merchant supplier of secure communications technology and other similar products,filed a securities fraud action in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania,naming as defendants various officers and shareholders of spd technologies,spd technologies and a subsidiary,spd electrical systems,spd electrical.spd electrical is a manufacturer of circuit breakers and switchgear for the united states navy nuclear submarines and surface ships.
as relevant here,the complaint,advancing claims under both federal and state law,alleged that on august,entered into a merger agreement with spd technologies and midmark capital,a majority shareholder of spd technologies,whereby purchased all outstanding shares of spd technologies.the complaint further alleged that the defendants engaged in a deceptive scheme designed to induce to pay an artificially high purchase price for the company through material misrepresentations and conceal the fraudulent scheme.claims not to have discovered this scheme until january.the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint,arguing,inter alia,that the federal securities fraud claims were after august,three years from the date of the merger august.
in a thorough and opinion,judge brody granted the defendants motion and held that,contrary to contentions,did not overcome the strong presumption against revival of claims,especially where those claims had been extinguished by a statute of repose.under the limitations scheme,judge brody concluded,claims had expired on august,three years after the date of the merger and nearly one year before the enactment of.judge brody declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state claims this appeal followed.
lieberman and now ask us to reverse the decisions below,which held that the extended limitations period of did not apply to revive their expired federal securities fraud claims.because both cases involve the identical legal issue,the parties submitted a joint motion for consolidation for purposes of disposition.the court granted that motion on november,
we have jurisdiction over the district courts final orders dismissing the respective actions pursuant to.our review is plenary.see ballay legg mason wood walker,cir this question is purely one of statutory construction which implicates our plenary standard of review.
prior to the enactment of,b,there was no congressionally created limitations period for federal securities fraud claims arising under section b of the exchange act.as a result,in lampf,pleva,lipkind,prupis petigrow gilbertson,d,the supreme court held that litigation instituted pursuant to section b and rule must be commenced within one year after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation and within three years after such violation,as statutorily prescribed for express causes of actions contained in the exchange act and the securities act.id.at.the lampf court viewed the limit as a period of repose,intended to impose an outside limit not subject to tolling principles.id.at.citation omitted.as the supreme court stated 
the period,by its terms,begins after discovery of the facts constituting the violation,making tolling unnecessary.the limit is a period of repose inconsistent with tolling because the purpose of the limitation is clearly to serve as a cutoff,we hold that tolling principles do not apply to that period.
as part of,enacted on july,congress amended the limitations scheme for private securities fraud actions,previously established by the supreme court in lampf.section of provides 
a a private right of action that involves a claim of fraud,deceit,manipulation,or contrivance in contravention of a regulatory requirement concerning the securities laws,as defined in section a of the securities exchange act of a,may be brought not later than the earlier of 
years after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation or 
years after such violation.
b effective limitations period provided by section b of title,united states code,as added by this section,shall apply to all proceedings addressed by this section that are commenced on or after the july,date of enactment of this act.
c no creation of in this section shall create a new,private right of action.
public company accounting reform and investor protection act of,stat,codified in part at b emphasis added.
both lieberman and maintain that section of applies retroactively to their claims,thus extending the relevant repose period to five years after the alleged fraudulent transactions they rely on the effective date provision of the statute,which provides that this section,shall apply to all proceedings that are commenced on or after july.b.both submit that they filed their actions after july,which,they claim,brings their actions within the purview of the new statute.section would extend the respective filing deadlines to april,for lieberman and august,for.the actions are timely if,and only if,section is applicable 
the appellees,on the other hand,contend that lampf provided the governing limitations structure for private securities fraud claims at the time of the alleged fraudulent conduct in each case.they further contend that lieberman and claims had been extinguished by the period of repose prior to the enactment of.the appellees submit that congress never intended for to apply retroactively to revive claims already extinguished by a statute of repose.
the question we must decide,then,is whether section effectuates this resurrection of moribund securities fraud claims.we now turn to its resolution.
we begin our analysis with a clarification of the question presented.retroactive application of a new statute,such as section,occurs whenever the statute is applied to causes of action already accrued prior to its enactment date.see landgraf usi film products,d the principle that the legal effect of conduct should ordinarily be assessed under the law that existed when the conduct took place has timeless and universal appeal.quoting kaiser aluminum chem.bonjorno,d scalia,concurring.but that description,while accurate,is nonetheless imprecise,at least for present purposes.
section of may be applied retroactively to two separate categories of cases.first,it is possible to give section retroactive effect by applying it to all claims that have accrued but have not yet expired as of the enactment date july.second,it is equally possible to apply section retroactively to revive already expired claims,an entirely separate category of cases.the eighth circuit court of appeals has explained the distinction as follows 
providing that a statute of limitations should be applied retroactively is a broad brush approach to what is actually a more specific inquiry.retroactive application can reach two categories of cases first,a group on which the statute has not run at the time the statute is amended and second,cases on which the existing statute has run at the time of amendment.the second group is affected not only by questions of the retroactive application of the statute,but also by the need to consider the question of revival of barred claims.
kansas pub.employees ret.reimer koger,cir holding that amendment to state limitations statute applied retroactively but did not revive actions.the present appeals fall into the second group of cases.
here,we decide only whether congress intended for section to revive already expired securities fraud claims.we do not decide the broader question,not presented by these appeals,whether congress intended section to have a general retroactive effect.though related,the two questions are analytically distinct,requiring separate inquiries into congressional intent.we are mindful of that distinction in applying the principles that govern our retroactivity determination.see martin hadix,d scalia,concurring noting that the key question is retroactive in reference to what.
the supreme court has frequently noted that there is a presumption against retroactive legislation that is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence.landgraf,at.the presumption arises because e lementary considerations of fairness dictate that individuals should have an opportunity to know what the law is and to conform their conduct accordingly.id.consequently,congressional enactments will not be construed to have retroactive effect unless their language requires this result.bowen georgetown,d.
in landgraf usi film products,the supreme court set forth a test for determining whether a particular statute applies retroactively.at.at the first stage,a court must determine if congress has expressly prescribed the statute intended reach.id.if congress has done so,the inquiry ends,and the court enforces the statute as it is written.id.if the statute is ambiguous or contains no express command,a court must examine whether the statute would have an adverse effect if it were held to be retroactive that is to say,whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he acted,increase a party liability for past conduct,or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.id.if the statute would do any of these things,it will not be applied retroactively,absent clear congressional intent to the contrary.id 
congressional intent 
in accordance with landgraf,we first look to the plain language of section of.section b states that the revised statute of limitations shall apply to all proceedings addressed by this section that are commenced on or after the july,date of enactment.lieberman and contend that this provision clearly expresses the temporal scope of the statute,and that the statute applies to all claims,even previously expired ones,filed after the date of enactment.that contention is a plausible one,but it is just as plausible to read the provision as applying to all claims that are still viable and not previously extinguished,filed after the date of enactment.even assuming,without deciding,that section b clearly provides for retroactive application,it does not necessarily follow that section b thereby clearly provides for the resurrection of moribund claims.
in addition,lieberman and read section b in isolation.in our view,however,section b must be considered together with section c,which provides that n othing in this section shall create a new,private right of action.see morton,d we do not construe statutory phrases in isolation we read statutes as a whole.section c creates,at a minimum,ambiguity as to the temporal reach of the statute.
application of to lieberman and claims,previously extinguished by the statute of repose,would create new causes of actions.as the supreme court has noted,extending a statute of limitations after the period of limitations has expired impermissibly revives a moribund cause of action.hughes aircraft united states ex rel.schumer,d citing chenault united states postal,cir relying on landgraf in holding that a newly enacted statute that lengthens the applicable statute of limitations may not be applied retroactively to revive a plaintiff claim that was otherwise barred under the old statutory scheme because to do so would alter the substantive rights of a party and increase a party liability see also enterprise,at where a plaintiff is empowered by a new statute to bring a cause of action that previously had no basis in law,a new cause of action has,in some sense of the word,been created.
the salience of section c is further magnified by the fact that lieberman and claims had been extinguished by a statute of repose,not merely by a statute of limitations.see stolz family partnership daum,cir noting that statutes of repose affect the availability of the underlying right that right is no longer available on the expiration of the specified period of time.the stolz decision distinguished a statute of repose from a statute of limitations in the following manner 
in general,a statute of repose acts to define temporally the right to initiate suit against a defendant after a legislatively determined time period.unlike a statute of limitations,a statute of repose is not a limitation of a plaintiff remedy,but rather defines the right involved in terms of the time allowed to bring suit.s tatutes of limitations bear on the availability of remedies and,as such,are subject to equitable defenses,the various forms of tolling,and the potential application of the discovery rule.in contrast,statutes of repose affect the availability of the underlying right that right is no longer available on the expiration of the specified period of time.in theory,at least,the legislative bar to subsequent action is absolute,subject to legislatively created exceptions set forth in the statute of repose.
id.at quoting calvin corman,limitation of actions,at.
if,as the supreme court has suggested,extending a statute of limitations after the period of limitations has expired would essentially create a new cause of action,see hughes aircraft,at,then a fortiori applying to claims extinguished by a period of repose would unequivocally create a new cause of action.compare chenault,at declining to apply new statute retroactively to revive a claim that would otherwise be stale under old statute of limitations.congress undoubtedly possesses the powers to resurrect claims extinguished by a statute of repose,no less than claims barred by a statute of limitations,but it must manifest those powers
