this securities class action lawsuit arises out of the acquisition of digital island,by cable wireless,plc c w.pursuant to a may,merger agreement between digital island and c w,dali acquisition dali,a subsidiary of c w,made a cash tender offer to shareholders of digital island under which it acquired percent of the shares of digital island.dali was thereafter merged into digital island,which survived as a subsidiary of c 
plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended class action complaint the complaint on may.plaintiffs in this case represent a class comprised of all persons,other than the named defendants and certain related parties,who owned digital island common stock during the relevant period and who received the tender offer defendants are digital island,members of digital island board of directors during the relevant time period,including digital island ceo,ruann ernst the directors c w,c w ceo,graham wallace and dali.plaintiffs allege that,in connection with the tender offer,defendants made misleading statements and failed to disclose material information in violation of section e of the securities and exchange act of the act,as amended by the williams act of.e.plaintiffs further allege that the directors received extra consideration for their shares in violation of section d of the act,d,and securities and exchange commission sec rule,the best price rule,a.plaintiffs allege both individual violations by defendants of these provisions,as well as control person liability under section a of the act.a.
the district court dismissed plaintiffs consolidated amended complaint,with prejudice,for failure to state a claim pursuant to.b and the private securities litigation reform act of the pslra.in re digital island sec,d.by a subsequent order,the district court denied plaintiffs motion,pursuant to.e,which sought to alter the court judgment and to permit plaintiffs to file an amended complaint under.a.because we conclude that plaintiffs proposed second consolidated amended class action complaint the proposed amended complaint does not articulate a viable theory of fraud,we will affirm both orders of the district court.
the following facts are drawn from the proposed amended complaint and from digital island securities and exchange commission sec form,which is referenced in the proposed amended complaint and included in the joint appendix.see oran stafford,cir taking judicial notice of documents required by law to be filed with the sec.digital island provides a global delivery network and suite of services for enterprises that use the internet to deploy business applications and conduct.digital island began searching for a potential acquirer in august of,at which time representatives of digital island contacted representatives of c w to gauge c w interest in a strategic partnership with digital island.in march of,c w indicated that it was interested in a potential business combination with digital island.in april of,c w delivered an initial draft of the merger agreement and made an initial offer to purchase digital island for a share.after considering the offer and meeting with its financial advisors,digital island advised c w that it was prepared to begin negotiations,provided that the offer price was increased to at least.
negotiations between digital island and c w continued through april and into may,but c w would not agree to raise its offer to per share.on may,digital island announced an agreement to provide certain business services to microsoft corporation.the price of digital island stock rose that day from per share to per share.on may,representatives of c w indicated that c w board of directors had preliminarily approved an offer of per share digital island made a of per share,which was rejected by c on may,the digital island board met and voted unanimously to approve the execution of the merger agreement with a per share tender offer price of and to recommend to the shareholders that they accept the tender offer.
on may,digital island and c w executed the merger agreement,which contemplated a first step tender offer followed by a second step merger.under the tender offer,shareholders who tendered their shares were to receive per share.under the merger,all remaining shares of digital island would be canceled,and shareholders would receive per share.the tender offer period expired on june,and on june,digital island announced that approximately percent of its outstanding stock had been tendered.
plaintiffs section e claim is based on two significant business deals that were announced immediately after the expiration of the tender offer.on june,digital island announced a major business agreement with bloomberg lp,and on july,digital island announced another major business agreement with major league baseball mlb.according to plaintiffs,both the bloomberg and mlb deals had substantial value to digital island,and,if disclosed,would have substantially influenced the shareholders decision to tender their shares 
plaintiffs allege that defendants knew of the bloomberg and mlb deals prior to expiration of the tender offer,but deliberately or recklessly failed to disclose the deals until after the expiration of the tender offer.plaintiffs argue that defendants had an affirmative duty to disclose the bloomberg and mlb deals,or,alternatively,that defendants failure to mention those deals in the tender offer and the schedule rendered those documents materially misleading.plaintiffs allege that defendants were motivated to suppress the bloomberg and mlb deals because the success of the tender offer and resulting merger created a windfall for defendants that was not enjoyed by digital island other shareholders.specifically,plaintiffs allege that,pursuant to the merger,the directors received substantial cash payments for outstanding options to purchase digital island common stock,as well as for their shares of restricted common stock.additionally,plaintiffs allege that ceo ernst had executed a lucrative contract for employment to serve as president and ceo of the surviving entity 
such extra consideration was given to digital island officers and directors in order to induce them to support the offer to purchase at the price per share and to withhold the announcement of the bloomberg and major league baseball deals until after the expiration of the offer to purchase in order to preclude the need for c w to increase the consideration in the offer to purchase.
app.at.according to plaintiffs,disclosure of the bloomberg and mlb deals threatened to derail the merger with c w 
if the announcement induced more than percent of digital island stockholders not to tender their shares,the merger would not be consummated and the digital island officers would lose their lucrative employment agreements,as well as the extra consideration for their shares.thus,any announcement concerning the bloomberg or major league baseball deals carried with it the threat of undermining the merger agreement.
in addition to their section e claim,plaintiffs allege that,by virtue of these cash payments and the ernst employment agreement,the directors received extra consideration for their shares in violation of section d of the act and the sec best price rule.plaintiffs allege individual violations by defendants of sections e and the best price rule,as well as control person liability under section a of the act 
the district court dismissed the complaint on september,for failure to state a claim.the district court held that plaintiffs section e claim failed to meet the heightened pleading requirements of the pslra in two respects the complaint did not identify with specificity the statements that were allegedly misleading,and the complaint did not plead facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter.b.the district court further held that plaintiffs failed to state a claim for violation of the best price rule because that provision applies only to payments made during a tender offer,and the extra consideration alleged by plaintiffs was received pursuant to agreements executed prior to the tender offer.finally,the district court dismissed plaintiffs control person liability claim because the predicate violations on which that claim was based,the section e and best price rule claims were dismissed,and because plaintiffs failed to allege facts sufficient to establish control culpable participation.
plaintiffs filed a motion to alter judgment and for leave to file an amended complaint under.e and a.the district court denied plaintiffs motion on november.the district court concluded that plaintiffs had deliberately and unreasonably delayed seeking leave to amend until after judgment had been entered on the motion to dismiss.
plaintiffs timely appealed both orders on december,the district court had subject matter jurisdiction under and.this court has jurisdiction over the district court order dismissing plaintiffs complaint under because the complaint was dismissed with prejudice.manze state farm ins,cir.this court also has jurisdiction under section over the district court denial of plaintiffs motion for leave to amend.see foman davis,d river ins.cigna reinsurance,cir.we review de novo a district court dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim under.b.ramsgate court townhome ass west chester borough,cir.
on december,after oral argument in this case,the successor entity to the merger of digital island and dali filed for chapter bankruptcy in the district of delaware.under a,this filing operates to stay all proceedings against digital island and dali.digital island is a defendant in plaintiffs section e claim,and dali is a defendant in plaintiffs best price rule claim.although the stay of proceedings against digital island and dali does not affect our reasoning,it does mean that our decision today does not reach either entity.
section e of the act provides,in pertinent part 
it shall be unlawful for any person to make any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they are made,not misleading,or to engage in any fraudulent,deceptive,or manipulative acts or practices,in connection with any tender offer 
e.the district court held that section e requires proof of scienter,a mental state embracing intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud.ernst ernst hochfelder,d.both parties appear to agree 
section e is modeled on the antifraud provisions of b of the act and rule,schreiber burlington northern,d,which require proof of scienter,ernst ernst,at.because of the similarity in the language and scope of section e and rule,we have in the past construed the two consistently,flynn bass,cir adopting the same test of materiality for both section e and rule.we therefore join those circuits that hold that scienter is an element of a section e claim.see.bank fluor,cir smallwood pearl brewing,cir congress adopted in section e the substantive language of the second paragraph of rule and in so doing accepted the precedential baggage those words have carried over the years.
the pslra establishes a heightened pleading requirement for certain securities fraud cases.the pslra requires plaintiffs to state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.b.in requiring a strong inference of scienter,the pslra alters the normal operation of inferences under.b.in re rockefeller ctr.sec,cir u nless plaintiffs in securities fraud actions allege facts with the requisite particularity they may not benefit from inferences flowing from vague or unspecific that may arguably have been justified under a traditional rule b analysis.see also greebel ftp software,cir a mere reasonable inference is insufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.for purposes of the pslra,plaintiffs may plead scienter by alleging facts that establish a motive and an opportunity to commit fraud,or constitute circumstantial evidence of either reckless or conscious behavior.in re advanta.sec,cir.either way,plaintiffs must plead facts with particularity,and these facts must give rise to a strong inference of a knowing or reckless misstatement.id.at.
plaintiffs theory of the case is that the directors and ceo wallace suppressed the bloomberg and mlb deals to ensure the success of the tender offer and the subsequent merger when the tender offer succeeded,the merger cashed out various options to purchase shares of common stock as well as shares of restricted common stock held by the directors.according to plaintiffs,the prospect of cashing out these holdings induced the directors to suppress information that would have raised the value of digital island shares.such an increase,plaintiffs allege,would have jeopardized the merger agreement because shareholders would not have tendered at and c w would not have increased the consideration offered.ceo ernst lucrative employment contract with the surviving entity provided her with a further inducement.
setting aside the ernst employment agreement,the directors stood to gain from any increase in digital island share price in the same manner as any other digital island shareholder,that is,by tendering their shares into the offer or by having their shares cashed out in the merger.moreover,our reading of the proposed amended complaint compels the same conclusion reached by the district court as a result of the tender offer and merger,each director was paid the face value of the options,the difference,if any between the option price and.digital island,d at.nevertheless,plaintiffs argue that the success of the tender offer created a windfall for the directors because it allowed them to unload their holdings all at once,at a guaranteed price of a share 
granting that some value might attach to the avoidance of future risk,or that only so many shares can be unloaded on the open market without depressing the share price,plaintiffs theory is nevertheless a weak inference teetering on an unfounded assumption.kalnit eichler,cir sufficient motive allegations entail concrete benefits that could be realized by one or more of the false statements and wrongful nondisclosures alleged.quoting shields citytrust,cir.the inference is that the directors feared that c w would abandon its efforts to acquire digital island if the share price increased.plaintiffs argue that this fear can be inferred from c w rejection of digital island,and from the fact that the merger agreement was hastily executed within days of the disclosure of the microsoft deal.whether or not this inference is reasonable under rule b,the pslra requires a opposed to merely to survive a motion to dismiss.see rockefeller,at.the inference urged by plaintiffs is not strong,because the far more compelling inference is that the directors bargained aggressively with c w,motivated solely by a desire to exploit the surge in digital island stock price that followed the announcement of the microsoft deal.if the directors were confident of the bloomberg and mlb deals before the merger agreement was finalized,they would certainly have disclosed those deals to support their if instead,the bloomberg and mlb deals were finalized after execution of the merger agreement,c w rejection of the could have no bearing on how c w would react to the deals.rather,c w decision to increase the tender offer price following the microsoft deal would indicate that c w might respond favorably to the bloomberg and mlb deals.
regardless of the strength of this inference,it rests on an assumption,devoid of any factual allegation whatsoever,that the directors would be worse off if c w withdrew its offer.yet plaintiffs theory of the case necessarily requires that disclosure of the mlb and bloomberg deals would have increased the market value of digital island stock absent the merger.accordingly,to establish a strong inference of motive,plaintiffs were obliged to allege some facts tending to show how the directors could have hoped to make out better by unloading their options and restricted stock than by realizing the impact of the bloomberg and mlb deals on their shares,either in the market or in a merger with another suitor.see advanta,at no strong inference of scienter where detailed allegations revealed that allegedly improper profits were small in comparison to defendants stock holdings burlington coat factory,at noting that plaintiffs had failed to plead facts showing that allegedly improper profits were substantial in comparison to defendants overall stock holdings and compensation considering all the allegations in plaintiffs proposed amended complaint,we agree with the district court that plaintiffs theory makes little economic sense because the directors own stock options would have been devalued if they tried to sell the company for less than full price.digital island,d at.the proposed amended complaint therefore does not allege facts giving rise to a strong inference that the directors acted with scienter in not disclosing the bloomberg and mlb deals in their statements regarding the tender offer.
the ernst employment agreement does little to strengthen the inference of motive that can be drawn from plaintiffs allegations.as with the directors stock holdings,plaintiffs allege no facts from which it can be inferred that the employment agreement actually created a windfall to ernst beyond what she would otherwise realize by an increase in the value of her shares.more fundamentally,the fact that ceo ernst had executed an employment agreement with the acquirer can not,in and of itself,establish a strong inference of motive.as the fourth circuit explained in phillips lci int l,cir 
a ssertions that a corporate officer or director committed fraud in order to retain an executive position,or retain such a position with the merged company,simply do not,in themselves,adequately plead motive 
the rationale underlying these holdings is straightforward.similar situations arise in every merger thus,allowing a plaintiff to prove a motive to defraud by simply alleging a corporate defendant desire to retain his position with its attendant salary would force the directors of virtually every company to defend securities fraud actions,every time that company effected a merger or acquisition.
accord kalnit,at a n allegation that defendants were motivated by a desire to maintain or increase executive compensation is insufficient because such a desire can be imputed to all corporate officers.because plaintiffs allegations regarding the ernst employment agreement do nothing to distinguish her motivations from those surrounding countless other mergers and acquisitions,the proposed amended complaint fails to create a strong inference of scienter as required by the pslra.
a reckless statement is one involving not merely simple,or even inexcusable negligence,but an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care,and which presents a danger of misleading buyers or sellers that is either known to defendant or is so obvious that the actor must have been aware of it.advanta,at.allowing plaintiffs to plead recklessness is intended to discourage deliberate ignorance and prevent defendants from escaping liability solely because of the difficulty of proving conscious intent to commit fraud.id.scienter therefore requires a misrepresentation so recklessly made that the culpability attaching to such reckless conduct closely approaches that which attaches to conscious deception.mclean alexander,cir quoting coleco,berman,cir per curiam.recklessness is not intended to encompass claims essentially grounded on corporate mismanagement.advanta,at.
we agree with the district court that plaintiffs allegations fail to create a strong inference of recklessness.because plaintiffs allegations show that defendants interests were at all times tied to the value of their shares,we have no basis to infer the sort of conscious disregard and deliberate ignorance required to plead scienter.at most,plaintiffs allegations show that the directors failed to exploit the potential that the bloomberg and mlb deals had to increase the value of digital island shares,whether through the tender offer price paid by c w or on the open market.such alleged mismanagement does not fall within the prohibitions of section e.
section d of the act provides,in pertinent part 
where any person varies the terms of a tender offer before the expiration thereof by increasing the consideration offered to holders of such securities,such person shall pay the increased consideration to each security holder whose securities are taken up and paid for pursuant to the tender offer 
d sec rule a,the best price rule,implements section d and provides no bidder shall make a tender offer unless t he consideration paid to any security holder pursuant to the tender offer is the highest consideration paid to any other security holder during such tender offer.a.plaintiffs allege that the directors received extra consideration for their shares when their options and restricted stock were cashed out in the merger pursuant to the merger agreement in addition,plaintiffs allege that the employment agreement between c w and ceo ernst further constituted a premium for her shares.there is no dispute that both the merger agreement and the ernst employment agreement were executed prior to the tender offer.
the district court adopted,and defendants urge this court to adopt,a rule that payments arising out of an agreement executed prior to a tender offer do not state a claim under the best price rule,which expressly applies only to payments made during a tender offer.a.the district court and defendants rely heavily on lerro quaker oats,cir,in which the seventh circuit held that transactions before or after a tender offer are outside the scope of rule.the plaintiff in lerro alleged that a controlling shareholder had received extra compensation for his shares in the form of an exclusive distribution agreement executed by the tender offeror and the controlling shareholder prior to the tender offer.id.at.the agreement was to commence upon consummation of the offer.id.the court held that the value of the distribution agreement did not constitute extra compensation in violation of the best price rule because the agreement was signed before the offer began.id.at.the court reasoned 
before the offer is not during the offer the difference between during and before or after is not just linguistic.it is essential to permit everyone to participate in the markets near the time of a tender offer.bidders are forbidden to buy or sell on the open market or via negotiated transactions during an offer,but they are free to transact until an offer begins,or immediately after it ends.
id.at see also katt titan acquisition,d,stating that rule is,on its face,aimed at conduct during the pendency of the tender offer quoting walker shield acquisition,d.
plaintiffs urge this court to adopt a more flexible rule that focuses on whether the allegedly improper payment is an integral part of the tender offer.for their part,plaintiffs rely on epstein mca,cir,in which the ninth circuit rejected the argument that rule turns on the timing of the payment.epstein did not involve an agreement executed prior to the tender offer period instead,the issue in epstein was whether a payment made after the tender offer expired could violate the best price rule.the ninth circuit held that such a payment could establish a violation,reasoning that to hold otherwise 
would drain rule of all its force since even the most blatantly discriminatory tender which large shareholders were paid twice as much as small fall outside rule prohibition,so long as the bidder waited a few seconds after it accepted all of the tendered shares before paying the favored shareholders.
id.at.epstein held that the proper focus should be whether the transaction was an integral part of the tender offer.id 
we agree with the seventh circuit and the district court that the market requires a rule to demark clearly the periods during which the special williams act rules apply.lerro,at.we also agree with epstein that tender offerors can not be permitted to evade the requirements of the williams act simply by delaying the actual payment,or by agreeing on the extra payment beforehand.indeed,lerro itself acknowledges that some payments made outside of the tender offer period may be so transparently fraudulent as to require them to be treated as made during the tender offer 
doubtless there are limits to the use of a merger as a means to deliver extra compensation.suppose the acquirer had promised a shareholder for each share he tendered during the offer,plus another for each of these shares one month later.just as tax law requires boot to be treated as a gain received from the sale of stock,securities law treats boot as a payment during the tender offer.
lerro,at.nevertheless,the exception to the general rule is a narrow one,and plaintiffs allegations do not fall within it.
where,as here,a plaintiff argues that the best price rule has been violated by a transaction executed prior to the tender offer,the plaintiff necessarily alleges that the tender offeror has fraudulently devised a scheme to circumvent the rule.an offeror can and will enter into a wide variety of agreements,including agreements with shareholders,that are conditioned on the success of the tender offer.the ernst employment agreement is a perfect example an offeror who intends to operate a company as a going concern after the acquisition may reasonably attempt to secure the services of incumbent management.only where the tender offeror deliberately inflates that compensation to provide a premium for the officer shares is there a violation of the best price rule.in such instances,the tender offeror has attempted to defraud the shareholders of the target company of the equal consideration to which they are entitled under the williams act and the best price rule.
accordingly,in order to base recovery under the best price rule on a transaction executed prior to the commencement of a tender offer,plaintiffs must comply with.b,which requires that i n all averments of fraud or mistake,the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity.see shapiro ujb fin,cir holding that rule b applies to claims under sections and of the securities and exchange act of,when those claims are grounded in fraud.rule b particularity requirement,which has been rigorously applied in securities fraud cases,burlington,at,requires plaintiffs to accompany their legal theory with factual allegations that make their theoretically viable claim plausible,id.at.furthermore,under the pslra,plaintiffs must allege facts giving rise to a strong inference that c w acted with fraudulent intent that is,that c w intended to provide a premium to the directors for their shares through the merger agreement and the ernst employment agreement.b see also burlington,at requiring,prior to passage of the pslra,allegations supporting a strong inference that the defendant possessed the requisite intent to satisfy rule b.
with respect to the merger agreement,plaintiffs allege that the directors received extra compensation to the extent that they were able to cash out all of their options and restricted stock at once.as a threshold matter,we question whether the best price rule should ever apply to payments made pursuant to a merger.we find persuasive the second circuit reasoning in kramer time warner,cir 
w e perceive no basis in the language,structure or legislative history of the act for viewing a statutory merger following a successful tender offer for percent of a target shares as a continuation of the tender offer.such a merger lacks the most salient characteristics of a tender offer to purchase,tender and acceptance.moreover,state and federal law clearly treat mergers as distinct from tender offers.statutory mergers are authorized and regulated by state corporation codes,and federal regulation of such mergers is found in federal regulations concerning the solicitation of proxies.finally,the williams act contains,in addition to the best price provision,time limits,disclosure requirements,pro rata acceptance rules,and provisions for withdrawal of tendered shares that make no sense whatsoever in the merger context 
accord lerro,at kramer rejects,rightly we think,any argument that a merger should be integrated with a tender offer.they are different transactions,under different bodies of law epstein,at distinguishing kramer on the grounds that kramer,unlike epstein,involved a statutory merger 
as discussed above,plaintiffs fail to cobble together a coherent theory as to how these payments could have induced the directors to suppress the bloomberg and mlb deals and support the tender offer.conversely,we have difficulty understanding how these payments could give rise to an inference that they were intended by c w as such an inducement.more fundamentally,the fact that the merger cashed out certain unvested holdings of the directors,without more,can not establish a strong inference of fraudulent intent.plaintiffs do not allege that these holdings were anything but preexisting,legitimate obligations of digital island.the only inference we can take from these allegations,then,is that c w chose to honor digital island existing obligations.plaintiffs provide no explanation for why this behavior should raise suspicion,particularly where c w intended to operate digital island as a going concern.
nor have plaintiffs alleged any facts that would render the ernst employment agreement suspect.plaintiffs do not allege that ernst employment agreement is a sham transaction designed to insulate an improper tender offer premium.they do not contend that the compensation package was excessive,or that it was out of line with amounts that similarly situated executives were paid.instead,plaintiffs simply characterize the agreement as lucrative.this conclusory allegation provides no basis on which to infer the payment of a share premium in violation of the best price rule.
the facts alleged by plaintiffs are therefore a far cry from epstein.in that case,the tender offeror executed an agreement with one of the shareholders,sheinberg,under which sheinberg would receive a lump sum payment if the tender offer succeeded.epstein,at.immediately after the execution of the,that same tender offer was announced.id.at.the defendant in epstein claimed that the payment was to induce sheinberg to stay on as an officer and to cash out his stock options under the merger.id.at.plaintiffs argued,however,that the options themselves were conditioned on the success of the tender offer.id.at.with respect to sheinberg amended employment agreement,plaintiffs pointed out that the payment appeared to correspond precisely to the value of his options,there was no compensation for services.id.at.epstein thus involved precisely the kind of allegations of fraud that a bright line rule would exclude from best price rule protection.further proceedings were therefore necessary to determine the purpose of the sheinberg agreement,whether the lump sum payment constitutes incentive compensation that the offeror wanted to give sheinberg independently of the deal,or a premium that the offeror wanted to give sheinberg as an inducement to support the tender offer and tender his own shares.id.at.
to the extent that epstein holds that the proper inquiry in such cases is whether the transaction unconditionally obligated the offeror,we respectfully reject that holding.id.at see also id.at concluding that an agreement was an integral part of the offer and subject to rule requirements because the agreement was conditioned on the tender offer success.whether the offeror was unconditionally obligated would be important if we were dealing with an outright purchase of securities.see b allowing purchases of securities outside of a tender offer where purchase is pursuant to an unconditional and binding contract entered into before public announcement of the tender offer epstein,at thus a bidder who purchases shares from a particular shareholder before a tender offer begins does not violate rule.but tender offerors routinely engage in transactions not involving the purchase of securities that are conditioned on the success of the tender offer,if the offer fails,the prospective employer never comes into existence.epstein unconditionally obligated test should not subject all of these transactions to challenge under the best price rule.see also lerro,at warning against a construction of the best price rule that would imperil coun
