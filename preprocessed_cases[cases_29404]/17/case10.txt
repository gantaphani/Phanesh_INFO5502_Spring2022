when a company stock declines,a shareholder lawsuit often follows.this case is no exception.following a drop in the share price of ariad pharmaceuticals,investors filed suit against the company and four corporate officers together ariad,alleging securities fraud in violation of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of exchange act,b and a,as well as the securities and exchange commission sec rule.the complaint also raised claims under sections and of the securities act of securities act,and,against ariad,its directors,and various underwriters involved in the company january offering of common stock.the district court stopped the litigation in its tracks by dismissing the complaint in its entirety.see in re ariad,d.the plaintiffs timely appealed.
we affirm the district court dismissal of the securities fraud counts,except with respect to one particular alleged misstatement for which we find the allegations set forth in the complaint sufficient to state a claim.we also affirm the disposition of the plaintiffs claims under sections and,albeit on different grounds than those articulated by the district court.
fairly read,the complaint alleges the following.ariad pharmaceuticals,is a publicly traded company headquartered in cambridge,massachusetts.at all times relevant to this litigation,harvey berger served as ariad chairman and chief executive officer ceo,edward fitzgerald served as the company executive vice president and chief financial officer cfo,frank haluska served as its senior vice president and chief medical officer,and timothy clackson served as its president of research and development,senior vice president,and chief scientific officer.
in,ariad embarked on the development of ponatinib a tyrosine kinase inhibitor tki designed to treat patients suffering from chronic myeloid leukemia cml.as with any experimental drug,the development process entailed a series of clinical trials.see carpenters pension annuity funds biogen idec,cir.discussing typical trial structure.the first trial,dubbed pace,was intended to determine the maximum tolerable dose mtd of ponatinib.after settling on as the mtd,ariad began a second trial,pace.the purpose of this study was to determine the safety,efficacy,and durability of ponatinib,in order to support its limited approval for cml patients who are resistant to or intolerant of other tki treatments.in november,with pace,ariad began to screen subjects for its third clinical trial,epic,which was designed to compare ponatinib directly against the leading cml drug on the market,gleevec.
in july,ariad began the process of submitting a rolling application to the fda for limited approval to market ponatinib.in conjunction with the application,ariad submitted a july interim report consisting of data from the pace trial,with a date of july.the center for drug evaluation and research cder,located within the fda,subsequently analyzed the data and issued a series of reports of its own collectively the cder report.
by october,ariad and the fda began corresponding in earnest about potential approval of ponatinib for limited applications.as part of this process,ariad submitted a proposed label.the fda,however,rejected ariad proposal,citing concerns about adverse cardiovascular events and dosage reductions.on december,after some additional,ariad announced that the fda had approved the marketing of ponatinib on a limited basis.it was not all good news,however,as the fda required ariad to include a black box warning on ponatinib label about the risk of adverse cardiovascular events.following disclosure of these developments,ariad per share stock price fell from to.
in the wake of the black box warning,ariad nevertheless continued to publicly project confidence in ponatinib.but more troubling news arose in october.first,on october,ariad informed investors that,based on additional data from an august interim report,it was pausing enrollment in all clinical studies of ponatinib due to increased instances of medical complications in the pace trial.days later,on october,ariad issued a form and accompanying press release indicating that it had agreed to halt the epic trial entirely.finally,on october,ariad announced that it was temporarily suspending the marketing and commercial distribution of ponatinib at the direction of the fda.the market reacted harshly,and ariad stock price fell to per share.the instant shareholder lawsuit followed.
ii.procedural history 
on the defendants motion,the district court dismissed the complaint in its entirety.as to the exchange act claims,the court found that the complaint sufficiently alleged material misrepresentations or omissions about ponatinib,but that it failed to give rise to a strong inference of scienter as required by the private securities litigation reform act of pslra.for the securities act claims,the district court held that the complaint did not plausibly allege any material misrepresentations or omissions in relation to ariad january common stock offering.

iii.exchange act claims 
section b of the exchange act forbids the use or employ,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security,of any manipulative or deceptive device tellabs makor issues rights,d alteration in original quoting b.the sec has implemented this provision via rule,which proscribes,among other things,any untrue statement of a material fact or omission of any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made not misleading.to state a claim under section b and rule,a plaintiff must plead the following elements a material misrepresentation or omission scienter a connection with the purchase or sale of a security reliance economic loss and loss causation.aca fin.guar.advest,cir.citing dura,broudo,d.
the only two elements implicated by this appeal are the existence of a material misrepresentation and scienter.ultimately,because we find that the complaint fails to adequately plead scienter with respect to most of the alleged misstatements,we need not determine whether those statements contained any misrepresentations or,if so,whether such misrepresentations were material.
we have,however,recognized that the materiality and scienter inquiries are linked.abiomed,at.this is because the marginal materiality of an omitted fact tends to undercut the argument that defendants acted with the requisite intent in not disclosing it.id.at citation omitted.accordingly,we must bear in mind that a fact is material where there is a substantial likelihood that its disclosure would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.basic levinson,d citation omitted.

here,ariad alleged misstatements fall into two broad categories those made before the fda december,limited approval of ponatinib and the corresponding disclosures and those made after such approval.we address each of these categories in turn below,and,with the exception of one statement,we agree with the district court that the complaint fails to give rise to the required strong inference of scienter.we also find the plaintiffs allegations of insider trading insufficient to resuscitate the inadequate fraud claims.
the first alleged misstatement identified during the period occurred in a december,press release about the pace trial data.the release indicated that i nitial safety data show ponatinib to be well tolerated.it went on to list the rates of some adverse events,including rash,thrombocytopenia,dry skin,abdominal pain,headache,and pancreatitis,but it did not mention the rate of cardiovascular events.as required by the pslra,the complaint purports to explain why the statement wa s misleading,b,by referencing the cder report based on data collected through july.the complaint identifies several similar statements by ariad about the safety of ponatinib between december and.the plaintiffs claim that each of these statements was materially misleading in light of the data reflected in the cder report.
but the plaintiffs theory of fraud suffers from a glaring omission.the complaint contains conclusory allegations that the defendants possessed contemporaneous knowledge of various facts in the cder report,including the rate of serious cardiovascular events,based on their continuous monitoring of the pace trial data.the plaintiffs do not,however,allege any specific facts about when the defendants learned of these adverse events or even when the adverse events occurred.rather,they impermissibly seek to establish fraud by hindsight,suggesting that,as early as december,the defendants must have known about adverse events occurring up until the july,date.not only does this theory defy logic,it also ignores our caselaw instruction that a statement can not be intentionally misleading if the defendant did not have sufficient information at the relevant time to form an evaluation that there was a need to disclose certain information and to form an intent not to disclose it.biogen,at see also id.at finding complaint insufficient to support inference of scienter where the plaintiffs failed to allege when the relevant adverse events became known auto.indus.pension tr.fund textron,cir.affirming dismissal where warnings by subordinates or expressions of concern by executives were notably absent.
the complaint allegations about access to the pace data do not fill this gap.only one such allegation relates to the period,and it stands for the unremarkable proposition that,as of may,ariad was in the process of collecting,qcing,and processing the data.the paragraph is silent on the crucial questions of when the serious adverse events occurred and when the defendants became aware of them.
in addition to statements about ponatinib safety,the complaint also cites various allegedly misleading statements about dose reductions.for example,on december,haluska,ariad chief medical officer,told investors,we have quantified yet the number of dose interruptions or dose reductions in the pace study.the plaintiffs theory of fraud follows a familiar pattern this statement was purportedly misleading because of the defendants contemporaneous knowledge of certain facts in the cder report,including the fact that of patients required a dose interruption or dose reduction.subsequent paragraphs contain similar allegations.we are,however,left to guess as to precisely when the defendants became aware of the dose reductions.
for these reasons,we have little trouble concluding that the complaint fails to create a compelling inference of scienter with respect to statements made before the july,date for the cder report.indeed,the plaintiffs come close to conceding as much by alleging that the defendants possessed knowledge of the relevant adverse events and dosage reductions b y no later than july.
arguably,the analysis could be different for time periods after that date if the defendants were familiar with the data that ariad provided to the fda.but the complaint contains no such allegation.in fact,aside from a conclusory statement that haluska participated in the creation of ariad july submission,the complaint fails to indicate whether and to what extent the defendants were involved in collecting or reviewing the relevant data.accordingly,we find the plaintiffs allegations insufficient to state a claim with respect to the purported misstatements from july through october.
on october,the fda sent an email to unspecified individuals at ariad rejecting the company proposed label for ponatinib due to inadequate safety disclosures.the agency cited the rate of serious cardiovascular events in the pace trial data,as well as the dose reduction rate.a meeting was held on november,which included fda personnel,haluska,and clackson,ariad chief scientific officer,among others.after that meeting,the fda directed ariad to submit a revised label with a black box warning.
in light of these later communications with the fda,the plaintiffs allegations are sufficient to support a strong inference of scienter with respect to one particular material misstatement on december,an investment bank published a report on ariad based on a breakfast meeting the previous day with chairman and ceo berger,haluska,and clackson,among others.the report stated,in pertinent part,that management continues to be optimistic about ponatinib prospects for approval in the with a favorable label.it further indicated that the drug profile continues to look very benign,with few worrisome signals.the report cited pancreatitis as the most prevalent serious adverse event occurring in of patients and noted low rates of cardiovascular issues.
assuming these allegations are true,it was knowingly or recklessly misleading for haluska and clackson to express optimism about ponatinib chances for approval with a favorable label weeks after learning that the fda had rejected ariad proposed label.while management may have held out hope of achieving this result,the expression of that hope without disclosure of recent troubling developments created an impermissible risk of misleading investors.see zak chelsea therapeutics int l,cir.finding a strong inference that the defendants either knowingly or recklessly misled investors by failing to disclose critical information received from the fda,while releasing less damaging information that they knew was incomplete.similarly,after the fda specifically noted the rate of serious cardiovascular events,it was knowingly or recklessly misleading for ariad to cite pancreatitis as the most prevalent serious adverse event.see aldridge,at t he fact that the defendants published statements when they knew facts suggesting the statements were inaccurate or misleadingly incomplete is classic evidence of scienter.
ariad fails to develop any argument that these misstatements were not material,and,in any event,we have little difficulty concluding that disclosure of the fda concerns or the rate of serious cardiovascular events with respect to ariad leading product would have altered the total mix of information available to investors.for these reasons,we reverse the district court dismissal of the section b and rule claims predicated upon this december,press release 
the plaintiffs allegations rely on the same type of fraud by hindsight theory that doomed the majority of their claims.it is undisputed that,on december,ariad disclosed to investors the rate of serious cardiovascular events as well as the fda requirement of a black box warning.the complaint nonetheless identifies various subsequent statements about ponatinib that were purportedly misleading for failure to disclose
