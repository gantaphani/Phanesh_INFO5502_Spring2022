genzyme corporation genzyme appeals from a district court order dismissing genzyme complaint against federal insurance company federal for failure to state a claim.genzyme sought to recover its costs in settling a shareholder class action under a corporate and director and officer liability insurance policy the policy issued to genzyme by federal.federal denied coverage and genzyme sued,seeking damages of million plus other relief.the district court held that genzyme loss was not insurable as a matter of massachusetts public policy.we disagree with this conclusion.in the alternative,the district court held that genzyme was precluded from recovering under the terms of the policy clause for any amount paid to settle claims.we agree with the district court that the policy does not cover the amount paid to settle claims against the corporation.however,we hold that the policy does cover any settlement amounts paid pursuant to an indemnification obligation with respect to the directors and officers.because a portion of the settlement amount may have been paid to settle claims against the directors and officers,we remand to the district court to consider the question of allocation.
genzyme is a biotechnology corporation organized under the laws of the commonwealth of massachusetts.from to,genzyme capital structure included tracking stock designed to track the performance of particular business divisions rather than the company as a whole.from december through june,three series of genzyme tracking stock were outstanding,one each for the general division which traded under the ticker symbol genz,the biosurgery division which traded as gzbx,and the molecular oncology division which traded as gzmo.each of these tracking stocks was a series of genzyme common stock.genzyme allocated the performance of programs,assets,and liabilities to each division.however genzyme owned the divisional assets and was responsible for all liabilities.therefore,though the tracking stocks reflected the financial performance of the separate divisions,the divisions themselves were not separate entities.each division was owned directly by genzyme and holders of the tracking stock were holders of a single class of genzyme stock and possessed voting rights in genzyme as a whole.each of these tracking stocks was registered under the securities exchange act of and traded under its own symbol on the nasdaq exchange.
genzyme articles of organization articles contained an optional share exchange provision which permitted genzyme to eliminate its tracking stock structure by requiring biosurgery division and molecular oncology division shareholders to exchange their shares either for general division shares or for cash 
the articles specified that each division shareholder would receive shares of general division stock equal to of the fair market value of the tracking stock in any share exchange.the articles defined fair market value as the average closing price of gzbx or gzmo stock during a period commencing thirty days prior to the announcement of a share exchange.
on may,genzyme announced that it had decided to invoke the exchange provisions in the articles and thereby eliminate the tracking stocks.we refer to this as the share exchange.in particular,genzyme announced that it would exchange each biosurgery division and molecular oncology division share for a certain number of general division shares,leaving the general division shares as the only outstanding common stock of the corporation.the share exchange was carried out on june.each biosurgery division shareholder received shares of genz stock per share of gzbx stock.genzyme itself received nothing in the exchange,other than cancellation of the tracking stock.
the share exchange was unpopular with many biosurgery division shareholders and soon after it was announced,a number of shareholder lawsuits were filed against genzyme,its board of directors,and its officers.one of these cases was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against genzyme,its directors,and two of its officers.that court certified a class consisting of those persons who held shares of gzbx stock when,after the market closed on may,genzyme announced the share exchange.on august,genzyme agreed to settle all of the class members claims against the company and against its directors and officers by making a payment of million.the entirety of the settlement payment was paid by genzyme.genzyme now seeks to recover from federal for the settlement payment in the amount of million,the maximum recovery allowed under the policy.although at least some of genzyme theories might also allow it to recover litigation costs in the shareholder suit,genzyme does not seek to recover those costs,presumably because the settlement costs million exceed the million policy cap.
an understanding of the claims made by the plaintiffs in the class action is integral to an understanding of the dispute between genzyme and federal.the operative complaint at the time of settlement,the fourth amended class action complaint,alleged that the creation of genzyme biosurgery division tracking stock was a product of its merger with biomatrix,biomatrix,an independent biomaterials company.this merger combined the assets of biomatrix with those of genzyme surgical product division and tissue repair division to create the biosurgery division.
the class action plaintiffs alleged that genzyme promised at the time of the merger that it would operate biosurgery as an independent business reflected by tracking stock,but failed to do so.in addition,the class action plaintiffs alleged that genzyme directors and officers managed the biosurgery division corporate earnings and withheld positive information about the biosurgery division in an effort to artificially depress the market value of the gzbx stock so that genzyme could fold the biosurgery division into the general division at an exchange rate that would be favorable to general division shareholders.since the articles provided a fixed ratio of exchange which depended on the market value of the biosurgery division shares,genzyme could execute the share exchange with fewer general division shares by artificially depressing the market value of the biosurgery division shares.general division shareholders would benefit from an exchange executed by issuing the minimum number of new general division shares possible.
the class action plaintiffs alleged that genzyme and its officers and directors violated the securities laws by causing genzyme to engage in insider trading and by failing to disclose material information to the public.they also alleged that the directors and officers breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty,candor,good faith,and due care to genzyme shareholders,including the biosurgery division shareholders.the class action plaintiffs further alleged that genzyme breached the implied covenant of good faith with respect to the articles of organization and that genzyme breached the merger agreement it had executed with biomatrix.finally,the class action plaintiffs alleged that genzyme engaged in unfair and deceptive trade practices under state law.the class action plaintiffs alleged that the directors and officers would be motivated to carry out such a scheme by virtue of the fact that they themselves owned large numbers of general division shares.
the class action in the underlying litigation involved two.the members of one sold their shares in the open market after the share exchange was announced but before june,when the share exchange occurred,and thus did not participate directly in the share exchange.the members of the other transferred their shares pursuant to the share exchange.
on september,federal issued the director and officer and corporate liability insurance policy at issue to genzyme.the policy covers claims made during the period of september,to september,the period during which the class action plaintiffs complaints were filed.it limits federal liability to million and is subject to a million deductible under insuring clause.insuring clause covers losses for which genzyme grants indemnification to its directors and officers.insuring clause covers losses suffered by genzyme on account of securities claims.insuring clause provides 
federal shall pay on behalf of genzyme all loss for which genzyme grants indemnification to each insured person,genzyme officers and directors,as permitted or required by law,which the insured person has become legally obligated to pay on account of any claim first made against him,individually or otherwise,during the policy period for a wrongful act committed,attempted,or allegedly committed or attempted by such insured person before or during the policy period.
insuring clause provides 
federal shall pay on behalf of genzyme all loss for which it becomes legally obligated to pay on account of any securities claim first made against it during the policy period for a wrongful act.
the policy defines loss as the total amount which genzyme or its officers and directors become legally obligated to pay on account of each claim and for all claims in each policy period made against them for wrongful acts for which coverage applies,including,but not limited to damages,judgments,settlements,costs and defense costs.emphasis added.the policy also provides that loss does not include matters uninsurable under the law pursuant to which the policy is construed.id.
the policy also contains a provision which provides that 
federal shall not be liable under insuring clause for that part of loss,other than defense costs,which is based upon,arising from,or in consequence of the actual or proposed payment by any insured organization of allegedly inadequate or excessive consideration in connection with its purchase of securities issued by genzyme.
emphases added.by its terms,the exclusion only applies to claims made against genzyme that implicate insuring clause.the policy does not define the term purchase of securities.
the policy also contains an allocation provision which provides as follows 
if a securities claim covered,in whole or in part,under insuring clauses or results in any director or officer under insuring clause or genzyme under insuring clause incurring both loss covered hereunder and loss not covered hereunder,because such securities claim includes both covered and uncovered matters,the parties shall allocate such amount to loss as follows 
of such amount constituting defense costs shall be allocated to covered loss and 
ii of such amount other than defense costs shall be allocated to covered loss.
iii notwithstanding i and ii,the parties shall allocate that part of loss subject to certain exclusions,including the clause based upon the relative legal exposure of the directors and officers and genzyme.
genzyme sought indemnification from federal under the policy.federal denied coverage,stating that the settlement payment is not an insurable loss under the policy.genzyme filed suit against federal in the massachusetts state courts,and the case was removed to the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.genzyme alleged that federal breached its contract with genzyme by denying coverage that federal breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and that federal engaged in unfair and deceptive acts and practices,in violation of.laws chs.and.
federal moved to dismiss genzyme complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b on the grounds that it failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.on september,the district court dismissed the suit.genzyme federal ins,d.the district court found that the settlement payment was not an insurable loss for the purposes of insuring clause as a matter of public policy.in reaching this conclusion,the district court opined that genzyme,in effect,stole from the biosurgery division shareholders and conferred an improper benefit on the general division shareholders.id.at.
the district court reasoned that genzyme should not be able to divide the benefits of equity ownership among its shareholders one way,redistribute those benefits,and then demand indemnification from its insurer for the redivision.id.at.the district court expressed its concern that a company could take advantage of a legal rule permitting indemnification in such circumstances,with the result being that the shareholders whose shares were cancelled would be compensated through the judgment or settlement,and the corporation other shareholders would obtain the benefits flowing from the share cancellation while shifting a portion of its sic costs to the corporation insurer.id.at.the district court therefore concluded that the settlement payment was not an insurable loss as a matter of massachusetts law,holding that a payment to resolve a claim that a corporation benefitted one group of shareholders at the expense of another group of shareholders is not legally insurable as against public policy.id.at.
in the alternative,the district court held that the settlement payment represented a loss in connection with genzyme purchase or proposed purchase of its own securities,thereby triggering the exclusion and excluding the payment from coverage under insuring clause.the district court also held that under the clause,genzyme was not entitled to reimbursement for its indemnification of its officers and directors under insuring clause even if the clause did not apply on its face to insuring clause.noting that it will often be the case that when a shareholder can bring a claim against the corporation,she can also bring one against its directors and officers,the district court opined that permitting genzyme to recover would encourage fraud by insured corporations.id.at.the district court therefore concluded that it makes little sense to allow a corporation to sidestep coverage limitations in its insurance policy through the simple expedient of claiming that a settlement payment was made to indemnify its directors and officers.id.finally,the district court held that genzyme did not state a claim of unfair and deceptive acts and practices under.laws ch.

the policy definition of loss excludes matters uninsurable under the law pursuant to which the policy is construed.the district court held that the settlement payment is not an insurable loss for any of the insuring clauses,including insuring clause,as a matter of massachusetts public policy because the settled claims charged that genzyme benefitted one group of shareholders at the expense of another.the district court provided no case or statutory support for this holding.
massachusetts law governs the scope of the policy.the public policy rationale articulated by the district court finds no support in massachusetts statutory or case law.massachusetts law recognizes only a limited public policy exception.massachusetts general laws ch,provides a list of risks for which insurance against loss may be issued and purchased.it provides that no company may insure any person against legal liability for causing injury,other than bodily injury,by his deliberate or intentional crime or wrongdoing.id.sub.sixth b.in andover newton theological school,continental casualty,the massachusetts supreme judicial court held that insurance coverage is impermissible against public policy under that provision if an intentionally committed,wrongful act was also done deliberately or intentionally,in the sense that the actor knew that the act was wrongful.id.at.this court has discussed this holding,remarking that i n other words,massachusetts law only proscribes coverage of acts committed with the specific intent to do something the law forbids.andover newton theological,cont l cas,cir emphasis altered.there is no contention that this exception is applicable in this case even though the class action plaintiffs did allege fraud by genzyme and certain of its officers and directors 
the supreme court has made it clear that under federal law,in order for a contract to be invalidated on public policy grounds,s uch a public policy must be well defined and dominant,and is to be ascertained by reference to the laws and legal precedents and not from general considerations of supposed public interests.grace rubber workers,quoting muschany united states.under massachusetts law,courts similarly are not charged with creating amorphous public policy limitations on insurance policies.
the massachusetts supreme judicial court has stated that p ublic policy refers to a court conviction,grounded in legislation and precedent,that denying enforcement of a contractual term is necessary to protect some aspect of the public welfare.beacon hill civic ass ristorante toscano,emphasis added.we see no basis in massachusetts legislation or precedent for concluding that the settlement payment is uninsurable as a matter of public policy.at the same time,there are significant reasons why such an exception should not be created as a matter of public policy.such an exception would have the effect of making it impossible to secure coverage for damages awards in routine securities litigation that charges the corporation with unfair or unlawful treatment of a class of securities holders.such coverage is clearly contemplated by the policy here.by its terms,the policy provided coverage for losses that genzyme becomes legally obligated to pay on account of any securities claim.a securities claim includes any claim brought by or on behalf of any securities holder of genzyme.if the parties wish to exclude such coverage,it is common to include limiting provisions as was,in fact,done here in the clause discussed below.there is no clear public policy that would prevent the parties from including securities litigation coverage in policies,or any basis to assume that policies are designed to exclude such coverage,particularly where,as here,securities litigation is specifically mentioned in the policy and one class of claims arising from such litigation is specifically excluded by the clause.
in the alternative,federal argues that the settlement payment represents restitution by genzyme of gains or benefits to which genzyme was not entitled and is therefore uninsurable.while there is no massachusetts case recognizing this principle,in the district court federal cited level communications,federal insurance company,cir and its progeny to support this contention.in level,the plaintiffs alleged that level corporation paid too little to acquire plaintiffs interests in a business by making fraudulent representations and retained for its own benefit the amounts it ought to have paid.level settled the claim,and sought coverage under its insurance policy with federal.the seventh circuit held that because the payment was restitutionary in nature,the settlement payment was not a loss and therefore not insurable because the definition of loss within the meaning of an insurance contract does not include the restoration of an gain.id.at.when a corporation receives a benefit to which it is not entitled and is then forced to disgorge that benefit,restitution is available to remedy the unjust enrichment.level embodies the principle that a restitutionary payment is not insurable.federal argued before the district court that level should govern this case.the district court rejected this argument because in its view,genzyme itself received no material benefit in the share exchange that could be disgorged through a restitutionary remedy.genzyme,d at.
we need not address the question of whether massachusetts recognizes the exception set forth in level as we agree with the district court that this case does not fit within the framework of level.this case does not present an unjust enrichment situation.here,genzyme obtained no identifiable asset in the share exchange and therefore the settlement payment can not represent the restoration to the plaintiffs of some amount genzyme had improperly taken and withheld.genzyme simply reorganized its capital structure by cancelling one series of stock and issuing additional shares of another series of stock,and acquired a right to cancel its tracking stocks.a corporation is neither benefitted nor harmed by issuing additional shares of stock the issuance of additional shares has no effect on a corporation assets or liabilities.the right to cancel shares is not an identifiable asset.therefore,the exception articulated in level would not apply even if recognized in massachusetts 
federal urges alternatively that a loss for insurance purposes does not occur if it derives from the fulfillment of an existing obligation.in other words,federal argues that fulfilling a preexisting obligation through a settlement or judgment does not transform that payment into a covered loss.see pac.ins,eaton vance,cir.in pacific insurance,the policy holder had a contractual obligation to establish and fund certain employee accounts pursuant to a plan.the policy holder failed to do so and thereafter was contacted by an employee who alleged that his account had not been properly funded.upon the advice of counsel,who informed the policy holder that the employee would likely be successful if he chose to litigate the issue,the policy holder retroactively established and funded the accounts to the level they would have reached had the policy holder timely contributed.the insurer thereafter sought a declaratory judgment that the money contributed was not recoverable under the insurance policy.this court agreed,holding that the policy holder 
seeks reimbursement for amounts it and satisfaction of its obligation to establish and fund those accounts to the level they would have attained had the policy holder initially complied with the plan.so understood,the cause of this obligation can not be the breach of the obligation instead,in our view,this obligation derived from the plan itself 
id.at footnote omitted.because the policy does not cover debts that are incurred through a contractual obligation,id.at,and because i t makes no sense to permit a dereliction in duty to transform an uninsured liability into an insured event,id.at,this court held that the payment was not a loss within the meaning of policy in suit.
this case does not fall within the rule articulated by this court in pacific insurance.unlike here,the dispute in pacific insurance involved a payment made to fulfill an explicit,preexisting contractual obligation to another party.indeed in pacific insurance,this court stated that the relevant liability for which the policy holder seeks recovery from its insurer is not one for breach of fiduciary duty relative to the belatedly funded employee accounts.id.at.instead,this court noted that the underlying obligation for which reimbursement is sought existed regardless of whether eaton vance first complied with its fiduciary duties or breached them.id.at.the same can not be said of this case.genzyme had no concrete and identifiable preexisting contractual obligation to pay the amount of the settlement.rather,the underlying complaint made clear that the alleged cause of the injury was in fact the breach of genzyme applicable fiduciary duties contractual obligations.in sum,this court holding in pacific insurance does not support a conclusion of uninsurability.
this leads us to the only provision in the policy that could provide a contractual basis for denying payment under the clause.it provides 
federal shall not be liable under insuring clause for that part of loss,other than defense costs which is based upon,arising from,or in consequence of the actual or proposed payment by any insured organization of allegedly inadequate or excessive consideration in connection with its purchase of securities issued by genzyme.
emphases added.this clause on its face bars recovery for losses under insuring
