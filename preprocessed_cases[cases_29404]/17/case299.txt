anvil is a privately held washington company that provides engineering services to petroleum companies in the northwest.quinn uncle,lorren levorsen,founded anvil in.quinn was employed by anvil in the late and early.in,levorsen established an employee stock ownership plan esop for anvil employees.in,levorsen gave his remaining anvil stock to a family company,with equal ownership interests divided among quinn,levorsen niece,and levorsen two stepsons.beginning in,quinn wrote letters to levorsen and anvil leadership urging the adoption of more aggressive strategies to increase the value of anvil stock.quinn also wrote anvil executives to report asserted deficiencies that he perceived in the valuation of anvil stock made in connection with the administration of the esop.
beginning in,quinn initiated a series of related lawsuits against anvil and its leadership,alleging undervaluation of its stock.quinn first lawsuit was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds shortly after being filed in in california.quinn second lawsuit,brought in washington state court in,was settled in.in february,quinn filed this derivative shareholder suit in the united states district court for the western district of washington.the only anvil stock quinn owned when he filed the suit was fifty shares given to him by his parents before the commencement of this suit.quinn named as defendants anvil,the esop,several board members,and others defendants.quinn alleged that appraisals used for esop valuation were flawed and resulted in undervaluation of anvil stock.quinn sought damages for breach of fiduciary duty,breach of contract,and negligence.
on july,while quinn lawsuit was pending,anvil board unanimously adopted a resolution to amend anvil articles of incorporation the resolution.the resolution stated that the proposed amendment would restrict ownership of substantially all of the company common stock to employees and the esop and effect a reverse stock split whereby each sixty shares of class a common stock would be automatically converted to one share of common stock.a shareholder with less than sixty shares would not be entitled to receive a fractional share,but would instead receive a cash payment in lieu thereof.thus the resolution would eliminate share ownership of those holding less than sixty shares.the resolution set a shareholder vote on the amendment for august.
on or about july,anvil board distributed proxy materials to anvil shareholders.the proxy materials said that the purpose of the amendment was to facilitate employee ownership of anvil,which anvil considered to be an important part of its culture and also important to its clients and suppliers.the amendment would achieve this goal by permitting anvil to repurchase employees shares at the end of their employment and by conducting the reverse stock split.the proxy materials explained that,as a result of the reverse stock split,a shareholder with fewer than sixty shares would get cash but would no longer be an anvil shareholder.one of the persons with fewer than sixty shares,the board disclosed,was quinn.based on the board determination that exceeded the fair value of a share of class a common stock,holders of fractional shares would receive a payment equivalent to the share ratio of shares held divided by sixty by the materials also stated that a dissenting shareholder with fewer than shares of class a common stock had appraisal rights to obtain payment of the fair value of the shareholder shares.
on july,defendants filed with the district court a notice of action that may leave plaintiff with no anvil shares.the notice told quinn and the court that an august shareholder meeting had been scheduled to vote on the amendment,and that the amendment,if approved,would,among other things,effect a reverse stock split leaving quinn with no shares and,consequently,no standing to pursue this case.quinn moved for a temporary restraining order and for a preliminary injunction against the shareholder vote.on august,the district court denied the motion and,the next day,the shareholders approved the amendment with near unanimity.quinn notified anvil that he would exercise his appraisal rights.
thereafter,defendants filed a supplemental motion to dismiss the action for lack of standing.the district court stayed further discovery pending resolution of the motion.quinn opposed the motion with declarations and exhibits,and simultaneously moved for leave to conduct discovery,arguing that further discovery was necessary to oppose defendants motion.the court granted the supplemental motion to dismiss,reasoning that because quinn no longer held any shares of anvil stock,he did not meet federal rule of civil procedure requirement that a plaintiff in a derivative share holder suit hold shares throughout the litigation.the district court rejected quinn argument that the reverse stock split should be unwound due to fraud or procedural irregularity,reasoning that quinn had no evidence of fraud and that the procedural irregularities asserted by quinn were unsupported or immaterial.the district court also rejected as without foundation in ninth circuit caselaw quinn argument that he should be able to maintain his derivative suit based on equitable considerations because,as quinn contended,anvil reverse stock split had no purpose other than to end his lawsuit.the district court was not persuaded that quinn was entitled to further discovery.
quinn moved for reconsideration of the dismissal and argued,based on financial information he received from anvil after electing appraisal,that anvil had undervalued its shares in setting the compensation for fractional shares in the reverse stock split.the district court denied quinn motion,concluding that even if it considered this new evidence,it would not unwind the reverse stock split because the new evidence did not suggest fraud.quinn timely appeal followed.
the first issue raised by quinn appeal is whether we should reverse the district court decisions not to enjoin or unwind the reverse stock split and restore quinn shares.quinn request that the district court unwind the reverse stock split is properly understood as a request for preliminary equitable relief.see yamamoto omiya,cir shareholder suit seeking to void a sale consummated through allegedly misleading and deceptive proxy solicitations characterized as a request for equitable relief we review the district court decisions denying the preliminary injunction against the reverse stock split for abuse of discretion.see nader brewer,cir per curiam denial of preliminary injunction reviewed for abuse of discretion see also macdonald grace church seattle,cir denial of motion for reconsideration reviewed for abuse of discretion.a district court abuses its discretion in denying a preliminary injunction if it bases its decision on an erroneous legal standard or clearly erroneous findings of fact.cal.pharmacists ass,cir see also united states hinkson,cir en banc.
quinn attacks the reverse stock split on two grounds first,that it was fraudulent,and second,that the amendment was procedurally flawed.entitlement to a preliminary injunction requires showing,among other things,likely success on the merits.cal.pharmacists,at.because quinn sought the appraisal remedy,washington law precludes him from attacking the amendment unless he shows that it was fraudulent or procedurally flawed.see.sound infiniti,snyder,review granted.quinn,however,has not demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits of his claims that the amendment involved fraud or procedural irregularity.we hold that the district court was within its discretion in not enjoining or unwinding the reverse stock split see cal.pharmacists,at hinkson,at.
arguing that the amendment was fraudulent,quinn takes issue with the board statements in the proxy materials that was not less than the current fair value of a share of class a common stock and was higher than its current value.under washington law,a representation is only fraudulent if it is both material and false.see baertschi jordan.the district court did not find the representations concerning the share value fraudulent,stating,plaintiff seeks to draw a correlation between net income and stock price,a valuation process that ignores all other facts that affect the value of a company stock such as asset sales,planned expenditures,and prospects for new business.this finding was not clearly erroneous.the figure exceeded the most recent price of and was also higher than prior independent appraisals.nor was the share price material to the amendment because anvil shareholders,other than those few with less than sixty shares,retained their equity in anvil with only fractional shares cashed out.see martin miller,stating that a fact is material if a reasonable person would attach importance to its existence in determining his or her action.
quinn next contends that the proxy materials were fraudulent because they omitted material facts.quinn argues that it was fraud for anvil not to disclose quinn allegations,that the amendment would end quinn lawsuit,that anvil employees who brought future derivative suits would risk termination,and that certain anvil board members had conflicts of interest because they either had a financial interest in the amendment due to their acquisition of undervalued option stock or are defendants or related to a defendant in this suit.but these omissions were not fraudulent because quinn has not established that there is a substantial likelihood that this information would have been important to shareholders in deciding how to vote on the amendment.see guarino interactive objects.the proxy materials disclosed that the amendment would divest quinn of his shares,severing anvil relationship with quinn.the amendment was neither a referendum on the directors nor the independent appraisal process,so the greater specificity concerning quinn allegations and the nature of his lawsuit that quinn suggests was required was not necessary.there was no need for anvil to disclose that employees would bring future suits at risk of termination because quinn contention of potential retaliation is unsupported.
concerning the alleged conflicts,we reject quinn conclusory assertion that certain board members were conflicted because they owned shares based on anvil faulty appraisals.and even assuming,as quinn argues,that three of the seven board connor,john macpherson,and scott conflicted because of their ties to this suit,the remaining four directors unanimously voted to adopt the amendment.this was sufficient to establish a quorum,see,and to validly ratify the amendment,see id.anvil treatment of these alleged conflicts,if they were conflicts at all,was procedurally proper and not fraudulent.
quinn also did not show that the amendment was otherwise procedurally flawed.quinn argues that shareholders had to approve the amendment through separate group voting.see.quinn is mistaken.the redemption agreement between levorsen and anvil did not create a separate series or class of stock entitled to a separate vote separate group voting was unnecessary.because quinn can not show likelihood of success on his claims of fraud and procedural infirmity in the amendment,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining preliminarily to enjoin or unwind the reverse stock split.
the second issue raised by quinn appeal is whether,despite not holding shares after the resolution was implemented,quinn meets federal rule of civil procedure standing requirements for a shareholder derivative action.we review de novo whether quinn has derivative standing to assert claims on behalf of anvil.kona,estate of bishop,cir.
the normal rule is that a corporation is run by its management,and the corporation itself has the right to make claims.see potter hughes,cir t he general rule of american law is that the board of directors controls a corporation.a derivative action is an extraordinary process where courts permit a shareholder to step into the corporation shoes and to seek in its right the restitution he could not demand in his own.lewis chiles,cir quotation marks omitted see kayes pac.lumber,cir because of the fear that shareholder derivative suits could subvert the basic principle of management control over corporate operations,courts have generally characterized shareholder derivative suits as a remedy of last resort.quotation marks omitted.
because of the extraordinary nature of a shareholder derivative suit,rule establishes stringent conditions for bringing such a suit.potter,at s trict compliance with rule and the applicable substantive law is necessary before a derivative suit can wrest control of an issue from the board of directors.first,plaintiffs must comply with rule pleading requirements,including that the plaintiff allege with particularity the efforts,if any,made by the plaintiff to obtain the action the plaintiff desires from the directors.id.at quotation marks omitted see.b.second,rule states that a derivative action brought by one or more shareholders to enforce a right of a corporation may not be maintained if it appears that the plaintiff does not fairly and adequately represent the interests of shareholders or members who are similarly situated in enforcing the right of the corporation or association.a.we have inferred from this language not only that a derivative plaintiff be a shareholder at the time of the alleged wrongful acts but also that the plaintiff retain ownership of the stock for the duration of the lawsuit the continuous ownership requirement.lewis,at.if a shareholder is divested of his or her shares during the pendency of litigation,that shareholder loses standing.see id.
this second requirement,the continuous ownership requirement,as the district court properly recognized,forecloses quinn derivative action.by operation of the reverse stock split,quinn fifty shares were cancelled and quinn thereafter held no anvil stock.quinn derivative claims are an intangible asset belonging to anvil,not to quinn.see id.quinn,a nonshareholder,can not benefit from any recovery the company obtains from defendants in a derivative suit and therefore,unlike anvil continuing shareholders,quinn does not have an interest in pursuing the claims.see id.we therefore hold that,after the reverse stock split,quinn did not meet rule continuous ownership requirement.
quinn nevertheless urges us to recognize an exception to rule continuous ownership requirement because,as he describes it,anvil conducted the reverse stock split only to terminate his pending lawsuit,and the amendment was permeated by fraud and procedural flaws we have rejected applying an equitable exception to the continuous ownership requirement,and quinn provides no compelling reason why we should apply one now.see id.at rejecting argument of former shareholder that we should recognize equitable standing where the company leadership conducted an asset sale during the pendency of the litigation to allegedly insulat e themselves from liability kona,at rejecting equitable standing where former shareholder did not challenge the stock foreclosure that divested shareholder of shares and company was still in existence.
to the extent that other courts have recognized exceptions to the continuous ownership requirement,these exceptions are inapplicable here.first,some co
