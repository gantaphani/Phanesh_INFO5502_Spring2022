opinion of the court 
joseph nagle and ernest fink were and executives of concrete manufacturing and construction businesses.the businesses entered into a relationship with a company owned by a person of filipino descent.his company would bid for subcontracts on pennsylvania transportation projects as a disadvantaged business enterprise.if his company won the bid for the subcontract,nagle and fink businesses would perform all of the work.
fink pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud the united states.nagle proceeded to trial,where a jury found him guilty of a myriad of charges relating to the scheme.both defendants filed timely appeals.nagle challenges the district court order denying his motion to suppress electronic evidence discovered during searches of the businesses offices.both defendants challenge the amount of loss the district court found they were responsible for in calculating the appropriate sentencing guidelines range.we will affirm nagle conviction,vacate nagle and fink sentences,and remand for resentencing.
the united states department of transportation provides funds to state transportation agencies to finance transportation projects.these funds often go towards highway construction,provided through the federal highway administration fhwa,or towards mass transit systems,provided through the federal transit administration fta.in pennsylvania,the fhwa provides funds to the pennsylvania department of transportation penndot,and the fta provides funds to the southeastern pennsylvania transportation authority septa.
federal regulations require states that receive federal transportation funds to set annual goals for participation in transportation construction projects by disadvantaged business enterprises dbes.a dbe is a small business that is at least owned by an individual or individuals who are both socially and economically disadvantaged and whose management and daily operations are controlled by one or more of the disadvantaged individuals who own it.id.a state agency will announce a goal when soliciting bids for a contract,and bids for the contract must show how the contractor will meet the goal.if the prime contractor is not a dbe,this is usually demonstrated by showing that certain subcontractors that will work on a contract are dbes.states themselves certify businesses as dbes.id.a business must be certified as a dbe before it or a prime contractor can rely on its dbe status in bidding for a contract.id.c.
most importantly here,in order to count towards a contract dbe participation,a dbe must perform a commercially useful function on the contract.id.c.therefore,a certified dbe whose role is limited to that of an extra participant in a transaction,contract,or project through which funds are passed in order to obtain the appearance of dbe participation can not be counted towards dbe participation.id.c.
in the joseph nagle grandfather established schuylkill products spi,a,in cressona,pennsylvania.spi manufactured concrete beams that are used in highway construction projects.in the,the nagle family also established cds engineers,cds,to operate as a construction company for the concrete beams spi manufactured.by,cds was a subsidiary of spi.neither spi nor cds qualified as or was certified as a dbe in any state.
in,spi was owned by two people nagle father,gordon,who owned of spi,and fink,nagle uncle by marriage,who owned.gordon nagle was the president and chief executive officer of spi,while fink served as vice president and general manager of spi.that year,spi entered into an arrangement with a company called marikina engineers and construction marikina.marikina was a connecticut corporation owned and managed by romeo cruz,an american citizen of filipino descent.because cruz was of filipino descent,marikina qualified as a dbe for fhwa and fta projects.marikina was certified as a dbe in connecticut and pennsylvania,among other states.
spi and marikina agreed that marikina would bid to serve as a subcontractor for penndot and septa contracts that had dbe participation requirements.if marikina was selected for the subcontracts,spi and cds would perform all of the work on those contracts.spi and cds would pay marikina a fixed fee for its participation but otherwise keep the profits from the scheme.
in practice,spi identified subcontracts that spi and cds could fulfill,prepared the bid paperwork,and submitted the information to prime contractors in marikina name.spi used stationery and email addresses bearing marikina name to create this correspondence.it also used marikina information to access penndot electronic contract management system.cds employees who performed construction work on site used vehicles with magnetic placards of marikina logo covering spi and cds logos.spi and cds employees used marikina business cards and separate cell phones to disguise whom they worked for.they also used a stamp of cruz signature to endorse checks from the prime contractors for deposit into spi bank accounts.although marikina payroll account paid cds employees,cds reimbursed marikina for the labor costs.
in,gordon nagle passed away.joseph nagle inherited his father stake in spi and assumed the titles of president and chief executive officer.at that time,fink became the chief operating officer and chairman of the board.spi relationship with marikina lasted until march.between and march,marikina was awarded contracts under the penndot dbe program worth over million and contracts under the septa dbe program worth over million.between and march,marikina was awarded contracts under the dbe programs worth nearly million.
spi and cds offices were all located in the same compound in cressona.none of the offices was open to the public.spi administrative office was a converted,white house.the house was subdivided into offices and cubicles.between twelve and fifteen people worked in the building,as well as nagle and fink.cds administrative office was also a converted house,owned by fink and leased to cds.the compound contained a transportation building,a production building,and various parking lots.in total,spi and cds employed around individuals who worked in the compound.
spi and cds purchased a computer for nearly every employee who required one.they also created a shared network over a server.the employees who had access to the network needed a user identification and password to access it.the network itself was compartmentalized into drives.only five people,including nagle and fink,had access to all of the drives on the network.emails sent from or received by spi or cds accounts were stored on the network as well.nagle received a company computer,which he took home every night and used for business and personal purposes.he never used any other employee computer.
in october,the federal bureau of investigation fbi executed two search warrants at spi and cds offices.the warrants authorized agents to seize business records of marikina and all predecessors and affiliated operating entities,spi,and cds including any and all financial documents contracts and invoices payroll documents and personnel files email and correspondence phone records and calendars and c omputers and computer equipment.nagle.at.during their search of spi and cds offices pursuant to the warrants,agents found eleven computers and the shared network server.the agents imaged the computers on site.nagle had brought his computer home with him before the search,so it was not seized and imaged.
in november,a federal grand jury in the middle district of pennsylvania returned an indictment against nagle and fink.the indictment charged them with one count of conspiracy to defraud the united states,in violation of eleven counts of wire fraud,in violation of six counts of mail fraud,in violation of one count of conspiracy to engage in unlawful monetary transactions,in violation of h and eleven counts of engaging in unlawful monetary transactions,in violation of.cruz,the owner of marikina dennis campbell,an spi executive and timothy hubler,a cds executive,were indicted separately,pled guilty to the charges,and agreed to cooperate against nagle and fink.
nagle and fink jointly moved to suppress the electronic evidence that the fbi agents had imaged from spi and cds computers and network server during the october search.they argued that the warrants were unconstitutional general warrants,that the warrants were unconstitutionally overbroad,and that the agents had executed the warrant in an unreasonable manner.the united states opposed the motion,contesting each of the arguments and also suggesting that nagle and fink lacked the requisite privacy interest to challenge the searches.the district court held a hearing and took evidence.two fbi agents and an fbi employee testified about the preparation and execution of the warrants as well as the fbi review and analysis of the imaged data.nagle and fink testified about the history and structure of spi and cds,the two companies computers and network use,and their own use of the companies computer infrastructure.
after the hearing,fink pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud the united states,in violation of.nagle,however,continued his challenge to the search.in september,the district court denied nagle suppression motion.the district court concluded that nagle failed to show he had a personal expectation of privacy in the electronic information that the agents had imaged from spi and cds computers and network server.the district court reasoned that nagle never used the other employees computers and that w hile nagle may have had the expectation that,as president and ceo of spi and cds,the contents of the companies server would remain private,he had this expectation in his official capacity as an executive and officer of these corporations as opposed to himself as an individual.nagle app.at.therefore,the district court held that defendant has not demonstrated that any of his fourth amendment rights were violated,and thus his ownership of the companies whose records were seized is irrelevant.nagle app.at.
on april,after a trial,a jury found nagle guilty on all of the charges presented in the indictment except for four of the wire fraud charges.
before deciding nagle motion to suppress,the district court began the process of sentencing cruz,campbell,and hubler.as part of that process,the district court issued an opinion on the amount of loss they were responsible for,under,in order to calculate the appropriate guidelines range.see united states campbell,cr,wl.july,hereinafter the campbell loss opinion.the district court concluded that application note f ii to was the appropriate legal standard to calculate the amount of loss that under note f ii the amount of loss was the face value of the contracts marikina received and that the defendants were not entitled to a credit against the loss for the work performed because they had not refunded the contract price to allow a legitimate dbe to perform the work.id.at.
after fink pled guilty and before nagle trial,a presentence report psr was prepared for him.the psr relied on the campbell loss opinion to conclude that the loss fink was responsible for was the face value of the penndot and septa contracts marikina received while he was an executive million.under b,this amounted to a increase in the guidelines offense level.with other enhancements and adjustments,the psr calculated fink total offense level to be and assigned him a criminal history category of i.this corresponded to a guidelines range of to months of incarceration,which was reduced to months pursuant to.see a.
fink objected to the loss calculation in the psr on the basis that the proper loss amount was the pecuniary harm suffered by an actual dbe that did not receive the contractsin other words,the profit an actual dbe would have received on the contracts.the district court reserved ruling on the objection until after nagle trial.
after the jury verdict,a psr was prepared for nagle as well.the psr relied on the campbell loss opinion to conclude that the loss nagle was responsible for was the face value of the penndot and septa contracts marikina received while he was an executive million.this amounted to a increase in the guidelines offense level.with other enhancements,the psr calculated nagle total offense level to be forty and assigned him a criminal history category of i.this corresponded to a guidelines range of to months of incarceration.
nagle objected to the loss calculation in the psr on the grounds that there was no evidence another dbe was willing to perform the contracts,penndot and septa received what they paid for under the contracts,and the largest conceivable actual loss was the value of the contracts less overhead and expenses.
in february,the district court held a joint hearing to address the issue of the amount of loss for both defendants.at the hearing,in addition to arguing that the proper loss amount was the face value of the marikina contracts,the government introduced evidence pertaining to the gross profits earned by spi and cds on the marikina contracts during fink and nagle respective tenures as executives.fink and nagle both contested the profit amounts,which the government asserted were several million dollars.
on may,the district court held that nagle was responsible for million in losses and that no credit was permitted.on may,the district court held that fink was responsible for million and that no credit was permitted.
the district court then requested briefing on the appropriate amount of restitution.after briefing,the district court rejected the government argument that the appropriate amount of restitution was the same as the amount of loss under the guidelines.the district court reasoned that spi and cds fully performed the contracts,so the government received what it paid for.the district court held that the government was only entitled to the difference between the face value of the contracts and what it would have paid spi and cds knowing that they were not dbes.however,because the government failed to prove what this difference was,the district court found that no restitution was appropriate.
the district court sentenced nagle first.he requested a downward departure in his offense level.under the guidelines,this corresponded to a loss amount of between and million.the district court granted the departure and additionally lowered another enhancement by one level.with a final offense level of,the district court calculated nagle guidelines range to be to months of incarceration.the district court sentenced him to months of incarceration,one year of supervised release,a fine,a special assessment,and no restitution.
the district court then sentenced fink.the government moved for fink to receive a downward departure in his offense level.under the guidelines,this corresponded to a loss amount of between million and million.the district court granted the departure and lowered another enhancement by one level.with a final offense level of,the district court calculated fink guidelines range to be to months of incarceration.the district court sentenced him to months of incarceration,one year of supervised release,a fine,a special assessment,and no restitution.
nagle and fink filed timely appeals 
we first consider nagle challenge to the district court order denying his motion to suppress the electronic evidence seized from spi and cds offices.the district court denied the motion because it concluded that nagle did not show that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the places searched or items seized.we exercise plenary review over the district court legal conclusions but review its factual findings for clear error.united states silveus,cir.
a defendant who seeks to suppress evidence allegedly seized or discovered in violation of the fourth amendment must first demonstrate that the government physically occupied his property for the purpose of obtaining information or that he had a legitimate expectation of privacy that has been invaded by government action.free speech,att y,cir internal quotation marks omitted rakas illinois,d fourth amendment rights are personal rights which,like some other constitutional rights,may not be vicariously asserted.internal quotation marks omitted.to have a legitimate expectation of privacy,the defendant must show an actual or subjective expectation of privacy in the subject of the search or seizure and show that this expectation of privacy is objectively justifiable under the circumstances.united states donahue,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in other words,the expectation of privacy must be one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable.smith maryland,d internal quotation marks omitted 
no one disputes that spi and cds,as corporate entities,could challenge the search of their respective offices,whether through a motion to suppress had they been charged with a crime or through a action.nagle argues that because he is the majority owner of the small,corporations,he should have the same ability to challenge the searches that the corporations do.in other words,nagle says,because the government physically intruded on the corporations property and otherwise invaded their legitimate expectations of privacy,and because he is the majority owner of the corporations,the government physically intruded on his property and otherwise invaded his legitimate expectation of privacy.in support of that argument,nagle cites a line from new york burger an owner or operator of a business has an expectation of privacy in commercial property,which society is prepared to consider to be reasonable,d.
but that expectation of privacy is different from,and indeed less than,a similar expectation in an individual home.id.at.although the supreme court has not clarified precisely how much less of an expectation of privacy a business owner has in commercial premises,we see a consensus among the courts of appeals that a corporate shareholder has a legitimate expectation of privacy in corporate property only if the shareholder demonstrates a personal expectation of privacy in the areas searched independent of his status as a shareholder.
in united states sdi future health,the defendants were of an incorporated business and sought to challenge a warrant authorizing a search of the corporation premises,cir.the ninth circuit rejected their argument that mere ownership and management of the corporation allowed them to challenge the search of the corporation premises.id.at.this was because a reasonable expectation of privacy does not arise ex officio,but must be established with respect to the person in question.id.at.however,the defendants could still show a legitimate expectation of privacy in the corporation property if they show ed some personal connection to the places searched and the materials seized and took precautions on their own behalf to secure the place searched or things seized from any interference without their authorization.id.at.the court remanded the matter for further fact finding.
in united states mohney,the defendant was the sole owner of an incorporated business and sought to challenge the search of the business headquarters,cir.the sixth circuit concluded that the defendant failed to show he had a reasonable expectation of privacy.id.at.the court concluded,
where the documents seized were normal corporate records not personally prepared by the defendant and not taken from his personal office,desk,or files,in a search that was not directed at him personally,the defendant can not challenge a search as he would not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in such materials.
mohney,in turn,relied on a decision of the second circuit in lagow united states,cir per curiam.lagow was the sole shareholder and officer of his corporation and sought an order forbidding the use of evidence seized from the corporation in any future trial against him.id.at.the court rejected his claim,reasoning that lagow chose to avail himself of the privilege of doing business as a corporation and,therefore,he may not vicariously take on the privilege of the corporation under the fourth amendment its wrongs are not his wrongs its immunity is not his immunity.id.
finally,in williams kunze,one of the plaintiffs was the sole shareholder and president of a corporation and brought a bivens action against an irs agent who searched the company records pursuant to a warrant,cir.the fifth circuit found that summary judgment was properly granted to the federal agent because the shareholder could not challenge the search of the business premises.id.at.an individual status as the sole shareholder of a corporation is not always sufficient to confer upon him standing to assert the corporation f ourth a mendment rights.unless the shareholder can demonstrate a legitimate and reasonable expectation of privacy in the records seized,he can not challenge the search.id.citation omitted.the court concluded that the shareholder could not show such a legitimate expectation of privacy in records seized from the common file room.id.at.
these decisions all support a common proposition a shareholder may not challenge a search of corporate property merely because he is a shareholder,but he may challenge the search if he show ed some personal connection to the places searched and the materials seized,sdi future health,at,and protected those places or materials from outside intrusion.
even the cases in which a shareholder was permitted to challenge the search of corporate offices fall within this paradigm.in united states gonzalez,the shareholders of a corporation wished to challenge recordings from a wiretap placed in their corporation office,cir.the ninth circuit observed that owners of the premises where an illegal wiretap occurs have standing to challenge the interception,even if the owners did not participate in the intercepted conversations.id.because the shareholders owned the office themselves directly and not indirectly through the corporation the court found that they had the reasonable expectation of privacy necessary to challenge the wiretaps.id.at.the shareholders in gonzalez showed a personal connection to the place searched in that they were the actual,direct owners of the property,and they showed effort to keep the conversations there private.thus,gonzalez falls within the larger circuit consensus.
so does henzel united states,cir.the defendant in henzel was also the sole shareholder and president of his business,and he sought to challenge evidence seized from the corporation.id.at.the evidence seized was the corporation business records,which were located in his office and most of which he personally created.id.at.the fifth circuit concluded that he,therefore,had an interest in the property seized and premises searched.id.again,henzel showed a personal connection to the place searched his office and the items seized records he personally created and showed an effort to keep both private.
we find this line of authority persuasive and adopt it.to show he can challenge the search of spi and cds offices and the seizure of the employees computers and network server as a shareholder and executive,nagle must show a personal connection to the place searched or to the item seized and that he attempted to keep the place and item private.nagle has failed to meet this standard.
the employees computers that were seized and imaged were discovered in the employees offices.nagle did not show that he used these employees offices,nor that he used their computers or accessed their files.accordingly,he failed to show a personal connection to the computers or the place where they were discovered.
the server is,however,slightly more complicated.the server was not seized from his office.therefore,nagle must show a personal connection to the electronic files located on the server and that he kept them private in order to demonstrate a reasonable expectation of privacy.nagle failed to show that he ever accessed other employees files and emails on the server and,therefore,failed to establish a personal connection to their files.although nagle certainly had a personal connection to his own files and emails located on the server,he failed to show what efforts he made to keep his materials private from others.although the server was password protected and only five individuals,including nagle,had access to every drive on the server,nagle did not establish where his files and emails were located o
