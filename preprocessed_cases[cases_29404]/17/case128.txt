opinion of the court 
by most accounts,the merger between exxon and mobil has been quite successful.shareholders in the new exxonmobil have benefitted from a tremendous increase in stock price since the companies merger in.but the plaintiffs here,former shareholders of mobil,want more.they allege that a misrepresentation by exxon made in the course of the merger negotiations and ensuing votes caused them to receive fewer shares in the combined corporation than they otherwise were entitled.we will never know the merits of this allegation though,for we agree with the district court that this lawsuit is not timely under the relevant statutes.
allegations in the 
quite unlike the prevailing price of oil as we consider this case,world oil prices in the late,as measured in constant dollars,were near historic lows.at least partly in response to that market condition,exxon corporation and mobil giants in the oil plans on december,to merge into the world largest oil company,exxonmobil corporation.the merger was to take the form of a exchange whereby,in relevant detail,each share of mobil stock would be exchanged for shares of exxonmobil,thus giving former mobil shareholders about ownership in the new company.shareholders of both companies voted on and approved the merger on may,and the federal trade commission blessed it some six months later.the merger took effect,shares in the old companies were exchanged for new shares in exxonmobil on november.
prior to the companies respective shareholder votes,on march,exxon filed its required securities and exchange commission sec form for the year ending the previous december.that filing,in turn,was incorporated by reference in the proxy statement issued by both exxon and mobil in anticipation of the merger votes.plaintiffs assert that exxon form,therefore,the proxy false or misleading.and though their,complaint canvassing,inter alia,the history of exxon corporation,the science and technology of oil drilling,and the objectives,concepts,and principles of modern accounting methods is prolix,the basic theory of plaintiffs case can be simply stated 
because oil prices in the late were so low,certain oil reserves owned by exxon had become uneconomical to tap.that is,the cost of extracting a barrel of oil from some of its deposits exceeded the revenue that could be generated from the sale of that barrel.according to generally accepted accounting principles gaap promulgated by the financial accounting standards board fasb,uneconomical assets,like some of exxon oil reserves,require specific accounting treatment.in march,fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas,which generally requires that if ever a asset expected future cash flow is less than its book value,the asset should be classified as impaired and its fair value be recognized as a revenue loss for the accounting period in which the asset becomes impaired.once a company characterizes an asset as impaired,it is irreversible.that is,even if an asset were to become unimpaired,the previously recognized accounting loss can not be in that accounting period or nunc pro the asset is actually sold.
exxon did not follow the impairment procedure mandated by sfas.instead,as candidly stated in its form,exxon policy was to undertake disciplined,regular review of its assets.this aggressive asset management program,in its estimation,would provide a very efficient capital base.consistent with these statements,exxon did not recognize any of its oil reserves as impaired and,therefore,did not report the accounting losses that such a recognition would have required.in contrast,every other major oil company recognized impaired assets and their resulting effect on net income during the same.the size of these writedowns on revenue at other oil companies in ranged from million to billion.
using these figures as reference points,plaintiffs estimate that exxon should have recognized impairments losses of between billion and billion.this,of course,would have reduced exxon net income by the same amount and,consequently,affected its share price.the resulting lower share price,in turn,would have led mobil to demand a higher exchange rate,more shares of exxonmobil in its merger with exxon.the evidence of this,plaintiffs say,is that one of the means by which the two companies decided that each share of mobil stock would be exchanged for shares of exxon stock was by consulting a analysis performed by the investment banking firm goldman sachs.earnings in exxon case would have been lower had it recognized the asset impairments.given the size of the impairments that plaintiffs allege exxon should have taken,mobil shareholders would have received an additional stake in exxonmobil.this corresponds with damages to those shareholders estimated in the complaint to total between billion and billion.
none of these allegations,however,suggests that exxon fraudulently issued its form,which plaintiffs are required to do to make out a valid securities fraud claim.for this,plaintiffs allege other facts.first,they suggest that the timing of exxon decision not to recognize its impaired oil reserves is the midst of merger negotiations and votes both of which would likely turn out more favorable to exxon the higher its earnings appeared.second,plaintiffs cite the claims of a confidential witness who held various financial analyst positions in exxon accounting department and first came forward in.in,when sfas was first issued,the witness had calculated that its effect on exxon financial reports would be to require at least a million in earnings.when the witness reported these calculations to supervisors,they purportedly responded that exxon chairman and ceo lee raymond instead had decreed that sfas would have no impact on exxon financial reports.the witness,claiming that exxon has a culture,interpreted raymond statement to be tantamount to marching orders for the executive staff,they now had to justify no impact.later,the witness was also told not to conduct any further impairment analyses.
third,even if exxon were allowed to ignore sfas and follow its own disciplined,regular review of its assets as part of an aggressive asset management program,plaintiffs allege that exxon claim that it did not need to recognize any of its assets as impaired under its own program did not comport with its contemporaneous public statements.if exxon had performed a bona fide analysis of any sort and determined that its oil reserves were not impaired,then it would necessarily have to expect that oil prices would rebound from their levels.as exxon told the sec in an investigation relating to this very issue,the corporation does not view temporarily low oil prices as a trigger event for conducting the impairment tests.plaintiffs,however,cite numerous public statements from exxon officials including congressional testimony by raymond that they allege indicate that exxon in fact did not view oil prices to be temporarily,at the very least,that exxon was unsure whether prices would rebound.see,compl.quoting raymond congressional testimony the only thing i can tell you about the price for the next two years is we do have a clue.
plaintiffs filed a complaint in the district court for the district of new jersey against exxon and raymond for alleged violations of a of the securities exchange act,a,and sec rule promulgated thereunder filing a false or misleading proxy statement b of the securities exchange act,b,and sec rule promulgated thereunder securities fraud and a of the securities exchange act,a derivative liability for raymond the district court granted exxon motion to dismiss because it ruled that both the a and b claims were barred by the statute of limitations and,in any event,the b claim was not properly pleaded.plaintiffs appeal each of these rulings,but we need only address the timeliness issues.
ii.discussion 
the securities exchange act did not explicitly provide a private right of action for claims under either b or a.as early as,though,courts had begun to recognize implied private rights of action based on b,see,kardon gypsum,and the supreme court,at least implicitly,approved,see,blue chip stamps manor drug stores,d affiliated ute citizens united states,d superintendent of ins.bankers life cas,d.the same is true for a.case borak,d.
having created these causes of action,courts then began to consider the within which they must be brought.for decades the general practice was to borrow the statute of limitations from the closest analogous cause of action.see,bath bushkin,gaims,gaines jonas,cir nesbit mcneil,cir kovens,cir forrestal,graham,cir.
recognizing the need to minimize uncertainty and litigation inherent in that approach,our court was the first to advocate and adopt uniform limitations periods for b claims.in re data access.sec,cir en banc quoting,crown life ins,cir.in data access we determined that using the limitations periods set out in other sections of the securities exchange act would lead to the uniformity and certainty desired.specifically,we adopted the statute of limitations and the statute of that was prevalent throughout the securities exchange act for the express rights of action that the legislation did create,e,c,and b.three years later,in lampf,pleva,lipkind,prupis petigrow gilbertson,the supreme court approved this framework,d.specifically,the court adopted the limitations periods found in e of the securities exchange act as the controlling provision.id.at.soon after the court approval of our data access decision,we extended its reasoning to a claims as well.see westinghouse franklin,cir.
at the time of the events described in plaintiffs complaint,this is where the law stood for securities claims brought under b and a,the limitations periods consisted of a statute of limitations and a statute of repose.on july,however,the public company accounting reform and investor protection act of known as the act or,simply,enacted,stat.in relevant part,extended the limitations periods for private right s of action that involve a claim of fraud,deceit,manipulation,or contrivance in contravention of a regulatory requirement concerning the securities laws.id.a,b.such actions now have the benefit of a statute of limitations and a statute of repose.id.
because of the timing of both the underlying events and the filing of this case,we have a perfect storm of issues concerning the timeliness of plaintiffs complaint.for any of their claims to be ruled timely,each of the following three conditions must be met 
timing extensions must apply retroactively to these claims,even though the underlying violation had already taken place when that legislation was enacted 
the statute of repose must begin as of the date of the merger,between exxon and mobil,not the date that the joint proxy statement was issued,and 
the statute of limitations must not have begun to run until on or after february,two years prior to filing the complaint,leaving only the statute of repose as the limitations period of any material concern.
what this means is that if does not apply to any given claim raised by plaintiffs above,then,by any calculation,e statute of repose ran out over a year before plaintiffs filed this suit.
additionally,if the repose period started on the date of the proxy statement rather than the date of the merger above,the provided by would not apply here.this is because was passed more than three years after the proxy statement was issued,and we have already held that it did not revive previously extinguished claims.see lieberman cambridge partners,cir.thus,the statute of repose would operate to bar plaintiffs claims.
and finally,if plaintiffs became aware or should have become aware that the proxy statement was false,misleading,or fraudulent before february,then the statute of limitations would operate independently to bar their claims above.
application of in this case 
can longer limitations periods apply to any of the claims raised in plaintiffs complaint 
to repeat,in lieberman we held that the lengthier limitations periods provided by did not apply to claims that had expired under the limitation periods in place prior to the passage of that legislation,even if the claims were filed after its enactment and would be timely under its provisions.at.we explicitly reserved the question,however,whether that act lengthened the limitations periods for claims on which the periods were already running but had not yet expired.id.at.
though there is a presumption against retroactive legislation that is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence,landgraf usi film,d,it is also the case that if congress has expressly provided for retroactive effect,a court must enforce the statute as written,lieberman,at.as noted above,in b of congress explicitly stated that t he limitations period s provided by section b of title,united states code,as added by this section,shall apply to all proceedings addressed by this section that are commenced on or after the date of enactment of this act.stat.congress used the terms proceedings that are commenced instead of claims that accrue or similar such language.the plain meaning of these words directs that claims filed after july,receive the benefit of the extended limitations periods,even if the shorter periods had already begun but had not expired on the underlying causes of action.hence,the types of claims listed in b and raised in suits with timing like this in but complaining of events in the benefit of statute of limitations and statute of repose.the lingering question,though,is whether each of plaintiffs claims here is in fact within the scope of b.
which of plaintiffs claims benefit from the extended limitations periods provided by 
there can be no question that b covers claims based on b of the securities exchange act.the statute refers explicitly to private right s of action that involve a claim of fraud in contravention of the securities laws.b.indeed,the implied cause of action recognized under b is widely known and referred to as securities fraud.see,insider trading and securities fraud enforcement act of,stat.to conclude that b does not apply to b claims would be absurd.
but does b also apply to plaintiffs a claim section b,by its terms,applies to claims that involve fraud,deceit,manipulation,or contrivance.this wording closely tracks the language of b,which prohibits employing any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance.violations of a,on the other hand,may be committed without scienter in other words,no culpable intent is required.see cal.pub.employees ret.v.the chubb,cir in contrast to section b,scienter is not a necessary element in alleging a section a claim.for liability to attach under a,all that is required is that a proxy statement be false or misleading with respect to any material fact.a.
given this material distinction,we conclude that congress did not intend to include a claims within the scope of b,but rather intended that provision to apply to b claims and other claims requiring proof of fraudulent intent several district courts have done the same analysis and reached the same conclusion when deciding b relevance to a and other claims.see virginia damon trust country fin,d,holding that b does not apply to claims brought under of the securities exchange act in re global crossing.sec,d,same in re alstom sa sec,d,holding the same for,a a,and of the securities act of in re firstenergy.sec,d,and a of the securities act of amy grynol gibbs,note,it about time the scope of section of the act of.concluding that b does not apply to claims under of the securities act of.
plaintiffs,as a position,next argue that even if a claims are not necessarily based in fraud and thus would not generally get the benefit of b extended statute of limitations,their particular a claim does sound in fraud and therefore does fall within the scope of b.lending some support to this we should look at claims in a practical manner,not a categorical that,under our precedent,if a claim not otherwise requiring proof of scienter nonetheless sounds in fraud,then federal rule of civil procedure b heightened pleading standard applies see shapiro ujb fin,cir see also rombach chang,cir.plaintiffs therefore ask whether it is fair that the same thinking that is used to impose rule b burdens on their a claim sounding in fraud be used to deny them the benefits of b,which applies to fraud claims.
plaintiffs focus on perceived fairness is misplaced.rather,as we did when deciding shapiro,we focus on the policy choice of congress as shown by the text and purpose of the applicable law.first,the text of rule b supported our conclusion in shapiro because,by its terms,the rule applied to averments,allegations to be backed up with evidence.section b,however,refers to right s of action.this distinction is significant because averments,when assembled,are what constitute right s of action,and a statute using the latter b necessarily applies at a higher level of generality than a statute using the former rule b.this point was not lost on us in shapiro.see at rule b refers to averments of fraud,and thus requires us to examine the actual allegations that support a particular legal claim.second,pleading with specificity,as required by rule b,is intended to give defendants more certainty as to the charges they must defend.rombach,at.as with that policy choice made for the benefit of defendants,so too does the policy choice of congress to establish firm deadlines for securities fraud claims help defendants.allowing plaintiffs effectively to bypass this policy thereby select the length of the limitations periods that will apply to a claim merely by sounding their a claim in not promote the principal reason for having certainty for defendants.we therefore see no reason to transpose our ruling in shapiro to this case.
in ruling that a claims do not fall within the scope of b,we recognize that this severs the tie between the limitations periods applicable to b claims and a claims that we recognized in westinghouse.see at holding that the same statute of limitations periods that applied to claims under b also apply to those under a.plaintiffs make much of this link in their filings before us.but the law has materially changed since our decision in westinghouse,and to use its policy arguments to claim otherwise ignores what has happened since.
as explained above,in the absence of express limitations periods for the a implied right of action,westinghouse naturally relied on b similar objectives fair corporate suffrage and protect ing investors when deciding it could use as well the same method set out in data access,approved in lampf when determining the for a claims.id.at.westinghouse did not say that the limitations periods for a claims are,by their nature,the same as those for b claims.rather,that case held that in the absence of any explicit congressional command,there was good reason to think that congress would want a as much as b be the same as every other securities claim.thus,the link established by westinghouse for a claims was not to b,but instead as with b itself to other causes of action in the securities laws.
when it comes to b claims,though,there is now a new,express limitations periods set by a law that did not previously exist.that congress has now provided explicit,extended limitation periods for claims,such as those brought under b,is not cause to alter the way we determine the applicable limitation periods for a claims,which need not be and,thus,still do not have express limitation periods.though data access and lampf have now been superseded by as they relate to the time limitations on b claims,nothing in that legislation indicates congress desire to supersede the rationale of those cases as applied in westinghouse with respect to a claims.
we hold that b applies to claims under b,b claims,but not to claims under a,a claims.because plaintiffs filed their complaint over four years after the merger between exxon and mobil the previously applicable statute of repose still applies and serves as a bar to their a claim.only plaintiffs b claim,therefore,has the potential to be viable given the facts here,and we thus continue with that claim alone down the timing gauntlet.
b.when do e and b statutes of repose begin to run 
as described above,the limitations period established by b for securities fraud claims consists of a scheme the set up,taken from e of the securities exchange act,sported a scheme,but was identical to b in all other material respects.under both systems,courts have consistently referred to the shorter time period as a statute of limitations and the longer period as a statute of repose.see,lampf,at.tello dean witter reynolds,cir margolies deason,cir.the question we address here is when did e and b statutes of repose begin to the time of exxon alleged misrepresentation the march proxy statement or at the time its merger with mobil was consummated late november.if it is the former,then the statute of repose provided by e serves to bar plaintiffs b claim,as that period would have expired four months before became law.again,under our precedent,did not revive previously extinguished claims.see lieberman,at.
a statute of repose bars any suit that is brought after a specified time since the defendant acted,even if this period ends before the plaintiff has suffered a resulting injury.black,supra,at emphasis added.unlike statutes of limitations,which traditionally do not begin to run until a cause of action has accrued,when all required elements have occurred and the onset of which is often subject to delay by late discovery of the injury or when a reasonable person should have discovered it,statutes of repose start upon the occurrence of a specific event and may expire before a plaintiff discovers he has been wronged or even before damages have been suffered at all.accord nesladek ford motor,cir a statute of repose is different from a statute of limitations because a tort limitations statute does not begin to run until the injury,death,or damage until the cause of action accrues.on the other hand,a statute of repose prevents the cause of action from accruing in the first place.adolph levy,solving statute of limitations problems,at.it might be said that statutes of repose pursue similar goals as do statutes of limitations protecting defendants from defending against stale claims,but strike a stronger balance.put more bluntly,there is a time when allowing people to put their wrongful conduct behind out of the law more important than providing those wronged with a legal remedy,even if the victims never had the opportunity to pursue one.
thus,while it is true that for a b claim to accrue there must be an exchange of securities here,the november consummation of the merger,see dura,broudo,d,and only then do plaintiffs suffer any actual injury,nevertheless the specific acts targeted by a b cause of action are fraudulent statements themselves.it therefore is more consonant with the traditional understanding of how a statute of repose functions for the repose periods of e and b to begin from the date of exxon alleged misrepresentation the march,proxy statement.
supporting this view is the text of the relevant statutes themselves,especially in relation to the limitations periods applicable to other causes of action provided by the securities exchange act.notably,e and b set their statutes of repose relative to the violation,not to the accrual,of the cause of action.in light of our discussion above,this word choice is important.coupled with the observation that the repose periods associated with other causes of action provided by the same act do use the term accrue,see,c of the act,this suggests that congress knew that the terms carried different meanings.
the supreme court has also weighed in,although only in a dictum.the concluding line of lampf,which disposes of the case,reads as there is no dispute that the earliest of complaints was filed more than three years after petitioner alleged misrepresentations,claims were untimely.at.emphasis added.as the misrepresentations in lampf occurred at about the same time as the exchange of securities,whether the date to begin running the statute of repose is the date of the misrepresentation was not necessary to the court decision.nonetheless its focus was on the alleged misrepresentation,not the exchange of securities.
for the reasons set out traditional understanding of how statutes of repose function,the text of e and b,and a supreme court hold th
