alleging subject matter jurisdiction based upon diversity of citizenship,onepoint sued borchert and catuzzi in federal district court asserting seven minnesota causes of,tortious interference with contract,money had and received,breach of fiduciary duty,civil theft under minnesota statute,and,unjust enrichment,and civil conspiracy.to reach the jurisdictional threshold for diversity cases,onepoint alleged three types of enhanced damages under minnesota law.these include treble damages under the minnesota receipt of stolen property statute punitive damages under the minnesota civil theft statute and attorney fees and costs based on the litigation exception.
