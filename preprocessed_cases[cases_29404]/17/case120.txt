background 
avaya,which came into existence in september,as a from lucent technologies,designs,builds,and manages communications networks for businesses.avaya sponsors three employee pension benefit plans administered in accordance with erisa,at the time she filed this lawsuit,edgar participated in the avaya.savings plan the union plan,one of the three plans offered to eligible employees.the other two plans are the avaya.savings plan for the variable workforce the variable plan and the avaya.savings plan for salaried employees the management plan the plans state that they are intended to provide for a portion of the livelihood of participants in their retirement,by allow ing each participant to elect to set aside a portion of his or her salary on a pretax and after tax basis.at.participants are permitted to change or terminate the amount they elect to contribute,subject to certain requirements,at any time.
the plans provide that the investment options shall include a broad range of investment alternatives as the company determines are necessary or appropriate to allow participants to materially affect the potential return and achieve a portfolio with aggregate risk and return characteristics typical of similar pension plans.at.the plans offer three asset classes investments,bond and stock funds,and asset allocation funds.although avaya selects the investment options,plan participants have discretion as to how their contributions are invested,including whether to invest all of their contributions in one fund or in a mix of funds.after initially electing which funds to invest in,a plan participant may change how future contributions are invested and transfer existing investments into other funds.
during the relevant time period,avaya offered plan participants investment options,which the summary plan descriptions explain,differ in their investment objectives and opportunities for risk and return.at.the plan descriptions state that participants should consider the risks and potential rewards of each option.id.of particular significance to this litigation,the plans provide that the investment options shall include the avaya stock fund,which shall be invested primarily in shares of avaya common stock,with a small portion in cash and other liquid investments.at.with respect to the avaya stock fund,the plan descriptions state 
the value of your investment will vary depending on avaya performance,the overall stock market,the performance and amount of investments held by the fund,and the amount of fund expenses.investing in a single stock fund carries more risk than investing in a diversified fund.
at.according to avaya form filed with the securities and exchange commission sec on june,the master trust,which holds the total assets for all three plans,was valued at billion at the end of december.of this amount,approximately percent,or million,was invested in the avaya stock fund.
on april,avaya publicly released its quarterly earnings statement in which it announced that it was unlikely to meet its previously forecasted earnings goals for fiscal year.the announcement explained that this was primarily due to disruption in sales caused by the company implementation of new delivery methods costs associated with integrating recent acquisitions and potential softness in the technology market.at.on the first trading day following the announcement,the price of avaya common stock fell from to per share.
in july,edgar filed this class action lawsuit pursuant to section of erisa,a she seeks damages and injunctive relief under a,on behalf of all similarly situated individuals who participated in the plans and invested in the avaya stock fund between october and july the class period defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint pursuant to rule b for lack of standing,and rule b for failure to state a claim for breach of fiduciary duty.on april,the district court granted defendants rule b motion without reaching the standing issue this timely appeal followed.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to and e.we have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to.we exercise plenary review over a district court dismissal of claims pursuant to rule b.miller fortis,cir.we accept all allegations in the complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.id.
iii.discussion 
we first address edgar argument that defendants breached their fiduciary duties by imprudently offering avaya common stock as an investment option during the class period.we then turn to her contention that defendants had a duty to disclose to plan participants avaya allegedly deteriorating financial condition.
duty of prudence 
section of erisa imposes the following duty on erisa fiduciaries 
a prudent man standard of care 
a fiduciary shall discharge his duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries 
b with the care,skill,prudence,and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims 
c by diversifying the investments of the plan so as to minimize the risk of large losses,unless under the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so and 
d in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan 
a in rejecting edgar prudence claim,the district court first determined that defendants conduct should be reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard,and then concluded that edgar failed to allege facts sufficient to establish an abuse of discretion.we agree with both rulings.
an abuse of discretion standard governs defendants decision to offer avaya stock 
in concluding that defendants decision to offer avaya common stock as an investment option is reviewed for an abuse of discretion,the district court relied on moench robertson,cir.in moench,we held that fiduciaries of an employee stock ownership plan esop are entitled to judicial deference when they decide to invest plan assets in the sponsoring company stock.id.at.under erisa,an esop is defined,in relevant part,as an individual account plan which is designed to invest primarily in qualifying employer securities.d.although the plans are not esops,we agree with the district court that the same deferential standard applies here.
moench involved an esop which required the trustee to invest all contributions received under the terms of the plan in esop stock.moench,at.after the price of the stock declined dramatically,a former employee and participant in the esop sued the fiduciaries of the plan for breach of their duty under erisa,claiming that they should have diversified plan assets in light of the company financial deterioration.id.at.on appeal,we reversed the district court summary judgment ruling in favor of defendants and held that in limited circumstances,esop fiduciaries can be liable under erisa for continuing to invest in employer stock according to the plan direction.id.at.we explained that although the primary purpose of the esop was to invest in employer stock,defendants were not absolutely require d to do so rather,they retained limited discretion over investment decisions id.at.
turning to the standard governing defendants discretionary decision to offer employer securities as an investment option,we first considered the unique status of esops under erisa.specifically,we noted that esop fiduciaries are exempt from the duty to diversify imposed by a c,and from b strict prohibition against dealing with a party in interest id.at.we explained that these exceptions arise out of the nature and purpose of esops themselves,which as set forth in,is to invest primarily in qualifying employer securities.d a.in other words,the concept of employee ownership constituted a goal in and of itself.moench,at.
despite the special status of esops,we emphasized that esop fiduciaries are still required to act in accordance with the duties of loyalty and care that apply to fiduciaries of typical erisa plans.id.at see also kuper iovenko,cir t he purpose of esops can not override erisa goal of ensuring the proper management and soundness of employee benefit plans.fink sav.trust,the investment decisions of a profit sharing plan fiduciary are subject to the closest scrutiny under the prudent person rule,in spite of the strong policy and preference in favor of investment in employer stock.internal quotation marks omitted.in other words,congress expressly intended that the esop would be both an employee retirement benefit plan and a technique of corporate finance that would encourage employee ownership.moench,at internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,we declined to adopt a per se rule that the decision of an esop fiduciary to invest in employer securities is not subject to judicial review see id.at.
in order to fashion an appropriate standard that would balance the two roles that esops are required to a mechanism of corporate finance and a vehicle for retirement noted that trust law distinguishes between two types of directions.id.at.on the one hand,if the trust requires the trustee to invest in a particular stock,then the trustee is immune from judicial inquiry.id.on the other hand,if the trust merely permits the trustee to invest in a particular stock,then the trustee investment decision is subject to de novo judicial review.id.
the situation presented in moench did not fit either category.defendants were not absolutely required to invest in employer securities,but they were more than simply permitted to make such investments.id.we therefore determined that an intermediate abuse of discretion standard would strike the appropriate balance between immunity from judicial review,at one extreme,and de novo review,at the other.accordingly,we set forth the following rebuttable presumption a n esop fiduciary who invests plan assets in employer stock is entitled to a presumption that it acted consistently with erisa by virtue of that decision.however,the plaintiff may overcome that presumption by establishing that the fiduciary abused its discretion by investing in employer securities.id.edgar refers to this deferential abuse of discretion standard as moench presumption of prudence.see,appellant br.at.
edgar argues that moench presumption of prudence does not apply here,because the plans at issue in this case are not esops.we are not persuaded.an esop is one of several types of pension plans categorized under erisa as eligible individual account plans or eiaps.d a.an eiap is defined as an individual account plan which is i a,stock bonus,thrift,or savings plan ii an employee stock ownership plan or iii a money purchase plan which is invested primarily in qualifying employer securities.id.it is undisputed that the plans at issue in this case are eiaps 
because one of the purposes of eiaps is to promote investment in employer securities,they are subject to many of the same exceptions that apply to esops.see wright oregon metallurgical,cir.for example,a provides that all eiaps,not just esops,are exempt from erisa duty to diversify in the case of an eligible individual account plan the diversification requirement and the prudence requirement only to the extent that it requires diversification is not violated by acquisition or holding of qualifying employer securities.a emphasis added.and e a states that erisa prohibitions against dealing with a party in interest or shall not apply to the acquisition or sale by a plan of qualifying employer securities if the plan is an eligible individual account plan.e a emphasis added.consequently,eiaps,like esops,place employee retirement assets at much greater risk than traditional erisa plans.wright,at.given these similarities,we conclude that the underlying rationale of moench applies equally here 
in sum,we conclude that the district court correctly determined that moench abuse of discretion standard governs judicial review of defendants decision to offer the avaya stock fund as an investment option.
the facts alleged in the amended complaint do not establish an abuse of discretion 
having set forth the appropriate standard of judicial review,the district court then correctly concluded that edgar failed to plead facts sufficient to establish that defendants abused their discretion.
in order to rebut the presumption that a fiduciary acted prudently in investing in employer securities,a plaintiff must show that the erisa fiduciary could not have believed reasonably that continued adherence to the esop direction was in keeping with the settlor expectations of how a prudent trustee would operate.moench,at.thus,the plaintiff may introduce evidence that owing to circumstances not known to the settlor and not anticipated by him,investing in employer securities would defeat or substantially impair the accomplishment of the purposes of the trust.id.quoting restatement second comment g.
in moench,we observed that the plaintiff alleged that the precipitous decline in the price of the employer stock,as well as defendants knowledge of its impending collapse and their own conflicted status,changed circumstances to such an extent that defendants could effectuate the purposes of the trust only by deviating from the trust direction or by contracting out investment decisions to an impartial outsider.id.at.specifically,plaintiff proffered evidence that during the relevant period,the price of the company stock declined from to less than per share federal regulators informed the company board of directors that they had concerns about the company financial condition and had uncovered various regulatory violations the federal deposit insurance corporation eventually took over control of one of the company subsidiaries and,ultimately,the company filed for chapter bankruptcy.id.at.based on these facts,we remanded the matter to the district court for further development of the record.id.at.
here,edgar alleges in the amended complaint that defendants abused their discretion by knowingly or recklessly disregarding the fact that the cost of integrating a recent corporate acquisition was greater than defendants publicly represented rather than having a positive financial impact,the acquisition reduced avaya earnings by at least per share during the fiscal year changes to avaya method of delivering products to market were causing severe disruptions in sales and the company was experiencing a dramatic reduction in demand for its products.therefore,edgar contends,avaya had no reasonable basis to project an increase in profits or an increase in revenues of for fiscal.at.
edgar allegations,if true,indicate that during the class period,avaya was undergoing corporate developments that were likely to have a negative effect on the company earnings and,therefore,on the value of the company stock.in fact,this is precisely what happened when the price of avaya stock declined by per share following avaya april,earnings announcement.we can not agree,however,that these developments,or the corresponding drop in stock price,created the type of dire situation which would require defendants to disobey the terms of the plans by not offering the avaya stock fund as an investment option,or by divesting the plans of avaya securities.indeed,had defendants divested the plans of avaya common stock during th
