comcast of illinois initiated this action against multivision electronics and its sole officer and shareholder,ronald abboud,alleging that they had violated the cable communications policy act and injured comcast by illegally distributing cable descramblers.the district court granted comcast motion for summary judgment.after a hearing on damages,it awarded comcast in damages for which multivision and abboud were held to be jointly and severally liable.they appeal,arguing that the district court erred by granting summary judgment to comcast,abused its discretion in awarding damages and denying a continuance,and should not have imposed individual liability on abboud.we affirm.
comcast owns and operates a cable television system and provides cable services to paying subscribers.the system signals are transmitted from their point of origin to comcast reception facilities and then retransmitted to subscribers homes through comcast cable network.to prevent subscribers from receiving services they have not paid for,comcast encodes or scrambles its signals.a subscriber must have a converter box or descrambler connected to a television in order to receive the transmitted signals,because scrambled signals are not viewable.as part of its service,comcast offers its subscribers a descrambler for which they pay a small rental fee.comcast cable system is addressable,meaning that comcast programs each subscriber converter to receive only purchased services.it is possible,however,for an individual to circumvent comcast encoding system by installing an unauthorized descrambler which decodes the signals and receives programming the individual has not purchased.
in february comcast began to investigate the cable descrambler sales of platinum electronics,and steven abboud ronald abboud brother and shortly thereafter initiated an action against them alleging illegal distribution of cable descramblers.in june while that litigation was ongoing,federal marshals raided the offices of platinum electronics in omaha.some of the documents seized during this raid related to sales of cable descramblers by multivision,which had operated from the same location as platinum electronics 
based on the information contained in the seized documents,comcast commenced this action against multivision and ronald abboud.the complaint alleged that the defendants distribution of cable descramblers between and violated the cable communications policy act,a,which provides that no one shall intercept or receive or assist in intercepting or receiving any communication service offered over a cable system,unless specifically authorized to do so by a cable operator or as may otherwise be specifically authorized by law.assisting in interception includes the manufacture or distribution of equipment intended by the manufacturer or distributor for unauthorized reception of cable services.id.a.comcast alleged that by selling cable descramblers the defendants had assisted in the unauthorized interception of cable services.
evidence was presented to the district court relating to multivision sales of cable descramblers.it is not disputed that the descramblers sold by appellants are capable of decoding cable television signals or that comcast had not authorized any identified customer to use a descrambler sold by multivision.the descramblers multivision sold typically cost customers well over,and at least three models cost.invoices for the descramblers included a statement reading,do not hook up your descrambler until you have received authorization from your cable company or local officials.by opening and hooking up this equipment you agree to be fully responsible for using this equipment in a legal manner.multivision also gave a return form to purchasers of cable descramblers.customers could fill it out and give it to multivision to identify the specific problem they were having with a descrambler.the form provided check boxes,three of which were labeled premium stations are scrambled,basic stations are scrambled,and some premium stations come in,others do not.
comcast also found a classified advertisement multivision had placed in nuts volts magazine in february,march,and april,stating that it sold cable descramblers.richard killian,an investigator for comcast,found multivision listed along with other distributors of cable descrambling equipment on a swedish website under the heading cable descrambler ordering list.two of the other listed distributors modern electronics and tka electronics have been sued in nebraska for illegal distribution of cable descrambling equipment,and we recently affirmed a grant of summary judgment against tka electronics in an unpublished opinion.comcast of.x,tka.cir.
both sides filed motions for summary judgment.comcast argued that there was no genuine issue of fact as to whether the defendants intended to help their customers illegally obtain cable programming.multivision and abboud argued that a decision of the nebraska supreme court involving abboud and the distribution of cable descramblers,imperial empire trading city of omaha,put comcast on notice of the defendants activities in.claiming that a three year statute of limitations governs actions under,the defendants argued that the action was time barred because comcast did not sue until.
the district court granted comcast summary judgment motion and denied that of the defendants.it concluded that comcast action was not barred by the statute of limitations because there was nothing to put comcast on notice of the defendants actions before february.it further concluded that there was no genuine issue of fact as to whether the defendants intended to assist their customers in illegally intercepting cable television because the defendants were involved in distributing cable descramblers,whose only intended use was the unauthorized reception of cable services.it also held that the disclaimers included with the invoices were insufficient to shield the defendants from liability.
the district court initially set a hearing on damages for october.on october defendants moved for a continuance based on an affidavit averring that ronald abboud had admitted himself to a health rehabilitation facility outside nebraska for treatment three days before,that he would be unavailable on october,and that his treatment would last for days or possibly longer.the court granted a continuance to november.at the november hearing neither abboud nor any of the defendants witnesses were present.based on a letter written by abboud psychotherapist,counsel for defendants requested a further continuance.after the district court denied the oral motion,the hearing proceeded.comcast submitted defendants tax returns for the years through as evidence of defendants gross revenues and requested damages equal to the gross revenue reported on the tax returns.
on september,the district court awarded comcast damages.to find the amount of actual damages,it accepted the amount of gross revenue reported on multivision tax returns,rejected the deductions defendants had claimed on them,and deducted from defendants gross profits to reach,the actual damages awarded.the statute authorizes a district court to increase damages by up to if it finds that a violation was committed willfully and for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain.see c b.the court found that defendants violations met these requirements and added for a total award of.it also found that plaintiff was entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees in the amount of and ordered judgment entered in the total amount of.ronald abboud and multivision were made jointly and severally liable for the judgment.
abboud and multivision appeal the summary judgment and the award of damages.in their view summary judgment was inappropriate not only because comcast claims are barred by the statute of limitations,but also because there is a dispute of material fact as to whether abboud and multivision intended the descramblers to be used for the unauthorized reception of cable programming.they further assert that the district court abused its discretion by denying their second motion for a continuance.the award of damages was itself an abuse of discretion they say,because comcast failed to meet its burden of proving the amount of their profits,and the district court erred by finding the violation willful and abboud personally liable.
comcast responds that the issuance of the imperial empire decision and its availability in the public record was insufficient to put it on notice of appellants activities,that the evidence of their intent and willfulness is overwhelming,and that there was sufficient basis to impose personal liability against abboud.it also argues that the denial of a continuance did not cause appellants any prejudice and that the court award of damages is supported by the evidence.
appellants contend that the district court erred by granting summary judgment to comcast.they argue first that the statute of limitations barred comcast claims,asserting that because the decision of the nebraska supreme court in imperial empire trading was in the public record and involved the sale of cable descramblers by a company which ronald abboud owned,comcast was put on notice of appellants actions in.appellants claim that comcast should have been aware of the case and under an obligation to investigate.such an investigation would have revealed that the imperial empire trading company was owned by ronald abboud,that ronald abboud also owned multivision,and that multivision was engaged in the allegedly unlawful practices for which comcast seeks relief in this case.comcast responds that merely because imperial empire was in the public record beginning in,that does not mean it should have been aware of it.we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,using the same standard as the district court and construing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving parties.iowa network,qwest,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only if the evidence establishes that there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.
the parties have proceeded on the assumption that the timeliness of this suit is governed by a three year statute of limitations borrowed from the copyright act,b.the cable communications policy act lacks its own statute of limitations and courts are in disagreement on the applicable statute.compare prostar massachi,cir borrowing three year limitation from copyright act,with kingvision,belmont,cir borrowing two year limitation from state antipiracy statute.we assume without deciding that the three year limitation applies.in this case we need not choose between the federal copyright law or state law because nebraska antipiracy statute,has a limitations period of eighteen months and we conclude that comcast should have first been aware of appellants activities in february,six months before the complaint was filed on august.
in imperial empire,the case on which appellants rely for their statute of limitations argument,a former employee of the company which appellants claim was owned by ronald abboud notified omaha police that imperial possessed illegal cable descramblers which it had been selling.the police obtained a warrant and seized the property.imperial was charged with theft of services and moved to suppress the seized property.the motion was granted and the charges later dismissed.meanwhile,the police had decided that the property was contraband and destroyed it without obtaining court approval.imperial sued omaha for conversion and wrongful destruction of property,and the district court held the city liable.since no lawful market was found to exist for the destroyed property,it awarded only nominal damages.on appeal the nebraska supreme court concluded that the district court factual determination that no lawful market existed was clearly wrong,at,and remanded for further proceedings.
in federal question cases,the discovery rule applies in the absence of a contrary directive from congress.union pac.beckham,cir.under this rule,a cause of action accrues and the statute of limitations begins to run when the plaintiff discovers,or with due diligence should have discovered,the injury which is the basis of the litigation.see id.the pertinent issue here is whether the publication of the imperial empire decision would have led a reasonable person in comcast position to investigate the possibility that its rights were being violated.see csc holdings,redisi,cir.
imperial empire did not suggest that comcast services were being used without authorization,and comcast is not mentioned.the only cable service provider mentioned in the opinion is cox cable omaha.appellants assert that because comcast later purchased cox,comcast should have investigated further when it bought cox.appellants have not pointed to anything in the record on appeal which contains information about any transaction between comcast and cox or that imperial empire applied in any way to comcast.we conclude that issuance of the imperial empire decision was not enough to put comcast on notice that its own rights were being violated.because appellants do not argue that anything other than imperial empire could have caused comcast claim to accrue before february we conclude that comcast action is not time barred.
appellants next argue that the district court erred in concluding that there was no genuine issue of fact as to whether they possessed the requisite intent.they contend that simply because the descramblers were capable of illegal use does not demonstrate that they were intended to be used in this way.the cases on which comcast relies are distinguishable say appellants,because in them the district court was either acting as a trier or fact or examining the likelihood of success on the merits.nor are the disclaimers evidence of their unlawful intent,for a reasonable jury could find that the descramblers were intended to be used legally.they point to evidence of legitimate uses for the converter boxes and the finding in imperial empire that a lawful market existed for the descramblers.comcast counters that cable customers had no reason to purchase a descrambler from appellants except for illegal uses,and that appellants were aware of this fact.it also asserts that the disclaimers were clearly intended to shield appellants from liability and as such are evidence of unlawful intent.finally,it contends that imperial empire is readily distinguishable from the present case and the district court did not err by declining to defer to it.
intent has traditionally meant not only desire to bring about the consequences of an act,but also knowledge that certain consequences are substantially certain to result from it.see restatement second of torts cmt.b william prosser,the law of torts at ed see also,first bank of omaha acceptance ins,bradley am.smelting ref.if there was no genuine issue of fact as to whether appellants knew that it was substantially certain that their sales of cable descramblers would result in the unauthorized interception of cable services,the district court grant of summary judgment should be affirmed.
because it is undisputed that comcast subscribers were able to rent a cable descrambler from comcast for substantially less than the cost to purchase a comparable product from multivision,there is little reason a paying customer would spend a considerable sum of money to purchase multivision product.see intermedia partners,qb distribs,time warner cable of city cable box wholesalers.at oral argument counsel for appellants suggested that a customer might wish to purchase a descrambler with a remote volume control or channel changing feature or might want an additional device for another television in the home.appellants urge us to infer that customers would pay hundreds of dollars for better volume control or channel changing capability but that would be mere speculation on this record.see twymon wells fargo,cir.
on the return form appellants gave purchasers,three of the check boxes describing problems a customer might experience are labeled premium stations are scrambled,basic stations are scrambled,and some premium stations come in,others do not.if multivision gave the form to its customers for them t
