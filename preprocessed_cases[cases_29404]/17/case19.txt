george schussel appeals a decision of the united states tax court holding him liable,as the recipient of a fraudulent transfer from his former company,for the company back taxes including penalties of over million,plus interest of at least million.on appeal,he does not dispute that his company fraudulently transferred millions of dollars to him in an effort to avoid paying income taxes to the irs.what he disputes is how much he owes the irs as a result of those transfers.first,he argues that the tax court erred in applying the federal tax interest statute,and that he should only have to pay the likely much lower amount of prejudgment interest that would be due under massachusetts law.second,he claims that the tax court should have accepted his corrected tax returns as establishing the amount of the assets he misappropriated.third,he maintains that he should have received credit for money he loaned back to his company,which the company then used to pay his legal bills.concluding that the tax court calculated prejudgment interest under the wrong statute,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings.
background 
we have previously recounted george schussel efforts to circumvent tax law,affirming his convictions for tax evasion and conspiracy to defraud the united states.see united states schussel,app x cir.we recount the basics here,adding only the details necessary to resolve this appeal most of which were stipulated by the parties.
beginning in the early,schussel operated a massachusetts corporation called digital consulting,dci.until,dci was a subchapter c corporation during the relevant period,schussel controlled of dci schussel set up an offshore shell company to siphon dci income into accounts that he controlled,all without paying the requisite corporate or individual taxes.dci failed to report all of its income to the irs,and eventually,the irs issued a notice of deficiency regarding dci,and tax returns.dci neither contested nor paid the assessed liabilities.it has been insolvent since.
as we explain below,the irs can,by statute,collect a person tax debt by reclaiming assets the debtor has transferred to someone else a transferee.see.on november,the irs sent schussel a notice of liability notice,claiming that he was liable as a transferee for dci tax deficiencies.the notice claimed that dci had tax deficiencies of,and for those three years as shown in the attached statement,and that t his portion of total assessed income tax deficiencies,plus interest as provided by law,constitute your liability as transferee in summary,the attached statement provided 
the statement also said that,of dci tax liability,only,and the amounts transferred for these respective tax years,plus interest as provided by law from the date of this notice,will be assessed against george schussel as transferee these sums,not including interest,add up to.a note at the base of the page explained that schussel was 
liable for the lesser of the value of the property transferred,plus interest as provided by law,or the balance of the liability,plus accrued interest.accordingly,the transferee liability for the,and assessed liability of the transferor is limited to the above stated value of property transferred to him for the three years.
schussel challenged the notice in tax court,claiming among other things that he should receive credit against any transferee liability for money that he loaned back to dci.most of that money,schussel readily admits,dci used to cover expenses related to his tax litigation according to the stipulated facts and evidence at trial,dci gross receipts,legal and consulting expenses,and loans from schussel amounted to 
the irs answer to schussel petition for review asked that the notice of liability simply be confirmed.however,its pretrial memorandum abandoned the limited theory of schussel liability for interest advanced in the notice and statement.instead,it argued that schussel was liable for dci back taxes,plus interest as determined under the federal tax interest statute from the due date of dci tax returns,and that his liability was not limited to the amount of assets that dci fraudulently transferred to him 
after trial,the tax court ruled on a large number of issues,only a few of which are relevant to this appeal.as pertinent here,it first determined that schussel received from dci fraudulent transfers in the amounts of during,during,and during to,for a total of.then,at the irs request,the court held schussel liable for dci back taxes,plus prejudgment interest at the federal rate from the respective dates on which dci income taxes were due for,and so calculated,prejudgment interest alone totaled approximately million by the time the irs issued the notice,leaving schussel liable for over million plus further accruing interest at the federal rate.finally,the tax court refused to give schussel credit against his liability for the amount he loaned back to dci from to,or to limit his liability to the amount of assets he received no matter how that figure was calculated.
schussel timely appealed,fed.a,challenging each of those conclusions.first,he argues that his total liability should have been limited to,the undeclared income figure the irs used to correct his individual tax returns,or at most to the million of dci assets that the irs notice and statement claimed he received.second,he contends that any prejudgment interest on the fraudulently transferred funds should have been assessed at the massachusetts rate of per year,but only from the date of the irs notice rather than the dates on which dci unpaid taxes were due in,resulting in a substantial reduction in his total liability.third,he argues that he should receive credit,to be counted against his liability,for roughly million in loans he made to dci between and.
we have jurisdiction under.we address each of schussel arguments,assessing first the question of interest,then the amount transferred,and then whether schussel should receive credit for any alleged retransfers.
ii.standard of review 
our review of the tax court ruling is in most respects similar to our review of district court decisions factual findings for clear error and legal rulings de novo.drake comm r,cir see also a,c.the clear error standard of review extends to factual findings based on inferences from stipulated facts.capital video comm r,cir internal quotation marks omitted.a finding is clearly erroneous when,although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.interex,comm r,cir internal quotation marks omitted.although the burden is usually on the taxpayer to demonstrate that an irs ruling is wrong,in transferee cases the irs bears the burden of showing that the petitioner is liable as a transferee of property of a taxpayer,but not of showing that the taxpayer was liable for the tax.a see generally tax.a,d 
iii.analysis 
a.the tax court applied the wrong framework to assess how much schussel owes.the fraudulent transfer claim 
in its effort to recover sums transferred to schussel by dci,the irs availed itself of the procedures set forth in.section specifies the procedures by which the irs may administratively assert among other claims state law remedies for fraudulent transfers,subject to challenge in tax court while the procedures are federal,state substantive law controls in determining whether and to what extent the transferee is liable.see frank sawyer trust of may comm r,cir here,nearly all of the transfers are covered by the massachusetts uniform fraudulent conveyance act mufca.laws ch,et.the few made after october fall under the massachusetts uniform fraudulent transfer act mufta.id.et.
schussel did not appeal the tax court finding that the transfers in this case were made with the actual intent to defraud dci,the irs.therefore,the transfers are invalid both as to creditors with claims against dci at the time of the transfer and as to those whose claims arose later.see id.id.a.
both the mufca and mufta generally permit a creditor with a matured claim to avoid a fraudulent conveyance,secure a return of the transferred funds in favor of the creditor to the extent necessary to satisfy his claim.david zilah.laws ch,a,b,c allowing avoidance to the extent necessary to satisfy the creditor claim,but limiting the judgment to the lesser of a the amount of the claim,and b the value of the assets adjusted as the equities may require jordan shapiro et,massachusetts practice collection law ed describing remedies under the mufca.each statute gives the court some discretion to fashion an equitable remedy in some cases.see.laws ch,a iii subject to section,allowing any other relief the circumstances may require id.d allowing courts to m ake any order which the circumstances of the case may require to protect creditors with immature claims.
in discussing the issues raised by this appeal,it is helpful to distinguish between interest accrued on the tax obligation of the,and interest accrued on the transferred funds recovered from the transferee by a creditor.federal interest on a tax obligation accrues automatically,usually from the date when the tax payment first becomes late.a,e that interest is simply a part of the debt owed by the to the irs,see e,all of which may usually be collected from a fraudulent transferee to the extent of the amount fraudulently transferred.see,lowy comm r,wl also united states verduchi,cir under rhode island fraudulent transfer not section treating the irs claim against the transferor as including the accumulated interest.thus,for example,if the taxpayer owes in taxes,upon which in interest accrues,and the taxpayer then fraudulently transfers to a transferee,the irs can certainly recover a judgment of no less than against the transferee 
what is at issue in this case is prejudgment interest asserted against the transferee on the amount of the transfer deemed to be avoidable that is,the amount that the transferee must give back.suppose,again,that a taxpayer owed in taxes and accrued in interest but,this time,he transferred to a transferee.the transferee would be liable for a judgment that he pay over to the irs the entire transferred to him.like most other litigants against whom a monetary liability is established,he might also owe some amount of prejudgment interest the question is how much.
according to the irs,it depends on when the interest accrued.if,as in our example,it accrued before the taxpayer transferred the so that on the day of transfer,the taxpayer owed more to the irs than he gave away to the transferee,the irs concedes that state fraudulent transfer law would apply to limit the irs to recovering from the transferee the he received,plus such prejudgment interest as might be available under that state law.but if the additional interest owed by the taxpayer to the irs accrued after the transfer so that on the day of transfer,the taxpayer gave away more than he owed at that time,the irs claims that the transferee would owe the entire in interest accrued under federal law.that interest,it says,accrued on the transferee own liability not just on the taxpayer underlying debt and ran under section at the same rate and from the same date as against the original taxpayer on the underlying tax debt.essentially,the irs argues that where state law provides the basis for transferee liability,the ratio of irs debt to assets transferred on the date of transfer operates as a toggle switch to pick whether state or federal law controls prejudgment interest.
the language of the two statutes is sufficiently abstract that it could be read as providing partial support for the irs.under section,transferee liability is to be assessed and collected in the same manner and subject to the same provisions and limitations as in the case of the taxes with respect to which the liabilities were incurred.a.and the tax interest statute,section,provides that a ny reference in this title except for in the subchapter relating to deficiency procedures to any tax imposed shall be deemed also to refer to interest imposed by this section on such tax.id.e.there is some appeal,therefore,in the irs claim that section is simply one of the same tax provisions and limitations to which transferee liability is subject under section.see robinette comm r,cir so holding,before the supreme court ruled in comm r stern,d,that state law governs the substance of fraudulent transferee liability under section nicholas united states,d interpreting the to mean that where a chapter bankruptcy trustee was not liable for interest on the debtor taxes after a certain point,a trust fund collectable in the same manner as those taxes would not garner interest baptiste comm r,cir where a federal statute created the transferee liability,concluding that subject to the same provisions and limitations in section means that the irs can charge interest on transferee liability as if it were a tax liability 
statutory history can also be read as providing some support for the more limited idea that interest accrues at the federal rate from the date of the transfer.the original draft of section precursor,section of the revenue act of,stat,specified that no interest would accrue on a transferee liability until he received a notice and demand,reprinted in cum.bull.pt.in conference,that language was changed the committee asserted that section did not alter the extent of transferee liability,but went on to add that no interest accrued on the transferee assumed liability after the transfer,except interest for failure to pay upon notice and demand and interest at per cent a year for reimbursing the government at the usual rate for the loss of the use of the money due it,at,reprinted in cum.bull.pt.this might suggest that congress expected a standard federal interest rate to apply,and did not view that choice as much altering existing transferee liability law.but as a number of cases point out,it is hardly crystal clear 
ultimately,we are saved from having to search for an answer in ambiguous statutory language and unclear legislative history.instead,we find our answer in the supreme court interpretation of a prior version of this same statute.in commissioner stern,d,the supreme court held that another of section predecessor statutes,section of the internal revenue code of,provided only the procedure by which the irs could assert substantive rights against transferees created by other did not create any such rights.stern,at.thus,where,as there,state fraudulent transfer law supplied the substantive rule,state law controlled the existence and extent of transferee liability.id.at.although the statutory language has changed some since then the parties agree that stern still controls,and requires that state law dictate the existence and extent of schussel transferee liability.
in turn,both massachusetts and federal courts treat prejudgment interest as a substantive part of a remedy.see,tobin liberty mut.ins,cir in a discrimination case,noting that i t is well established that prejudgment interest is a substantive remedy governed by state law when claims are brought in federal court militello ann grace,a n award of prejudgment interest is a substantive remedy.since section governs only procedure,and since prejudgment interest is generally a matter of substance,it follows that section does not govern prejudgment interest where the substantive law is state law.
resisting this conclusion,the irs points to several cases in which the irs was in fact able to recover prejudgment interest under federal law.but it offers little authority expressly adopting its is,few transferee cases where a court held that because the transferor gave away more than he owed to the irs that day,section interest runs on the transferee liability from the date that the transferor taxes were due,even though that interest has grown the debt well beyond what the transferee received and regardless of when the transferee learned about the debt.and even those few cases it identifies offer little informative analysis.see upchurch comm r,cch under illinois estate transferee liability rules,where the transferee received more than the estate owed as a deficiency but less than the deficiency plus interest,concluding that interest ran under section on the transferee liability for the deficiency from the date the estate tax return was due see also pneumatic united states,where the assets transferred were adequate to satisfy the total taxes,penalties,and interest,describing the interest charged as upon the transferee liability,rather than the transferor tax debt butler comm r,cch in a case applying minnesota fraudulent transfer law,explicitly comparing the roughly million transferred with the transferor million tax liability on the date of the transfer.
on the whole,the weight of the case law is consistent with the basic logic of our stern analysis.this precedent includes two of the cases upon which the irs itself relies,estate of stein commissioner,wl,and lowy commissioner,wl.in lowy,the tax court explained that federal law determines the quantum of the irs claim against the,and that that claim includes statutory interest.at interpreting the code.therefore,where the assets in the hands of the transferee were more than ample to discharge the full federal liability of the transferor including interest,there was no need to resort to interest principles to make the irs whole.see id.at.here,of course,the irs would not be made whole by recovering the funds transferred to schussel because dci debt,including penalties and interest,was larger than the amount transferred.this type of situation was presented in estate of stein,where the tax court explained that because the transferred assets were insufficient to pay the transferor total liability,interest is not assessed against the deficiencies because the transferee liability for such deficiencies is limited to the amount actually transferred to him.interest may be charged against the transferee only as determined by state law.at.accord,stanko comm r,cir in a constructive fraudulent transfer case,rejecting an argument similar to the irs here as unsound under nebraska law stansbury comm r,cir where the transferees received less than the transferor total amount owed to the irs,concluding that under stern their interest liability before receiving a notice was governed by state law patterson sims,cir where the taxpayer liability,even before interest,exceeded the transferee net benefit,concluding that the transferee substantive liability was controlled by state law,and using state law to assess the liability of a transferee in addition to the value of the property received.
we therefore accept the irs invitation to follow lowy and estate of stein,but we follow the actual reasoning of the opinions in those cases,not the caricature of them reflected in the irs position.the resulting rule,we believe,is consistent with stern mandate that massachusetts law dictate schussel substantive liability.stern,at.that rule is simple the irs may recover from schussel all amounts dci owes to the irs including section interest accruing on dci tax debt,up to the limit of the amount transferred to schussel,with any recovery of prejudgment interest above the amount transferred to be determined in accord with massachusetts law this rule,in our view,appropriately defers to massachusetts fraudulent transfer law and avoids the arbitrary effects of the government focus on the ratio of the debt to the transferred assets on the date of transfer.our comfort with this conclusion is buttressed by but not predicated on the fact that the irs itself appears to have taken a similar approach in guidance similarly,the notice of liability in this very case tracked that guidance,rather than the position the irs later advanced at trial and on appeal.
schussel contends,and the irs does not dispute,that under massachusetts law,no interest would have begun to accrue until the date of the notice of liability.laws ch,providing for prejudgment interest as of the date of commencement of the action.lassman keefe in re keefe,cir applying section to a massachusetts fraudulent transfer action in bankruptcy court.we accept without deciding that uncontested description of massachusetts law.schussel therefore owes no prejudgment interest on his own liability as transferee that is,on the amounts transferred to him for the time period the notice.
the reader might think and hope we are done with this interest ing issue,but this is tax law,and it should surprise no one that a bit more need be said regarding the subsequent period of time that passed between the notice and the judgment as opposed to the longer periods that passed between the due date of the tax and the issuance of the notice,or between the date of the transfer and the notice.section provides that when a tax is not paid on or before the last date prescribed for payment,interest shall accrue,and that where the last date for payment is not prescribed anywhere else,that date in no event shall be later than the date notice and demand for the tax is made by the secretary.a,b internal revenue service,chief counsel advisory,noting that section does not prescribe a last date for the transferee to pay a tax and that a transferee liability for the tax arguably arises upon the date of transfer,but that section imposes liability for interest on the transferee at least as of the date of notice and demand for payment of the transferee liability.this language suggests that the question of prejudgment interest after the date of the commissioner notice of transferee liability may well be a matter of federal law.stanko,at.see also patterson,at.
schussel,however,affirmatively volunteers that,from the date of the notice until judgment,he is subject to prejudgment interest under.laws ch.and because the massachusetts rate twelve percent exceeds the current federal rate three percent,the irs has had no cause to oppose schussel position that massachusetts interest rules also apply to the period between the notice and the judgment.see.laws ch,a,irs rul.accordingly,on remand in this particular case,the simple rule stated above should control for the entire prejudgment time period,with any prejudgment interest assessed above the amount transferred calculated at the massachusetts rate from the date of the notice.
b.how much did dci transfer to schussel 
we turn next to divining the size of the transfer.schussel argues first that that amount is,which is the amount the irs determined he received as constructive dividends from dci when the irs corrected his personal tax returns for.in the alternative,he argues that the amount should be the amount identified in the notice of transferee liability and adopted by the tax court.the irs did not,but claims apparently as an alternate basis for affirmance that the record shows that over the life of the scheme,schussel used dci to divert over million to himself not just the million listed in the notice.
addressing first schussel arguments for limiting the amount deemed to have been fraudulently transferred to him to million,we agree with the tax court that the constructive dividends determination is not controlling.schussel concedes that the million figure represents the amount of dci gross receipts diverted from to into accounts that he controlled.and on appeal,schussel offers no sufficient explanation for why the amount of his constructive dividend income is also the correct measure of assets fraudulently transferred under massachusetts law accordingly,we see no error in the tax court decision to accept as a proper measure of the assets he received during the actual amount transferred from dci into accounts as stipulated by the parties.
we turn next to the irs argument for increasing the amount deemed to have been transferred by dci to schussel.the irs argues that there is record evidence demonstrating that,in addition to the transferred in,dci also diverted roughly million more to schussel largely comprised of amounts transferred to him before.assuming that these transfers were also made with fraudulent intent,massachusetts law renders all of the money available to pay both prior and subsequent claims.see david zilah.therefore,the irs asks us to conclude that the amount transferred to schussel was roughly million.
the irs argument for using this increased figure confronts a nettlesome problem of notice and procedure namely that the irs never it seems sought to amend its notice of liability or other pleadings to clearly warn schussel that it would seek to use the million figure.a granting the tax court jurisdiction to determine increases in deficiencies asserted at or before a hearing or rehearing tax.specifying the procedure,much like,for amending pleadings.the notice assured him that his liability was limited to plus interest as provided by law.when schussel filed his petition with the tax court challenging the liability imposed on him by the notice,the irs filed an answer,largely affirming the position taken in the notice,but referring without specific dollar amounts to transfers dating back to.
apparently deciding but not announcing that it had erred in its more limited initial approach,the irs pretrial memorandum did indeed add allegations of additional transfers and diversions with dollar figures dating back to.at trial,the irs also offered evidence reflecting the alleged diversions from on.schussel,for his part,objected to this awkward attempt to establish transfers in excess of those claimed in the notice,although he failed to identify any prejudice the shift had caused him.in reply,the irs asserted that it was not seeking,and need not seek,an increased deficiency because dci underlying tax deficiency was the same as it has always been it then simply asserted that it had amply proved the greater amount of assets transferred to schussel.the tax court never clearly addressed the issue,possibly because,by accepting the irs theory of prejudgment interest,the court pretty much affirmed a recovery that equaled the entire tax liability.
on appeal,the irs again pays scant attention to the procedural niceties.rather,it simply asserts that it proved transfers in the larger amount.maybe so,but that is hardly the point.the point is that the record available to us on appeal contains neither a notice of liability,nor an amendment,nor a ruling under tax court rule b that could provide a basis for affirming the decision of the tax court on the alternative million figure now urged by the irs.comm r,cch explaining that the tax court can not generally determine a greater deficiency than that listed in the notice where the irs has not pleaded such an increase tax.we therefore leave this entire question,whether the tax court may or should accept a belated motion to amend or consider any other available relief to the discretion of the tax court on remand.
schussel loans to dci to pay schussel litigation expenses did not reduce the net amount transferred to him.
generally,a fraudulent transferee can reduce or eliminate his liability by returning the property to the original transferor before he receives a notice of transferee liability.see eyler comm r,cir ginsberg comm r,wl,aff,cir mertens law of federal income taxation thompson 
even if there is no actual retransfer,a transferee might reduce his liability by showing that he used the property to pay the transferor debts at least if those debts had priority over the transferor tax liability.see,eyler comm r,cch and cases cited therein mertens law of federal income taxation while a transferee who pays the debts of the transferor will not be relieved of liability to the extent of payment unless the debts paid held priority over the tax claimed by the government,a transferee who retransfers the property to the transferor can avoid liability as a fraudulent transferee.
with these principles in mind,we turn to schussel claim that the tax court erred in denying him credit for just over million that he loaned to dci between and most of that money was used to pay expenses relating to schussel own criminal and civil tax cases.schussel argues that his legal costs were properly deductible as business expenses,suggesting that there is no irregularity in dci paying them,and hence in his giving dci money to do so.the irs objects that these were loans,not retransfers,and that the only point of the loans was to let schussel count personal expenses as dci expenses and maximize his tax deductions.although the irs bears the burden of proof in transferee liability cases,see a,schussel bore the burden of going forward with the evidence to refute transferee liability once the irs made a prima facie showing of such liability.eyler,cch citation omitted.
the tax court,siding with the irs,evidently found that the loan transactions lacked economic substance.it found that dci was out of business when the loans were made,had nothing to gain or lose by defending or not defending the charges,and never contested the tax deficiency.schussel comm r,cch,at.it held that t he amounts loaned to the corporation were never available to pay its tax liabilities.id.at.the tax court declined to address schussel arguments about whether the claimed expenses were deductible to either schussel or dci,or to apportion them between the two,deciding only whether loans by petitioner to the corporation should reduce the transfer liabilities in issue it noted,however,that recording loans to a defunct entity,paying expenses and deducting them on an s corporation return,and passing through the resulting losses to petitioner personal income tax returns was simply a way to create the appearance that personal expenses were business expenses.id.at.in any event,the court noted,schussel was bound by the contemporaneous characterization of these transactions as loans.id.at.in sum,the court found unjustified by law or reason the idea that schussel liability as a transferee for corporate income taxes that he caused to be evaded should be reduced by the costs of defending himself from the consequences of his fraud.id.
schussel objects to the tax court findings and conclusions on only two grounds.first,he attacks the court observation that nothing in law or reason justified reducing schussel liability by the amount of his own legal fees.not so,schussel contends precedent makes clear that legal defense costs related to one business may be deductible as a business expense.see,comm r tellier,d.while true,this helps him little.we view the tax court remark as a passing comment upon the equities of the case not as holding that schussel expenses were per se nondeductible.this is especially clear in light of the tax court explicit refusal to decide the deductibility question.this passing comment affords no basis for reversal.
second,schussel takes aim at the tax court conclusion that the loaned funds were never available to pay dci tax bill,and its resulting refusal to apportion those expenses.regardless of how the transfers were recorded on the corporate books,he argues,they put cash in dci accounts or really,on its ledgers which was then available to pay dci debts.reading the court analysis as a whole,however,we think that it justifiably concluded that there was no meaningful retransfer.
viewed through the lens of federal tax doctrine which the parties more or less invite by failing to cite any authority on point,the result is justified by the power to disregard the form of transactions that have no business purpose or economic substance beyond tax evasion.see fidelity int l currency advisor a fund,llc ex rel.tax matters partner united states,cir tax considerations are permissibly taken into account by taxpayers but where a transaction has no economic purpose other than to reduce taxes,the irs may disregard the reported figures as fictions and look through to the underlying substance.why else would the tax court specify that the services paid for were rendered to schussel personally,or that dci was out of business and had nothing to gain by defending the charges,before concluding that the loans were not available to pay dci debts we note that schussel offers no challenge to those first two findings.it thus appears that the tax court found no economic substance or business purpose for dci in the loans,and that their only function was to manipulate tax liability bergersen comm r,cir declining to credit the characterization of purported loans from a company to stakeholders,and instead treating them as dividends,where the effect of the whole transaction was to give the
