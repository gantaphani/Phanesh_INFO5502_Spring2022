background 
bosack and his wife lerner were the founders of cisco systems.they employed soward as their investment manager.the three formed capital partners,capital.soward served as the general partner,and bosack and lerner were limited partners.
several years later,bosack and soward formed cartesian,a second partnership,for the purpose of managing bosack high touch investments.soward was the general partner of cartesian bosack was a limited partner.a written partnership agreement for cartesian the wood agreement was drafted,but never signed.
a decade or so later,bosack and lerner began to suspect soward had breached his fiduciary duties in managing their assets.they discovered that soward had made undocumented loans to himself and his friends.soward was removed as the general partner of capital,and of cartesian.bosack and lerner then formed sllb,and it replaced soward as the general partner of cartesian.
soward demanded arbitration,seeking among other things a dissolution of cartesian and an accounting of his partnership interest.bosack and lerner participated with soward in the arbitration proceeding.it lasted two years,during which more than sixty days of hearings were held,more than twenty witnesses testified,and over five hundred exhibits were entered into evidence.due to the complicated nature of the proceedings,the parties agreed to proceed in stages.the panel entered a series of five interim awards,and then one final award.
the results of the awards were mixed.in interim award,the panel determined that the terms of the wood agreement governed the cartesian partnership,though that agreement had never been signed.the panel determined that soward breached his fiduciary duties,but that bosack had no right to remove him as a general partner of cartesian.under the terms of the wood agreement,the panel held that soward remained a limited partner in cartesian after he was removed as the general partner.the panel concluded that the value of soward partnership should be calculated as of september.interim award was not made final.
interim award is not involved in this appeal.
in interim award,the panel determined the value of soward partnership interest was.award was the only interim award the arbitration panel made final and immediately enforceable.
in interim award,the panel ruled in favor of soward on two tort claims.after bosack removed soward as the general partner of cartesian,the panel determined that,under delaware law,soward was entitled to an accounting and a prompt distribution of his partnership interest.the panel found that bosack had breached his fiduciary duties to soward by failing to provide him with an accounting and distribution,and by improperly taking control of all the cartesian assets.the panel also found bosack and lerner liable for conversion by their improper appropriation of soward interest in cartesian.damages awarded under interim award were subject to a credit for payments made to satisfy interim award.
in interim award,the panel ruled that bosack and lerner had acted with malice and oppression,and that soward was entitled to punitive damages of against bosack,and against lerner.
bosack and lerner moved the district court to vacate interim awards and,as well as the panel hearing order finding that punitive damages applied.they also asked the district court to vacate the final award as to soward tort claims and punitive damages,and the award of related costs and attorney fees.the district court denied that motion and confirmed the panel final award,which incorporated its earlier interim awards.

discussion 
bosack and lerner argue awards and,and the portion of the final award confirming those awards,should be vacated because the panel allegedly violated rule of the commercial arbitration rules of the american arbitration association rule and the functus officio doctrine,the panel manifestly disregarded the law,and the appealed awards are completely irrational.they also appeal the award of attorney fees and costs.
rule provides that t he arbitrator is not empowered to redetermine the merits of any claim already decided.this rule essentially codifies the common law doctrine of functus officio,which forbids an arbitrator to redetermine an issue which he has already decided.mcclatchy newspapers central valley typographical union,cir quoting la vale plaza,noonan,cir.we include both rule and functus officio in our references to functus officio.
before determining whether the arbitrators violated the functus officio doctrine,we must first address a threshold question whether or not the functus officio doctrine may be applied to an interim award.this is a question of first impression in our circuit.
the eighth circuit has held that an interim award may be deemed final for functus officio purposes if the award states it is final,and if the arbitrator intended the award to be final.see,legion ins.vcw,cir.we adopt the criteria used by the eighth circuit,and apply them to the instant case.
only interim award satisfies the criteria for finality.the panel explicitly stated that interim awards,and were not final.furthermore,as the district court correctly found,the panel expressly reserved jurisdiction over all issues with the exception of the accounting performed in award until issuance of the final award.of the five interim awards,only award was expressly made final.thus,only award may be deemed final for purposes of the functus officio doctrine.
under either rule or the functus officio doctrine,bosack and lerner argument boils down to the same core contention they contend the panel exceeded its authority by redetermining the merits of award in award.they claim that in award,the panel ruled that soward remained a partner in cartesian through september.they argue that the panel ignored and contradicted this ruling in award by finding that soward ceased being a cartesian partner in november.
bosack and lerner mischaracterize the scope of award.the finding that soward remained a partner was made in award,not in award in awards and,the panel determined that the wood agreement controlled the cartesian partnership,and determined that an accounting was required to determine the value of soward partnership interest.award was limited in scope its only purpose was to determine the value of soward interest in cartesian,according to the terms of the wood agreement.
in award,the panel ruled on soward claims for breach of fiduciary duty and for conversion the panel did not revisit its decision in award or modify the accounting or its determination of the value of soward partnership interest.the panel did not redetermine the merits of award.accordingly,neither the functus officio doctrine nor rule applies.
bosack and lerner also contend that awards and were issued in manifest disregard of the law.
section a of the faa provides that a court may vacate an award where the arbitrators exceeded their powers.a.arbitrators exc
