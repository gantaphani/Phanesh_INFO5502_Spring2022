central laborers pension fund clpf appeals the district court dismissal with prejudice of its securities fraud complaint against integrated electrical services ies and several of ies executive officers for failure to meet the heightened pleading standards of the private securities litigation reform act pslra.we affirm.
facts and proceedings 
during the class period ies,a company,provided electrical contracting services in the united states through a network of more than subsidiary companies.despite its extensive use of subsidiaries,which were managed regionally,ies held itself out as an integrated company and filed consolidated financial statements.
starting in april,ies made various statements expressing confidence in the company financial status,and over the next months the company stock price generally increased.in early august,ies publicly disclosed that it could not release its quarterly earnings numbers on time due to an ongoing evaluation of certain projects.later in august,the company acknowledged that material weaknesses in the company internal controls might require restatement of prior financial figures.ultimately,ies restated its financial results for three periods fiscal year,fiscal year,and the first two quarters of fiscal year.
in june,plaintiff clpf,a stockholder,filed a consolidated amended class action complaint cac against ies,its president and ceo herbert allen,and two men who served as the company cfo at different times,william reynolds and jeffrey pugh,alleging violations of sections b and a of the securities exchange act b a,as well as rule promulgated thereunder.the cac alleges that a number of false or misleading statements by ies regarding the company financial condition caused an artificial inflation in the market price of ies securities during the class period the allegedly false and misleading statements were distributed publicly through press releases,sec filings,and company investment profiles,which were reports providing analysis about the company.
the defendants moved to dismiss the cac under rules b and b of the federal rules of civil procedure,arguing,inter alia,that the cac did not meet the pleading requirements of the pslra.clpf opposed the motion and included in its response a request to amend the cac if the court deemed it insufficient to avoid dismissal.the district court granted the motion and dismissed the cac with prejudice,implicitly refusing to grant clpf leave to amend.specifically,the court found that the cac did not meet the particularity requirement as to scienter.
clpf timely appealed and raised two arguments.clpf argues that the cac allegations of scienter were articulated with sufficient particularity to defeat a motion to dismiss.second,clpf urges that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to permit amendment of the cac.
ii.standards of review and applicable legal standards 
motion to dismiss 
we review de novo a district court dismissal of a complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b.see nathenson zonagen,cir.we must accept all facts alleged in the complaint as true and must construe the allegations in the light that is most favorable to the plaintiff.plotkin ip axess,cir.nevertheless,w e do not accept as true conclusory allegations,unwarranted factual inferences,or legal conclusions.id.
in order t o state a claim under b and rule,a plaintiff must allege,in connection with the purchase or sale of securities a misstatement or an omission of material fact made with scienter on which plaintiff relied that proximately injured him.fin.acquisition partners lp blackwell,cir second and third alterations in original internal quotation omitted.
under the pslra,a plaintiff alleging securities fraud must plead the substantive elements of the violation with particularity.id.at.the pslra appears to comport with this court relatively strict interpretation of rule b,which requires a plaintiff to specify the statements contended to be fraudulent,identify the speaker,state when and where the statements were made,and explain why the statements were fraudulent.abc arbitrage plaintiffs group tchuruk,cir internal quotation omitted.t he pslra specifically provides in b that,if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief,the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.id.internal quotation omitted.failure to do so results in dismissal of the complaint.id.
in any private action arising under the pslra in which the plaintiff may recover money damages only on proof that the defendant acted with a particular state of mind,the complaint shall,with respect to each act or omission alleged to violate this chapter,state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.
b.section b and rule violations require proof that the defendant acted with scienter,which means either intent or severe recklessness.blackwell,at.severe recklessness is 
limited to those highly unreasonable omissions or misrepresentations that involve not merely simple or even inexcusable negligence,but an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care,and that present a danger of misleading buyers or sellers which is either known to the defendant or is so obvious that the defendant must have been aware of it.
nathenson,at internal quotation omitted.
the pslra did not,however,generally alter the substance of the scienter requirement for section b and rule claims.see goldstein mci worldcom,cir.this court also does not require a plaintiff to present direct evidence of scienter in order to withstand dismissal of his securities claims.allegations of circumstantial evidence justifying a strong inference of scienter will suffice.id.at.
furthermore,t he pleading standard does not license us to resolve disputed facts at this stage of the case.barrie,cir.it does,however,permit the court to engage in some weighing of the allegations to determine whether the inferences toward scienter are strong or weak.see rosenzweig azurix,cir.importantly,the supreme court recently stated that t o determine whether the plaintiff has alleged facts that give rise to the requisite strong inference of scienter,a court must consider plausible nonculpable explanations for the defendant conduct,as well as inferences favoring the plaintiff.tellabs,makor issues rights,d.the court provided that t he inference that the defendant acted with scienter need not be irrefutable,of the genre,or even the most plausible of competing inferences yet the inference of scienter must be more than merely reasonable or must be cogent and compelling,thus strong in light of other explanations.id.internal citations and quotations omitted.accordingly,the court held that a complaint will survive a motion to dismiss only if a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.id.
refusal to permit amendment 
this court reviews the district court refusal to grant leave to amend the complaint for abuse of discretion.see goldstein,at.federal rule of civil procedure favors permitting amendment the district court discretion,therefore,must be considered in this context.see rosenzweig,at.
iii.discussion 
motion to dismiss for failure to plead scienter with sufficient particularity 
clpf contends that it pleaded scienter with sufficient particularity to avoid dismissal based on a holistic examination of the various allegations taken in the light most favorable to it.clpf alleged insider trading,gaap violations,failure to fix an accounting error,the making of false statements about internal controls,and pervasive knowledge of accounting problems throughout ies.
this court must examine these allegations in toto when determining whether clpf adequately pleaded scienter.barrie,at.
gaap violations,public statements,and restatement of financials 
the cac describes ies alleged gaap violations in detail.clpf urges that its assertions in the cac regarding the accounting errors and internal controls at ies serve as strong circumstantial evidence of,at a mi
