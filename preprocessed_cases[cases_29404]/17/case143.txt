an insolvent internet company involved in an illegal ponzi scheme used its financial statements,compiled by its accounting firm,to attract investors.after the company spent the investors money and incurred millions more in debt,it filed for bankruptcy.a bankruptcy trustee was appointed,and he sued the accounting firm,along with the partner responsible for compiling the financial statements,for,among other things,malpractice and deepening insolvency.the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants on both claims.
we affirm.the malpractice claim founders on two grounds the company was not harmed by its accountants actions,and in any event the affidavit submitted to support the claim was a sham.as for the claim,allegations of negligent conduct do not qualify for consideration.
factual background and procedural history 
citx becomes insolvent 
bernard roemmele formed citx corporation,in as an internet company of sorts.roemmele took immediate opportunity to pillage citx for starters,he used its money to license his own intellectual property,to cover one of his debts,and to settle one of his lawsuits 
in,citx linked up with professional resources systems international,prsi,ostensibly to create an internet shopping mall for merchants who would pay a fee to be featured.citx used this prsi the help of a phenomenon called the internet sell equity in itself.as it happened,prsi was a fraudulent enterprise,and citx stock sales were illegal under federal and pennsylvania law.prsi scammed nearly from online merchants,and citx received approximately of this money.the florida attorney general shut down prsi in january,and a receiver was appointed for it.
prsi was citx only significant client,and at the time prsi was closed it owed citx over.in citx compiled financials,this was all that was keeping the company theoretically in the black.because citx showed a positive balance sheet,it was able to sell more securities for over,which it proceeded to burn through in a year and a half.citx apparently spent much of the money in fruitless litigation against prsi receiver.
in july,citx filed a chapter petition.the case was later converted to chapter,and gary seitz was appointed as trustee 
schoen and detweiler compile the financials 
the in this case are robert schoen,a certified public accountant,and detweiler,hershey and associates,schoen employer.in,citx retained detweiler and schoen to its financial statements.seitz alleges that went beyond its written engagement agreement and that it missed many red flags at citx.these alleged red flags included that citx bookkeeper was actually bernard roemmele girlfriend,and a high school dropout citx was bouncing checks it was insolvent,without the prsi receivable,it had virtually no income prsi had been shut down and yet citx was selling stock to the public.
detweiler prepared citx financial statements for the period from july,through december.there were two sets of statements,both of which were compilations,as was made plain at the beginning of each statement.the first statement covered the fiscal years ending june,and june,the second covered the period ending december.the second statement included the prsi receivable and was accompanied by a note that said in full 
in january,the company,along with its largest customer and several individuals,were named as defendants and charged with certain security violations by the attorney general office in florida.as of the date of these financial statements,the company is not sure what impact,if any,these charges will have on its financial position.as of december,the financial statements reflect accounts receivable in the amount of from this customer and related deferred revenues in the amount of 
this second financial statement,from which stems this suit,was taken to a february citx shareholder meeting.even with its weakened financial condition and in suspect circumstances at least one shareholder had by this time decided that the company was a ponzi scheme,citx was still able to raise more than in equity.the company thereby prolonged its existence and went on to accrue millions of dollars in debt.
seitz sues detweiler 
seitz sued detweiler in july.his complaint contained four causes of action malpractice deepening insolvency breach of fiduciary duty and negligent misrepresentation.the bankruptcy court dismissed seitz fiduciary duty claim.later,after withdrawing the reference to the bankruptcy court of this adversary proceeding,the district court granted summary judgment to detweiler on the negligent misrepresentation claim.finally,the district court granted summary judgment to detweiler on seitz malpractice and claims.seitz appeals only the ruling on the latter two claims.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction over this case under and.we have jurisdiction under because this is an appeal from a final order.
we exercise plenary review of a district court grant of summary judgment.huu nam tran metro.life ins,cir.in so doing,we apply the same test as the district court we therefore decide whether there is a genuine issue of material fact and,if not,whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.internal quotation marks omitted.we also view the facts in the light most favorable to the party against whom summary judgment was entered.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
iii.discussion 
was summary judgment correctly granted on the malpractice claim 
to survive summary judgment on his malpractice claim,seitz must present sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable jury to find in his favor.see anderson liberty lobby,d.e.pennsylvania recognizes professional malpractice claims on a theory of negligence.see guy liederbach.thus,seitz must establish that detweiler owed a duty to citx,detweiler breached that duty citx was actually harmed,and detweiler breach caused that harm.see martin evans.
seitz must establish harm to citx actual loss or damage to support a negligence action.id.he alleges harm to it in the form of deepening insolvency that detweiler dramatically deepened the insolvency of citx,and wrongfully expanded the debt of citx and waste of its illegally raised capital,by permitting citx to incur additional debt by virtue of the compilation statements prepared and relied upon by third parties.compl.
this requires us to decide whether deepening insolvency is a viable theory of damages for negligence as opposed to whether it is a viable cause of topic dealt with in section b below.our only opinion to address deepening insolvency,official committee of unsecured creditors lafferty,cir,defined it,in predicting pennsylvania law,as an injury to a debtor corporate property from the fraudulent expansion of corporate debt and prolongation of corporate life.id.at.in that opinion,we concluded that deepening insolvency was a valid pennsylvania cause of action.id.at.although we did describe deepening insolvency as a type of injury,id.at,and a theory of injury,id.at,we never held that it was a valid theory of damages for an independent cause of action.those statements in lafferty were in the context of a cause of action.they should not be interpreted to create a novel theory of damages for an independent cause of action like malpractice 
also,we note that seitz did not provide sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable jury to find harm.assuming for the sake of argument that detweiler financial statements allowed citx to raise over,that did nothing to deepen citx insolvency.it did the opposite.sabin willett,the shallows of deepening insolvency,bus.law,discussing loans.before the equity infusion,citx was in the red using round numbers for ease of discussion.with the added investment,it was thereby insolvent only.insolvency decreased rather than deepened.any later increase in insolvency,the several million dollars of debt incurred after the investment was wrought by citx management,not by detweiler.
the crux,then,is the claim that the equity investment allowed citx to exist long enough for its management to incur millions more in debt.but that looks at the issue through hindsight bias.as noted,the equity investment was hardly
