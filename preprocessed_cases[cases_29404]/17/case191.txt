background procedural 
the facts giving rise to this litigation began in when shardar khan and mohammed halipoto,american citizens and natives of pakistan,decided to build the first hydrogen peroxide plant in pakistan.to accomplish this goal,khan and halipoto formed two companies.the first was united international,a partnership established under texas law,and the second was tcl,a subsidiary of united international and a corporation formed under pakistani law.tcl was later converted to a public entity,with the khan and halipoto each owning of the stock of the company.
tcl obtained financing for the project from the industrial development bank of pakistan idbp and the investment corporation of pakistan icp.as security for the loans,the following assets were pledged the proposed chemical plant,of tcl stock,and the personal guarantees of khan and halipoto.between and,the loans to tcl totaled approximately million.tcl contracted with cmc to build the plant in pakistan.the contract between cmc and tcl contained a provision mandating arbitration of any disputes in houston,texas.in,and halipoto filed for personal bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code in the southern district of texas.they were granted a partial discharge in august,but the case remained open so the trustee could administer and sell property of the estate.in,after disputes arose concerning the building of the plant,tcl and cmc submitted their claims for arbitration in houston.tcl hired the houston law firm,beck,redden,secrest brs to represent them in the arbitration proceeding,which was scheduled to begin in june.on june,cmc initiated an adversary proceeding in the halipotos bankruptcy case against tcl,the khans,the halipotos,and the halipotos bankruptcy trustee,arguing that the arbitration involved property of the halipotos estate,that tcl,khan,and halipotos,and khan exercised unauthorized control over the estate property,and that the arbitration provision in the contract between tcl and cmc was fraudulent because cmc was not aware of the halipotos pending bankruptcy.the bankruptcy court refused cmc request to stay arbitration.
on august,the arbitration panel awarded more than million to tcl.tcl then immediately filed suit in the southern district of texas to confirm and enforce the arbitration award.cmc challenged the court subject matter jurisdiction,but the district court rejected this argument and confirmed the award.see in re arbitration between trans chem.and china mach.import export.the parties appealed to this court,which affirmed,stating simply we agree with the district court analysis of these issues and therefore adopt parts of its careful and comprehensive opinion.trans chem.china import and export,cir.
while these matters were pending before the district court and court of appeals,tcl defaulted on its loans from the idbp and icp in pakistan.in april,an attorney for the idbp sent a letter of default to the khans and halipotos.the khans allege that they never received that letter because it was improperly addressed.on may,idbp initiated foreclosure proceedings against tcl in pakistan to collect on unpaid loans totaling more than million.the pakistani court issued an interim attachment of tcl property.the khans again allege that they never received notice of this proceeding because the address used on court documents was not the khans proper address.
in september,brs,the attorneys for tcl,wrote the idbp and thanked them for contacting khan and halipoto regarding the outstanding loan balance.the letter further requested the bank indulgence while tcl attempted to collect on the arbitration award against cmc.
in december,the pakistani court affirmed its interim attachment of tcl property and directed the sale of the company assets.that order also contained an incorrect address for the khans and halipotos.advertisements were placed in pakistani newspapers to announce the sale of the plant.on june,new orient international limited new orient offered to buy the plant,contingent on all of tcl equity shares being assigned as well.however,the khans and halipotos had pledged only of their shares in tcl to secure the loans so the bank had to take additional measures to complete the sale.
thereafter,on july,icp wrote khan at the correct address and notified her that icp planned to auction tcl shares of stock pledged as collateral if the debt was not timely paid.the letter further stated that if the sale of these shares was insufficient to satisfy the loan,the bank would then proceed to sell the khans personal property,including the shares not pledged,under the personal guaranty signed by the khans at the time the loans were extended.a week later,idbp moved the pakistani court to cancel the outstanding shares of stock in tcl.on july,khan wrote a pakistani attorney to engage his services to prevent the sale of his shares in tcl.the attorney subsequently declined representation,stating that tcl problems with the banks requires immediate and time consuming attention which we are not in a position to provide.
the khans reportedly continued to contact the idbp and icp,but to no avail.on november,the pakistani court issued an order cancelling their shares of tcl and directing that they be to new orient.the following month,cmc advised the district court in houston that it had received from new orient notice of a change in ownership of tcl.new orient also contacted brs to inform the firm of the change in ownership.new orient requested that brs cease dealing with the khans and halipotos rather,new orient asserted that it had the right to collect the arbitration award directly from cmc.new orient then brought an action in beijing,china to enforce the arbitration award against cmc.
at this point,the halipotos bankruptcy trustee,who had learned of new orient involvement with the case,moved for an injunction in the bankruptcy court to prevent cmc from negotiating settlement of the arbitration award outside the bankruptcy proceeding.on january,the bankruptcy court held a hearing,in which khan testified regarding the loss of his shares and his discussions with idbp and icp.khan further testified about the incorrect addresses on the documents filed with the pakistani court and his lack of notice of that court decision.at the conclusion of the hearing,bankruptcy judge karen brown granted the injunction.she found that the pakistani proceeding to cancel the shares was done ex parte and that the addresses for the khans and halipotos were either incorrect or were no longer used by the shareholders.further,she found that the banks knew of the shareholders current addresses,but intentionally failed to include this in their petitions to the pakistani court.judge brown found that the transaction was designed to defeat the protections of tcl interests in the arbitration award,as determined by the district court.she then ordered that the amount of the award be placed into the registry of the court and enjoined cmc from proceeding with other litigation until the rights of the parties could be determined.
in march,the khans filed a request with the court in pakistan to vacate the foreclosure.however,two months later,the khans withdrew the request,claiming that it was without prejudice to their rights to agitate the matter at any other stage.
despite the bankruptcy court injunction,new orient continued to pursue cmc for collection of the arbitration award in china because they could not find any of cmc assets in the united states even after the court appointed a receiver to search for cmc assets in the united states.cmc also refused to comply with the court order to deposit the funds in the registry of the court.as a result,the district court imposed sanctions against cmc by august,those penalties amounted to more than million.
in november,the beijing court granted new orient motion to enforce the arbitration award and ordered cmc to transfer the full amount to new orient bank account in beijing.this was done,and tcl has been paid the amounts due under the arbitration award.in may,tcl and cmc filed a joint motion to dismiss the district court case in houston.new orient then filed a disputed motion to substitute counsel for brs.brs was seeking to intervene in the matter to collect its contingency fees on the litigation proceeds and enforce their attorney lien on the judgment.
ten days after brs moved to intervene,the khans filed their motion to intervene and opposed the motions to substitute counsel and dismiss the proceedings.thereafter,in august,the halipotos,individually and through their bankruptcy trustee,filed motions to intervene.the district court granted brs intervention and motion for substitution of counsel and denied the motions to intervene filed by the khans and halipotos,individually.the court granted the trustee motion because the trustee had secured an injunction in the bankruptcy court to prohibit exactly the type of action that had occurred in this case.the court then denied the joint motion to dismiss,finding that the settlement between new orient and cmc was a direct violation of the bankruptcy court order.
the khans then filed a motion to reconsider,which was partially granted to permit intervention on the khans claims for expenses.however,the court denied the motion in all other respects,but stated that its denial was without prejudice to being if the bankruptcy court denies the khans a forum as to the issue of the khans interest in shares of tcl.during the hearing on the motion,the district judge told the khans that if they were not satisfied with the bankruptcy court ruling,they could appeal that matter to him otherwise,the district court found that the dispute should be resolved before the bankruptcy court.the khans sought to appeal this ruling,but this court affirmed,stating simply we affirm for essentially the same reasons stated by the able district court.trans chemical,china mach.import and export,cir.june,per curiam unpublished.this court found that the appeal was essentially premature because the district court indicated its willingness to entertain the motion again after the bankruptcy court had ruled.
the bankruptcy court thereafter entered an order of civil contempt against cmc and new.the parties subsequently entered a settlement agreement for contingent on the bankruptcy court abstaining from deciding the khans ownership interest.in the order approving compromise and settlement,entered october,the bankruptcy court stated 
upon the trustee receipt of the cash settlement payment,the trustee,tcl and cmc agree and stipulate and the court finds and concludes as follows 
a.the arbitration award entered in favor of tcl is a corporate asset of tcl and is not an asset of any shareholder of tcl,including but not limited to any person,trust,corporation,or other entity,and the ownership of tcl shares does not entitle any individual shareholder to any direct claim for relief or damages for any action or inaction regarding the arbitration award.
b.the resolution of all remaining issues regarding the ownership of tcl and its assets i is a matter of pakistan law ii no longer involves the trustee or the bankruptcy estate iii requires the presence of parties not currently before the bankruptcy court and iv is a matter on which the court will abstain in favor of a court of competent jurisdiction,including the courts of pakistan,with jurisdiction over all of the necessary parties.
on december,judge brown then entered an order dismissing and closing adversary proceeding,which stated that all matters between the trustee,tcl and cmc have been resolved.the court shall abstain with respect to all remaining matters.the khans took no action with regard to these rulings from the bankruptcy court.on december,the district court dismissed the claims of the trustee and estate against tcl and cmc.
on december,the khans moved for leave to file an amended complaint in intervention again seeking to litigate the issue of tcl corporate ownership.on february,the district court issued a written order and reasons denying the khans motion for leave to file an amended complaint in intervention.the district court found that the bankruptcy court holding in the order approving compromise and settlement did not deny the khans a forum rather,it found that the courts of pakistan were an appropriate forum.the judge further noted that this decision would have to stand because the khans had not appealed that decision or the bankruptcy court decision to abstain in favor of a court of competent jurisdiction.the court further concluded that the khans made a knowing decision to form a pakistani corporation and borrow from a pakistani bank.the court expressed its reluctance to these matters when the other parties to the pakistani proceeding were not before the district court.finally,the court concluded that t he khans have known since that the pakistani courts canceled their shares.if they thought that the pakistani court was wrong,they should have sought relief in pakistan.it is from this order that the khans take this appeal.
ii.whether the district court order was a final order for the purposes of appellate jurisdiction 
the khans appeal from the district court order denying leave to file an amended complaint in intervention.however,the parties briefed the issue,and the district court considered the issue,as a complaint in intervention,rather than one seeking leave to amend.accordingly,this court will similarly construe the district court order as denying a complaint in intervention.
before reaching the merits of this appeal,this court must first determine whether it has jurisdiction to hear this appeal.rule of the federal rules of civil procedure defines two types of intervention intervention of right rule a and permissive intervention rule b.appellate jurisdiction over orders denying relief under rule varies depending on whether relief is sought under rule a or rule b.because the khans assert they are entitled to either intervention of right or permissive intervention,this court must consider its jurisdiction in each context.
this court clearly has appellate jurisdiction from the denial of a motion to intervene as of right.see edwards city of houston,cir en banc.however,if a motion for permissive intervention is denied,this court operates under an anomalous rule that provides jurisdiction only to consider whether the district court abused its discretion denying the motion.id.if it did,the court retains jurisdiction and must reverse if it did not,the court must dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.id.
iii.standard of review 
as noted above,this court must determine whether the khans were entitled to either intervention of right or permissive intervention.this court reviews de novo denials of intervention of right.id.at.orders denying permissive intervention are reviewed for clear abuse of discretion and will be reversed only if extraordinary circumstances are shown.id.
iv.whether the district court erred in denying the khan motion for leave to amend their complaint in intervention as a matter of right.
rule of the federal rules of civil procedure states that intervention of right is to be permitted upon timely application when the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action and the applicant is so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the applicant ability to protect that interest,unless the applicant interest is adequately represented by existing parties.fed.civ.a.timeliness of
