hal hicks leased trailers to midwest transit,midwest while he was the president,a director,and a majority shareholder of the company.shortly thereafter a receiver was appointed by an illinois state court to protect midwest from various breaches of fiduciary duties alleged against hicks in a shareholders derivative lawsuit.the receiver refused to pay hicks on the leases,arguing that they were invalid under the illinois director conflict of interest statute.
while this litigation was ongoing in state court,hicks lender filed suit in federal court to foreclose on loans it made to finance hicks purchase of the trailers.hicks against midwest and the receiver on a variety of contract law theories.hicks then settled with his lender and the litigation was stayed pending the outcome of the litigation.the district court eventually dismissed most of hicks claims on summary judgment after concluding he failed to comply with the requirements of the illinois director conflict of interest statute the parties settled the claim that survived summary judgment.hicks now appeals,and we affirm.
background 
this case has a complex procedural history in both state and federal court.when the events that ultimately led to this lawsuit began in early,hicks was president,one of two directors,and a shareholder of midwest transit,a closely held company with its principal place of business in illinois.midwest is in the business of providing trailers to the postal service.two other individuals,michael witters and diane witters,were each stockholders of midwest diane was also the other director.in january the witters initiated a shareholders derivative lawsuit in illinois state court to have hicks removed from office based on a host of financial misconduct allegations,including personally purchasing and then leasing trailers to midwest at inflated rates since.on april,the state court entered a temporary restraining order prohibiting midwest from transferring any money to hicks other than amounts due on existing trailer leases.
shortly thereafter,on may and july,hicks secured two loans from general electric capital business asset funding corporation ge capital,a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in washington,to purchase more trailers.hicks granted ge capital a security interest in the trailers,and midwest guaranteed the loans in agreements signed by its secretary,who was neither a director nor a shareholder.the total amount of the loans was,which broke down to payments of per trailer per month.for reasons uncertain,the trailers were titled in midwest name even though hicks paid for them hicks then leased the trailers to midwest in two lease agreements dated june and july,again signed by midwest secretary.under those leases,midwest agreed to pay hicks per trailer per month for three years hicks then planned to pay ge capital the additional per trailer due on the loans it is undisputed that michael and diane witters did not participate in or approve any of these transactions.
on july,the state court appointed donald hoagland as interim receiver of midwest based on findings of misconduct,including large sums paid to hicks for trailers leased by him to the corporation.hoagland then dismissed hicks from midwest and ceased paying him for the trailers still in midwest possession.hicks brought a motion in state court in october to order midwest to pay on the leases or return the trailers to hicks.hoagland refused to pay hicks,arguing both that the trailers were titled in midwest name and that the leases violated the illinois director conflict of interest statute.comp.stat,which requires authorization from a majority of disinterested shareholders or directors when an interested director seeks to engage in a business transaction with the corporation.the state court denied hicks motion on grounds that both title to the trailers and the legitimacy of the leases remained in dispute.the court further instructed hoagland to maintain possession of the trailers pending resolution of the dispute and suggested that midwest send the payments directly to ge capital,which midwest did from december through june.hicks failed to make any payments to ge capital between july and february.
on february,ge capital filed suit in the southern district of illinois against hicks,midwest,and hoagland seeking to foreclose on the loans,obtain possession of the trailers,and recover money due hicks admitted ge capital allegations but against midwest and hoagland on a number of theories arising out of midwest continued possession of the trailers and failure to make lease payments to hicks.those claims,all governed by illinois law,included two counts of breach of lease,indemnification and contribution,quantum meruit,conversion,a petition to quiet title,and tortious interference with a business contract.the district court exercised supplemental jurisdiction over hicks pursuant to a.hicks subsequently settled with ge capital by paying off the amount due,after which the loans were reinstated.
as the litigation continued,the district court concluded that hicks had the superior right to possession of the trailers and on july,ordered midwest to return all trailers to hicks by july.midwest was slow in complying and failed to return some trailers until late august,prompting a motion from hicks for contempt damages.the court granted hicks motion and referred the case to a magistrate judge to determine the appropriate amount of damages.contempt damages were assessed in two first for costs resulting from the delay in returning the trailers,for which hicks was awarded,and the second for repairs necessitated by the condition in which the trailers were returned,for an amount to be determined with the aid of a special master.on august and november,the magistrate judge entered orders setting forth how the phase two damages determination would proceed and stating that i n the event the court does not award hicks damages for items claimed in hicks pending motion,hicks reserves the right to seek any such uncompensated damages to the trailers,costs for repair or other elements of damage in the underlying case.the phase two damages proceedings concluded with an order entered on march,stating that the parties had agreed to settle for a lump sum payment of.
soon after this settlement,hicks submitted discovery requests to midwest in an attempt to facilitate a claim for additional compensation for physical damages to the trailers based on the reservation of rights language found in the august and november,orders.midwest objected on grounds that further compensation was precluded by the march,settlement,which purported to cover all physical damages.the magistrate judge agreed and issued another order concluding that hicks had settled all claims for physical damages to the trailers in the march agreement and could pursue no further discovery.
in the meantime,hicks filed a motion for summary judgment on some of his.with no objection from midwest,the district court granted hicks claim to quiet title to the trailers.the remaining claims were then stayed pending resolution of the derivative suit.shortly after the litigation concluded and the stay was lifted,midwest and hicks filed for summary judgment on all remaining claims except quantum meruit.midwest contended that hicks leases were invalid under the illinois director conflict of interest statute because the witters did not authorize either lease and because the leases did not reflect fair market value.hicks argued that hoagland had implicitly validated the leases by maintaining possession of and continuing to use the trailers after he was appointed receiver.hicks also submitted an affidavit stating that the fair market value of postal trailers ranges from to a month.on september,the district court granted summary judgment to midwest on all claims except quantum meruit.the court concluded that hoagland had not validated the leases by retaining the trailers because he had continuously challenged their validity and only maintained possession under the direction of the state court,and that hicks had failed to carry his burden of coming forward with evidence to create a triable issue of fact on the fairness of the leases under the illinois statute.
the parties then agreed to settle the quantum meruit claim for a lump sum that broke down to per trailer per month for midwest unpaid use.hicks now appeals the summary judgment dismissing his claims for breach of lease,indemnification and contribution,conversion,and tortious interference with a business contract in hopes of recovering the monetary difference between the leases and the quantum meruit settlement he also appeals the district court denial of his discovery request aimed at securing additional recovery for physical damage to the trailers.
ii.discussion 
we review a district court entry of summary judgment de novo,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.experian info.solutions,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.although the moving party bears the burden of proving that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,the nonmoving party retains the burden of producing enough evidence to support a reasonable jury verdict in its favor,at.
applicability of the illinois statute 
hicks first two claims are for breach of lease based on illinois contract law.the district court granted summary judgment for midwest on these claims on the basis of the illinois director conflict of interest statute,which states in relevant part 
a if a transaction is fair to a corporation at the time it is authorized,approved,or ratified,the fact that a director of the corporation is directly or indirectly a party to the transaction is not grounds for invalidating the transaction or the director vote regarding the transaction provided,however,that in a proceeding contesting the validity of such a transaction,the person asserting validity has the burden of proving fairness unless 
the material facts of the transaction and the director interest or relationship were disclosed or known to the board of directors or a committee of the board and the board or committee authorized,approved or ratified the transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of disinterested directors,even though the disinterested directors be less than a quorum or 
the material facts of the transaction and the director interest or relationship were disclosed or known to the shareholders entitled to vote and they authorized,approved or ratified the transaction without counting the vote of any shareholder who is an interested director.
comp.stat.a.it is undisputed that midwest other two shareholders,one of whom was also the only other director,did not authorize the leases with hicks.rather,at the time hicks and midwest entered into the leases,the witters had already initiated their derivative suit challenging hicks authority to enter into precisely these kinds of leases.according to the statute,hicks,as the person asserting the validity of the leases,has the burden of proving their fairness.
on appeal,hicks makes two threshold arguments challenging the applicability of the statute.first,he claims the statute can only be used offensively by a corporation challenging the director accused of profiting from the interested transaction,in a derivative lawsuit.we initially note that hicks did not make this argument in the district court,and arguments not raised before the district court are waived on appeal.see,belom futures ass n,cir.the argument is meritless in any event.the statute provides that in a proceeding contesting the validity of an interested transaction,the person asserting validity has the burden of proving fairness,a the statute does not limit the proceedings in which it may be invoked,nor is there any language limiting its applicability to suits brought by the corporation against the interested director.nothing in the statute suggests it is inapplicable as a defense against the validity of a transaction in the context of a claim.hicks has not identified a single illinois case supporting his proposed interpretation of the statute.accordingly,we conclude the statute is applicable as a defense as well as a ground for attacking a transaction.
hicks alternatively argues that midwest is bound by the leases regardless of their validity because hoagland kept and continued to use the trailers after his appointment as receiver.hicks relies upon toushin gonsky,d,but the case is factually distinguishable from this one.the receiver in toushin had challenged the validity of two movie theater leases on the ground that the shareholder who had signed on behalf of the closely held company lacked sufficient authority due to a pending action for accounting and dissolution.while this action was pending,the receiver retained possession of the theaters without making lease payments and did not respond to letters from the lessee informing him that rent payments were outstanding.id.at.the receiver also treated the leases as valid in reports to the court,which included amounts for rent due on the leases as unpaid bills.id.at.
on the foregoing facts,the illinois appellate court concluded that a lthough the receiver challenged the validity of the leases based on the alleged agent authority to bind the corporation,the continued possession o r use of the premises was an election to adopt the lease.without reaching the merits of the issue of the validity of the leases,it is clear that rent and other charges have accrued for the period of the receivership.id.emphasis added.the court further held that i f the receiver remains in possession beyond a reasonable time to make the election to adopt or challenge a lease made prior to his appointment,he elects to adopt the lease by implication,and is bound by its terms.id.
toushin thus establishes that under illinois law,a receiver implied acceptance of a lease may trump the lease invalidity in some circumstances.but the circumstances here are very different.in toushin,the receiver treated the leases as valid during the time in which he failed to make payments,and he did not challenge their validity until a court action was brought to repossess the theaters.moreover,the validity of the leases in toushin had nothing to do with the underlying litigation that led to the receiver appointment.here,in contrast,the challenge to the validity of the leases was not only in existence when hoagland took over as receiver,but hicks practice of entering into insider leases was actually one of the reasons for the appointment of a receiver in the first place.see witters hicks,d,listing as a reason for appointment that hicks leasing of trailers owned by him to midwest constituted a conflict of interest as set forth in section.
moreover,when hicks initially challenged midwest failure to pay the leases,the state court directed midwest not to return the trailers and suggested that midwest make lease payments directly to ge capital until ownership of the trailers and the validity of the leases could be determined.at the october,hearing on hicks motion,the court specifically noted w e have the validity of the leases themselves in controversy.the burden of proof is on hicks to show that these were entered into fairly,and that is something we take up at trial.
accordingly,unlike in the receiver in toushin,hoagland never accepted the validity of the hicks leases and challenged them from the moment he learned of their existence.in addition,at the time of hoagland actions,there was legitimate confusion regarding whether hicks or midwest was the rightful owner of the trailers,so hoagland was under no clear duty to return or pay for the trailers.this was,as we have noted,one of the factors cited by the state court in its conclusion that midwest should make payments directly to ge capital instead of to hicks.it is abundantly clear that hoagland never acted in a manner that would support a conclusion that he adopted the leases by implication.
