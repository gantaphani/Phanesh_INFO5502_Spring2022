this appeal is before the court a second time,after our previous decision,cir,reversing the dismissal of the suit by the district court on the defendants motion to dismiss,was itself reversed by the supreme court,d.the court remanded the case to us with directions to consider whether the plaintiffs allegations of securities fraud in violation of section b of the securities exchange act of,b,and sec rule,create the strong inference of scienter,as defined by the supreme court in its opinion,that the private securities litigation reform act of requires for the complaint to survive a motion to dismiss.
rule forbids a company or an individual to make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading.b.but liability requires proof of the defendant scienter,which is to say proof that he either knew the statement was false or was reckless in disregarding a substantial risk that it was false.higginbotham baxter international,cir.a popular definition of recklessness in this context is an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care to the extent that the danger was either known to the defendant or so obvious that the defendant must have been aware of it.in re scholastic.securities litigation,cir,quoting rolf blyth,eastman dillon,cir.this looks like two of the risk and how big the risk as a practical matter it is only one because knowledge is inferable from gravity the danger was either known to the defendant or so obvious that the defendant must have been aware of it.when the facts known to a person place him on notice of a risk,he can not ignore the facts and plead ignorance of the risk,illinois tool works,cir sec jakubowski,cir.
a complication introduced by the private securities litigation reform act is that actual knowledge of falsity,not merely indifference to the danger that a statement is false,is required for liability for or speculations about the future.c b ii see helwig vencor,cir.this has implications for pleading,since the strong inference that must be drawn to avoid dismissal can not be an inference merely of recklessness if predictions are challenged as fraudulent.the fact that all the statements challenged in this case that we found in our earlier opinion to be materially false are in the present tense is not decisive on the question whether the statements include predictions our earnings are certain to double is in the present tense,but is a prediction.but a mixed statement is not entitled to the safe harbor with respect to the part of the statement that refers to the present.when tellabs told the world that sales of its system were still going strong,it was saying both that current sales were strong and that they would continue to be so,at least for a time,since the statement would be misleading if tellabs knew that its sales were about to collapse.the element of prediction in saying that sales are still going strong does not entitle tellabs to a safe harbor with regard to the statement representation concerning current sales.
section b of the reform act requires that the plaintiff complaint state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind,b,that is,with scienter.but except with regard to statements,the act does not specify the required state of mind,so it remains the concept of scienter developed before the act.nathenson zonagen,cir helwig vencor,supra,at.in our previous opinion,we ruled that the plaintiffs had adequately pleaded not only that the defendants had made materially false statements but also that they had acted with the required scienter.the first ruling was not disturbed by the supreme court and is the law of the case,controlling our present consideration.the second ruling was not reversed,but the supreme court disagreed with this court interpretation of strong inference of scienter and directed us to dismiss the complaint unless a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.at footnote omitted.the plaintiff must plead facts rendering an inference of scienter at least as likely as any plausible opposing inference.id.at emphasis in original.so first the inference must be cogent,and second it must be as cogent as the opposing inference,that is,the inference of lack of scienter.
to judges raised on notice pleading,the idea of drawing a strong inference from factual allegations is mysterious.even when a plaintiff is required by rule b to plead facts such as the when and where of an alleged fraudulent statement,the court must treat the pleaded facts as true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.borsellino goldman sachs group,cir.to draw a strong inference in favor of the plaintiff might seem to imply that the defendant had pleaded facts or presented evidence that would,by comparison with the plaintiff allegations,enable a conclusion that the plaintiff had the stronger case and therefore that a judge could not draw a strong inference in the plaintiff favor before hearing from the defendant.but comparison is not essential,and obviously is not contemplated by the reform act,which requires dismissal in advance of the defendant answer unless the complaint itself gives rise to a strong inference of scienter.for a defendant will usually have evidence to present in his defense and so a complaint that on its face,and without reference to the defendant case,creates only a weak or bare inference of scienter,suggesting that the plaintiff would prevail only if there were no defense case at all,would be quite likely to fail eventually when the defendant had a chance to put on his case,which would normally be after pretrial discovery.apparently congress does not believe that weak complaints should put a defendant to the expense of discovery in a case,which is likely to be this case is.
the complaint alleges the following the corporate defendant,tellabs,manufactures equipment used in fiber optic cable networks its principal customers are telephone companies.in december,the beginning of the period of alleged violations of rule,tellabs principal product,accounting for more than half its sales,was a switching system called titan.the product was almost years old when on december tellabs announced that the successor product,titan,was available now and that sprint had signed a multiyear,million contract to buy the,though in fact no sales pursuant to the contract closed until after the period covered by the complaint.the same announcement added that despite the advent of the,sales of the would continue to grow.most of these and other announcements quoted in the complaint were made by richard notebaert,who was tellabs chief executive officer and,along with tellabs,is the principal defendant.
the following month,tellabs announced that customers are buying more and more tellabs equipment and that tellabs had set the stage for sustained growth with the successful launch of several products.in february,the company told its stockholders that its growth was robust and that customers are embracing the.in response to a question frequently asked by sales of the had company declared that although we introduced this product nearly years ago,it still going strong.in march the company reduced its sales estimates slightly but said it was doing so because of lower than expected growth in a part of its business unrelated to the and systems,and that interest in and demand for the continues to grow and we are satisfying very strong demand and growing customer demand for the,and we are as confident as may be an the.and in response to a securities analyst question whether tellabs was experiencing any weakness at all in demand for the,notebaert responded no,we not we still seeing that product continue to maintain its growth rate it still experiencing strong acceptance.yet from the outset of the period covered by the complaint tellabs had been flooding its customers with tens of millions of dollars worth of that the customers had not requested,in order to create an illusion of demand.the company had to lease extra storage space in january and february to accommodate the large number of returns.
just weeks after these statements tellabs reduced its sales projections significantly because its customers were exercising a high degree of prudence over every dollar spent.but it reiterated that the demand for the was very strong.in april it said we should hit our full manufacturing capacity for the in may or june to accommodate the demand we are seeing.everything we can build,we are building and shipping.the demand is very strong.
in june,however,at the end of the period covered by the complaint,tellabs announced a major drop in revenues,and its share price,which at its peak during the period had been and in the middle of the period had varied between and,fell to just under.it currently is below.but the deterioration had been well under way by december as a result of the bursting of the bubble in the middle of the year.the market for the was evaporating the next month january,tellabs largest customer,verizon,reduced its orders for the by already,the previous june,reduced them by percent.and not a single system was shipped during the complaint period.
tellabs revenues in were percent lower than the year before and its profits percent lower.the drop in the second quarter most of which was within the period covered by the complaint over the year before was even steeper revenues dropped percent and profits percent.
the company statements that we have quoted or paraphrased were,we ruled in our previous,to repeat,the ruling binds us as law of the pleaded as materially false.but is an inference of scienter from these allegations cogent and at least as compelling as the contrary there was no scienter it is easier to consider the second,the comparative,question first,and also to separate the issue of the company scienter from that of notebaert.the emphasis throughout the litigation has been on the latter,but the former is also alleged and though briefly argued and we begin with it.
there are two competing inferences always assuming of course that the plaintiffs are able to prove the allegations of the complaint.one is that the company knew or was reckless in failing to realize,but we shall not have to discuss that possibility separately that the statements were false,and material to investors.the other is that although the statements were false and material,their falsity was the result of innocent,or at worst careless,mistakes at the executive level.suppose a clerical worker in the company finance department accidentally overstated the company earnings and the erroneous figure got reported in good faith up the line to notebaert or other senior management,who then included the figure in their public announcements.even if senior management had been careless in failing to detect the error,there would be no corporate scienter.intent to deceive is not a corporate not because collective intent or shared purpose is an oxymoron.it is not.a panel of judges does not have a single mind,but if all the judges agree on the decision of a case,the decision can properly be said to represent the collective intent of the panel,though the judges who join an opinion to make it unanimous may not agree with everything said in it.
the problem with inferring a collective intent to deceive behind the act of a corporation is that the hierarchical and differentiated corporate structure makes it quite plausible that a fraud,though ordinarily a deliberate act,could be the result of a series of acts none of which was both done with scienter and imputable to the company by the doctrine of respondeat superior.someone low in the corporate hierarchy might make a mistake that formed the premise of a statement made at the executive level by someone who was at worst careless in having failed to catch the mistake.a routine invocation of respondeat superior,which would impute the mistake to the corporation provided only that it was committed in the course of the employee job rather than being a frolic of his own,joel morrison,eng,would,if applied to a securities fraud that requires scienter,attribute to a corporation a state of mind that none of its employees had.to establish corporate liability for a violation of rule requires look ing to the state of mind of the individual corporate official or officials who make or issue the statement or order or approve it or its making or issuance,or who furnish information or language for inclusion therein,or the like rather than generally to the collective knowledge of all the corporation officers and employees acquired in the course of their employment.southland securities inspire ins.solutions,cir footnote omitted.a corporation is liable for statements by employees who have apparent authority to make them.see,american society of mechanical engineers,hydrolevel,d,and for the application of the principle to securities fraud in re atlantic financial management,cir.
suppose the false communication by the employee to his superiors had been deliberate.suppose he was embezzling tens of millions of dollars,and by concealing the embezzlement greatly exaggerated his corporation assets.suppose he even knew that as a result the corporation would misrepresent its assets to investors.nevertheless,even if his superiors were careless in failing to detect the embezzlement,the corporation would not be guilty of fraud,since the malefactor acts of embezzling and concealing the embezzlement would not be acts on behalf of the corporation deliberate wrongs by an employee are not imputed to his employer unless they are not only within the scope of his employment but in attempted furtherance of the employer goals.hunter,cir fitzgerald mountain states,cir home life ins.equitable equipment,cir.

the court in the southland securities case said that corporate scienter could be based on the state of mind of someone who furnished false information that became the basis of a fraudulent public announcement.suppose he had knowingly supplied the false information intending to help the company.his superiors would not be liable for failing to catch the mistake,but southland implies that the corporation would be liable,just as it would be in a common law tort suit.page keeton et,prosser and keeton on the law of torts,ed.that theory of liability is not argued in this case,however,and so we need not explore it.nor do the plaintiffs seek to use section a of the securities exchange act,a,to impose control person liability on the corporation,which would require the plaintiffs to overcome defenses of good faith and noninducement.tellabs does not make the argument,which has been rejected by most courts,that section a supersedes liability based on apparent authority or respondeat superior.hollinger titan capital,cir en banc commerford olson,cir in re atlantic financial management,supra,at fey walston,cir.
the critical question,therefore,is how likely it is that the allegedly false statements that we quoted earlier in this opinion were the result of merely careless mistakes at the management level based on false information fed it from below,rather than of an intent to deceive or a reckless indifference to whether the statements were misleading.it is exceedingly unlikely.the and the were tellabs most important products.the was described by the company as its flagship product and the was the heralded successor.they were to tellabs as windows xp and vista are to microsoft.that no member of the company senior management who was involved in authorizing or making public statements about the demand for the and knew that they were false is very hard to credit,and no p
