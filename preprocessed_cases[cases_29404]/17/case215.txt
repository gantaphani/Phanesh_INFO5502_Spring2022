the plaintiffs in this case are the international union,united automobile,aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america,its local union number,and five former employees of an automobile parts supply company called mexican industries in michigan.plaintiffs filed suit against defendants pamela aguirre robin krych,jill aguirre and rance aguirre,who at all relevant times were the principal shareholders of the company,alleging violations of the employee retirement income security act,et,the labor management relations act,et,and the worker adjustment and retraining notification act,et.in this appeal,plaintiffs challenge several rulings by the district,the award of summary judgment in favor of defendants on all claims,the grant of rance aguirre motion for sanctions and the striking of an affidavit of plaintiffs purported expert witness.for the following reasons,we affirm the district court rulings.
in,henry aguirre,commonly referred to as hank aguirre,founded mexican industries in michigan,which was organized as a subchapter s corporation under the internal revenue code.as an s corporation,the company did not pay corporate income tax instead,its net income passed through to the shareholders,who were taxed based upon their pro rata ownership of the company stock.see a.the extent of the company profits,if any,were determined by its auditors.hank aguirre and the company board of directors established an provision for corporate profits,whereby the company profits during the calendar year were distributed in twelve equal monthly increments to shareholders beginning in july of the following calendar year.this provision was used to ensure that the company maintained sufficient operating capital.
when hank aguirre died in september,his estate owed taxes of approximately million dollars.most of his stock in the transferred to the henry aguirre living trust,of which his four children,who are the defendants in this case,were the beneficiaries.pursuant to the internal revenue code,the trust was required to distribute the stock to the beneficiaries or to another trust within two years of hank aguirre death in order to maintain the company status as an s corporation.see c a ii.the noonan and edward to establish four qualified subchapter s trusts,one for each defendant,which were used to distribute stock while maintaining the company subchapter s status.noonan and phillips served as the trustees of these qualified trusts,and the defendants played no role in their administration.
in march,the board appointed defendant rance aguirre to be the company chief executive officer.he resigned a few months later,but remained involved with the company as a director on a limited basis until.pamela aguirre became chief executive officer after rance resignation.when it became clear that she was borrowing large sums of money from the company for her own personal use,however,the board added defendants robin krych and jill aguirre as executive officers.defendants contend that pamela was not replaced outright because of her high profile in the community.
between and,defendants received salaries,health insurance,director fees and distributions from the company,which plaintiffs maintain were excessive and unwarranted.pursuant to the provision,the distribution of corporate profits that defendants received during this period included profits from the last six months of and all of the profits from.the company continued to enjoy financial success throughout the first few years following hank aguirre death.in approximately,however,the company began experiencing financial problems.between and,its spending and debt increased and,after,it made no annual profits at all.the company financial condition continued to decline in,as customers were lost and the company principal lender refused to extend further credit.a management apparently further contributed to the company demise.
in september,in the midst of these events,the company entered into a collective bargaining agreement with the international and local unions.the agreement provided for employee vacation leave and other benefits,including medical,dental and vision coverage.in april,due to its declining business and increasing debt,the company closed several plants and began laying off employees.the individual plaintiffs were laid off in june.on june,the company filed a voluntary bankruptcy petition pursuant to chapter of the bankruptcy code and ceased operations.on august,the international union filed a claim in the bankruptcy proceeding for unpaid vacation,medical,dental and vision benefits,union dues and other amounts it also alleged violations of the worker adjustment and retraining notification act.the company chapter proceeding was converted to a chapter liquidation proceeding in december.
the present action against the four aguirre siblings was subsequently filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan.plaintiffs allege that the company committed various violations of the employee retirement income security act,the labor management relations act and the worker adjustment and retraining notification act,and that defendants are personally liable for the damages caused by those violations.plaintiffs have not sued the company directly because of the automatic stay provisions of the bankruptcy code.see a providing that the filing of a bankruptcy petition operates as a stay of the commencement or continuation of a judicial proceeding against the debtor.
on september,the district court denied defendants motion for judgment on the pleadings.it permitted plaintiffs to amend their complaint to clarify their claims and to develop their theory during discovery.after the completion of discovery,defendants moved for summary judgment.on november,the district court granted the motion and dismissed the complaint.it also granted rance aguirre motion for sanctions,as well as his motion to strike the affidavit of plaintiffs purported expert witness.plaintiffs then filed a motion for reconsideration,which was denied.this timely appeal followed.
summary judgment 
we review the district court award of summary judgment de novo.see graham county of washtenaw,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.in determining the existence of a genuine issue of material fact,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party.graham,at.
the primary issue in this case is whether the defendants can be held individually liable for the company alleged statutory violations.as an initial matter,defendants rely on peacock thomas,d,for the proposition that federal subject matter jurisdiction is lacking over plaintiffs claims.in peacock,the supreme court held that a plaintiff who had obtained a judgment against a corporate employer could not enforce the judgment in a second suit asserting a theory against a shareholder,without an independent basis for federal subject matter jurisdiction.at.defendants argue that there is no subject matter jurisdiction here because plaintiffs are seeking to hold them merely vicariously,rather than directly,liable for the company alleged statutory violations.see,ellis all steel,cir holding that claims for direct erisa liability against a corporation alter ego do not implicate peacock concerns,whereas claims positing vicarious liability reflect an attempt to use ancillary jurisdiction to impose an obligation to pay an existing debt on a person not already liable for that judgment,which is precisely what peacock holds must have its own jurisdictional basis independent of the federal character of the underlying erisa judgment discussing cent.states,and areas pension fund cent,cir.in an apparent attempt to rebut plaintiffs jurisdictional argument,plaintiffs insist that they are seeking to hold defendants directly,not merely vicariously,liable for the statutory violations alleged in the complaint,under a theory that they have labeled the veil piercing v
