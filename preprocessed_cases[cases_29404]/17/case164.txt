this case involves two putative class actions,consolidated on interlocutory appeal,brought by purchasers of real estate brokerage services in south carolina.each complaint alleges that the real estate brokerages serving as board members of the local multiple listing service conspired to unfairly restrain market competition in violation of of the sherman antitrust act.the district court denied the defendants motions to dismiss the complaints.we affirm and remand for further proceedings.
the two complaints at issue concern allegedly anticompetitive passed by board members of two different multiple listing services in south carolina.a multiple listing service mls is an incorporated joint venture that,among other things,maintains a database of properties listed for sale in the mls service area,which its member brokerages use to post and find property listings.an mls centralizes information within the real estate market it serves,enabling mls members to communicate with each other to coordinate the sale and purchase of real estate.particularly in an area served by only one mls,access to mls resources may be critical for a brokerage to successfully participate in the relevant real estate market.
the complaints contain nearly identical allegations.in the first complaint the robertson complaint,plaintiffs identify the putative class as purchasers of real estate brokerage services listed by the defendants on the multiple listing service of hilton head island,hhmls.similarly,in the second complaint the boland complaint,plaintiffs identify the putative class as purchasers of real estate brokerage services listed by the defendants on the columbia consolidated multiple listing service,cmls.the robertson and boland defendants are identified as licensed real estate brokerages that served,via their employees,on hhmls and cmls board of trustees,respectively.
the complaints allege that while serving on the relevant mls boards of trustees,defendants conspired to restrain competition in their respective real estate markets in violation of of the sherman antitrust act.according to the complaints,defendants used the mls as a conduit to create rules that govern mls members conduct and business practices,which inhibit ed competition and illegally stabilized the prices paid by plaintiffs as customers of real estate brokerage services.specifically,the complaints allege that the rules passed by the defendants were designed to exclude innovative,competitors and thus insulate the defendants from competitive pressures posed by brokerages that offered a larger menu of service choices and alternative pricing to their customers.
for example,the defendants allegedly prevented members from providing anything less than the full array of services that brokerages traditionally have provided and prohibited members from allowing a property seller the option of avoiding paying the broker a commission if the seller finds the buyer on his or her own.both complaints allege that defendants prescribed subjective standards for admission to membership that allow mls representatives to deny membership to brokerages who they might expect to compete more aggressively or in more innovative ways than mls members,including defendants,would prefer.according to the complaints,the defendants aimed to exclude brokerages from the mls by requiring,among other things,that member brokerages maintain a physical office in the mls service area.
the defendants in each case moved to dismiss the complaints under rule b for failure to state a plausible claim for relief.among other things,the robertson and boland defendants argued that the sherman act claims warranted dismissal under the intracorporate immunity doctrine for failure to allege an agreement between two or more separate legal entities.the district court denied the motions to dismiss,finding that the complaints alleged an anticompetitive conspiracy sufficient to state a plausible claim for relief under.relying on american needle,national football league,d,the trial court found that the claims were not barred by the intracorporate immunity doctrine because the alleged conspiracy joins independent centers of decisionmaking that are capable of conspiring under section.
the district court certified its order for interlocutory review under b and this court granted defendants petition for permission to appeal.appellants renew their objections to the sufficiency of the robertson and boland complaints and we shall address their claims in turn.we review de novo the district court denial of the rule b motions to dismiss.see anita style mexican food,anita mexican foods,cir.like the district court,we must take the complaints factual allegations as true and draw all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs favor.see du pont de nemours kolon,cir.
section one of the sherman antitrust act prohibits e very contract,combination,or conspiracy,in restraint of trade.to establish a antitrust violation,a plaintiff must prove,and therefore plead,a contract,combination,or conspiracy that imposed an unreasonable restraint of trade.dickson microsoft,cir.
at this stage of the litigation,our task is limited.we are not asked to consider whether defendants actually violated,but to determine whether the complaints state a plausible claim for relief to survive a motion to dismiss.ashcroft iqbal,d.we must first inquire therefore whether these pleadings state a claim against defendants for their decisionmaking as mls board members to wit,whether defendants constituted separate economic actors capable of conspiring for purposes of.see oksanen page mem l,cir en banc.appellants contend that plaintiffs failed to allege the plurality of legal entities necessary for a sherman act violation.they argue that the individual brokerages acted only in their capacities as mls board members and that everything that may have happened here reflects nothing more than the independent actions of a single corporate entity,namely the mls itself.
for the reasons that follow,we disagree.
the sherman antitrust act was designed to be a comprehensive charter of economic liberty aimed at preserving free and unfettered competition as the rule of trade.pac.ry.united states,d.section two of the sherman antitrust act proscribes both concerted and independent actions that monopolize trade.see.but section one prohibition against restraint of trade applies only to concerted action,american needle.at,which requires evidence of a relationship between at least two legally distinct persons or entities,oksanen,at.concerted activity is of special concern because it inherently is fraught with anticompetitive risk and deprives the marketplace of the independent centers of that competition assumes and demands.copperweld independence tube,d.
two supreme court cases,copperweld and american needle,have set forth the criteria for concerted action and guide our analysis of defendants conduct.copperweld held that officers or employees of the same firm do not provide the plurality of actors imperative for a conspiracy as internal agreement to implement a single,unitary firm policies does not raise the antitrust dangers that was designed to police.at.in american needle,the court applied copperweld to the conduct of members of an incorporated joint venture.specifically,the court recognized that a greements made within a firm can constitute concerted action covered by when the parties to the agreement act on interests separate from those of the firm itself,and the intrafirm agreements may simply be a formalistic shell for ongoing concerted action.at footnote omitted.
the american needle court explained that concerted action under does not turn simply on whether the parties involved are legally distinct entities.id.at.rather,substance,not form,should determine whether a n entity is capable of conspiring under.id.at quoting copperweld,at.it is thus not dispositive if defendants organize themselves under a single umbrella or into a structured joint venture.id.at.the relevant functional inquiry is whether there is a conspiracy between separate economic actors pursuing separate economic interests,such that the agreement deprives the marketplace of independent centers of decisionmaking.id.quoting copperweld,at.citation omitted.
applying this analysis,the court in american needle held that the licensing activities of national football league properties nflp a corporate joint venture formed by the national football league teams to manage their intellectual property constituted concerted action within the meaning of.the court concluded that a lthough nfl teams have common interests such as promoting the nfl brand,they are still separate,entities,and their interests in licensing team trademarks are not necessarily aligned.id.at.therefore,t teams operating independently through the vehicle of the nflp are not like the components of a single firm that act to maximize the firm profits.the teams remain separately controlled,potential competitors with economic interests that are distinct from nflp financial.id.at.as a result,the court held that the nfl teams and nflp were appropriately subject to suit under for nflp licensing activities.
appellants contend that the mls rules at issue here are the product of independent action by agents of a single corporation.but the nature of defendants alleged participation in the mls joint venture fits squarely within american needle definition of concerted conduct.taking the factual claims in the complaints as true,the competitive relationship between the individual brokerages resembles that between the nfl teams.the mls is comprised of individual real estate brokerages that are separately incorporated and that compete with each other in the sale and purchase of real estate.like the nfl teams,each brokerage is a substantial,independently owned,and independently managed business that is guided by a separate corporate consciousness.id.at quoting copperweld,at.and therefore,like the nfl teams,the individual brokerages lack a complete unity of interest and do not possess either the unitary decisionmaking quality or the single aggregation of economic power characteristic of independent action.id.
the gravamen of the complaints here is that the brokerages colluded to use the mls corporate vehicle to exclude lower cost brokerages from competing in the relevant real estate market and to stabilize prices within that market.the mls enabled the individual brokerages to make collective decisions about pricing and services that they otherwise would have made independently.as in american needle,this alleged collective action among potential competitors depriv ed the marketplace of independent centers of decisionmaking.id.at.although appellants stress that the defendants passed the mls in their capacity as mls board members,the relevant question is whether defendants acted on interests separate from those of the firm itself.id.at.and it is clear that defendants alleged efforts to exclude innovative competitors conflicted with the economic interest of the mls to admit additional members and to expand its database of property listings.
we emphasize,however,that even if some of the rules in question did happen to serve the interest of the mls,this would not necessarily place defendants conduct outside the scope of.as the court in american needle noted,the nfl teams economic interests will often coincide with those of the nflp as an entity in itself,but that commonality of interest exists in every cartel.id.citation omitted emphasis omitted.what matters is that,according to the allegations,the defendants remained separately controlled,potential competitors with economic interests that were distinct from the mls financial.id 
our holding that applies is not meant to discredit the salutary economic function that an mls may perform.an mls may bring significant advantages to the market by,for example,dismantling information and communication barriers and easing the geographical barrier confronting the relationship.arthur austin,real estate boards and multiple listing systems as restraints of trade,colum.the joint venture thus provides a buyer with a wider selection of purchase opportunities than is available from a single broker,and this integration of operations enables an expansion of output within the real estate market.joseph brodley,joint ventures and antitrust policy,harv.but the power of mls board members to pass restrictive membership rules can also threaten economic harm to nonmembers and deprive the real estate market of the competitive forces that are at the heart of our national economic policy.soc y of prof l eng rs united states,d.where mls members have the power to exclude other competitors from access to its pooled resources,there exists the potential for significant competitive harms alongside the competitive advantages of an mls.united states realty multi list,cir.section one is therefore an appropriate mechanism to ensure that the concerted action of mls members retains a procompetitive character.
our analysis is consistent with several courts of appeals decisions that have applied to allegedly anticompetitive mls rules and membership criteria.see reifert cent.mls,cir freeman san diego ass of realtors,cir thompson metro.multi list,cir pope.real estate comm n,cir realty multi list,penne greater minneapolis area bd.of realtors,cir.although in reifert and pope the courts ultimately concluded that was not violated,appellants have failed to point to a single court of appeals decision placing allegedly anticompetitive mls conduct outside section one coverage altogether.
in an effort to distinguish these cases,appellants argue that even if mls board members are theoretically susceptible to claims,the complaints here fail to sufficiently plead that defendants were engaged in anything more than intracorporate deliberations.see copperweld.specifically,appellants contend that it is fatal to the complaints that plaintiffs do not allege the existence of separate economic actors pursuing separate economic interests as required by american needle.it is true that these exact words do not appear in the complaints,which were filed before american needle was issued and which were not amended in its aftermath.but american needle was decided at the summary judgment stage with the benefit of limited discovery.the decision does not suggest that a plaintiff must invoke the precise words of separate economic actors pursuing separate economic interests for a complaint against a joint venture to proceed past the pleading stage.instead,it is sufficient that the facts in plaintiffs complaints reasonably support such an inference.see iqbal,at.a claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.
it is clear from the complaints that the individual brokerages are economically separate from the mls and from each other.the complaints identify each defendant as a distinct brokerage corporation licensed to do business in the mls service area.furthermore,plaintiffs allege that the brokerages in the mls service area are supposed to compete with each other to provide services to customers.it is an obvious inference that as potential competitors within the mls service area,defendants pursued separate economic interests.
in addition,plaintiffs pled facts which suggest that the defendants used the mls corporate vehicle in a way that did not coincide with the mls economic interests.the complaints assert that the mls purported to benefit the real estate market by aggregating information and expanding a database of property listings,but that the mls rules that defendants colluded to promulgate were not reasonably necessary to achieve the benefits of the mls.according to the complaints,whereas mls members earn income through sales commissions,the mls finances its services through the collection of membership dues.the complaints allege that the mls board members profited by illegally inhibiting competition,passing rules that restricted mls membership in order to stabilize the price of brokerage services,but to the detriment of the mls own interest in new dues collection.
our task here is not ultimately mechanical.the supreme court has emphasized that evaluating the
