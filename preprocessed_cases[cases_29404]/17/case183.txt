iii.discussion 
federal securities law claims 
the parties dispute which particular statutes set the applicable periods of time in which to bring the first and second causes of action in the first amended complaint.in the first cause of action,margolies alleges that deason violated of the securities act of,codified at.deason argues that the appropriate time limits for this action are found at,which imposes a term of three years after the sale of the security or its being offered to the public.
in the second cause of action,margolies alleges that deason violated both b of the securities exchange act of,codified at b,and rule b,codified at.in lampf,pleva,lipkind,prupis petigrow gilbertson,d,the supreme court held that these claims were barred after the same time period,namely three years after the sale or offering.under this period,which deason urges,the first and second causes of action are clearly because suit was not filed within three years of the sale or offering.
margolies argues that instead the time limit for the first and second causes of action is controlled by section of the soa.enacted on july,the soa changed the time period to bring any private right of action that involves a claim of fraud,deceit,manipulation,or contrivance in contravention of a regulatory requirement concerning the securities laws,as defined in section a of the securities exchange act of.b.the district court correctly found that the claims in the first and second causes of action involved fraud such that they were the type of claims that fall within the confines of this statute.
under the new statute,such violations may be brought not later than the earlier of years after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation or years after such violation.id.the soa contains two other important provisions.first,one provision states that the new time period shall apply to all proceedings addressed by this section that are commenced on or after the date of enactment of this act,stat.second,another provision states that n othing in this section shall create a new,private right of action.id.
at this point it is worth noting the difference between statutes of limitations and statutes of repose.statutes of limitations speak to matters of remedy,whereas statutes of repose eliminate the underlying rights when they lapse.chase securities donaldson.statutes of limitations lieberman cambridge partners,cir statutes of repose burlington northern santa fe ry.poole chemical,cir t he differences between statutes of limitations and statutes of repose are substantive,not merely semantic.
the statute at issue here is a statute of repose.see lampf,at.noting that the time period under the securities exchange act of is a statute of repose bear lake river waterworks irrigation garland.stating that when a statute creates a right unknown at common law,the general rule is that a corresponding statutory time bar is one of repose rather than limitation.as such,the right to relief itself is extinguished when the relevant time period expires.
the soa was enacted well after the first and second causes of action accrued and subsequently expired under the old time limits.under the period of three years,these causes of action were extinguished in early,more than a year prior to the enactment of the soa.margolies would have us hold that these causes of action that were indisputably for a period of more than a year prior to the enactment of the soa are no longer.
the second,third,fourth,seventh,and eighth circuits,in cases addressing this issue,have held that the soa did not revive previously extinguished causes of action.see in re enter.mortgage acceptance.sec.litig.enterprise,cir lieberman,at glaser enzo biochem,cir foss bear,stearns,cir in re adc.sec,cir.the second circuit opinion in enterprise contains a retroactivity analysis that the other circuit courts have largely followed.at see,foss,at we find enterprise persuasive and have nothing to add to the second circuit explanation.in an interlocutory appeal,the eleventh circuit disagreed with the other circuits and remanded for further.tello dean witter reynolds,cir noting that statutes that are textually clear as to retroactivity should be retroactively applied.we conclude that the district court correctly followed the majority of the circuits in holding that the soa did not apply retroactively to revive the first and second causes of action.
the supreme court has stated repeatedly that there is a presumption against retroactive legislation that is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence.hughes aircraft united states ex rel.schumer,d internal alteration and quotation omitted.in landgraf usi film products,the supreme court established a test for retroactivity inquiries,d see rutland moore,cir refusing to apply a portion of the civil rights act of retroactively.under landgraf,the court first task is to determine whether congress has expressly prescribed the statute proper reach.at.if congress has not done so,the second step is 
t he court must determine whether the new statute would have retroactive effect,whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he acted,increase a party liability for past conduct,or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.if the statute would operate retroactively,our traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent clear congressional intent favoring such a result.
with respect to the first step,the court has indicated that an express prescription is synonymous
