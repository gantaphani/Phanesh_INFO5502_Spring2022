the,frank whittington,ii frank,brought this action to enforce his rights as an alleged member of dragon group,dragon group,a delaware limited liability company.the include frank four siblings,all of whom are members of dragon group thomas whittington,tom,richard whittington richard,faith whittington faith and dorothy minotti dorothy collectively,the sibling defendants.the remaining defendants are dragon group and certain other members of the whittington family,who are not of the same generation as frank.the defendants tom and richard are also managers of dragon group.
the court of chancery held that frank action was barred by the doctrine of laches.in reaching that decision,it determined that the analogous statute of limitations is three years.we have concluded the applicable analogous statute of limitations is twenty years.therefore,this matter will be remanded to the court of chancery for further consideration in accordance with our holding in this opinion.
in,frank and the sibling defendants entered into an agreement in principle the aip,which constituted a global settlement of the case styled whittington v.the farm,and various other disputes.in the farm case,frank sought recognition of his proportionate ownership interest in various business entities owned and operated by the sibling defendants,including whittington.on june,each of the parties to that litigation signed the aip following three days of trial before the court of chancery.
the aip is a document containing eleven numbered paragraphs.it provides in relevant part 
frank gets shares of.stock upon payment of without interest.frank proportionate interest in will be carried forward into dragon group llc with same rights as all other members.
in full repayment of a loan from dorothy whittington,frank pays estate and waives his interest in his generation skipping trust in favor of his four siblings estate releases to trust and trust releases to frank shares upon payment.
frank,and other members,will receive periodic financial and operating information for,frog hollow and dragon group as outlined in items and of the march,letter of todd schiltz.
all payments set forth herein above shall be made by june,and appropriate documentation acceptable to all parties to accomplish same including without limitation the certificate of formation and operating agreement for dragon group,
claiming frank failed to perform under the aip,the sibling defendants filed a motion with the court of chancery to enforce that agreement.the court of chancery heard the motion on october,and held that the aip should be enforced as a contract.among other things,the court of chancery expressly held that the parties inability to agree upon the form of certain documents contemplated in the aip,releases,a new note,and new governing documents for certain related entities did not make the aip unenforceable.
despite the court of chancery ruling,the parties continued their pattern of delay,waiting nearly a year before purporting to comply fully with the express terms of the aip.unable to work together cooperatively or effectively,the parties never completed certain of the secondary documentation referred to in the court of chancery ruling.the parties could not agree,for example,on a proposed form of operating agreement for dragon group prepared by the sibling defendants to reflect frank membership in that entity.
on september,tom distributed that document the offering memorandum to all prospective members of dragon group.the offering memorandum provided that each member must pledge his shares of stock as a prerequisite for membership in dragon group.the offering memorandum also stated that a ny shareholder of not returning all documents fully executed on or before the close of business on october,will be deemed not to have accepted the offer and thus not be able to participate.
frank submitted an executed copy of the offering memorandum by the deadline on october.in that copy,however,he changed his dragon group ownership interest from to.on october,at,frank also paid the aggregate referenced in paragraphs and of the aip and the sibling defendants delivered to him the stock certificates for the total shares of ltd stock.
by letter dated november,tom,dragon group sole managing member at the time,informed frank counsel that frank altered version of the offering memorandum constituted a counteroffer that had been rejected.in response,on december,frank,acting pro se,filed a motion for order compelling defendants compliance with court order and directing performance by substitute the motion.that motion essentially asked the court of chancery to resolve the differences among the parties as to the form of the ancillary documentation for dragon group,and to permit relitigation of certain issues resolved by the aip.
in a letter opinion dated march,the court of chancery denied frank motion.with respect to dragon group operating agreement,which also is at issue in this action,the court of chancery ruled that the terms of the dragon group llc operating agreement will be those that were established at its inception,adjusted to reflect frank whittington percentage ownership therein.seizing upon the fact that the court of chancery had denied frank motion,the defendants apparently claimed victory and proceeded as if nothing had changed.frank,on the other hand,believed his position had been vindicated and mistakenly assumed he would be included as a member of dragon group with a ownership stake.in fact,however,after the march,letter opinion,the defendants never took any action to include frank as a member of dragon group.
frank sister,dorothy,testified at trial but did not reveal during the discovery period,that she had spoken to frank by telephone only days after the march,ruling.according to dorothy,she informed frank that she and the other sibling defendants believed they had prevailed in the motion and,consequently,frank was not a member of dragon group.frank denied that this conversation occurred.
in april,frank initiated discussions concerning his rights under the aip with two attorneys,jay katz and jeffrey boyer,before engaging them formally as his legal counsel on may.katz and boyer had detailed discussions with frank about the aip.according to katz,frank was adamant that the sibling defendants were not treating him as a member of dragon group.he was being excluded.he was not getting information on dragon group and he was very upset about that.at the time,the dragon group matter was only one of several disputes frank had with his siblings.
after their engagement,katz and boyer sent a global settlement offer on behalf of frank to jeffrey weiner,counsel for the sibling defendants.the offer proposed a by the sibling defendants of all of frank interests including notes in all of the entities for fair market value.the sibling defendants rejected frank settlement offer on july.about a day or two later,katz called weiner to inquire about the rejection and the sibling defendants refusal to negotiate.at trial,katz described that conversation as follows 
i pointed out to the fact that frank had complained that he was getting the dragon group financial statements.
and weiner said,why should he get them he not a member.
so i asked weiner why frank not a member.and is that what the aip says.and he gave me his explanation of why he did think frank was a member.
weiner said two different things.one was that in the creation of dragon group or at some point all of the whittington family members who were supposed to be members of dragon group were supposed to do something.in that case i think it was,as i remember,to turn over certain certificates.frank had refused.this was part of the deal.and when frank had refused,they took that as his saying well,i do want to really be a member.and there might have been some other things he did about marking up some documents.i ca specifically remember what that was,but some which,in his mind,was frank rejection of membership in dragon group and,therefore,he was entitled to the financial statements.
shortly after this conversation and before july,katz informed frank of the sibling defendants position that he was not a member of dragon group,and,therefore,had no right to receive any financial information from that company.
in august,the entities owned by the sibling defendants collectively convened an annual stockholders meeting.frank attended with boyer,but they were excluded from the meeting when the discussion turned to dragon group.according to katz,boyer was told that since frank did have an interest in dragon group,that he was invited to the meeting or he could stay for the meeting.
the next communication regarding frank status dragon group occurred when tom sent a letter to frank,dated april,stating that frank had been sent a for dragon group in error.the letter stated 
the dragon group llc was sent to you in error you are not a member of dragon group llc.i looked at your file on this matter and there is correspondence to your attorney regarding the fact that you did not return an appropriately signed agreement nor did you send maura your shares to be used as security for loans that dragon group might need.
frank admits that this letter provided notice of the sibling defendants position that he was not a member of dragon group.
in late,dragon group called upon its members to make a capital contribution.in connection with that call,dragon group received on january.the funds contributed by the sibling defendants were taken from a dividend approved by the board.dragon group did not call upon frank to make a capital contribution,presumably because the defendants did not consider him a member of that entity.
in december,dragon group entered into a million mortgage with for a property in new castle county,delaware.dragon group made timely payments on the mortgage at a nine percent interest rate from december until september,when it satisfied the mortgage.frank admits that he generally was aware of the mortgage payments from dragon group to.
procedural history 
frank commenced this litigation by filing a verified complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief the complaint against dragon group,tom,richard,faith and dorothy on july.on october,frank moved for summary judgment.the court of chancery heard argument on that motion and denied it in an oral ruling on may.frank then filed a verified amended complaint the amended complaint on june,which added the other individual defendants.later in,frank dismissed defendant marna whittington without prejudice.on february,the remaining defendants filed a joint motion for summary judgment on their defense of laches.the court of chancery issued an opinion denying that motion on june.a trial was held from june to,and the court of chancery heard argument on january.
frank asked for three different but related types of relief in the court of chancery.first,he asked the court of chancery to enforce the dragon group operating agreement and find that his membership interest under that agreement is.second,commensurate with that membership interest,frank asked for an order compelling the defendants to turn over his proportionate share of all profits from dragon group,including any distributions.third,frank requested an accounting of dragon group to determine the extent of his share of its profits.
in the court of chancery,the defendants contended that frank was precluded from obtaining such relief because he failed to bring his claims within the applicable statute of limitations.the defendants also argued that,notwithstanding the statute of limitations,the doctrine of laches bars frank claims.in addition,the defendants disputed the merits of frank claims.they asserted that frank is not a member of dragon group because he failed to comply with specific admission requirements.alternatively,the defendants submitted that,even if frank is a member of dragon group,his membership interest is far less than.in reply,frank asserted that these defenses are barred by the doctrines of res judicata,collateral estoppel,and judicial estoppel based on the outcomes of two prior rulings by the court of chancery dated october,and march.frank also asserted that the doctrine of unclean hands prohibits the defendants from raising any defense to his claims.
the court of chancery concluded that this action should be dismissed on the ground of laches.therefore,it did not address the merits of frank claims.it noted,however,that frank has stated a plausible claim that he was to be a member of dragon group under the aip with an ownership interest possibly as high as and that the defendants breached the aip.for purposes of its opinion,the court of chancery assumed,without deciding,that but for the laches defense,frank would prevail on those aspects of his claims.nevertheless,and despite having made that assumption,the court of chancery decided it was unnecessary to reach frank based on res judicata,collateral estoppel,and judicial estoppel.
doctrine of laches 
both the doctrine of laches and statutes of limitations function as time bars to lawsuits.unlike a statute of limitations,the equitable doctrine of laches does not prescribe a specific time period as unreasonable laches is an unreasonable delay by a party,without any specific reference to duration,in the enforcement of a right,and resulting in prejudice to the adverse party an unreasonable delay can range from as long as several to as little as one month the temporal aspect of the delay is less critical than the reasons for it.in some circumstances even a long delay might be excused 
although statutes of limitations always operate as a to actions at law,they are not controlling in equity as this court recently held in reid spazio 
a court of equity moves upon considerations of conscience,good faith,and reasonable diligence.thus,although a statute of limitations defense is premised solely on the passage of time,the lapse of time between the challenged conduct and the filing of a suit to prevent or correct the wrong is not,in itself,determinative of laches.instead,the laches inquiry is principally whether it is inequitable to permit a claim to be enforced,the touchstone of which is inexcusable delay leading to an adverse change in the condition or relations of the property or the parties.under ordinary circumstances,a suit in equity will not be stayed for laches before,and will be stayed after,the time fixed by the analogous statute of limitations at law but,if unusual conditions or extraordinary circumstances make it inequitable to allow the prosecution of a suit after a briefer,or to forbid its maintenance after a longer period than that fixed by the statute,the court will not be bound by the statute,but will determine the extraordinary case in accordance with the equities which condition it 
accordingly,the doctrine of laches also permits the court of chancery to hold a plaintiff to a shorter period if,in terms of equity,the plaintiff should have acted with greater alacrity,and when the plaintiff failure to seek equitable relief with alacrity threatens prejudice to the other party.
laches bars an action in equity if t he plaintiff waited an unreasonable length of time before bringing the suit and the delay unfairly prejudices the defendant.therefore,laches generally requires proof of three elements first,knowledge by the claimant second,unreasonable delay in bringing the claim and third,resulting prejudice to the defendant.this doctrine is rooted in the maxim that equity aids the vigilant,not those who slumber on their rights.as explained by this court in federal united havender 
a court of equity moves upon considerations of conscience,good faith and reasonable diligence.knowledge and unreasonable delay are essential elements of the defense of laches.the precise time that may elapse between the act complained of as wrongful and the bringing of suit to prevent or correct the wrong does not,in itself,determine the question of laches.what constitutes unreasonable delay is a question of fact dependent largely upon the particular circumstances 
a statute of limitations period at law does not automatically bar an action in equity because actions in equity are only by the equitable doctrine of laches.where the plaintiff seeks equitable relief,however,the court of chancery applies the statute of limitations by analogy absent a tolling of the limitations period,a party failure to file within the analogous period of limitations will be given great weight in deciding whether the claims are barred by laches 
analogous statute of limitations 
the general rule for determining which statute of limitations should apply by analogy to a suit in equity is that the applicable statute of limitations should be applied as a bar in those cases which fall within that field of equity jurisdiction which is concurrent with analogous suits at law.delaware courts use the following test for determining whether a legal claim is analogous to the equitable claim at issue 
w here the statute bars the legal remedy,it shall bar the equitable remedy in analogous cases,or in reference to the same subject matter,and where the legal and equitable claim so far correspond,that the only difference is,that the one remedy may be enforced in a court of law,and the other in a court of equity 
the court of chancery concluded that frank claims ultimately are predicated upon the aip and that this action is based upon a promise within the meaning of section 
frank claims unquestionably relate to the same subject matter as would a legal claim for damages based on an alleged breach of the aip as a practical matter,there is not likely to be much difference between the prosecution of frank claim here for an accounting and a claim for damages in a court of law.thus,frank claims for declaratory relief and an accounting are analogous to a legal claim for the same relief.in the case of his request for injunctive relief,it is simply a remedy that may be enforced in a court of equity,as opposed to a claim for damages,which may be pursued at law.
therefore,the court of chancery held that the statute of limitations in title,section of the delaware code was the analogous statute of limitations for purposes of its laches analysis.
exception for contract under seal 
the court of chancery noted,however,that one exception to the statute of limitations for contract actions specified in title,section is for contracts under seal,for which the common law period applies.in the court of chancery,frank argued that the aip is a contract under seal.in support of his argument,frank noted that the word seal appears in typed letters beside the signature line for each signatory of the aip.
the court of chancery ruled that while documents of debt,such as mortgages or promissory notes,escape the limitation if they contain the most minimal reference to a seal,actions arising from other types of contracts must show a clearer intent to enter into a contract under seal.in support of that ruling,it relied upon the case of american telephone telegraph harris where the superior court held 
in delaware,for an instrument other than a mortgage to be under seal it must contain language in the body of the contract,a recital affixing the seal,and extrinsic evidence showing the parties intent to conclude a sealed contract the mere existence of the corporate seal and the use of the word seal in a contract do not make the document a specialty.
because the aip is neither a mortgage nor a promissory note,the court of chancery concluded that a number of the cases frank relied upon were inapposite.
the record reflects that the aip contains no reference to a seal other than the printed word seal next to each signature.the court of chancery held that evidence is insufficient to demonstrate an intent of the parties to enter into a sealed contract.accordingly,it reiterated its holding that the statute of limitation for contracts applies by analogy in this case.
contract under seal 
in this appeal,as a matter of first impression for this court,we must decide what evidence is necessary to establish a specialty contract under delaware law.the term specialty contract refers to a contract under seal and is used to distinguish a sealed contract from an ordinary,unsealed contract under delaware law,a contract under seal is subject to a statute of limitations however,exactly what constitutes a sealed instrument that is not a mortgage or deed under delaware law is not clear because there is a conflict in the trial courts decisions,in particular,between in re beyea and american telephone telegraph harris 
conflicting delaware cases 
in beyea estate,judge speakman of the orphan court held that a promissory note with the word seal printed to the right of in line with the signature on the note was an instrument under seal the note did not contain a testimonium clause and there was no reference to the parties intention to render the note a sealed instrument in the body in holding the note a sealed instrument,judge speakman reiterated delaware common law doctrine of sealed instruments 
i t has been a matter of general and common knowledge in this state for many years past that usage and custom has sanctioned the use of printed forms of notes and other contracts with the word seal printed on the form immediately to the right of the place intended for the signature,and that when such a printed form is used for the purpose for which it was intended,and is signed to the left of and in line with the printed word seal,upon the delivery of the executed obligation for or on behalf of the maker to the person for whom it was intended,or to his authorized agent,the character of the obligation of the maker is that of an obligation or contract under seal,irrespective of whether there is any indication in the body of the obligation itself that it was intended to be a sealed instrument 
accordingly,in beyea estate,the court held that promissory notes were under seal,based solely on the placement of the word seal to the right of the signatures 
in american telephone telegraph harris the superior court held that for an instrument other than a mortgage to be under seal,it must contain language in the body of the contract,a recital affixing the seal,and extrinsic evidence showing the parties intent to conclude a sealed contract the only evidence of the parties intent to create a contract under seal in presence of corporate seals and the word seal on the signature page of the license agreement at insufficient as a matter of law to show that the agreement was a specialty contract 
other delaware cases 
in a case that predated harris,peninsula methodist homes and hospitals,architect studio,the superior court found a contract to waterproof a balcony to be under seal in reliance on beyea estate rule that the word seal printed to the right of the parties signatures is effective as a seal.although the contract there had the word seal below rather than beside each signature,the court conclusion was buttressed by the presence of a testimonium clause immediately above the signatures,further evidencing the parties intent to create a contract under seal 
conversely,kirkwood kin donuts,exemplifies where applying the harris rule rather than the estate rule controls the outcome.the court there examined a franchise contract and a lease,each bearing only a corporate seal after the parties signatures and a testimonium clause identical to the one in peninsula the contracts were held not under seal because the the mere presence of a seal and a testimonium clause are not enough to create a sealed instrument the court allow ed discovery to develop extrinsic evidence of the parties intent with respect to sealing the agreements.
more recently,consolidated rail liberty mutual insurance applied the harris rule in the context of a construction contract and found that although t he signature clauses do make reference to the words seal sealed,the significance of those references are unclear.in the absence of any extrinsic evidence of intent or evidence of intent within the body of the contract,the superior court held the contract could not be considered a specialty.the court acknowledged peninsula and distinguished it on than,stating that to the extent that peninsula represents a contrary holding in circumstances similar to those present herein,this court respectfully declines to follow it.the court reasoned that no purpose would be served by according the same archaic presumption
