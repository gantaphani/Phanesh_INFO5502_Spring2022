second amended opinion 
plaintiffs,purchasers of bonds registered by gmac in september,brought suit under sections and a of the securities act of against gmac and its control persons,including general motors,which at the time gmac.plaintiffs alleged that gmac had breached its disclosure obligations as well as made material misstatements in its registration statements and prospectuses for multiple offerings of bonds registered in and.the defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiffs complaint for failure to state a claim.the district court granted the defendants motion.it found that plaintiffs lacked statutory standing to bring claims regarding offerings other than the one in which they had purchased.the district court also found that the plaintiffs had no claim regarding a duty to disclose because item,the regulatory authority relied on by plaintiffs,did not give rise to a duty to disclose the information the plaintiffs sought because the information was not firm specific to gmac.additionally,the district court found that there was no material omission because the affirmative statements made by gmac were not rendered misleading by the absence of the information cited by plaintiffs.lastly,the district court held that most of gmac statements were not false,and the ones that were arguably false were not material to bond investors.we find that the named plaintiffs own claims are without merit because the offering materials did not have material omissions because item only imposes a duty to make projections regarding known information,and plaintiffs pleaded only that the information was knowable and gmac affirmative statements were not rendered misleading by the absence of the information described by plaintiffs.we also find that the offering materials for the offering in which plaintiffs purchased did not include material misstatements,because the affirmative statements made by gmac were in fact true.since the named plaintiffs individual claims can not succeed on the merits,we affirm the judgment of the district court dismissing plaintiffs complaint.
background 
general motors acceptance corporation gmac is a financial services corporation whose largest source of revenue comes from providing financing for those who purchase vehicles from general motors gm,gmac parent corporation.gmac profit is derived from borrowing money at a certain interest rate,and then lending money at a higher interest rate its earnings are derived from this spread.gmac credit rating,then,is important to its profit margin because the higher its credit rating,the larger the interest rate spread and the greater gmac profit.
one source from which gmac borrowed was the general public.gmac would publicly offer debt securities such as those purchased by plaintiffs.the debt securities had a coupon rate,which is the rate of interest gmac would pay,as well as a yield,which was the payments gmac would make over the life of the security not including the return of the principal.at the time the last interest payment was due,gmac would return the principal to the investor.
gmac typically calculated the coupon rate it offered on its debt securities based on its credit rating.credit ratings are determined by credit rating agencies.these private agencies form opinions regarding an issuer risk of default.the risk of default is tied to the financial condition of a company,with particular focus on the company equity cushion.this means that the more a company assets exceed its debts and liabilities,the less the company risk of default the safer the investment.due to the market faith in the credit agencies,an issuer must typically offer higher rates of interest when it has received a lower credit rating.
the plaintiffs in this case are investors who purchased second smartnotes,which were bonds registered by gmac in september.the plaintiffs also seek to represent a class of all investors who purchased bonds registered by gmac in and and sold between july,and november.they allege that gmac conduct similarly injured all members of the purported class.
the plaintiffs allege that gmac offering materials filed between and suffered from material omissions and misstatements in violation of section and section a of the securities act of.they contend that while gmac disclosed that its performance and credit rating were closely related to gm performance and credit rating,gmac failed to disclose or misstated material information regarding gm performance and credit rating,which,if disclosed,would have adversely affected gmac credit rating.specifically,they claim that gmac should have disclosed that gm overstated its cash flow for fiscal years and,the extent of gm pension liability for delphi,and that gm net income had been inflated by an improper accounting for supplier rebates.additionally,plaintiffs claim that by failing to disclose this information,gmac credit rating and the coupon rate it offered on its bonds were rendered false and misleading.the plaintiffs further assert that this information was required to be contained within the registration statements for the bonds by regulation.lastly,plaintiffs aver that gmac materially misstated its financial results in.plaintiffs state in their complaint,however,that they do not allege fraud on the part of any defendant.
plaintiffs claim that these material omissions and misstatements injured the purported class.specifically,plaintiffs allege that,had they known this information about gm,they would have not purchased gmac debt securities because gmac was offering too low of a coupon rate.the plaintiffs claim that if they were aware of the undisclosed financial risks faced by gm,they would have demanded a higher interest rate for their investment in gmac,and therefore they accepted a risk they otherwise would not have,absent a higher interest rate.
when this questioned information was disclosed to the public,the plaintiffs allege that both gm and gmac credit rating fell.both credit ratings were reduced to below investment grade in light of the previously undisclosed information.id.this reduction in credit rating in turn reduced the secondary market value of the debt securities plaintiffs had purchased.
the defendants moved for dismissal of the plaintiffs complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b.they contended that the plaintiffs did not have standing to bring any claims,on behalf of a purported class or otherwise,relating to offerings in which the plaintiffs had not purchased bonds.furthermore,they asserted that the offering materials for the second smartnotes offering,the offerings from which the plaintiffs had purchased their bonds,did not suffer from material omissions or misstatements,and therefore plaintiffs have failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted.
the district court agreed with the defendants and granted the motion to dismiss the plaintiffs complaint.first,the district court held that,despite the purported class action,the plaintiffs failed to establish statutory standing to bring claims regarding offerings in which they had not purchased.the district court then went on to hold that gmac owed no duty to disclose information about gm because an issuer only has to disclose information about itself,not its parent corporation.the court further held that gmac affirmative representations were not rendered misleading by the absence of the information plaintiffs desired because those representations referred to general ties between gmac and gm,and the statements did not incorporate or in any way warrant the accuracy of gm publicly disclosed information.lastly,the district court held that while gmac did restate its disclosed financial results for fiscal year,that restatement was immaterial as a matter of law.the plaintiffs now appeal that judgment.
plaintiffs argue on appeal that the district court erred in granting the defendants motion to dismiss.first,plaintiffs argue that they have statutory standing to bring the claims belonging to the alleged class,including all purchasers of bonds gmac registered in and.second,plaintiffs allege that the district court was incorrect in concluding that they had failed to state a claim for relief.they assert that gmac failed to disclose certain information that it was required to disclose about gm either because it had a duty to disclose that information or because that information was required so as to not render other statements gmac had made misleading,thereby violating and a of the securities act of.see a,a.additionally,they assert that gmac also violated the securities act by misstating material information in both the registration statement and the prospectus.lastly,plaintiffs assert that the control persons of gmac,namely general motors,should be held liable under of the securities act of.see.
we conduct de novo review of a district court decision to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim under federal rule of civil procedure b.campbell pmi food equip.group,cir.when conducting such review,we generally accept the factual allegations contained in the plaintiffs complaint as long they rise above the level of speculation.we need not,however,accept as true legal conclusions or unwarranted factual inferences.id.at.we can also affirm on grounds other than those accepted by the district court.miller champion,cir.
statutory standing 
sections and a create causes of action founded on misleading statements,misstatements,or omissions in a registration statement or a prospectus,respectively.a,a.because both causes of action are tied to an offering document or oral communication,only those who acquired securities in the offering to which the document or oral communication pertains have standing to sue.id.based on this rationale,the district court found that the named plaintiffs in this case lacked statutory standing to sue regarding ten of the named offerings,because the named plaintiffs had purchased bonds only in the second smartnotes offering.
while we have grave concerns about such an analysis,we need not reach the question regarding the named plaintiffs standing to represent the alleged class.if it is found,prior to class certification,that the named plaintiffs individual claims are without merit,then dismissal is proper.see,sprague general motors,cir shipp memphis area office,cir see also kim commandant,cir per curiam.because we find below that plaintiffs claims are meritless,we need not address whether they would have had standing to represent the purported class.
ii.alleged violations of and a of the securities act of 
plaintiffs allege that defendants violated and a of the securities act by omitting material facts they had a duty to disclose and by misstating material facts.section imposes a duty of disclosure for an issuer registration statement.it holds liable any issuer who fails to disclose a material fact required to be stated therein.a.sections and both impose a duty to disclose additional facts when a statement of material fact made by the issuer is misleading,and they both impose liability for failing to fulfill that duty of disclosure as well as for misstating a material fact.a.
violation by omission 
plaintiffs allege that defendants violated the securities act by omitting information it was required to include in the registration statement.see a.there are two accepted methods of determining whether a duty exists for the offeror to disclose certain information in the context of a public offering.first,an offeror is to disclose all material information required to be disclosed by statute.city of monroe employees ret.bridgestone,cir see also stating that a person is liable when a registration statement omits a material fact required to be stated therein.second,an offeror has a duty to disclose any additional information required to make another statement,whether required or voluntarily made,not misleading.rubin schottenstein,cir en banc.the plaintiffs additionally urge that insider trading analysis should give rise to a third circumstance under which a company making a public offering has a duty to disclose.city of monroe employees ret,at.we analyze each in turn.
disclosure 
plaintiffs allege that gmac was required to disclose that gm had overstated its cash flows for fiscal years and,that gm had a dollar pension liability for delphi,and that gm had incorrectly accounted for supplier rebates,which inflated gm net income in quarters to which the supplier rebates were not attributable.plaintiffs allege that this information falls under regulation,item disclosure requirements.see a.specifically,plaintiffs cite item demands that the registrant provide such other information that the registrant believes to be necessary to an understanding of its financial condition,changes in financial condition and results of operations,a include other statistical data the registrant believes will enhance a reader understanding of its financial condition,id.at instruction and i dentify any known trends or any known demands,commitments,events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in the registrant liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way,a.
neither of the first two citations to a provide support for plaintiffs assertions in this case.the language and context of the first two requirements cited make clear that they only require the registrant to provide information regarding the results that have already occurred.see,a,instruction generally,the discussion shall cover the three year period covered by the financial statements.plaintiffs do not allege that the undisclosed information had an effect on gmac current,reported financial condition.plaintiffs are instead claiming that this information,when disclosed,would impact gmac condition,and that gmac had a duty to disclose that information because it would have a future effect.
section a mandate imposes a duty,but we do not think it extends as broadly as plaintiffs contend.the section requires gmac to i dentify any known trends or any known demands,commitments,events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in the registrant liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way.liquidity is defined as the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet the enterprise needs for cash.a,instruction.
the problem for the plaintiffs is that they do not contend that gmac had any knowledge about the information at gm instead,they specifically only contend that the information was knowable to gmac.see,pls.reply br.at citing paragraph of the complaint,which lists directors of gmac and the positions some of them had in gm,for support that the plaintiffs pleaded that it was knowable,rather than known,information.knowable,then,extends the duty to disclose information to include a duty to first investigate and then disclose.this,however,directly contradicts the text of item,which only requires disclosure of known trends or any known demands,commitments,events or uncertainties a,ii,ii 
plaintiffs attempt,but fail,to overcome the plain text of item by pointing to the fact that section does not require scienter.section,however,only imposes strict liability on those who fail to include information required to be stated in the registration statement.a.some of the duties of disclosures,the breaches of which section makes actionable,do require knowledge.this includes item,which only imposes a duty to make projections regarding information known to the registrant.a,ii,ii.section does not amend item requirement of knowledge.instead,section does not impose a further requirement of knowledge,as a fraud action would.if it did,the plaintiff would have to prove that defendant knew of an event that was reasonably likely to impact its liquidity thereby having a duty to disclose under item and that defendant knowingly failed to disclose this information when preparing its registration statement thereby violating a version of section that had a knowledge requirement.defendants therefore would presumably be able to defend such an action by claiming that while it was aware of the information at one time thereby giving rise to the item duty,it had forgotten the information when preparing the registration statement thereby immunizing it from liability under section.while section does not require any additional knowledge,that does not change the fact that the duty of disclosure arising from item does require knowledge.
disclosure required to render statements not misleading 
plaintiffs allege that gmac disclosed information that misled investors into believing something untrue because gmac did not also disclose other,contextual information.specifically,plaintiffs claim that gmac disclosed credit rating and the coupon rate on its bonds were materially misleading,that gmac disclosed inextricable links with gm were materially misleading,and that gmac statements that gm had overall improvement and that the outlook for gm improved were materially misleading.
gmac credit rating and coupon rate 
gmac disclosed credit rating and coupon rate on its bonds were not materially misleading.the plaintiffs assert that when gmac disclosed the credit rating it was assigned by credit ratings agencies,it was warranting that the rating was an accurate reflection of its risk of default.additionally,the plaintiffs contend that when gmac attached a coupon rate to its bonds,it was warranting that this was the correct market rate of interest for gmac to pay given gmac risk of default.neither of these assertions are valid.
gmac did not warrant its credit rating,and therefore can not be held to have misled investors when disclosing it.a person misleads another when he says something and the communication can also be fairly understood to mean something materially different than what the speaker states.when gmac disclosed its credit rating,it generally said something along the lines of,standard poor has our credit rating to x because it was concerned about y.the question,then,is whether,by disclosing its credit rating,gmac was implying that the credit rating agency opinion regarding gmac risk of default was accurate and should be relied upon.
gmac disclosure of its credit rating was merely a true statement of historical fact.credit ratings are unique.investors consider credit rating agencies opinions important,and investors want to know those opinions,regardless of whether the company agrees or disagrees with the agencies opinions.see,frank partnoy,the siskel and ebert of financial markets two thumbs down for the credit rating agencies,see also frank partnoy,how and why credit rating agencies are not like other gatekeepers,in financial gatekeepers,yasuyuki fuchita robert litan,hereinafter financial gatekeepers referring to credit rating agencies as financial market gatekeepers and describing how investors consider credit ratings important and rely on them as independently valuable justin pettit,comment by justin pettit,in financial gatekeepers,similar.the investors do not allege that gmac lied to or misled the credit rating agencies,and there is no allegation in the complaint that would support such an assertion the opinions,then,were arrived at through the agencies usual methods,and all information they requested from gmac to formulate their opinion was provided their opinions,therefore,were accurate according to the agencies methods for determining risk of default because investors assigned independent meaning to the credit rating assigned by the agencies,they would not assume,absent any language to the contrary,that gmac was in any way warranting the accuracy of the rating.see,in re detre estate,holding that a trustee had not breached his fiduciary duty by investing in certain railroad bonds partly because moody had given the bonds a very high credit rating accord in re winburn will,misc,finding certain securities to be seasoned rather than speculative due to the credit rating they had received from moody.neither would the investors assume that,without saying so,gmac was agreeing or disagreeing with the credit rating agencies reasons for upgrading or downgrading gmac credit rating.gmac disclosure of its credit rating,therefore,was not materially misleading.
the coupon rate on the bond was not misleading for similar reasons.the coupon rate was in fact accurately stated the amount of interest that gmac would be paying on the bonds.gmac never went further and stated that the coupon rate was the fairest rate of interest for it to pay investors or that it somehow reflected gmac entire risk of default.a reasonable investor reads the coupon rate and takes from it that gmac was willing to pay a certain rate of interest on its bonds.a reasonable investor would then investigate whether or not she or he was willing to accept that rate of interest for the investment,not assume,absent a statement to the contrary,that gmac had incorporated all material information into its determination of the coupon rate and rely solely on that.the coupon rate,therefore,was not materially misleading.
gmac inextricable links with gm 
gmac statement regarding its inextricable links with gm was similarly not materially misleading.the plaintiffs main error in believing the statement misleading is their misconception of the law as imposing a broader duty of disclosure than it actually does.the plaintiffs believe that if gmac says anything about a topic or discusse s the subject,that gmac then must disclose all material,adverse information about that general topic or subject.pls.br.at.for instance,plaintiffs claim that when gmac raised the issue of gm performance being important to gmac,gmac was then required to disclose all material,adverse information it knew about gm.this is surely not the law.
a company has to disclose additional information only when what it has disclosed would be rendered misleading without that additional information.see a,a.gmac statement that it has inextricable links with gm is not misleading.the plaintiffs have not even alleged what other,untrue fact investors were misled into believing by that statement.this is probably because the statement does not lead any reasonable investor into believing anything about gm condition.gmac was not in any way stating that gm was doing well,that gm disclosures were all completely accurate,or anything else.gmac was merely making a true statement regarding its ties with gm,its parent company.
the plaintiffs expansive notion of the law comes from selective quotations from one of our prior cases and two cases from other circuits.they quote helwig vencor,cir quoting rubin schottenstein,cir en banc,for the proposition that an issuer must provide complete and information with respect to subjects on which he undertakes to speak.while reference to subjects might support the plaintiffs contentions,further reading of the case clearly disavows them.the defendant in helwig had publicly disclosed its alleged inability to determine the impact a bill pending in congress would have on its performance,and had also disclosed projections regarding its future earnings.at.in fact,however,the defendant had completed an internal assessment of the bill and had concluded that it would have a grave impact on future earnings.id.the defendant,therefore,had either misstated the facts,or it had misled investors because,while it may have meant that no definitive or accurate conclusions can be drawn,it implied that it can not assess the potential impact of the pending legislation in any way at that point in time.id.at.
the difference between helwig and our case is clear.the statement there misled investors into believing something that was in fact not true.here there is no allegation regarding what falsehood the investors were misled into believing from gmac statement,nor is there any rational way an investor can draw a false conclusion based on gmac simple assertion that it has inextricable links to gm.this distinction is also clear,despite selective quotations that may imply the contrary,when looking at rubinstein collins,cir and in re time warner.sec,cir.under this case law,gmac statement regarding inextricable links was not misleading.
gmac statements regarding gm performance 
plaintiffs also allege that gmac included materially misleading statements in its,which was filed in early.the specific statement at issue is as follows 
gmac,beginning in the third quarter of,has benefited from a significant reduction in unsecured borrowing spreads consistent with the overall
