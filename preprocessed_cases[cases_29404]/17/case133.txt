this appeal arises from the merger of ag,a german corporation and owner of the brand,and chrysler corporation,one of the big three american automakers.prior to closing,the merger had been billed as a merger of equals,with management of the new company,daimlerchrysler ag,to be shared equally between former and chrysler executives.shortly after the merger,however,several former chrysler executives left the company,leaving a greater share of control to the former executives.in,the ceo of daimlerchrysler,jurgen schrempp,made public statements suggesting that these management changes were exactly what he and other executives had wanted prior to the merger.in response,various chrysler shareholders,including kirk kerkorian investment company,tracinda corporation,brought suit against daimlerchrysler,schrempp,manfred gentz,and hilmar kopper defendants,alleging fraud,misrepresentation,and other violations of the federal securities laws in connection with the merger.the chrysler shareholders alleged that,had they known the merger was a takeover,rather than a merger of equals,they would have demanded a premium upon consummation of the merger.
the cases were consolidated before the united states district court for the district of delaware.defendants reached a settlement with most of the plaintiffs.tracinda case,however,culminated in a bench trial.in april,the district court issued a lengthy written opinion,finding in favor of defendants on all counts.tracinda appealed that finding,as well as the district court rulings striking tracinda demand for a jury trial and dismissing defendant hilmar kopper for lack of personal jurisdiction.defendants have,contending that the district court erred in its decision,levying a sanction against them for discovery violations.defendants have also appealed the district court denial of their motion for summary judgment on statute of limitations grounds 
background 
none of the district court factual findings is challenged on tracinda appeal.we derive the factual portion of the following summary from the district court opinion.see tracinda daimlerchrysler ag,d.our summary of the procedural history draws from the entire record.
factual findings 
tracinda corporation is a holding company,involved primarily in private investment.its chairman,chief executive officer,and sole shareholder is kirk kerkorian.prior to the merger of and chrysler corporation in,tracinda was the largest holder of chrysler stock at approximately.between and,kerkorian had a contentious relationship with chrysler managers.he frequently pressured them for stock buybacks,stock splits,and dividend increases,and he threatened to initiate a proxy fight in.in,chrysler and kerkorian settled their differences with various agreements.among other things,chrysler agreed to appoint a tracinda designee,james aljian,to the chrysler board of directors.
with aljian on chrysler board,kerkorian acquired significant inside information about the company.in,aljian reported to kerkorian that he believed chrysler managers were inept and the company faced imminent financial trouble.consequently,kerkorian considered selling large blocks of tracinda chrysler shares and also looked into the possibility of a merger partner for chrysler.kerkorian approached bob eaton,the chairman and ceo of chrysler,to discuss a possible combination with.at that time,kerkorian learned that eaton had already spoken with jurgen schrempp,the chairman of board of management,about possibly merging chrysler with.kerkorian consulted jerome york,tracinda and the former chief financial officer of chrysler.york advised kerkorian that now is the time for the merger because chrysler faced imminent financial risk.york analyzed various issues relating to the potential merger,including the tax consequences for tracinda,and reported his findings to kerkorian.kerkorian was enthusiastic about the merger as it would provide tremendous value to chrysler shareholders.
schrempp and eaton were the primary negotiators for and chrysler.over the course of several meetings,the two ceos discussed various aspects of the proposed merger,including the tax consequences of incorporating the new company as an american corporation,as a german aktiengesellschaft ag,or as a corporate entity in another nation such as holland.schrempp and eaton discussed the feasibility of joint management shared equally among executives from and chrysler.eventually,the term merger of equals was used to describe the proposed transaction.
in a memo to kerkorian,aljian described the proposed management composition of the new company,daimlerchrysler,and also characterized the merger as a merger of equals without elaboration.kerkorian was not concerned with management structure and supported the merger even before the discussions about corporate governance.kerkorian had some discussions with eaton about the implementation of the merger,but they were reasonably general and not on a very deep level.kerkorian understood that the details of the merger would be incorporated into the business combination agreement bca.
the chrysler board received a fairness opinion from credit suisse first boston csfb,assessing the value of chrysler shares in light of the proposed merger.csfb analyzed the merger as a strategic business combination,not involving a sale of or change in control which might warrant a control premium in determining that the proposed merger was fair to chrysler shareholders,csfb considered sixteen previously announced or completed transactions viewed as comparable.for each earlier merger of equals,csfb listed one company as the acquiror and one company as the target and noted that the distribution of seats on the combined company boards was not always equal between acquiror and target.
on may,the chrysler board of directors unanimously approved the merger and recommended that the chrysler shareholders do the same.on that same day,simultaneously with the execution of the bca,tracinda,kerkorian,chrysler,and executed the stockholder agreement sha,which obligated tracinda to vote its shares in favor of the merger.the sha contained a jury waiver clause 
each of the parties hereto agrees to waive any right to a trial by jury with respect to any claim,counterclaim or action arising out of or in connection with this agreement or the transactions completed hereby.
schrempp signed the sha on behalf of he did not sign in his individual capacity.the agreement was negotiated at arm length with both sides represented by counsel and other advisors.
substantively,the sha did not use the term merger of equals and contained no representations concerning corporate governance.rather,the sha referred to the bca,which described the shared governance structure of the new company.although the bca used the term merger of equals and contained a lengthy definition section,the bca did not define that term.
on august,the proxy statement and prospectus proxy which described the proposed merger between and chrysler and sought shareholder approval for the filed with the sec.the proxy was mailed to the chrysler shareholders along with several attached documents,including a cover letter from eaton,the bca,and the csfb opinion.the proxy stated,among other things,that daimlerchrysler ag would be the surviving entity,it would be incorporated in germany,and it would have two headquarters in auburn hills,michigan,and stuttgart,germany.the proxy explained that the german ag form was chosen primarily for its tax advantages.the proxy described various risks relating to the merger,including the difficulties inherent in integrating two large corporations from different countries and business cultures.the proxy reiterated the terms of the bca corporate governance provisions,noting among other things that the daimlerchrysler supervisory board would consist of shareholder representatives designated by,another from chrysler,and labor representatives the daimlerchrysler management board would initially consist of members designated by,another from chrysler,and members from daimler group and schrempp and eaton would serve as of daimlerchrysler for three years.the proxy included a clear standalone clause that stated these initial management structures could change after the merger was consummated.kerkorian did not concern himself with the proxy because he had already committed in the sha to voting for the merger.
the proxy repeatedly used the term merger of equals but did not expressly define it.the term is first used in the proxy to describe the similar size of the and chrysler constituencies and later used to describe the joint leadership of the new company,as provided in the bca.the term is used in eaton cover letter in a similar fashion.the proxy also used the term in reference to csfb fairness opinion,which compared the proposed merger to earlier strategic combinations not involving a sale of control.
after a media campaign by and chrysler to foster support for the proposed merger of equals,the chrysler shareholders voted overwhelmingly for the merger.chrysler shareholders received approximately of daimlerchrysler outstanding shares and shareholders received approximately.on november,the merger closed consistent with the provisions in the bca,including those relating to shared corporate governance.
for two years,the composition of the daimlerchrysler supervisory board did not change of the shareholder representatives were former chrysler directors.as provided for in the bca,the daimlerchrysler management board initially consisted of designees from and from chrysler.because the management board acted by consensus rather than through formal votes,the initial disparity between chrysler and designees was not significant.the managers from chrysler were able to provide their input with regard to all operations of daimlerchrysler and their opinions were taken seriously.the integration committee,a transitional body provided for in the bca,was formed with of its members from chrysler and from,pursuant to the terms of the bca.this committee was later renamed the shareholder committee.aljian was a member of the shareholder committee until kerkorian directed him to resign on november.consistent with the bca,daimlerchrysler maintained two operational headquarters,in stuttgart and auburn hills.
because both and chrysler designees considered the management board to be too large,approximately a year after the merger the board was reduced to members.five of the remaining members were chrysler designees.at the time,neither aljian nor kerkorian was concerned about this imbalance.the three chrysler designees who first left the management board were dennis pawley voluntarily retired,ted cunningham asked to resign,and thomas stallkamp fired.later,on january,eaton also voluntarily retired.the bca had stated that eaton would remain for three years,but eaton chose to depart early for personal reasons.in late,another former chrysler executive,james holden,was removed from the management board.holden had been placed in charge of the chrysler brands after eaton retirement and was held responsible for the chrysler group million loss in the third quarter of.most board members,including those designated by chrysler,supported the removal of holden in light of the chrysler group abysmal performance.at the time of trial,only one executive from chrysler,tom sidlik,remained on the management board four former chrysler directors served on the supervisory board.
in late,the management changes at daimlerchrysler were widely reported in the press.because the germans were taking over a larger share of management control in the new company,there was widespread speculation that,contrary to its billing,the merger between and chrysler had not been a merger of equals.around this time,schrempp agreed to interviews with the london financial times and barron magazine.during these interviews,schrempp made various statements suggesting that,in order to close the merger,he had intentionally misled the public,chrysler shareholders,and chrysler management into thinking the merger was a merger of equals,even though he had no intention of sharing control of the combined company with the americans.for example,in the financial times,schrempp was quoted as saying 
me being a chess player,i do normally talk about the second or third move.the structure we have now with chrysler as a standalone division was always the structure i wanted.we had to go a roundabout way but it had to be done for psychological reasons.if i had gone and said chrysler would be a division,everybody on their side would have said,there is no way we do a deal.but it precisely what i wanted to do.
in barron,schrempp was quoted as saying 
we said in spirit it was a merger of equals,but in our minds we knew how we wanted to structure the company,and today i have it.i have daimler,and i have divisions.
schrempp did not deny making these statements and never issued a correction or demanded a retraction.
procedural history 
a few months after these interviews were made public in late,tracinda filed suit against,daimlerchrysler,and daimlerchrysler executives schrempp,manfred gentz,and hilmar kopper collectively daimlerchrysler in its complaint,tracinda alleged violations of sections b,a,and a of the securities exchange act of and sec rules and promulgated thereunder and sections,a,and of the securities act of.tracinda also alleged common law fraud and civil conspiracy.prior to trial,tracinda voluntarily dropped its act claims.in addition,daimlerchrysler successfully moved to dismiss tracinda civil conspiracy claim,and kopper successfully moved for dismissal of the action against him,based on lack of personal jurisdiction.daimlerchrysler unsuccessfully moved for summary judgment on statute of limitations grounds,but its motion to strike tracinda jury demand was granted.a bench trial commenced on the remaining claims for common law fraud and act violations under,and against the remaining defendants,daimlerchrysler,schrempp,and gentz.
after a bench trial,the district court issued a opinion with pages of factual findings the factual findings are not challenged on appeal.in its opinion,the district court made numerous rulings,including dismissing gentz for lack of personal jurisdiction,concluding that tracinda could allege its claim,entering judgment for daimlerchrysler on tracinda oral misrepresentation claims under and because tracinda failed to prove daimlerchrysler made any false or misleading oral statements,entering judgment for daimlerchrysler on tracinda written misrepresentation claims under and because tracinda failed to prove daimlerchrysler made any false or misleading written statements concluding that,even if tracinda did show that daimlerchrysler oral or written statements were false or misleading under or,those misrepresentations would not have been material to tracinda,a sophisticated party with insider information,entering judgment for daimlerchrysler on tracinda control person claim under,as that claim is predicated on a primary violation of the federal securities law such as a violation of or and tracinda failed to prove a primary violation at trial,and entering judgment for daimlerchrysler on tracinda common law fraud claim,as that claim requires a showing of misrepresentation,and misrepresentation was not proven at trial.
of these rulings,tracinda appeals only the district court decision with respect to the written misrepresentation claim.specifically,tracinda alleges that the district court erred by concluding that daimlerchrysler statements were not false or misleading,by applying a subjective standard rather than an objective one in assessing the materiality of the alleged misrepresentations,and,along a similar line,by requiring tracinda to prove reliance,which is not an element of a a claim.tracinda also appeals the district court orders granting daimlerchrysler motion to strike the jury demand and kopper motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction 
on,daimlerchrysler challenges two other rulings by the district court.daimlerchrysler asserts that the district court abused its discretion by levying a dollar discovery sanction against daimlerchrysler absent bad faith and particularized proof of costs and fees.daimlerchrysler also contends that,if the district court judgment is not affirmed in all respects,this court should reverse the district court denial of daimlerchrysler motion for summary judgment on statute of limitations grounds.
ii.discussion 
subject matter jurisdiction was premised on section of the securities exchange act of,section of the securities act of,and and.we have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to and.tracinda appeal and daimlerchrysler are timely under and fed.a a and a.
jury trial waiver 
in granting daimlerchrysler motion to strike tracinda jury demand,the district court concluded that the stockholder agreement entered into by tracinda,kerkorian,and chrysler contained a broadly worded jury trial waiver that covered the claims brought by tracinda against defendants.the district court determined that,in light of the business sophistication of all parties involved,the waiver was entered into knowingly and voluntarily.the district court also found that the waiver covered the individual defendants,schrempp and gentz,who are not parties to the agreement the district court based these conclusions on ordinary agency principles that we have previously applied when interpreting agreements to arbitrate.
although tracinda does not contest that the jury waiver covers and chrysler,tracinda asks us to remand for a jury trial involving both corporate and individual defendants because it claims that parallel trials involving common issues of fact and law a bench trial for the corporate defendants and a jury trial for the individual defendants would be unworkable and in violation of the seventh amendment.daimlerchrysler argues in opposition that the district court correctly construed the sha by applying the jury waiver to all defendants.daimlerchrysler contends that the district court applied the appropriate constitutional standard for assessing the validity of the jury waiver and that it was appropriate for the district court to look to the arbitration clause cases for ordinary agency and equitable estoppel principles.
to decide this issue,we must determine whether a valid contractual jury waiver provision,which applies to a signatory corporation,will also apply to a nonsignatory officer acting as an agent of the signatory corporation.
because tracinda has not challenged the district court findings that the jury waiver was valid and that schrempp was an agent of,we are left to determine whether the district court correctly construed the jury waiver provision to cover the agent of the signatory principal 
the right to a jury trial in a civil case is a fundamental right expressly protected by the seventh amendment to the united states constitution.aetna ins.kennedy.bouriez carnegie mellon,cir.the question of a waiver of a constitutional right,including the seventh amendment right to a jury trial,is a federal question controlled by federal law.see brookhart janis,d in re city of phila,cir.federal courts apply federal law in determining whether a contractual jury trial waiver is enforceable.see,irving trust,cir.using federal law to determine the jury trial right assures the uniformity in its exercise which is demanded by the seventh amendment.simler conner,d per curiam.
because the right of jury trial is fundamental,courts indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver.aetna,at.collins gov t of virgin islands,cir.nevertheless,as with other constitutional rights,the supreme court has long recognized that a private litigant may waive the right to a jury trial in a civil case.commodity futures trade comm schor,d in re city of phila,cir equip.rental,hendrix,cir see also.to be valid,a jury waiver must be made knowingly and voluntarily based on the facts of the case.brookhart,at.hendrix,at james moore et,moore federal practice ed.supp see also first union bank united states,d,listing factors.
tracinda does not challenge the district court finding that the contractual jury waiver was entered into knowingly and voluntarily.rather,tracinda argues that the district court erred as a matter of law by applying an agency principle used in arbitration clause cases such as pritzker merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir,to hold that schrempp,a agent,is covered by the waiver.tracinda points out that,while all reasonable presumptions should be construed against jury waivers,collins,at,courts have construed arbitration agreements in light of the federal arbitration act faa policy that any doubts concerning the scope of arbitral issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration pritzker,at.tracinda contends that,by relying on arbitration clause cases,the district court applied a presumption in favor of jury waiver,when in fact the seventh amendment requires a presumption against waiver.
considering that the loss of the right to a jury trial is a necessary and fairly obvious consequence of an agreement to arbitrate,snowden checkpoint check cashing,cir,and that the submission of a case to arbitration involves a greater compromise of procedural protections than does the waiver of the right to trial by jury,gurfein sovereign group,pollak,some commentators consider it curious that courts apply a presumption in favor of an arbitration clause but against a mere jury waiver provision nevertheless,the tension between the cases favoring arbitration clauses and those disfavoring jury waivers does not affect the propriety of the district court reliance here on arbitration cases such as pritzker.the reason for this is that,in pritzker and similar arbitration clause cases,it is traditional agency principles of who is bound by an not the faa favoring of arbitration over a jury determined who was bound by the agreement to arbitrate.
in pritzker,pension plan trustees brought an erisa action against three brokerage firm that traded on behalf of the pension plan,the brokerage firm wholly owned subsidiary,which provided the pension plan with investment advice,and an individual broker who serviced the pension plan accounts.the trustees alleged violations,arising out of the cash management accounts opened with the brokerage firm.because each cash management agreement between the pension plan and the brokerage firm contained an arbitration clause,all defendants moved to compel arbitration,despite the fact that only the brokerage firm,and not the wholly owned subsidiary or the individual broker,was a party to the cash management agreements.the district court denied the motion to compel arbitration and the defendants appealed.on appeal,the trustees defended the district court ruling by urging that they could not be compelled to arbitrate because two of the three subsidiary and the not signatories to any agreement containing an arbitration clause.we rejected this argument and reversed the order of the district court based on traditional agency theory principles.pritzker,at.specifically,we stated that,b ecause a principal is bound under the terms of a valid arbitration clause,its agents,employees,and representatives are also covered under the terms of such agreements.id.
relying on pritzker,the district court rejected tracinda argument that the individual defendants,who did not sign the agreement containing the jury waiver,were not bound by it.the district court held that the jury waiver covered both the signatory corporations and its nonsignatory officers and directors.this was a proper of whether the jury waiver was knowing and enforceable,tracinda conceded of who,under traditional agency principles,was bound by that agreement.
the pritzker nonsignatory agents may invoke a valid arbitration agreement entered into by their and supported by other decisions of this court.see barrowclough kidder,peabody,cir,overruled on other grounds by pritzker,at holding that contingent beneficiaries inchoate and derivative claims should not entitle them to maintain separate litigation in a forum that has been waived by the principal beneficiary.isidor paiewonsky,sharp,cir holding that an arbitration agreement between a landlord and a head tenant also covered a subtenant,who was not a party to the agreement,where the head tenant and subtenant had interests that were directly related dupont de nemours rhone poulenc fiber resin intermediates,cir reaffirming that t raditional principles of agency law may bind a to an arbitration agreement.
tracinda,however,attempts to cast doubt on pritzker and similar cases by citing to our decision in chemrite,cir.in,a new jersey manufacturer,alleging various business torts against its south african distributor,brought suit to compel arbitration in new jersey based on arbitration agreements entered into by the manufacturer and a predecessor of the distributor.the manufacturer also alleged claims against various officers and directors of the distributor and sought to compel arbitration against them.the distributor and the individual defendants objected to arbitration.we held that the distributor was bound to arbitrate,at however,we also held that the individual defendants were not bound to arbitrate as they were not signatories to the arbitration agreements,id.at.we discussed pritzker and a similar case,letizia prudential bache,cir,but distinguished those cases because,like the instant case,they involved nonsignatory agents who sought to invoke an arbitration agreement entered into by their corporate principal,whereas involved nonsignatory agents who sought to avoid their principal agreement to arbitrate,at.this is not a distinction without a difference.dupont,at discussing the related concept of equitable estoppel as applied in the arbitration context and noting that courts are willing to estop a signatory from avoiding an arbitration clause but are reluctant to enforce an arbitration clause against a nonsignatory who seeks to avoid it see also,am.arbitration,cir same.in the instant action,schrempp,a nonsignatory agent,seeks to invoke the jury waiver provision in the agreement entered into by his corporate principal.therefore,pritzker and letizia are similar to the case before us and is distinguishable 
tracinda also relies on paracor fin.capital,cir and hulsey west,cir per curiam.however,like,these cases are distinguishable.in paracor,the court of appeals for the ninth circuit did not allow a nonsignatory financier and its ceo to invoke a jury waiver provision in a purchase agreement where they were not agents of the contracting party.at.clearly paracor is distinguishable from pritzker and the instant action,where the were agents of the signatory principals.in hulsey,on a loan guarantor petition for writ of mandamus in which he sought to reinstate his jury demand,the court of appeals for the tenth circuit held that the nonsignatory guarantor was not bound by a jury waiver provision in an amendment to a loan agreement between the borrower and lender.at.the court in hulsey did not allow the signatory to enforce the waiver provision against the resistant nonsignatory who was being sued in his personal capacity.therefore,hulsey is also distinguishable.
as set out above,we conclude that,when a valid contractual jury trial waiver provision applies to a signatory corporation,the waiver also applies to nonsignatory directors and officers seeking to invoke the waiver as agents of the corporation.this rule is consistent with the concept that corporations can act only through agents and employees,at see also in re mulco,it is axiomatic that a corporation by structural necessity must act,if it acts at all,through its agents,aff sub nom.mulco,black,risk,bramwell.if we did not allow nonsignatory agents of a signatory corporation to invoke a valid contractual jury waiver provision,such an agreement would be of little practical value,trott paciolla,as it would be too easy to circumvent the agreements by naming individuals as defendants instead of the entity itself,roby of lloyd,cir.see also arnold arnold,cir i f appellant can avoid the practical consequences of an agreement to arbitrate by naming nonsignatory parties as defendants in his complaint the effect of the rule requiring arbitration would,in effect,be nullified.quotation marks and citations omitted 
next,we address tracinda alternate argument that the district court should have barred daimlerchrysler motion to strike tracinda jury demand on the basis of laches.because laches is an equitable doctrine,we review the district court decision for abuse of discretion.see holmes pension plan of bethlehem steel,cir.in order to successfully assert the defense of laches,tracinda must show inexcusable delay by daimlerchrysler,and prejudice to tracinda as a result of the delay.santana,bobrick washroom,cir.
daimlerchrysler moved to strike tracinda jury demand approximately three years after tracinda filed it.tracinda had demanded a jury trial against the individual defendants but not against the corporate defendants.daimlerchrysler motion to strike came after the close of discovery,about six weeks before trial and approximately eight months after daimlerchrysler filed its motions for summary judgment.when daimlerchrysler filed its motion to strike,the district court had not yet decided all of daimlerchrysler summary judgment motions.
tracinda contends that daimlerchrysler strategically and inexcusably delayed filing its motion to strike and consequently caused tracinda undue prejudice.tracinda argues that it would have conducted discovery differently had it known that it would be trying its case to the court rather than to a jury.tracinda asserts that it was unable to modify its trial strategy in time because the district court struck tracinda jury demand only a few weeks before trial.in opposition,daimlerchrysler contends that it did not inexcusably delay filing its motion to strike because the motion was filed in accordance with federal rule of civil procedure.daimlerchrysler also argues that tracinda could not have been prejudiced by daimlerchrysler delay because tracinda knew all along that its claims against the corporate defendants were likely to be tried by the court.daimlerchrysler points out that tracinda never demanded a jury trial against the corporate defendants,presumably because tracinda was fully aware that the sha jury waiver provision covered and chrysler.
parties have a great deal of latitude on the timing of motions to strike a jury demand.moore federal practice.since a court has the power to act sua sponte at any time under rule it follows that a court has the discretion to permit a motion to strike a jury demand at any time,even on the eve of trial.id.for example,in united states schoenborn,cir,the government filed a motion to strike the defendant jury demand one week before trial,and the district court granted the government motion one day before trial.id.at.on appeal,the defendant conceded that he had no constitutional or statutory right to a jury trial in light of the fact that the government suit for restoration of wetlands was in equity and defendant counterclaims were against the united states.nevertheless,the defendant asserted that the district court abused its discretion by striking his jury demand because the government motion came immediately before trial and was in violation of the court pretrial scheduling order.citing rule a,the court of appeals for the eighth circuit rejected defendant argument.id.see united states,rejecting laches defense to government motion to strike defendant jury demand where government waited five years to file its motion but defendant showed no resulting prejudice from the delay other than the mere lapse of time.
because a party may file a motion to strike a jury demand at any time under rule a,we conclude that daimlerchrysler did not commit inexcusable delay by filing its motion to strike after the close of discovery.having reached this conclusion,we need not consider whether daimlerchrysler delay caused prejudice to tracinda 
the district court did not abuse its discretion by rejecting tracinda laches defense.as discussed above,tracinda does not challenge the district court findings that the sha jury waiver is valid,that it covers the claims brought by tracinda,and that schrempp is an agent of,a signatory to the sha.therefore,in light of our holding that a nonsignatory agent of a signatory corporation may invoke a contractual jury waiver provision,we will affirm the district court order striking tracinda jury demand as to all defendants.
written misrepresentation under 
after a bench trial,the district court issued a very thorough written opinion devoting over pages to findings of fact and over pages to conclusions of law,only one of which is challenged on appeal,the conclusion that no misrepresentation had occurred under a of the securities exchange act of and rule promulgated thereunder.
section a is designed to prevent management or others from obtaining authorization for corporate actions by means of deceptive or inadequate disclosures in proxy solicitations.seinfeld becherer,cir quotation marks omitted.section a makes it unlawful to solicit a proxy in contravention of such rules and regulations as the sec may prescribe as necessary and appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.a.rule,which the sec promulgated under a,provides that no proxy statement shall contain any statement which,at the time and in the light of the circumstances under which it is made,is false or misleading with respect to any material fact,or which omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not false or misleading or necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of a proxy for the same meeting or subject matter which has become false or misleading.a emphasis added.
pursuant to case borak,d,which found an implied private right of action under a,shareholders are authorized to sue for damages when a misrepresentation in a proxy statement interferes with fair corporate suffrage.id.at.to prevail on a a claim,a plaintiff must show that a proxy statement contained a material misrepresentation or omission which caused the plaintiff injury and that the proxy solicitation itself,rather than the particular defect in the solicitation materials,was an essential link in the accomplishment of the transaction.cal.pub.employees ret.chubb,cir citing cathcart,cir citing mills,d.to be actionable under rule,a statement or omission must have been misleading at the time it was made liability can not be imposed on the basis of subsequent events.in re nahc.sec,cir.information is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important in deciding how to vote.shaev saper,cir citing tsc,northway,d.in order to succeed,a a claim that relies on the undisclosed intent and unclean heart of a director must also be accompanied by objective and external evidence of actual misrepresentation.lewis chrysler,cir see also virginia bankshares,sandberg,d holding that a liability may not be established on mere disbelief or undisclosed motive without any demonstration that the proxy statement was false or misleading.
at trial,tracinda sought to prove that daimlerchrysler made false misleading statements omissions in the proxy and associated documents with regard to four topics material to tracinda decision to vote in favor of the proposed merger at the stock price offered to chrysler shareholders.first and foremost,tracinda alleged that daimlerchrysler made misrepresentations in the proxy,together with eaton cover letter and the attached bca,by characterizing the proposed merger as a merger of equals.second,tracinda alleged that the proxy contained misrepresentations and omissions relating to the reasons for choosing the german ag corporate form and the extent of the negotiations behind that decision.third,tracinda alleged that the proxy omitted certain risk factors of the merger,including the possibility that the shared corporate governance structure provided for in the bca could be altered in favor of former executives shortly after closing.fourth,tracinda alleged that a press release attached to chrysler sec form,filed to announce the proposed merger and incorporated by reference by the proxy,falsely stated that the two daimlerchrysler management board members representing interests from the side would be members.
after trial,the district court concluded that tracinda had not shown that the proxy and associated documents contained any misrepresentations under a and rule.the district court also concluded,as a secondary basis for its decision,that even if the statements and omissions at issue were false or misleading,they had not been material to tracinda decision to vote its shares in favor of the proposed merger.the district court noted that,prior to the merger,tracinda had been focused on the economics of the transaction,not corporate governance or structural issues.the district court also concluded that tracinda,a highly sophisticated investor with unique access to the chrysler board,did not rely on the proxy documents in deciding how to vote.the district court noted that tracinda had committed to vote for the merger,by way of the stockholder agreement,before the proxy solicitation and release.thus,the alleged misrepresentations in the proxy could not have caused injury to tracinda.
on appeal,tracinda argues that the district court erred by concluding that the proxy and associated documents did not contain any actionable misrepresentations,by applying a subjective standard rather than an objective one in assessing the materiality of the alleged misrepresentations,and,along a similar line,by requiring tracinda to prove causation by demonstrating its reliance on the alleged misrepresentations where no such proof was required.
with regard to whether there were written misrepresentations,tracinda argues that plenary review applies for two reasons.first,the district court finding of no written misrepresentation is similar to a finding made upon a rule b motion to dismiss.second,in finding the term merger of equals not false or misleading,the district court engaged in contract construction of the bca.we do not agree,however,that plenary review applies.whether any particular representation in the proxy was false or misleading is a question of fact subject to review under the clearly erroneous standard.see healey chelsea,cir matters of misrepresentation,knowledge,reliance,causation,and scienter are questions of fact,and the trial court findings as to those facts may not be set aside unless they are clearly erroneous.citing.a.furthermore,plenary review is not appropriate here because tracinda did not allege breach of contract it alleged fraud and violations of the federal securities laws.the district court engaged in interpretation of the bca corporate governance provisions in order to decipher the meaning of the term merger of equals,as it was used in the proxy,for the purposes of determining whether any misrepresentation had occurred.the district court did not engage in construction of the bca in order to determine the legal relations of the bca signatories pursuant to that contract.see john harkins waldinger,cir noting that contract determination of what ideas the contract language induces in other persons is a question of fact reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard,whereas contract construction the determination of the legal relations of the parties to the a question of law reviewed under the de novo standard quoting corbin,corbin on contracts at.we will review the district court finding of no misrepresentation for clear error.under the clearly erroneous standard,a finding of fact may be reversed on appeal only if it is completely devoid of a credible evidentiary basis or bears no rational relationship to the supporting data.shire,barr,cir citation omitted.
because we agree with the district court that,as a factual matter,the proxy and associated documents contained no misrepresentations,we need not reach the second and third issues on appeal,regarding the proper legal standards for determining materiality and causation.
merger of equals 
we begin with the most prominent alleged written misrepresentation,the characterization of the merger of and chrysler as a merger of equals.we must answer two questions.first,as a factual matter,was the district court definition of the term merger of equals clearly erroneous second,also as a factual matter,was it clearly erroneous for the district court to find the term merger of equals,so defined,not false or misleading 
as described by the district court,the term merger of equals appears in three relevant documents the,which solicited chrysler shareholder approval for the proposed merger eaton cover letter to the proxy,which introduced the proposed merger and announced a special stockholder meeting and the bca,which dictated the terms of the business combination and was attached and referred to in the proxy.
of these three documents,language describing a merger of equals appears in eaton cover letter as follows 
the chrysler merger and the other transactions described in the attached proxy together will have the effect of combining the businesses,stockholder groups,managements and other constituencies of chrysler and in a merger of equals transaction.daimlerchrysler ag will bring together two companies with equal financial strength under the joint leadership of both management groups and with its common equity about evenly split between the two shareholder groups 
eaton cover letter demonstrates that merger of equals could refer to the similar size and strength of and chrysler,or the joint corporate governance that was to be shared between managers from both both.because tracinda did not claim that and chrysler were not equal in size or strength at the time of the merger,the district court focused on the corporate governance aspect of the merger.
the district court noted that the proxy repeatedly referred to the proposed transaction as a merger of equals but failed to define the term.the proxy reiterated the joint governance provisions for the combined company as set forth in the bca and made reference to t he merger of equals corporate governance structure contemplated by the bca.importantly,the district court concluded that the proxy made clear that these joint governance provisions were initial management compositions subject to change after consummation of the merger and that vacancies in the management board of the new company could be filled without regard to former corporate affiliation.the district court emphasized that the proxy clearly stated,in a standalone clause immediately following the summary of the bca corporate governance provisions,that the combination agreement bca contains no provision that would bar governance changes after the transactions have been consummated.
in the bca,the term merger of equals was first introduced as follows 
whereas,and chrysler desire to combine their respective businesses,stockholder groups,managements and other constituencies in a transaction upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this restated agreement 
whereas,chrysler and daimlerchrysler ag desire to make certain representations,warranties,covenants and agreements in connection with the transactions contemplated by this restated agreement 
the district court noted that the bca provided that daimlerchrysler ag shall have a corporate governance reflecting that the transactions contemplated herein are a merger of equals.based on this language,and the language in the proxy and eaton cover letter,the district court concluded,as a factual matter,that the term merger of equals was to be understood as incorporating the joint corporate governance provisions set forth in the bca.this conclusion was firmly grounded in the evidence presented at trial and was not clearly erroneous.
was it clearly erroneous then for the district court to find the term merger of equals,as defined in relation to the bca,not to be false or misleading in order to make this determination,we must assess whether daimlerchrysler followed the corporate governance structure set forth in the bca.pursuant to german law,the bca provided for a daimlerchrysler supervisory board responsible for appointing members to the management board and overseeing their operations.the bca states that the supervisory board shall consist of members,including labor representatives pursuant to german law,shareholder representatives designated by,and shareholder representatives designated by chrysler.the district court found that this provision was followed tracinda does not assert otherwise.at the time the district court issued its opinion,the supervisory board was about evenly split between and chrysler designees.
daimlerchrysler handling of the management board,however,is a more contentious issue.the changes to that board composition,as colored by schrempp comments in the financial times and barron,are what prompted tracinda to bring its suit.with respect to the management board composition,the bca states with emphasis added 
the management board of daimlerchrysler ag shall consist of members.in general,of such members shall be those designated by chrysler,and of such members shall be those designated by,and there will be two additional members with responsibility for businesses.for three years following the effective time,jurgen schrempp and robert eaton shall be the and of the management board of daimlerchrysler ag and members of the office of the chairmen of daimlerchrysler ag.if any person designated as a member of the office of the chairmen or the management board of daimlerchrysler ag ceases to be a employee of either chrysler or at or before the effective time,in the case of any such employee of on the date hereof or any such employee to be designated by,or chrysler,in the case of any such employee of chrysler on the date hereof or any such employee to be designated by chrysler,shall designate another person to serve in such person stead.as highlighted by the district court,the split 
between and chrysler designees was meant to be understood in general,initial terms.the bca provided for the right of chrysler and to replace a designee to the management board or office of the chairman if that individual ceased to be a employee of the company prior to the effective date of the merger,but no such provision exists for the departure of executives after the merger closed.other than the time frames placed on the,no provision of the bca specified how long the composition of the management board was to last after the merger closed.indeed,the proxy explicitly stated that the management board members chosen by and chrysler pursuant to the bca were initial designees.further,as noted by the district court,the bca provides that the governance structure is based on recommendations and is subject to the powers of the daimlerchrysler shareholders and the supervisory and management boards.as made clear in the proxy,the bca contains no provision that would bar governance changes after the merger has been consummated.therefore,the district court found that the changes to the management board composition,resulting in more designees sitting on the board than chrysler designees,were permitted under the bca.the district court explicitly found that t he merger closed consistent with the provisions in the bca.tracinda daimlerchrysler ag,d.
consequently,the district court concluded that tracinda had not proved,by a preponderance of the evidence,a misrepresentation based on use of the term merger of equals,as defined by the bca corporate governance provisions.the district court explained its decision as follows 
although the bca and the set forth proposals concerning the numbers of individuals on the management board and the supervisory board from each side of the transaction,those documents do not require the proposed compositions to last for any specific period of time,reiterate that the proposed compositions are initial compositions,state that the proposed compositions are recommendations subject to the rights and approval of the shareholders and the supervisory board,and make clear that changes to the corporate governance structure are not barred after consummation of the transaction.
id.at.this finding was firmly grounded in the evidence presented at trial and was not clearly erroneous.
in affirming this conclusion of the district court,we reject the primary argument pressed by tracinda in its briefs and during oral argument.tracinda vehemently insists that the district court conclusion that the bca corporate governance provisions apply only until the moment in time when daimlerchrysler was created renders the entire proxy solicitation process meaningless,except as a means to deceive and also renders the corporate governance provisions of the bca illusory.in effect,tracinda argues that due to the fact that the composition of the management board was gradually altered in favor of former executives in the years following the merger,we should set aside the district court finding that the bca corporate governance provisions were complied with.we reject this argument because,as noted above,the bca permitted these changes,and the proxy expressed this point in clear terms.
moreover,as noted by the district court,tracinda insistence upon a management board perpetually divided between designees and chrysler designees is potentially unworkable and legally flawed.upon closing,and chrysler merged into one new company,at which point there were no longer two independent companies to make future board membership designations.in addition,a rigid quota system based on nationality or former corporate affiliation might have prevented the supervisory board from making personnel decisions in the best interests of the shareholders,thus interfering with its fiduciary duty.
we also reject tracinda argument to the extent it suggests that the district court erred by drawing on the bca corporate governance provisions in defining merger of equals.tracinda does not identify any alternate source that might have better assisted the district court in defining the term merger of equals,other than perhaps tracinda own notion of fairness.even if tracinda had identified a suitable alternate source,that would not necessarily render the district court chosen definition clearly erroneous.the court definition is based on the evidence before it.
indeed,even if we were to define merger of equals in general terms of shared or joint control,without reference to specific bca provisions,we would still reject tracinda appeal in light of the district court findings of a degree of shared control by the managers from daimler and chrysler the management board did not take formal votes,but acted by consensus f ormer chrysler executives who served on daimlerchrysler board of management had the opportunity to provide input into all the operations of daimlerchrysler,including the former divisions and their views and opinions were taken seriously.tracinda,d at.
because we will affirm the district court factual finding that no written misrepresentation occurred in the proxy solicitation,we need not consider the effect of schrempp comments to the financial times and barron,since intent to deceive without actual misrepresentation is insufficient to prevail on a a claim.see virginia bankshares,sandberg,d lewis chrysler,cir see also in re nahc.sec,cir to be actionable under rule,a statement or omission must have been misleading at the time it was made liability can not be imposed on the basis of subsequent events.
other claims 
next,we briefly address tracinda remaining claims of misrepresentation in the proxy regarding the reasons for and negotiations behind the selection of the german ag form for daimlerchrysler,risk factors relating to the potential for corporate governance changes in favor of designees,and the voting status of the two management board members representing interests.
german ag form.at trial,tracinda argued that the proxy misrepresented the reasons for organizing daimlerchrysler as a german aktiengesellschaft ag,and the extent of the negotiations behind this decision.
with regard to the first claim,tracinda argued that the proxy falsely or misleadingly stated that the ag form was chosen because it best achieved both parties objectives which tracinda argued related to the governance structure of a merger of equals when in fact,according to tracinda,the ag form was chosen to facilitate schrempp secret takeover plan,or perhaps appease shareholders.the district court rejected this argument and found no such misrepresentation.the district court observed that the proxy did not define the parties objectives as the governance structure of a merger of equals.rather,the district court found that the proxy clearly linked the parties objectives to structural efficiency and favorable tax consequences for the,chrysler,and daimlerchrysler constituencies.after reviewing the language of the proxy and the evidence presented at trial,including testimony of both american and german executives of daimlerchrysler that was consistent with the proxy,the district court found that tax benefits were in fact the real reason for choosing the ag form therefore,no misrepresentation occurred.
on appeal,tracinda simply disagrees with the district court factual finding and reiterates its argument that it was erroneous to link the parties objectives to tax consequences,rather than to the shared corporate governance resulting from a merger of equals.tracinda argument is belied by the plain language of the proxy.as noted by the district court,the proxy explains the reasons for choosing the ag form as follows with emphasis added 
over the course of their discussions,the parties considered various alternative transaction structures for the combination of the two enterprises,including through a newly incorporated company,a company incorporated in the netherlands and either a newly organized german aktiengesellschaft or itself.the simplest structural solution,a direct merger of and chrysler,was not possible under german law.the parties believed that the structure for the transactions was the preferable alternative to a combination through a company or a company incorporated in the netherlands because this structure was believed to be the most tax efficient for the combined entity on an ongoing basis,could be to chrysler stockholders and to german stockholders and was the only structure which would enable the elimination of all minority stockholders of and chrysler thereby creating a parent corporation with one group of stockholders holding a single publicly traded equity security.the structure for the transactions was therefore selected because it best achieved both parties objectives.
the proxy clearly explained that the ag form was chosen for its tax benefits,and the testimony of executives from both sides of the merger supported the proxy explanation.therefore,we will affirm the district court finding of no misrepresentation as to the reasons for organizing daimlerchrysler as a german ag.
with regard to its second claim,tracinda argued at trial that the proxy misrepresented the extent of the negotiations behind the selection of the ag form.tracinda claimed that the proxy gave the false impression that the negotiations were not hotly debated and did not extend beyond march,even though evidence presented at trial suggested otherwise.the district court rejected this argument.the district court noted that the background of the transactions section of the proxy repeatedly referred to these negotiations and clearly explained that they occurred on and beyond april.on appeal,tracinda simply asks us to the factual findings of the district court.finding no clear error,we decline to do so.
risk factors.at trial,tracinda argued that the proxy misrepresented the risk factors associated with the proposed merger by failing to mention that absent a combination with,chrysler might not survive the next economic downturn in the automotive industry,and the daimlerchrysler supervisory board could,at any time after the merger closing,remove all former chrysler executives from the management board and replace them with former executives.
with regard to the first allegedly omitted risk factor,relating to the consequences of voting against the merger,the district court concluded that it need not be included because the proxy solicited votes in favor of the merger,and therefore the proxy risk factor section was designed to warn chrysler shareholders of the dangers of voting for the merger,not against it.in any case,the district court found that the proxy addressed the likelihood of future consolidation in the automobile industry in other sections.on appeal,tracinda fails to demonstrate how this finding was clear error,or how an allegedly omitted risk factor relating to the danger of voting against the merger could possibly support its a claim based on alleged misrepresentations and omissions that induced it to vote in favor of the merger.
with regard to the second allegedly omitted risk factor,relating to possibility of changes to the shared corporate governance set forth in the bca,the district court concluded that this risk was adequately explained because 
the explicitly disclosed that the merger governance provisions did not limit the supervisory board duties and responsibilities under german law that the supervisory board had the power to remove members of the management board and the bca contained no provisions that would bar governance changes after the daimlerchrysler transactions have been consummated.
tracinda daimlerchrysler ag,d,citations to proxy omitted.on appeal,tracinda recycles various arguments,in slightly different form,that we have already rejected in the context of the alleged merger of equals misrepresentation,discussed supra,section.in light of the explicit proxy language clearly describing the possibility of future corporate governance changes,we conclude that tracinda has failed to demonstrate clear error.
sec form.daimlerchrysler admits that a may,press release attached to a chrysler sec form filing erroneously stated that the two designees to the management board would be members.at trial,tracinda argued material misrepresentation under a because the proxy incorporated the by reference without explicitly identifying this error.the district court rejected this argument because of the proxy disclaimer that 
any statements contained herein,or in a document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference herein,shall be deemed to be modified or superseded for purposes of this proxy to the extent that a statement herein,or in any other subsequently filed document that is or is deemed to be incorporated by reference herein,modifies or supersedes such previous statement.any statement so modified or superseded shall not be deemed to constitute a part hereof except as so modified or superseded.
the district court also reviewed the proxy thorough discussion of the bca corporate governance provisions and found no mention of the management board members as.finally,the district court observed that the daimlerchrysler articles of association,attached to the proxy,made no reference to any members of the management board.therefore,the district court concluded that the failed to establish misrepresentation in the proxy.on appeal,tracinda expresses its disagreement with this factual finding but fails to establish clear error.
for the above stated reasons,we will affirm the district court finding that the proxy and associated documents contained no misrepresentations under a and rule 
discovery sanctions 
because we have rejected tracinda appeal in its entirety and will affirm the district court final judgment in favor of daimlerchrysler,we need not address daimlerchrysler claim on that the district court erred in denying daimlerchrysler motion for summary judgment on statute of limitations grounds.we therefore proceed to the final issue before claim on that the district court erred by awarding tracinda in costs for daimlerchrysler late document production,which violated the district court scheduling order.an order granting sanctions is reviewed for abuse of discretion.saldana kmart,cir.for the reasons that follow,we find no abuse of discretion and will affirm the order,awarding costs.
pursuant to the district court rule pretrial scheduling order,discovery closed on january.nearly a year later,on december,eve of the last day of informed the district court that it had failed to produce pages of documents responsive to tracinda earlier discovery requests.daimlerchrysler had just discovered that these documents had not been produced as required.because the district court found that these documents were highly relevant to issues raised throughout this litigation,the district court recessed trial.see tracinda daimlerchrysler ag,wl,at.april.daimlerchrysler provided copies of the pages to tracinda and,after further investigation,produced more pages a few days later.
the pages of documents came from the files of gary valade,chrysler cfo at the time of the merger and later a member of daimlerchrysler management board.the documents consisted primarily of valade handwritten notes taken during the merger negotiations valade had been one of the principal negotiators for chrysler.after considering the various requests of the parties and reviewing valade notes,the district court referred the matter to a special master for an evidentiary hearing and determination of the reasons for daimlerchrysler delayed production.the special master had been responsible for managing discovery throughout the course of this complex litigation and was very familiar with the case.
on december,the special master conducted a hearing at which live testimony and exhibits were presented regarding the circumstances giving rise to the production delay.on january,the special master issued a written report making detailed factual findings,which we summarize as follows 
on december,shortly before he was to testify at trial,valade flew to wilmington,delaware.he brought with him one of two binders he kept,containing various documents relating to the merger negotiations.included in the binders were his handwritten notes of the details of the key meetings.during the flight,valade reviewed the contents of the binder and found a page of meeting notes that he believed was helpful to daimlerchrysler trial position.when valade arrived in wilmington,he showed the page to the attorneys from skadden,arps,slate,meagher flom llp,one of the law firms representing daimlerchrysler.the skadden attorneys immediately investigated whether the page had been provided to tracinda during discovery.after searching skadden electronic database of produced documents,they concluded that it had not.skadden then began an investigation to determine why not.in michigan,skadden attorneys located the other binder which valade had used to collect materials and handwritten notes during the merger negotiations.skadden discovered that a substantial portion of the material from valade two binders had been produced to tracinda,but several dozen pages of handwritten notes had not.the next day,on december,skadden reported the problem to the district court.
in preparing for this case,skadden had followed its usual practice for a large document production.various safeguards were employed,including the creation of two sets of copies of all potentially discoverable material approximately million documents to be stored at separate locations in new york and new jersey.material collected from daimlerchrysler michigan headquarters,including valade office,was duplicated in auburn hills by an outside copy vendor.the original documents were returned to daimlerchrysler offices.the set of copies was sent to new york city,where it was duplicated again by a different copy vendor.the first,inviolate set of set of copies received from stored in jersey city it remained untouched.the second working set,the copies made from the inviolate set,was kept at skadden new york city offices where skadden attorneys reviewed the documents to determine whether they should be produced.approximately documents were deemed to be responsive to tracinda discovery requests and not to be protected by the privilege.the remaining million documents were classified and stored separately as either unresponsive or privileged.a new york city copy vendor scanned the producible documents into a searchable electronic database for skadden internal use and made a set of hard copies that was delivered to tracinda.
between december and,skadden conducted an elaborate search of both the inviolate and working sets of documents.the working set was more difficult to examine because it was no longer intact,having been divided up based on responsiveness and privilege.as a result of the search,skadden determined that copies of the material from valade binders appeared in two separate boxes in the inviolate set.box contained an incomplete set of the binder material,all of the pages first produced to tracinda but none of the tardily produced pages.box,however,contained a more complete set,including all the earlier produced pages and almost all of the tardily produced pages.
testimony,presented at the evidentiary hearing,revealed that box had been reviewed and processed during skadden document review.nevertheless,the pages of valade notes were not included in the set of documents produced to tracinda.the pages were also not included in skadden privilege log or its collection of unresponsive documents.in other words,the pages were present in box of the inviolate set but were nowhere to be found in the working set.
having made the above factual findings,the special master identified two possible reasons for daimlerchrysler failure to produce the pages of valade notes.first,the special master noted that the copy vendor in auburn hills apparently erred by creating two separate incomplete to varying the material in valade binders,which probably led to some confusion during skadden document review.second,the special master noted that the copy vendor in new york city,responsible for copying the set of documents sent there,might have failed to duplicate the entire contents of box,including the missing valade notes.this might explain how skadden could have reviewed and processed box of the working set without producing the missing notes or placing them in either its privilege log or its collection of documents.
despite the apparent improbability that two separate copy vendors in different cities could each make copying mistakes with the same group of documents,the special master concluded in his report that such a coincidence was in fact the most likely explanation for the late production of the pages of valade notes.the special master concluded that,while there was no definitive answer why the complete set of valade binders were not produced and no explanation for the coincidence noted above,there was nevertheless no evidence that the skadden attorneys or valade intentionally or in bad faith withheld the missing documents from production to the plaintiffs.the special master did not clearly address whether daimlerchrysler or skadden had acted negligently.
tracinda filed objections to the special master report to the extent it found coincidental copying error to have caused daimlerchrysler late production.tracinda also filed a motion for sanctions requesting that valade be barred from testifying at trial about the subject matter of his notes,except in response to questions about the notes by tracinda and the court jurgen schrempp and thomas stallkamp be recalled to testify at trial and daimlerchrysler be ordered to pay tracinda all of its fees and costs incurred from december,through the conclusion of trial.at a teleconference on january,the district court denied tracinda request to limit valade testimony.the district court did not need to rule on tracinda second request because daimlerchrysler agreed to have schrempp and stallkamp recalled.the district court indicated that it would grant tracinda request for costs and fees,with the precise amount to be determined after trial.consequently,the district court postponed ruling on tracinda objections to the special master report.trial resumed on february,and concluded two days later.
on april,the district court issued its opinion and order,entering final judgment for daimlerchrysler on all remaining counts.shortly thereafter,the district court overruled tracinda objections to the special master report,adopted its findings and awarded tracinda for the costs and fees it expended as a result of daimlerchrysler late production.even though the special master found no bad faith or intentional misconduct by daimlerchrysler or finding the district court district court concluded that the imposition of monetary sanctions was permitted and warranted in this case under fed.civ.f.in so concluding,the district court cited the inconvenience and expense daimlerchrysler caused tracinda and the court,the particular relevance of valade tardily produced notes,and,in light of the advanced stage of the litigation,the irremediable prejudice suffered by tracinda.like the special master,the district court did not clearly address whether daimlerchrysler or skadden had acted negligently in failing to produce all of valade notes during discovery.the district court also concluded that the sanction amount awarded was reasonable.the district court rejected daimlerchrysler argument that tracinda attorney declaration was insufficient to demonstrate the reasonableness of tracinda fee request.the district court accepted the declaration summary of the hours expended by tracinda attorneys and their corresponding hourly fees as a result of daimlerchrysler late production,even though the declaration did not precisely detail the specific tasks the attorneys performed or attach their actual billing records.
on appeal,daimlerchrysler contends that the district court abused its discretion by imposing sanctions absent a finding of bad faith or intent.daimlerchrysler argues that rule f sanctions are not designed to punish or deter blameless conduct and therefore the court decision was unjust under the rule.alternatively,daimlerchrysler argues that the district court abused its discretion by awarding an unreasonably large sanction award that was not sufficiently supported by particularized evidence.
as noted above,we review the district court decision for abuse of discretion.an abuse of discretion is a clear error of judgment,and not simply a different result which can arguably be obtained when applying the law to the facts of the case.sec infinity group,cir quotation marks and citations omitted.a court abuses its discretion if its decision to impose sanctions is based upon an incorrect legal standard or clearly erroneous factual findings.bowers coll.athletic ass n,cir citing cooter gell hartmarx,d.
sanctions under rule f 
federal rules of civil procedure a through e set forth standards for pretrial conferences,case management,and scheduling orders.rule f,which authorizes sanctions for violations of pretrial orders issued pursuant to this rule,states in relevant part with emphasis added 
if a party or party attorney fails to obey a scheduling or pretrial order,the judge,upon motion or the judge own initiative,may make such orders with regard thereto as are just,and among others any of the orders provided in rule b b,c,d in lieu of or in addition to any other sanction,the judge shall require the party or the attorney representing the party or both to pay the reasonable expenses incurred because of any noncompliance with this rule,including attorney fees,unless the judge finds that the noncompliance was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.
as the plain language of rule f indicates,monetary sanctions for noncompliance with rule pretrial orders are required and appropriate absent a showing that the violation was substantially justified or the award of expenses is unjust under the circumstances of the case.see james moore et,moore federal b ed.supp.
because there was no dispute that the tardily produced valade notes were relevant to the case and clearly within the scope of tracinda earlier discovery requests,daimlerchrysler does not contend that its late document production,which violated the district court scheduling order,was substantially justified.see fitz,ralph wilson plastics,noting that,in the context of rule sanctions,substantial justification occurs when there is a genuine dispute concerning compliance citing pierce underwood,d.instead,daimlerchrysler argues that the district court imposition of rule f expense sanctions,absent a finding of bad faith or intent,renders the sanction unjust and thus barred by the rule.in the alternative,daimlerchrysler argues that such a sanction requires at least a finding of negligence.daimlerchrysler contends that the special master and the district court found no negligence on the part of daimlerchrysler or its negligence on the part of the outside copy therefore the sanction awarded was unjust under rule f.
unjust can be variously defined as unfair,unreasonable,inequitable,or harsh.these definitions do not,in and of themselves,contain a requirement of intent or negligence.instead,unfair,unreasonable,inequitable and harsh invite a consideration of the degree of the sanction in light of the severity of the transgression which brought about the failure to produce.certainly,whether a failure to produce is intentional,negligent,or inadvertent is a significant factor in assessing the severity of the transgression.on the other hand,a failure to produce documents that is rectified many months before trial causes less prejudice and is less expensive to rectify than a failure to produce relevant documents that is discovered on the eve of the last day of a long and complicated trial.thus,the circumstances and timing of the eventual production of the documents is a correlative factor for the district court to consider,along with the nature of the failure to produce,in determining the nature and severity of the sanction.a assessment of costs for an inadvertent failure to product documents would be unjust if the documents were produced two months after the close of discovery but six months before trial is to begin.the failure to produce here,however,occurred eleven months after the close of discovery and,even more significantly,on the eve of the last day of a long trial.this case was extraordinarily complex and the preparations for trial,particularly in light of the huge number of documents produced,had been immensely time consuming.nevertheless,on the eve of the last day of trial,tracinda was required,through no fault of its own,to reexamine its trial strategy,reevaluate its examination of various witnesses,prepare for of several witnesses,and redevelop its of valade.in addition,as noted by the district court,the late production prejudiced tracinda whole trial preparation strategy by its effect on tracinda ability to develop its case,including most particularly its impact on tracinda decision of who to depose,the order of depositions and the substance and conduct of the trial prior to the revelation of the documents.tracinda,wl at.
even though the special master report found that t here was no evidence in the record that the skadden attorneys had any part in the copying,the obligation to produce the documents was daimlerchrysler and skadden.as between daimlerchrysler and tracinda,if anyone is to be charged with the significant expenses that tracinda incurred because of the late and prejudicial production,it does not seem unjust that daimlerchrysler should bear the expense.indeed,the district court noted in its sanctions opinion that,regardless of the reason for the failure to produce these documents,the fault for this production failure and the related delays and proceedings which followed,lies with defendants.id.at.we conclude that,under the extreme circumstances of this case,the district court acted within its discretion by imposing rule f expense sanctions.
this conclusion is consistent with the very broad discretion which district courts have to use sanctions where necessary to ensure compliance with pretrial orders this facilitates the expeditious and sound management of the preparation of cases for trial.in re sanction of baker,cir en banc.although a finding of bad faith is generally required for a court to impose sanctions pursuant to its inherent authority,see roadway express,piper,d discussing a court power to impose sanctions before,when rule was amended to add subdivision f martin brown,cir,no express requirement of intent or negligence exists in the language of rule f.
daimlerchrysler argues,however,that the purpose of rule f is to punish and deter egregious misconduct,not innocent mistakes,and therefore the imposition of sanctions in this case constituted an unjust award.in support of this proposition,daimlerchrysler cites to two cases,williams,wl,at june,and flaherty bruder sons,where motions for sanctions were denied because,among other things,the discovery violations at issue were inadvertent as we discuss supra,however,the standard we find relevant in defining unjust is the contrast between the nature of the violation of rule and the impact on the parties caused by the delay.therefore,the fact that the party with the obligation to produce documents may have been negligent is a factor to consider.nevertheless,even if the failure to produce has been inadvertent,sanctions may be called for under rule f if the impact is severe on the party who was due the discovery.see moore federal practice noting that one of the relevant factors in considering whether to impose rule f sanctions is the nature and consequences of the misconduct.the prejudice caused by daimlerchrysler discovery violation was significant because the effect on tracinda trial preparation could not be remedied and because the delay imposed substantial costs on beyond what the cost of trial preparation would have been had the documents been produced in a timely fashion.see scarborough eubanks,cir noting that prejudice includes excessive and possibly irremediable burdens or costs imposed on the opposing party.although valade notes surfaced before he testified at trial,and schrempp and stallkamp were recalled for further testimony in light of the newly discovered evidence,tracinda still suffered a degree of irremediable prejudice.flaherty and williams are therefore distinguishable from the instant case as the prejudice caused by the misconduct in those cases was substantially curable and therefore largely insignificant.
we conclude,therefore,in light of the circumstances of this case,that the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding tracinda expense sanctions under rule f.daimlerchrysler was wholly responsible for the late document production that caused tracinda to incur substantial expenses.despite the efforts of daimlerchrysler and the district court,the late production of valade notes irremediably prejudiced tracinda case.valade notes,which were not produced until the eve of the last day of trial,were highly relevant and would have had an impact on tracinda strategy and actions prior to that point,throughout discovery and during trial.
daimlerchrysler argues to the contrary that our holding will open the door to a flood of satellite litigation over rule f expenses every time a document production error is unearthed after the close of discovery,which can be a common occurrence in complex litigations.daimlerchrysler points out that scheduling orders often require document production to be completed before depositions commence,at which time witnesses often identify relevant documents not previously produced.
we do not concur with this assessment of the results of our decision.production errors discovered at the stage of litigation will result in little,if any,expense or prejudice to the opposing party and therefore are not likely to warrant the imposition of sanctions under rule f.on the other hand,if a litigant knows that even inadvertent failure to produce relevant documents may result in a sanction when the existence of the documents is discovered during trial,the litigant may exercise more care in ensuring that all relevant documents are produced.
daimlerchrysler also argues that our holding will have the effect of deterring future litigants from admitting and rectifying discovery errors.however,as daimlerchrysler admits,the obligation on parties and counsel to come forward with relevant documents not produced during discovery is absolute.indeed,the failure to do so can result in penalties more severe than monetary sanctions,including dismissal of the case.we are not concerned about chilling conduct that is compulsory and required by law.
reasonableness of expense award 
having concluded that it was within the district court discretion to impose sanctions on daimlerchrysler,we must now consider whether the amount of expenses awarded to tracinda was reasonable.if a party or attorney violates a pretrial order,rule f authorizes a district judge to make such orders with regard thereto as are just,including orders requiring the noncompliant person to pay the reasonable expenses incurred because of any noncompliance with this rule,including attorney fees.f emphasis added.daimlerchrysler argues that the district court abused its discretion by awarding tracinda because,according to daimlerchrysler,the evidence of expenses presented by attorney declaration including a summary of individual hours worked and corresponding hourly to justify that amount.daimlerchrysler argues that the declaration failed to distinguish adequately which expenses were incurred because of daimlerchrysler discovery error,and which were not,because the declaration did not include a precise breakdown of specific tasks performed.even though the district court awarded only half of the expenses originally requested by tracinda daimlerchrysler argues that such a breakdown was required because the district court had an obligation to parcel out the relevant and irrelevant expenses.daimlerchrysler also argues that the declaration was insufficient to demonstrate reasonableness because it was not accompanied by actual time sheets or receipts.
with regard to what daimlerchrysler calls the district court aversion to parceling,we find no abuse of discretion.tracinda attorney declaration explicitly sets forth only those expenses incurred in connection with the late production of valade notes emphasis added,and declared,under penalty of perjury pursuant to permitting unsworn declaration in lieu of sworn affidavit,that tracinda and its counsel never would have had to incur these additional attorneys fees and costs but for the defendants late production of valade notes emphasis added.because the declaration listed only expenses incurred because of daimlerchrysler late production.f,there was no need for the district court to parcel out the relevant fees and costs from the irrelevant ones as only relevant ones were requested.
we also reject daimlerchrysler argument to the extent it challenges the causation link between the late production of valade notes and the expenses incurred by tracinda as set forth in the attorney declaration.daimlerchrysler first produced valade notes during trial,on december.the trial was supposed to end the following day but was forced into recess because of daimlerchrysler late production.the litigation continued for several more weeks,through the christmas and new year holidays,with trial finally coming to an end on february.as stated in tracinda attorney declaration,throughout this period,tracinda had to prepare for and participate in the december,hearing before the special master,prepare and file its objections to the special master findings,prepare and file its motion for sanctions,review and analyze the newly produced valade notes and alter its trial strategy accordingly,prepare for and participate in the examination of valade and of schrempp and stallkamp in light of the new evidence,and prepare for and participate in three days of trial,including at least one day not originally planned for.it is that the overwhelming majority of these tasks had to be performed directly because of daimlerchrysler late production.although it is true that some parts of these tasks had to have been performed irrespective of daimlerchrysler error,tracinda examination of valade on subjects not covered by the tardily produced notes,certainly significant attorney fees and costs incurred by tracinda during this time period were directly caused by daimlerchrysler noncompliance with rule.
next,we address daimlerchrysler argument that tracinda attorney declaration was insufficient to prove the reasonableness of the expenses awarded because the declaration did not attach actual time sheets and receipts for corroboration.although the preferred practice is for the attorney to attach contemporaneously recorded time sheets,we conclude that the declaration in this case is sufficient.yeager fuel.power light,wl,at,under rule,sanctioning plaintiff for discovery abuses and awarding defendant reasonable expenses based on attorney affidavit summarizing time spent by and billable rates of defense counsel citing webb county bd.of education,d reviewing attorney affidavit in support of prevailing party request for attorney fees pursuant to.
the declaration supporting tracinda request for expenses was made by alan stone,a partner at a wilmington law firm morris,nichols,arsht tunnel,one of three large firms representing tracinda,the other two being located in new york fried,frank,harris,shriver jacobson llp and los angeles christensen,miller,fink,jacobs,glaser,weil shapiro llp.with regard to attorney fees,the declaration sets forth three tables,one for each firm,listing the names of the legal professionals who worked for tracinda including partners,associates,and support staff,their hourly rates ranging from to,the number of hours they worked during the relevant time period ranging from hours to less than hour,and the total fees accrued approximately for hours for the wilmington firm,for hours for the new york firm,and for hours for the los angeles firm,which came to a grand total of approximately for hours of work.the declaration states,under penalty of perjury,that these tables set forth the actual amount of hours worked by attorneys and support staff from plaintiff counsel in connection with the late production of valade notes.with regard to other costs,the declaration sets forth three more tables listing miscellaneous expenses,travel,hotel,consulting,duplication,incurred by each firm as a result of daimlerchrysler late production,which totaled approximately.
daimlerchrysler does not directly challenge the hourly rates or the total for miscellaneous costs set forth in the declaration.rather,daimlerchrysler focuses on the quantity of legal work summarized in the declaration approximately hours and contends that it exaggerates the actual legal fees incurred by tracinda as a result of daimlerchrysler late production.daimlerchrysler argues that it was abuse of discretion for the district court not to require corroborating evidence,such as contemporaneously recorded time records.
we reject daimlerchrysler argument to the extent it accuses alan stone of issuing a false declaration.stone declaration was made under penalty of perjury and the district court made an implicit factual finding that stone declaration was credible.there is nothing in the record to cast doubt on the district court conclusion that it was reasonable for tracinda lawyers to spend hours of time collectively during a recess from trial representing approximately hours a week in this remarkably complicated,litigation.the district judge presided over this massive case for over years and was intimately familiar with its complexity,the lawyers involved,and the amount of work required to prosecute it.without any evidence of error,we will not the judgment of a district judge to determine the reasonableness of a fee request.
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we will affirm the district court order of november,granting daimlerchrysler motion to strike tracinda jury demand and the judgment of april,finding daimlerchrysler not liable for common law fraud or federal securities violations.without reaching the merits,we will deny as moot tracinda appeal of the district court order of march,granting defendant kopper motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.with regard to daimlerchrysler,we will affirm the district court order of april,awarding tracinda in costs for daimlerchrysler late discovery production.finally,we will deny as moot daimlerchrysler of the district court order of june,denying daimlerchrysler motion for summary judgment on statute of limitations grounds.
