clinton brown,a wealthy businessman,made a risky investment in the securities of a small california company called earthboard sports usa earthboard.he was induced to embark on such a course of action by the tip he had received from jeffrey vaughn,an acquaintance and financial advisor who considered brown to be a prospective client,that a large public company was about to acquire earthboard on extremely,even ridiculously,favorable terms.however,the promised acquisition turned out to be an entirely fictitious creation of earthboard president,one hugh jeffreys,a felon.when the truth was finally revealed,brown and many others lost their investments.brown then sued earthboard,jeffreys,vaughn,and vaughn employer lincoln financial advisors lincoln in federal court,claiming a variety of federal and state securities violations.the district court entered default judgment against earthboard and jeffreys.
subsequently,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of vaughn and lincoln.relevant to the appeal before us now,the district court held that brown complaint that the parties had sold him unlawfully unregistered shares under kentucky blue sky law was preempted by the national securities markets improvement act of,stat.nsmia,because the securities had been sold pursuant to a valid federal registration exemption and brown did not adduce sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact with respect to two vital elements of a securities fraud suit scienter and loss causation.brown filed a timely notice of appeal.for the reasons stated below,we reverse the district court with respect to the claims against vaughn,but affirm summary judgment in favor of lincoln.
as brown appeals from summary judgment,we review the adduced evidence in the light most favorable to him.earthboard is a cosa mesa,california corporation that designs and manufactures extreme skateboards and related equipment.in,it offered subscriptions in certain of its securities and filed for an exemption from federal registration requirements with the united states securities and exchange commission sec.specifically,the company filed for a federal registration exemption pursuant to rule of regulation d,a safe harbor provision authorized by section of the securities act,for limited private placements.rule permits a private issuer to sell unregistered securities to any accredited investor and up to other unaccredited purchasers,so long as certain requirements are met.such a filing is generally intended to exempt the sale from federal and state registration requirements pursuant to nsmia.earthboard did not file any amendments to its filing or file for a new exemption.thus,the company continued to offer subscriptions in its securities until about,all purportedly pursuant to its filing.
brown ran his own marketing firm from until.in,brown accountant,gene schindler,introduced him to vaughn,a financial advisor and registered representative employed by lincoln.vaughn solicited k business from brown marketing firm,ask ing to be one of brown investment advisors.vaughn viewed brown as a prospective client,and knew that brown would received a large sum of money if he sold his firm.when brown finally sold his company in,vaughn wanted to know what brown plans were for the money.thereafter,vaughn contacted brown periodically.during that time,it seems that brown and vaughn met on social occasions,playing golf occasionally,taking a golf vacation together at brown arizona home,and enjoying brown jet.they were both fans of indiana university basketball team,and they attended an game together.brown dined at vaughn home at least once,vaughn attended a christmas party at brown home,and they attended a few dinners together.
apparently,in august,vaughn first heard about earthboard from his builder,who told him that the company was raising capital for expansion and put him in contact with the company president,jeffreys.vaughn spoke with jeffreys by telephone in august,and again in late september.they apparently did not meet each other in person until march.according to brown,jeffreys told vaughn on the telephone that earthboard was involved in acquisition negotiations with vans,a footwear company,and that,according to the terms of the deal,one share of earthboard securities would be exchanged for one share of vans when the transaction finally closed.at that time,vans shares were trading at about,but jeffreys offered his company shares to vaughn for just apiece.thus,vaughn stood to realize a capital gain when and if the promised transaction was closed.it was almost too good to be true.
armed with what he probably took to be illicit or illegal insider information,vaughn allegedly decided to reap the rewards.of course,the essential value of such an illicit tip lies in its concealment from the public eye,so it was probably impossible for vaughn or anyone else to conduct any proper investigation of the transaction.but vaughn allegedly did not allow his fundamental ignorance about jeffreys,a felon previously convicted of fraud,or about the supposed transaction,to govern his decisions.of course,there was apparently not an ounce of truth to jeffreys tips.
according to the evidence adduced by brown,vaughn started by investing his own money in this scheme,and he ultimately purchased about worth of earthboard shares.he signed a subscription agreement on september,and purchased shares for per share.the company seems to have accidentally sent him an extra shares around that time,though it rescinded those surplus shares some time later.after introducing investors such as brown to the opportunity,he purchased another shares on his own account for on march,and the company gave him an additional shares for free at that time in lieu of paying me a commission,presumably to thank him for advising investors like brown about the opportunity.he purchased another shares on his own account in december for per share.
after deciding to invest for himself,vaughn began to solicit friends and acquaintances to participate in this opportunity.taking the evidence in the light most favorable to brown,vaughn contacted brown in late november or early december to tell him that he wanted the opportunity to prove to brown how valuable he could be as a financial advisor and that he had an investment opportunity.vaughn wanted to meet brown to discuss it.due to a sense of urgency in the phone call,brown agreed to meet vaughn for lunch about two days later.at that meeting,vaughn shared with brown the details of this privately held enterprise called earthboard,and its imminent sale to a publicly traded firm called vans.to bolster the story veracity,vaughn allegedly lied to brown by claiming that earthboard president,jeffreys,was a personal friend or acquaintance of his,that they had done business before in some way,shape or form and that jeffreys owed him a favor.vaughn then explained that subscriptions in earthboard stock were available to a limited group of investors at per share,and that the purported stock swap upon the transaction closing offered brown the prospect of doubling his investment overnight.but vaughn warned that time was pressing,for the vans transaction was imminent and brown needed to move quickly if he wanted to be a part of it.
brown said he was interested,and vaughn replied i need to get you a subscription agreement.vaughn made arrangements to have a subscription agreement sent to brown by fax.earthboard sent the subscription agreement to brown on december.brown consulted his financial advisors,two of whom specifically questioned how vaughn could have access to such inside information about an unannounced transaction involving a public company,but brown would not be deterred.relying entirely on vaughn tip,brown saw this as an opportunity to invest in vans,a company he found to be solid,though he did not independently investigate earthboard.
brown received his subscription agreement and wire transfer instructions directly from earthboard.brown claims that vaughn assisted him in completing the form.he clearly saw listed as the original share price,and it had been marked out and replaced by.brown assumed the stock price had risen because of the imminent transaction.he neither saw nor asked for a private placement memorandum ppm,though it was referenced in the subscription agreement he had signed.he faxed the completed subscription form directly to earthboard on december,requesting shares.vaughn then faxed wire instructions to brown from lincoln fax machine,and brown finally wired to earthboard.
after completing this transaction,vaughn and brown engaged in numerous conversations regarding their investments in earthboard,and both spoke about the fluctuating price of vans stock.brown asked vaughn to s end me whatever you get from earthboard,and vaughn sent press releases and announcements from earthboard to brown,who apparently did not receive them directly from earthboard.on january,vaughn faxed an earthboard press release to brown from lincoln fax machine,wherein earthboard announced a definitive agreement to have its stock acquired by a publicly traded major footwear company.according to this press release,earthboard stock would be exchanged on a one for one basis,apparently confirming the lies told to brown.brown continued to follow vans stock,assuming that the transaction was complete and awaiting only public announcement.brown and vaughn even discussed whether to sell or hold the vans stock after the merger.vaughn kept assuring brown that the transaction with vans was imminent,and so brown continued to believe that vaughn remained in constant contact with earthboard management.in fact,however,as of january,vaughn had allegedly not yet even met with earthboard president in person,and there is a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the question of whether had he conducted any due diligence about earthboard or the rumored transaction prior to soliciting brown in his deposition,vaughn at first claims that he personally met jeffreys and toured earthboard factory in early,but almost immediately he seems to have corrected himself by admitting that the meeting and tour did not occur until march.
vans shares having risen to,brown decided to purchase an additional shares of earthboard at per share on february.for this investment,he signed a new subscription agreement for his entire purchase of shares for a total investment of,which contained more complete and legible disclosures than the subscription agreement that he had received in december.this agreement warned that the securities have not been registered and that the securities were offered pursuant to section of the securities act.to make this purchase,brown again acknowledged that he was an accredited investor and that he had relied solely on his own independent investigation in making the investment decision.brown claims that he asked for,but never received,earthboard financial statements,the offering circular,the ppm,and any other disclosures about the company.
meanwhile,as we noted above,vaughn himself purchased another shares of earthboard on march,and received an additional shares from earthboard in lieu of commission.in december,vaughn sent a letter of instruction on lincoln stationary to earthboard transfer agent,purchasing another shares.in july,vaughn seems to have purchased another shares from his neighbor,charles goebel,who had earlier purchased the shares in response to vaughn pitch.
time passed,but the fictitious transaction never closed,and it was finally revealed that the whole scheme was fraudulent.brown filed a complaint against all defendants in september,raising a host of federal and state claims,and filed an amended complaint on november.on may,the district court entered default judgment against earthboard and jeffreys,holding them jointly and severally liable for plus pre and interest representing brown entire investment even though those parties are almost certainly.on august,the district court entered summary judgment in favor of vaughn and lincoln,holding,in relevant part,that the kentucky blue sky law is preempted by federal securities regulations respecting covered offerings filed pursuant to the nsmia,and brown could not prove loss causation and scienter for his claims against vaughn.the claim against lincoln was dismissed because it depended entirely on the claim against vaughn.brown filed a timely appeal.
the district court exercised federal question jurisdiction with respect to brown federal claims,and took supplemental jurisdiction over the kentucky claims pursuant to a.the district court granted summary judgment based on its analysis and application of federal law.we review de novo the district court legal conclusions,including matters of statutory interpretation.johnson karnes,cir hoffman comshare,in re comshare.sec.lit,cir.
brown first claim on appeal is that the district court erred in holding that federal law preempts his state blue sky law claims nsmia,which in pertinent part amended section a a of the securities act,a a,preempts state regulation with respect to covered securities.the states can not,in the exercise of control over local laws and practice,vest state courts with power to violate the supreme law of the land.kalb feuerstein.according to section b d of the securities act,b d,a covered security is,inter alia,any security exempt from federal securities registration pursuant to commission rules or regulations issued under of the act.see.the parties agree that the offering was purportedly made pursuant to rule based on earthboard filing.
the parties differ in their interpretation of the effect of earthboard filing for rule exemption.brown claims that an offering must actually meet the conditions established by the sec regulation in order to qualify as a covered security exempted from state registration requirements by nsmia.he further claims that earthboard offering did not,in fact,qualify as a covered security under rule.the defendants answer that nsmia exempts,inter alia,all securities from state regulation so long as the company has attempted to qualify for a valid federal exemption or has purported that the securities are offered pursuant to an exemption.moreover,they argue that the earthboard offering actually qualified for rule exemption.the district court held that the simple fact that the filing had been entered under the rubric of a federal exemption entitled it to federal preemption pursuant to nsmia.district courts and state courts have split on the question of whether filings must actually qualify for a federal securities registration exemption in order to be entitled to nsmia preemption.to the best of our knowledge,no federal appeals court has yet ruled on this question.we now agree with those courts that have held that offerings must actually qualify for a valid federal securities registration exemption in order to enjoy nsmia preemption.
in temple gorman,d,the district court held that congress broadly preempted state law registration actions in passing nsmia.in that case,the plaintiffs asserted that their state law claims were not preempted as the securities were not actually exempt because they did not meet rule or any other exemption requirements.id.at.the district court did not dispute that allegation,but noted that congress purpose in passing nsmia was to further and advance the development of national securities markets and eliminate the costs and burdens of duplicative and unnecessary regulation by,as a general rule,designating the federal government as the exclusive regulator of national offerings of securities.ibid quoting,at.based on this purpose,as stated in the legislative gloss,the temple court held that 
the securities in this case were offered or sold pursuant to a commission rule or regulation adopted under section and r egardless of whether the private placement actually complied with the substantive requirements of regulation d or rule,the securities sold to plaintiffs are federal covered securities because they were sold pursuant to those rules.
id.at internal quotation marks omitted.as such,the temple court held that the state blue sky law was preempted by the fact that the defendants had attempted or purported to qualify for a legitimate federal exemption.several district courts have followed temple reasoning.see lillard stockton,d,pinnacle commc ns.int l,am.family mortgage,d,when an offering purports to be exempt under federal regulation d,any allegation of improper registration is covered exclusively by federal law.
other courts have roundly rejected temple reasoning.the supreme court of alabama raised the first challenge to temple reasoning when it required the defendants claiming nsmia preemption for their offering,which had been sold pursuant to rule exemption,to prove that the challenged securities actually qualified for a valid federal exemption.buist time domain,so d.
several federal district courts have approved buist line of reasoning.one district court noted that the plain language of the securities laws defines a covered security as one that is exempt from registration under this title pursuant to commission rules or regulations.afa private equity fund miresco inv,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the miresco court required defendants to present evidence showing that the securities at issue here are exempt from registration under the rules adopted by the sec under and held that it is defendant burden,as the party relying on the exemption,to establish that the exemption applies and that all conditions of the exemption had been satisfied.ibid.another court noted that 
t o the extent that temple can be read to support the principle of broad preemption that the defendants urge,this court declines to follow that case this court has found no authority for the broad preemption principle and c ontrary to temple,most commentators have stated the obvious a security has to actually be a covered security before federal preemption applies.
hamby clearwater consulting concepts,llp,d,citations omitted.this general line of reasoning has been repeated even more recently 
the temple court read language into the statute that does not appear there.a security is covered if it is exempt from registration nowhere does the statute indicate that a security may satisfy the definition if it is sold pursuant to a putative exemption.if congress had intended that an offeror representation of exemption should suffice it could have said so,but did not.such an intent seems unlikely,in any event that a defendant could avoid liability under state law simply by declaiming its alleged compliance with regulation d is an unsavory proposition and would eviscerate the statute.nor is it necessary to look to the legislative history the statute is unambiguous.
grubka webaccess int l,d,citations and internal quotation marks omitted.see also myers otr media,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,denying plaintiff motion for summary judgment where defendants claim nsmia preemption because defendants have proffered evidence sufficient to create a question of fact as to whether they are exempt under rule.
we likewise reject temple approach.under the prevailing view of the commerce clause grant of authority,gonzales raich,d,congress has clearly been authorized to regulate the trading of securities.this includes the power to preempt contravening state regulations.congress could in fact decide to occupy the entire field of securities regulation and preempt all state laws as they pertain to securities appellees urge us to believe that congress actually performed a feat only slightly narrower,for to hold that nsmia preempts state regulation wherever offerings merely purport to be filed pursuant to a valid federal registration exemption,or where parties have filed for,but fail to qualify for,an sec registration exemption,would effectively eviscerate state registration requirements.in such a world,state registration requirements could be avoided merely by adding spurious boilerplate language to subscription agreements suggesting that the offerings were covered,or by filing bogus documents with the sec.congress indubitably possesses the power to accomplish that end.
however,it is dispositive to our inquiry that congress chose not to include broadly preemptive language when it enacted nsmia.instead,the statute plainly restricts its preemptive scope to covered securities,and it neither defines,nor requires the sec to define,covered securities in a fashion that would actually include all securities.the statute thus does not expressly preempt state laws with respect to non covered securities,nor does the statute text reveal an implied intent to preempt all state statutes in the field.geier am.honda motor,d.moreover,far from defining covered securities in a manner that generally incorporates all securities,the sec has promulgated specific requirements that must be met in order for a security to be covered.therefore,we hold that nsmia preempts state securities registration laws with respect only to those offerings that actually qualify as covered securities according to the regulations that the sec has promulgated.
next,the appellees urge us to avert our eyes from the statute plain language and look instead to legislative intent as supposedly espoused by the gloss on which they,and the district court,rely.but resorting to legislative history is always a risky endeavor,subject to manipulation by individual legislators and by simple mistakes of fact by the courts.while legislative history may sometimes usefully add to our understanding of a statute where the statutory language is ambiguous,it can not alter the plain meaning of the text.to avoid a law plain meaning in the absence of ambiguity would trench upon the legislative powers vested in congress by art.i,of the constitution.violette days,cir quoting in part dep t of housing and urban dev.rucker,d.see hamdan rumsfeld,d scalia,dissenting we have repeatedly held that reliance on legislative history is impermissible where the statutory language is unambiguous.here,the statute is not ambiguous.had congress possessed the political will to preempt state blue sky laws in their practical entirety,it would have expressed that decision in the statute plain text.therefore,we reverse the district court,and hold that nsmia preempts state securities registration requirements only with respect to securities that actually qualify as covered securities under federal law.
the appellees next argue that earthboard offering actually qualified for rule exemption,thereby triggering nsmia preemption of state regulation respecting covered securities.a a no law,rule,regulation,or order,or other administrative action of any state or any political subdivision thereof requiring,or with respect to,registration or qualification of securities,or registration or qualification of securities transactions,shall directly or indirectly apply to a security that a is a covered security.in assessing their claim,we note that f ederal preemption is an affirmative defense upon which the defendants bear the burden of proof.fifth third bank csx,cir.see caterpillar,williams,d.as the supreme court has held in the specific context of the national labor relations act 
the precondition for,that the conduct be arguably protected or prohibited,is not without substance.it is not satisfied by a conclusory assertion of and would therefore not be satisfied in this case by a claim,without more,that davis was an employee rather than a supervisor.if the word arguably is to mean anything,it must mean that the party claiming is required to demonstrate that his case is one that the board could legally decide in his favor.that is,a party asserting must advance an interpretation of the act that is not plainly contrary to its language and that has not been authoritatively rejected by the courts or the board.the party must then put forth enough evidence to enable the court to find that the board reasonably could uphold a claim based on such an interpretation.in this case,therefore,because the issue turns on davis status,the union claim of must be supported by a showing sufficient to permit the board to find that davis was an employee,not a supervisor.our examination of the record leads us to conclude that the union has not carried its burden in this case.
int l longshoremen ass davis,at.citations omitted.although davis was a labor case and did not arise from an appeal of a federal court grant of summary judgment,the basic principles for successfully asserting federal preemption as an affirmative defense on summary judgment are sufficiently clear it is first incumbent on the party moving for summary judgment to demonstrate that federal preemption potentially applies to the facts and circumstances of the suit,and,if so,the movants must adduce sufficient evidence,interpreted in a light most favorable to the party,to prove that there is no genuine issue of material fact contradicting the claim that the case at bar actually and unquestionably qualifies for federal preemption.the first step presents a purely legal determination,but the second raises a mixed question.should the movants fail to meet their burden with respect to the latter step,such as if a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding the claim actual qualification for federal preemption,the matter must be determined by the factfinder.see id.
in this case,the parties agree that the earthboard offering was made pursuant to the company filing for a registration exemption under rule,and so preemption potentially applies because nsmia preempts state registration requirements with respect to securities covered by such exemptions.to meet the remainder of their burden on summary judgment,the movants claim of must be supported by a showing sufficient to permit us to find that no genuine issue of material fact exists contradicting their claim that earthboard offering was actually a covered security.int l longshoremen ass davis,at.rule was promulgated pursuant to section of the securities act,and exempts certain limited offers and sales so long as the rule conditions are met all terms and conditions of rules and,must be met,including the provision of audited balance sheets to unaccredited investors the issuer must reasonably believe that there are no more than purchasers of securities who are not accredited investors as defined by rule,though there are no limits on the number of accredited investors each investor must meet certain qualifications as recited in a ii and the offers or sales of securities registered under regulation d must be integrated as part of a single offering,and so no offers or sales may be made more than six months before,or six months after,the offering itself.a 
the appellees assert that they have demonstrated that the offer actually qualified for rule exemption,but the only concrete evidence that they introduce to demonstrate actual compliance indicates that there were fewer than investors involved in the purchase,thereby satisfying the rule numerosity requirement.although the appellees argue that the sales to brown were sufficiently integrated with the filing so as to meet rule integration requirement,the appellees leave unexplained precisely how a sale of securities three years after the filing nevertheless remains integrated with the original filing,and so we find that there remains a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the rule integration requirement.
even assuming arguendo that the appellees successfully demonstrated integration,they still have not adduced any evidence with respect to the requirements mandating that the company provide certain information to unaccredited investors and that the company evaluate all unaccredited investors as being sufficiently sophisticated.moreover,we find it highly persuasive,albeit not dispositive,that in the sec filed a civil suit against earthboard and jeffreys in which it specifically complained that the company had offered unlawfully unregistered shares for sale,and that the offering did not qualify for a federal registration exemption under rule.the sec alleged that the offering did not satisfy rule because earthboard had failed to supply every unaccredited investor with audited copies of the company financial statements and earthboard had failed to comply with the requirement that all unaccredited investors actually have,or that the company reasonably believe d them to have such knowledge and experience of financial and business matters as to be capable of evaluating the merits of risks of their prospective investment.securities and exchange comm jeffreys et.therefore we hold that the appellees have failed to meet their burden because a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the shares sold to brown were covered securities warranting nsmia preemption from state law,and so summary judgment was not warranted.
the appellees raise two other arguments in support of their claims to preemption.they are both specious.first,vaughn notes that the preliminary notes to regulation d state that the 
a ttempted compliance with any rule in regulation d does not act as an exclusive election the issuer can also claim the availability of any other applicable exemption.for instance,an issuer failure to satisfy all the terms and conditions of rule shall not raise any presumption that the exemption provided by section of the act is not available.
preliminary notes.but see id.at regulation d is not available to any issuer for any transaction or chain of transactions that,although in technical compliance with these rules,is part of a plan or scheme to evade the registration provisions of the act.vaughn also notes that rule a provides a safeguard for insignificant deviations from the express terms of regulation d if the error was made in good faith.a.based on this,vaughn seems to argue that earthboard noncompliance was subject to the safe harbor provided by rule that he is not liable under state law because he is not an underwriter,issuer,or dealer subject to federal registration requirements and that he was not a seller under kentucky law.we disagree.with respect to the rule claim,the appellees have not adduced any evidence that earthboard even attempted to comply with all of the strictures of rule,much less that the company deviation from the rule strictures was both insignificant and done in good faith.we do not reach the merits of vaughn claim that he was not liable as a seller under the federal registration requirements because it is immaterial to the question of his liability under kentucky law,and because he stipulated to his federal seller status for the purposes of summary judgment 
we also disagree with vaughn contention that he was not,as an unavoidable matter of law,a seller under kentucky law.although he cites a recent sixth circuit opinion wherein we quoted the state trial court for the proposition that a stock broker who merely executes a trade and has no other interest in the stock other than his commission is not a seller under.ann,he mistakes the provenance of that opinion.excel energy,smith in re commonwealth inst,cir.that case arose from state securities litigation,but reached the federal courts only with respect to a bankruptcy issue.in that context,both we and the federal district court were estopped from reviewing or the state trial court determinations as to securities fraud liability.moreover,the state court of appeals and supreme court both dismissed the plaintiff appeal in excel only because of a timeliness issue,so those courts had no opportunity to review the merits of the state trial court interpretation of section.excel energy,commonwealth inst.as such,our reiteration of the state trial court determination,and the state appellate courts apparent approval of the trial court decision,possesses little precedential value.moreover,that case is readily distinguished from the case now before us because vaughn alleged role in soliciting and selling earthboard shares to brown,including his admission that he received a commission from earthboard for his efforts,suggests far greater participation in the sale than that of a stockbroker who merely transacts the business of his clients.under the circumstances as they have been alleged,vaughn does not merit summary judgment on the seller issue.
second,lincoln claims that brown has effectively waived his blue sky claim by admitting that the offering was private.lincoln is simply mistaken.it is true,as the district court ruled,that the exclusive federal cause of action for failure to register public or private securities lies under section a of the securities act,a,see faye roth revocable trust ubs painewebber,d,and it is also true that section a of the same act,a,is inapplicable to private offerings.gustafson alloyd,d.brown included a section a claim in his original complaint,which the district court found to be,and his section a claim was defeated by his admission that the earthboard offering was private.but brown has raised neither of those issues on appeal.instead,he appeals only from the district court dismissal of his state claim.there is a fundamental difference between a private offering,a private offering that is to say,one that actually qualifies for a registration exemption,and an private offering.brown here claims that the earthboard offering fell into the last category,which,after nsmia,is the only category of offerings still liable for state,and the appellees have failed to meet their burden of proving that the offering was actually and lawfully exempted from federal and,a fortiori,state registration requirements.for the purposes of the instant summary judgment motion,we agree.therefore,brown admission that the earthboard offering was private has no bearing on state claim,and we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment with respect to the state registration claim against vaughn 
brown also appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment with respect to his securities fraud claim.brown filed this action pursuant to section b of the securities exchange act,b,rule promulgated thereunder,and a virtually identical state statute.ann.the basic elements of a federal securities fraud action pursuant to rule and section b,and,by extension,of a kentucky securities fraud action,are a material misrepresentation or omission scienter a connection with the purchase or sale of a security reliance or transaction causation economic loss and loss causation.dura pharmaceuticals,broudo,d.vaughn and lincoln both dispute that brown has created a genuine issue of material fact with respect to three elements of securities fraud scienter,reliance,and loss causation.
scienter is a mental state embracing intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud.ernst ernst hochfelder,d.our task is thus to determine whether the complaint alleges facts that,if true,would,by forming the basis for a strong inference,convince a reasonable person that the defendant knew a statement was false or misleading.city of monroe employees ret.bridgestone,cir citation omitted.we therefore employ a totality of circumstances test in assessing whether a plaintiff has adequately alleged scienter,and among the factors that we have considered in the past are 
insider trading at a suspicious time or in an unusual amount divergence between internal reports and external statements on the same subject closeness in time of an allegedly fraudulent statement or omission and the later disclosure of inconsistent information evidence of bribery by a top company official existence of an ancillary lawsuit charging fraud by a company and the company quick settlement of that suit disregard of the most current factual information before making statements disclosure of accounting information in such a way that its negative implications could only be understood by someone with a high degree of sophistication the personal interest of certain directors in not informing disinterested directors of an impending sale of stock and the motivation of defendants in the form of saving their salaries or jobs.
ibid.as we have noted elsewhere,scienter 
is limited to those highly unreasonable omissions or misrepresentations that involve not merely simple or even inexcusable negligence,but an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care,and that present a danger of misleading buyers or sellers which is either known to the defendant or is so obvious that the defendant must have been aware of it.
platsis hutton,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.in securities fraud claims based on statements of present or historical as the claims plaintiffs bring in this consists of knowledge or recklessness.pr diamonds,chandler,cir.specific factual allegations that a defendant ignored red flags,or warning signs that would have revealed the accounting errors prior to their inclusion in public statements,may support a strong inference of scienter.id.at.
last year,we held that the plaintiff in a securities fraud case had sufficiently alleged reckless scienter with respect to a professional broker who had recklessly participated in a ponzi scheme,lost money in that scheme,and encouraged others to participate in the scheme 
while the defendant contends that he truly believed the fraud author and that he himself lost money in the purported trades,these facts do not controvert the evidence that the defendant encouraged people to invest in a program,the details of which he knew virtually nothing.in view of the defendant former employment at several brokerage firms,this court has little trouble concluding that he knew,or should have known,that the fraud author scheme was fraudulent.the court therefore concludes that the defendant acted with the requisite scienter to establish liability under the provisions of the securities laws.
securities and exchange comm george,cir.brown now contends that the instant case presents a set of circumstances analogous to that of george,as he alleges that vaughn had solicited prospective investors to invest in the earthboard offering,encouraged them to invest without having performed any investigation of his own and profited thereby by receiving,by his own admission,a commission from the company for his efforts on their behalf in addition to his own purchase of shares at of the price that he solicited brown to pay.
the appellees counter that george is inapplicable because the defendant in that case was more than a casual participant,and had raised more than two million dollars from investors and spent approximately of that amount on himself and his friends.id.at.the george defendant had also known that the money he paid to investors was wrongly characterized as profits,though he did not in fact know whither the money went or whence the money came.with respect to the instant circumstances,the appellees note that vaughn actually believed that the investment was worthwhile because he believed that earthboard was involved in negotiations with vans,a subjective belief that brown seems to concede to be an accurate characterization.
we think that brown has successfully alleged vaughn scienter and has adduced sufficient evidence to withstand summary judgment.vaughn is a licensed securities professional who,by his trade,is fully cognizant of the prohibitions contained in federal securities laws,and,as in george,should be aware of fraudulent schemes such as this one.yet he received a tip from an insider at earthboard to the effect that the company was engaged in unannounced merger negotiations with a public company at that time,undoubtedly a material fact about a company,and that tip included remarkably precise details about the deal probable outcome.of course,acting on that tip would almost certainly have been illegal had the insider not entirely invented it,though it is noteworthy that the tipper himself is currently serving a prison sentence for his role in this tawdry affair.but instead of obeying the letter and spirit of the securities laws,vaughn allegedly chose to enrich himself with illicit gain by abusing the material information he had received,first by purchasing earthboard securities for his own account,and then by soliciting clients and prospective clients to reap their own rewards in order to advance his own interests by impressing them with his investing acumen.it is inherently reckless for a securities professional to attempt to violate the law,and it is no defense to suggest that he actually believed the tip to be true as that simply further demonstrates his foiled intent to circumvent the law.
bolstering our conclusion that brown has sufficiently alleged vaughn recklessness,and consequently scienter,are the facts that he lied to brown about his relationship with jeffreys,which he presumably did in order to enhance the perceived value of his illicit information he apparently conducted not an iota of due diligence with respect to earthboard intrinsic value or the purported transaction with did not even discover that jeffreys was a convicted felon prior to soliciting brown to buy earthboard securities,nor did he apparently visit earthboard plants or meet with jeffreys in person until after brown purchase of earthboard shares the supposed stock swap set an apparently ridiculous price for earthboard he solicited brown and others to buy the shares at six times the price he had paid only a short time before and he received a commission for his efforts from earthboard despite the fact that the company was apparently not his client and his claim that he was not offering the securities for sale within the meaning of state law.
moreover,vaughn retort that he should be excused because it was impossible to have engaged in any proper due diligence investigation into the purported merger is entirely beside the point.the essential value of material information lies in its lack of transparency,for otherwise it would be impossible to capture the arbitral profit that lies between the true the price reflects all information,confidential or the public or discounted but transparent and lawful price that incorporates only the information that is known publicly.unlawfully or illicitly trading on confidential information necessarily makes the tippee dependent on the tipper reputed knowledge about confidential matters,replacing thereby the research required of lawful market participants,and the resulting conduct not only accomplishes an essential fraud on the market,it also renders the tippee fundamentally vulnerable to precisely the sort of fraud that earthboard and jeffreys consummated.see generally,kathleen coles,the dilemma of the remote tippee,gonz.donald langevoort,taming the animal spirits of the stock market a behavioral approach to securities regulation,nw.stephen choi,selective disclosures in the public capital markets,davis.that vaughn also fell victim to this scheme by his own volition does not itself render him immune to liability for his act of passing the tip to others.therefore we hold that brown sufficiently alleged vaughn scienter and adduced sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact so as to withstand summary judgment at this stage.
the district court also found that brown had failed to introduce sufficient evidence to demonstrate that his loss was caused by the appellees actions.in a private securities fraud action,a plaintiff must prove all traditional elements of causation and loss including that the defendant misrepresentation or other fraudulent conduct proximately caused the plaintiff economic loss.dura pharmaceuticals,at.loss causation requires a causal connection between the material misrepresentation and the loss.id.at.it has been likened to proximate cause in tort law.ausa life ins.ernst young,cir.
brown asserts that the purported merger was always and entirely fictitious,and that vaughn recklessness in exploiting rumors of the merger by soliciting brown investment was the direct cause of brown financial loss because he concealed the circumstances that bear upon the loss suffered such that brown would have been spared all or an ascertainable portion of that loss absent the fraud.lentell merrill lynch,cir.in addition,he argues that vaughn committed a material omission by not telling brown that he had purchased shares for or less,and he committed a positive misrepresentation when he explained that the price had risen to in anticipation of the merger.
we agree.in the first place,a reasonable trier of fact could find that brown was induced to make his investment in earthboard as a result of vaughn misrepresentations regarding the transaction and his relationship with jeffreys.both alleged misrepresentations created an illusion that vaughn,a securities professional obviously seeking to impress prospective clients,was passing along reliable,material information.although the supreme court has recently warned that normally,in cases such as this one,cases,an inflated purchase price will not itself constitute or proximately cause the relevant economic loss,dura pharmaceuticals,at,a small private offering is far more subject than shares trading on large public markets to initial purchase prices that are inflated fraudulently.we believe that could have been the case here.once it was revealed that the vans transaction was wholly fictitious,the value of brown investment plummeted,for the share price was allegedly predicated on the purported future value of earthboard shares once the vans transaction closed.brown has adduced evidence sufficient to withstand summary judgment that he was induced to invest in earthboard as a result of vaughn reckless misrepresentations,and that the revelation of the truth about the purported vans merger proximately caused his economic loss.
alternatively,the appellees claim that the context of the purchase indicates that brown could not,as a matter of law,have reasonably or justifiably relied on the information that vaughn allegedly provided.to support their contention,appellees especially note that the subscription agreement that brown signed contained an integration clause in which brown waived any claim that he relied on third party advice in making his purchase.appellees point to certain decisions by several of our sister circuits for the proposition that clauses in sales contracts absolutely foreclose later suits for deceit by prior representation.emergent capital inv,llc stonepath group,cir rissman rissman,cir jackvony riht financial,cir enterprises,caruso.
the appellees overstate their case.in the first place,the law of our circuit requires us to engage in a contextual analysis in order to ascertain whether,as a matter of law,a party has introduced sufficient evidence of reasonable reliance to withstand summary judgment.in assessing reasonable or justifiable reliance on summary judgment,we apply a recklessness standard in looking at the context of the asserted reliance.wright national warranty,cir.among the factors that we have employed in the past to ascertain reasonable reliance in a context are 
the sophistication of expertise of the plaintiff in financial and securities matters the existence of long standing business or personal relationships access to the relevant information the existence of a fiduciary relationship concealment of the fraud the opportunity to detect the fraud whether the plaintiff initiated the stock transaction or sought to expedite the transaction and the generality or specificity of the misrepresentations.
ibid.to erect a per se rule with respect to clauses would undermine the essential point of undertaking a contextual analysis,and we do not choose to adopt such a blanket rule now.
moreover,we do not read the opinions of our sister circuits in the appellees preferred manner far from erecting a per se rule foreclosing the possibility of recovery for deceit in all situations where an allegedly injured party has signed a clause,these opinions simply accord an appropriate weight to evidence of the signing of such a clause in the entire context of the alleged fraud.aes v.the dow chemical,cir rogen ilikon,cir kaufman guest capital,d,noting that the second circuit,in emergent capital,employed a contextual analysis.finally,it is noteworthy that the appellees were not themselves parties to the subscription agreement containing the clause.
under the unusual factual circumstances of this suit,including the clause in the subscription agreement,we do not think that brown acted unreasonably,as an unavoidable matter of law,in relying on the alleged tip of a securities broker who so obviously wanted to impress a prospective client.instead,brown has introduced enough evidence of reasonable reliance to withstand summary judgment at this stage.based on the evidence before us,therefore,we leave the final determination of reliance to the trier of fact.
finally,lincoln argues that,whatever vaughn potential liability,it can not be held secondarily liable as vaughn employer.we agree.in the first place,lincoln qualifies for the
