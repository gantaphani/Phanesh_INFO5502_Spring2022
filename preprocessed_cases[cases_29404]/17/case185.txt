fiber systems international,appeals the district court entry of a judgment on the company claim for damages under the computer fraud and abuse act,the district court grant of partial summary judgment dismissing the company claim for injunctive relief under the act,and the district court denial of judgment as a matter of law and a new trial on the defamation counterclaim raised by daniel roehrs,michael flower,thomas hazelton,rick hobbs,and kieran mcgrath collectively,the individual defendants.defendants conditionally the district court grant of partial summary judgment dismissing defendants counterclaim for defamation of applied optical systems,opteconn,and opteconn,optical cabling systems collectively,the corporate defendants and the district court judgment as a matter of law denying defendants claim that fiber systems international defamed the individual defendants through statements in and letters.for the reasons that follow,we affirm in part,reverse in part,vacate in part,and remand for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
the claims at issue in this appeal arose from the final days of the struggle for control over fiber systems international,fsi,a company that manufactures connectors for military use.the principal opponents in this conflict are roehrs,who was at that time part of the group that had a majority ownership of fsi,and defendant daniel roehrs,who was part of the minority group of shareholders.daniel roehrs and the other individual defendants,all of whom served as officers and directors of fsi,initiated litigation in to determine ownership of the company.the lawsuit settled in august with an agreement allowing michael roehrs to buy out the minority owners stake in the company.when the transaction closed on december,the individual defendants employment was terminated and michael roehrs took control as executive chairman.
in the suit on appeal here,fsi alleged that defendants violated the computer fraud and abuse act cfaa,as they left the company.specifically,fsi asserted that during their departure the defendants knowingly and intentionally accessed,deleted,downloaded,copied,took,and stole fsi confidential business and proprietary information and trade secrets,without authorization,from fsi computers,misappropriated and stole fsi computer equipment,and used and disseminated the wrongfully obtained information through the new companies that they formed daniel roehrs,thomas hazelton,and michael flower through applied optical systems,aos and rick hobbs and kieran mcgrath through opteconn,opteconn and opteconn,optical cabling systems ocs.fsi sought damages and injunctive relief under a,a,and g of the cfaa to compensate for the cost of data recovery and to prevent the defendants from continuing to use and disseminate fsi trade secrets.
defendants filed a defamation counterclaim alleging that fsi falsely accused them of being thieves.they relied on several documents in which fsi allegedly accused the defendants of,inter alia,stealing its intellectual property,as well as deposition testimony showing that fsi accused the individual defendants of being thieves or stealing fsi intellectual property.
defendants later moved for partial summary judgment on fsi claim for injunctive relief,arguing that fsi failed to establish the prerequisites for such relief because there was no evidence that any of the defendants were currently accessing fsi computers or threatening access in the future fsi moved for partial summary judgment on the corporate defendants counterclaim,arguing that the evidence was insufficient to show that the corporate defendants were defamed.the district court granted both motions.
in march,the case proceeded to a jury trial on the remaining claims.at the conclusion of the evidence,the district court submitted fsi claims under a and a of the cfaa to the jury,but submitted only three statements to the jury on defendants defamation counterclaim a police report filed by fsi alleging that defendants had committed theft and statements made by fsi to two companies accusing defendants of being thieves.
with regard to fsi claims,the jury found that none of the individual defendants violated a but that three roehrs,thomas hazelton,and rick a,entitling fsi to in total damages.however,the district court entered a judgment,holding that does not create a civil cause of action for violations of subsection a.
as to defendants counterclaims,the jury found that fsi maliciously accused all five individual defendants of being thieves in its statements to the two companies but that the police report was not filed with actual malice.based on the two defamatory statements,the jury awarded the individual defendants each in compensatory damages and each in punitive damages.because texas law places a cap on punitive damage awards,the district court reduced the punitive damages to for each defendant.
after the jury verdict,fsi filed a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law and,in the alternative,for a new trial.the district court denied this motion,and fsi timely filed a notice of appeal.
ii.discussion 
in this appeal,fsi challenges the district court holding that of the cfaa does not create a civil cause of action for subsection a,as well as the court grant of summary judgment dismissing fsi cfaa claims for injunctive relief.fsi also contends that the district court erred in denying judgment as a matter of law because the jury defamation verdict was based on evidence that was never admitted for substantive use and the statements allegedly made by fsi were nondefamatory.finally,fsi argues that the district court erred in denying a new trial because the jury verdict contained inconsistencies and the district court improperly admitted evidence of nondefamatory statements,which prejudiced the jury defamation findings.
defendants conditionally the district court grant of summary judgment dismissing the defamation claims that were based on statements against the corporate defendants,arguing that the statements should have been submitted to the jury as substantive evidence of defamation.defendants also conditionally the district court decision not to submit those statements to the jury as additional instances in which fsi defamed the individual defendants 
in the analysis that follows,questions of law are reviewed de novo.see,republic of congo,cir.
fsi cfaa claims 
civil liability under a 
despite the jury finding that daniel roehrs,thomas hazelton,and rick hobbs violated a of the cfaa,entitling fsi to damages totaling,the district court held that the cfaa does not create a civil cause of action for violations of a,and it entered a judgment on the claim.fsi appeals,alleging that civil claims for violations of a can be brought under g and that the jury found the elements necessary for entry of judgment on fsi behalf.we agree.
the cfaa criminalizes various fraudulent or damaging activities related to the use of computers.two of its provisions were before the jury in this case.section a prohibits the knowing access of a protected computer without authorization,with intent to defraud,if such conduct furthers the intended fraud and the violator obtains anything of value.a.section a punishes those who cause damage to a protected computer,either through the knowing transmission of a program,information,code,or command,or through intentional,unauthorized computer access.
civil actions are authorized for some,but not all,violations of substantive provisions.section g provides 
any person who suffers damage or loss by reason of a violation of this section may maintain a civil action against the violator to obtain compensatory damages and injunctive relief or other equitable relief.a civil action for a violation of this section may be brought only if the conduct involves of the factors set forth in clause i,ii,iii,iv,or v of subsection a b 
based on its reading of g,the district court held that the section does not create a civil action for violations of a.similarly,defendants argue that the explicit terms of g only authorize civil actions for violations of a.
however,this interpretation is at odds with the language of the statute,which plainly allows such an action to proceed section g extends the ability to bring a civil action to any person suffering damage or loss under this section,which refers to as a whole,as subsection g does not proscribe any conduct itself.and although g refers to subsection a b,the statute does not limit civil suits to violations of a.indeed,if congress intended to limit civil actions in this manner,it could have simply provided that civil actions may only be brought for violations of subsection a.
instead,the statute provides that a claim brought under any of the subsections of must involve one of the factors listed in the numbered clauses of subsection a b.these factors are 
i loss to or more persons during any period and,for purposes of an investigation,prosecution,or other proceeding brought by the united states only,loss resulting from a related course of conduct affecting or more other protected computers aggregating at least in value 
ii the modification or impairment,or potential modification or impairment,of the medical examination,diagnosis,treatment,or care of or more individuals 
iii physical injury to any person 
iv a threat to public health or safety or 
v damage affecting a computer system used by or for a government entity in furtherance of the administration of justice,national defense,or national security 
a b.accordingly,a civil action may be maintained under a of the cfaa if the violative conduct involves any one of these factors our interpretation is consistent with that of other circuits that have addressed this question.see yonkers,celebrations the party seasonal superstore,llc,cir we do not read section g language that the claim must involve one or more of the numbered subsections of subsection a b as limiting relief to claims that are entirely based only on subsection a,but,rather,as requiring that claims brought under other sections must meet,in addition,one of the five numbered a b tests.theofel,cir s ubsection g applies to any violation of this section and,while the offense must involve one of the five factors in a b,it need not be one of the three offenses in a a.
nonetheless,defendants argue that even if a civil cause of action may be maintained under a when one of the a b factors is established,the jury instructions for fsi a claim do not mention any of those factors.only the first factor from a b is at issue here,requiring loss during any period that aggregates to at least in value.
we review jury instructions for abuse of discretion when the instructions were properly objected to in the district court.see united states freeman,cir.but when the challenging party failed to preserve the error below,the instructions are reviewed for plain error.positive black talk cash money records,cir.to avoid plain error review,a specific objection must have been made on the ground raised on appeal,rather than a general objection to the instructions as a whole or an objection on a different ground.see united states fuchs,cir.defendants objected to the a instructions on the ground that there is no civil cause of action under a of the cfaa,but did not object on the ground that the jury was not instructed on the loss element,and accordingly this challenge is subject to plain error review.
in reviewing jury instructions for plain error,we are exceedingly deferential to the trial court.tompkins cyr,cir.for defendants to prevail under the plain error standard,they must show that an error occurred the error was plain,which means clear or obvious the plain error affects substantial rights and failing to correct the error would seriously impact the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.septimus of houston,cir.
in determining whether a particular jury instruction was erroneous,we must consider the instructions as a whole.russell plano bank trust,cir.although the jury charge failed to specifically instruct the jury to find one of the a b factors as a prerequisite to civil liability under a,the damages instruction required the jury to determine the amount of loss caused by the cfaa violation.following this instruction,the jury found that the three defendants violations of a caused fsi loss totaling,which far exceeds the loss requirement.despite defendants argument that the loss found in the damages instruction is somehow different from the substantive element of loss within a b i,the damages instruction defined loss exactly as defined in the damages instruction also required the jury to find that the loss was proximately caused by the conduct that violated a,which was more than enough to satisfy the g requirement that the violative conduct involve one of the a b factors.and even if this aspect of the instructions was erroneous,the jury damages finding shows that no substantial rights were affected,as the jury would have found the minimum met if instructed properly.
further,although the damages instruction erroneously failed to require a finding that the minimum loss occurred during a period,the time element was inherent in the jury finding,demonstrating that no substantial rights were affected.of the damages alleged by fsi,defendants only identify,incurred by the efforts of a data recovery expert,as including some charges that derived from more than a year after the time of the cfaa violation.but a b i does not require that the loss only occur within a year of the cfaa violation rather,it requires that the loss aggregate to during any period.a b i emphasis added.as defendants acknowledge,the data recovery expert first became involved in november,and his fee included work through january,all of which took place well within a span.regardless,the jury found in loss,which at a minimum must have included in loss associated with fsi original data recovery efforts,all of which took place within a span itself.accordingly,the district court failure to instruct the jury that it must find a loss of during a period was inconsequential.
injunctive relief 
fsi also appeals the district court summary judgment dismissal of fsi claim for injunctive relief under the cfaa.the district court held that injunctive relief was unavailable to fsi because the cfaa only allows an injunction to prevent ongoing or future unauthorized access to fsi computers,neither of which is shown here.fsi responds that it is threatened with present and future harm from defendants possession and use of trade secrets stolen by defendants through the acts that violated a and that an injunction should be available under the cfaa to remedy such a harm.
we need not address the question of whether an injunction may issue against the use of the information obtained through a past violation of a.although the jury found that defendants violated a,which required a finding that the defendants obtained something of value through their unlawful computer access,the jury also found that fsi falsely accused defendants of being thieves.thus,the value obtained by defendants could not have included stolen trade secrets.
t he scope of injunctive relief is dictated by the extent of the violation established,and an injunction must be narrowly tailored to remedy the specific action necessitating the injunction.john doe veneman,cir citing califano yamasaki,d valley rapides parish sch,cir.may.because the jury determined that defendants did not steal trade secrets through the acts that violated a,the requested injunction would be improper under the cfaa 
fsi motion for judgment as a matter of law 
fsi also appeals the district court denial of judgment as a matter of law,arguing that the evidence upon which the jury defamation verdict was based could not be considered as substantive evidence of defamation.fsi further contends that even if the evidence is considered substantively,it was insufficient to support a claim of defamation per se.
we review a district court ruling on a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo.victoria county,cir.under this standard,all evidence is viewed in the light and with all reasonable inferences most favorable to the party opposed to the motion.id.quoting resolution trust cramer,cir.this court will not reverse the district court denial of the motion unless a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue.id.quoting ellis weasler eng g,cir.
substantive evidence 
under the federal rules of civil procedure,depositions may be used to contradict or impeach the testimony of deponent as a witness,or for any other purpose permitted by the federal rules of evidence.a.one of these other purposes is the use of a witness prior inconsistent statements from a deposition as substantive evidence.d a gower cohn,cir.may.conceding that michael roehrs video deposition was admissible under these rules for both substantive and impeachment purposes,fsi contends that the defendants only actually used the deposition to impeach michael roehrs during,not as substantive evidence.according to fsi,this rendered the jury unable to consider the deposition as evidence of defamation under gower cohn,at.
gower recognized that materials once admitted for impeachment do not necessarily also become substantive evidence and held that the deposition evidence of prior inconsistent statements in that case was only offered to impeach.id.at.however,gower involved a situation in which both the district judge and the offering party clearly believed that the evidence was being used only to impeach,and in which the relevant jury charge only instructed the jury that the statements could be used as impeachment tools.id.unlike gower,the district judge in this case believed that defendants used the prior inconsistent statements not merely to impeach,but also to prove that fsi had in fact defamed them,and the jury instructions provided that i n determining whether any fact has been proved the jury may,unless otherwise instructed,consider the testimony of all witnesses,which includes a witness video deposition testimony 
because the deposition testimony was accepted as both impeachment and substantive evidence by the district judge and submitted to the jury for both purposes,fsi can only challenge the propriety of that decision.yet,as discussed above,the testimony was admissible as substantive evidence under rule d a.further,fsi failed to object to the jury instructions or request an instruction limiting the jury consideration of the testimony to impeachment purposes.fsi had the burden of requesting such an instruction,and its undisputed failure to do so renders the jury instructions susceptible only to a challenge for plain error.see.savoie otto candies,cir united states booty,cir.as the deposition testimony was actually admissible for substantive use,no plain error exists.see booty,at united states leslie,cir.
defamation per se 
defamation is a false statement about a person,published to a third party,without legal excuse,which damages the person reputation.moore waldrop,no pet.in a claim for defamation per se,t he words are so obviously hurtful that they require no proof that they caused injury in order for them to be actionable.columbia valley reg l med.ctr.bannert,christi,no pet.for a defamatory oral statement to constitute slander per se,it must fall within one of four categories imputation of a crime,imputation of a loathsome disease,injury to a person office,business,profession,or calling,and imputation of sexual misconduct.gray heb food store,christi,writ denied.the first category,which is at issue here,is met by a statement that unambiguously and falsely imputes criminal conduct to a party.id.fsi argues that its allegedly defamatory statements did not unambiguously impute criminal conduct and were not false.
the evidence of fsi defamatory remarks was provided by the testimony of michael roehrs,who spoke of statements that he made on fsi behalf to neil wilkin at optical cable corporation and statements that fsi employee mike dabrowski made to lockheed martin.on,after michael roehrs was asked whether he had told neil wilkin that the defendants were thieves or had stolen property,roehrs answered that he told neil wilkin that there has been misappropriation of intellectual property but denied calling them thieves.defendants counsel then played the following video deposition testimony from michael roehrs 
any other customers or vendors you know of that fiber systems has said to them the defendants are thieves or have stolen property 
ne i l wilkin with optical cable corporation.

also,after michael roehrs denied that mike dabrowski told a lockheed martin employee that defendants were thieves,defendants counsel played the following video deposition testimony from roehrs 
has fsi told anybody at lockheed martin that the defendants are thieves 
i think mike dabrowski,moreover,has let them know that there has been a misappropriation of intellectual property.
by these defendants 
and he was authorized to make these comments by fiber systems 
absolutely.
fsi first argues that this testimony does not show statements that are defamatory per se because they do not impute a crime.fsi acknowledges the extensive precedent holding that a false accusation of theft is defamatory per se,but argues that the recent texas court of appeals decision in moore waldrop establishes that statements like those made here are nondefamatory because they merely involve terms of general disparagement.
moore dealt with the defamatory nature of the statement,you do want to hire him,he a crook.at.the court held that standing alone,the word crook was merely a term of general disparagement,and did not impute a specific crime.id.at see also billington houston fire cas.ins,worth,no writ holding that the use of the words liar and crook were nondefamatory because they were used only as opprobrious terms.the district court here distinguished moore by observing that the word crook differs from thief because the latter much more directly imputes a crime than the word crook,and the court illustrated the point by quoting multiple,nondefamatory dictionary definitions for the word crook.fsi challenges this conclusion by pointing to an alternative definition of crook as a person who steals or cheats,swindler or thief,webster new world dictionary college ed,and by quoting several arcane,nondefamatory definitions of the word thief,including its meanings as a kind of wild bee said to rob hives and an excrescence in the snuff of a candle.see the oxford english dictionary simpson weiner,ed.accordingly,fsi argues that the word crook is no different than the word thief,and the outcome here should be the same as in moore.
we need not resolve a battle of dictionary definitions in this appeal.texas case law firmly establishes that falsely accusing someone of stealing or calling someone a thief constitutes defamation per se.see,bennett computer assocs.int l,writ denied one who falsely imputes to another the crime of theft commits slander per se.falsely calling someone a crook or thief or falsely accusing him of stealing property falls within the parameters of slander per se see also glenn gidel,no writ anderson alcus,no writ.in contrast,as recognized in moore,texas courts have determined that the term crook does not inherently have the same defamatory content.see,moore,at billington,at arant jaffe,no writ.but when the word crook is used in a context imputing theft,it is also defamatory per se.see bennett,at holding that f alsely calling someone a crook was defamatory per se where the defendant called the plaintiff a thief and a crook who had stolen computer software.
while it is similarly possible that a false allegation of theft could be made in a context that renders it nondefamatory,such a situation is not presented here.to affirm the district court decision,it is sufficient that the words used were reasonably capable of a defamatory meaning.musser smith protective.in answering this question,the court must construe each statement as a whole in light of surrounding circumstances based upon how a person of ordinary intelligence would perceive the entire statement.gray,at.the surrounding circumstances are the setting in which the alleged slanderous statement is spoken,consisting of the context of the statement and the common meaning attached to the statement.moore,at.only when the court determines the language is ambiguous or of doubtful import should the jury then determine the statement meaning and the effect the statement publication has on an ordinary reader.musser,at.
here,deposition evidence showed that michael roehrs told neil wilkin that defendants were thieves or had stolen property which directly imputes specific crimes under texas law see.ann.vernon punishing theft of property id.vernon punishing theft of trade secrets see also gray,at determining that an accusation of shoplifting was slanderous per se because shoplifting was punishable under the texas penal code.as the defamation cases discussed above illustrate,the common meaning of fsi statements imputed the crime of theft.and the surrounding circumstances present no factors that would alter the meaning of the statements,particularly considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendants.in fact,michael roehrs described in his live testimony that the statement to neil wilkin was made in the context of a discussion about the misappropriation of fsi property by defendants,which supports the conclusion that the accusation of theft imputed that crime.
nonetheless,fsi argues that from the context of the ongoing,heated controversy between fsi and the defendants,no person of ordinary intelligence could believe that fsi statements were anything more than rhetorical outbursts of an angry and frustrated business owner,much less a real accusation of theft.fsi relies on the supreme court opinion in greenbelt publishing association bresler,d,which held that an accusation of blackmail during a heated city council debate was mere rhetorical hyperbole because the word,in context,clearly referred to the unreasonableness of legal negotiating proposals discussed at the debate rather than the actual crime of blackmail but unlike greenbelt,the circumstances here only bolster the conclusion that michael roehrs was referring to the commission of a crime.the accusation of theft,in context,did not refer to activities readily identifiable to the listener as innocuous,as in greenbelt,but instead referred to the defendants alleged misappropriation of fsi intellectual property.the mere fact that an accusation arose from a heated controversy does not strip the statement of its defamatory content where a person of ordinary intelligence would nonetheless interpret the statement to impute a crime.
finally,fsi argues that the statements made by fsi were true.the truth of a statement is a defense to a claim for defamation.gustafson city of austin,pet.denied.this defense does not require proof that the alleged defamatory statement is literally true in every detail substantial truth is sufficient.id.fsi argues that its statements were substantially true because the jury found that three of the defendants violated a and that fsi report to the allen police department was made without actual malice.
however,the jury specifically found that fsi theft allegations were not substantially true.at most,the jury findings would be inconsistent,requiring a new trial.willard v.the john hayward,cir.thus,fsi argument is properly addressed in connection with its argument that the district court should have granted a new trial based on inconsistent jury findings,which is discussed later in this opinion.for purposes of the district court denial of fsi motion for judgment as a matter of law,the only question is whether the jury had a legally sufficient basis for finding that the allegations were not substantially true,and we are satisfied that defendants testimony provided such a basis.
defendants 
defendants raise in their two issues related to the district court treatment of several documents that allegedly show additional defamatory statements by fsi.first,defendants argue that the district court incorrectly granted summary judgment dismissing their claims that fsi defamed the corporate defendants in the documents.second,defendants contend that the district court erred by failing to submit those documents to the jury as additional instances of defamation against the individual defendants,which was equivalent to judgment as a matter of law for fsi on those issues.see turlington phillips petroleum,cir the district court below failed to submit this issue to the jury,in effect granting the opposing party a directed verdict on that theory of recovery.
the documents at issue are and letters sent by fsi employees or agents to various parties.exhibit is a february from michael roehrs accusing either his mother or daniel roehrs of supporting child molesters.exhibit,which is a january letter from the new fsi management team to business associates after the transition in power,notified the recipients of the change and asked for their assurance that they will not manufacture any proprietary fsi parts or utilize fsi design features for any personnel or former fsi employees.the letter also asked the recipients to let fsi know immediately if contacted by former fsi employees.exhibit is an october letter from fsi attorneys to the defense supply center in columbus,ohio the dscc,which said that certain confidential and proprietary information and trade secrets of fsi have been misappropriated and stolen by applied optical systems.the letter then asked that the dscc refrain from releasing any information submitted by aos in order to protect fsi trade secrets and confidential proprietary information which have been wrongfully taken by certain individuals at aos and unlawfully distributed.
in exhibit,an october to officials of the dscc,michael roehrs wrote that the minority group now known as applied optical systems optical cabling systems have begun using our intellectual property and trade secrets and are entering the market.the also stated that they have provided stolen proprietary information to the dscc and that they are using the government as a tool to launder our proprietary information and trade secrets.finally,exhibits were letters from fsi lawyers to three companies stating that fsi asserts and has reason to believe that these companies are in possession of have acquired fsi confidential proprietary and business information and trade secrets.fsi also believes that one or more of these companies are using,benefiting from,disseminating fsi confidential proprietary and business information and trade secrets.
the district court held that the documents were not capable of defamatory meaning because they did not make any specific allegations that the entities stole fsi proprietary information or knew it to be stolen,or directly accuse the corporate defendants of wrongdoing.the court determined that only exhibit was even arguably defamatory,but that the was intended to update the dscc on a dispute between fsi and the corporate defendants about whether the information the corporate defendants were submitting was fsi proprietary information.accordingly,the court determined that exhibit was mere hyperbolic language alerting the dscc that the information the corporate defendants submitted was the subject of litigation between the two parties and stat ing fsi theory of the case,albeit in somewhat stronger terms than its pleadings.
as we discussed previously,the district court role was to construe each statement in light of the surrounding circumstances to determine how the statement would be perceived by a person of ordinary intelligence.gray,at.if this inquiry shows that a statement falsely and unambiguously imputes criminal conduct,it is defamatory per se.gray,at.if the statement is ambiguous or can not be fully understood without the use of extrinsic evidence,the statement is not defamatory per se,and extrinsic evidence can be considered only under a defamation per quod theory.moore,at.
here,the district court properly held that two of the documents were not capable of defamatory meaning towards the corporate defendants.exhibit,in which michael roehrs accuses his mother or daniel roehrs of supporting child molesters,does not mention the corporate defendants at all.exhibit,in which fsi notified business associates of the change in management,contains no statements that could impute any crime,merely asking the recipients not to manufacture fsi parts or use fsi features for former employees.
however,exhibits and are reasonably capable of defamatory meaning,and in some respects are almost identical to the defamatory statements that the district court ultimately submitted to the jury.exhibit,sent by fsi attorneys to the dscc,stated that aos misappropriated and stole fsi trade secrets,and that fsi trade secrets were unlawfully distributed by aos to the dscc.these statements plainly impute a crime,and their context,which encourages the letter recipient to refrain from releasing information submitted to them by aos,supports the defamatory nature of the statements.further,exhibit,an from michael roehrs to the dscc,accused aos and ocs of provid ing stolen proprietary information to the dscc,and stated that these acts were done to launder fsi proprietary information and trade secrets.texas law criminalizes the knowing and unconsented communicat ion or transmi ssion of a trade secret.ann.b,and despite the district court belief that the was merely intended to update the dscc as to the litigation at issue here,the statements alleging transmission of stolen trade secrets went beyond such a purpose.
accordingly,the district court erred in granting summary judgment on the corporate defendants defamation claims based on exhibits and.the allegedly defamatory statements in exhibits present a closer question,and the district court should reconsider its decision on those exhibits in light of this opinion 
however,the district court properly refused to submit any of these documents to the jury as substantive evidence of defamation of the individual defendants.for a defamatory statement to be actionable,it must refer to an ascertainable person.robertson sw.bell yellow pages,no pet.a person is ascertainable if he is named in the statement or if those who know the person would understand that the statement was referring to the person.ledig duke energy,dist,no pet.further,a member of a group has no cause of action for a defamatory statement directed to some or less than all of the group when there is nothing to single out the plaintiff.eskew plantation foods,no writ.whether a party is ascertainable is a question of law for the court,but is submitted to the jury if the language is ambiguous or of doubtful import.ledig,at.
defendants first argue that exhibit was directed not only at aos,but the individual defendants as well.however,the language of the letter attributes criminal action to aos,not to the individuals who work for aos,and is incapable of defamatory meaning against the individual defendants.see ledig,at holding that statements about a company actions did not defame a member of the company senior management.the letter does refer to information wrongfully taken by certain individuals at aos,but nothing identifies any particular individual defendant similarly,exhibit refers to t he minority group now known as applied optical systems optical cabling systems and alleges current criminal behavior.although the letter references a past designation of the individuals as a group of minority owners in fsi,the context of the refers to that group present status as aos and ocs and alleges present that the crimes are only attributed to the named companies.further,exhibits make no reference at all to any of the individual defendants,mentioning only the acts of the corporate defendants.
defendants also point to exhibit,which alleges that c ertain individuals have admitted under oath that they violated the cfaa,but the exhibit does not identify any particular individuals.finally,exhibit may accuse daniel roehrs of supporting child molesters,but defendants fail to identify any crime that such an allegation imputes.
fsi motion for a new trial 
accompanying fsi motion for judgment as a matter of law,the company moved in the alternative for a new trial.in this appeal,fsi challenges the district court denial of a new trial,alleging that the jury verdict contained inconsistent answers to the special interrogatories and that the jury finding on defamation was improperly influenced by the spillover prejudice of inadmissible evidence.we review a district court ruling on a motion for new trial for abuse of discretion.int l ins.rsr,cir.this court also gives great deference to the district court ruling when it has denied the new trial motion and upheld the jury verdict.id.
inconsistent jury findings 
if the jury gives inconsistent answers to special interrogatories,the case must be remanded for a new trial.willard v.the john hayward,cir.in determining whether answers are inconsistent,we look to whether the answers may fairly be said to represent a logical and probable decision on the relevant issues as submitted.fdic fid.deposit,cir citation omitted.a jury answers should be considered inconsistent,however,only if there is no way to reconcile them.willard,at.this court makes a concerted effort to reconcile apparent inconsistencies in answers to special verdicts if at all possible.ellis weasler eng g,cir.
fsi argues that two different jury findings contradict the jury determination that fsi falsely and maliciously accused defendants of being thieves.first,fsi contends that the jury finding that three of the defendants violated a is equivalent to a finding that those defendants were thieves.second,fsi argues that the jury determination that fsi filed the police report of computer theft without malice establishes that fsi accusations that defendants stole the intellectual property on those computers were made without malice as well.
however,each of these findings can be reconciled.first,the finding that three defendants violated a did not necessarily establish that the defendants were thieves.section a deals with unlawful access of computer systems to further fraud.a.although the jury found that three defendants violated this section,and that their unlawful access caused a loss to fsi totaling,the determination did not require a finding that the defendants stole trade secrets or anything else.section a does require a finding that the violator obtained something of value by means of the unlawful access,but the value need not be a trade secret or even something that was stolen.the jury could have found that the value obtained by defendants inhered in the temporary use or possession of computer hardware as fsi suggested in its closing arguments or some other value that was obtained without theft.
additionally,the finding that fsi did not act with actual malice in filing the police report of computer theft does not establish,as fsi claims,that the report of theft was true or that later statements were made without malice as well.as the jury was instructed,actual malice means that the party making the publication acted with actual knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.accordingly,the jury finding on the police report does not mean that the jury believed that the allegations of theft were actually true,but merely that fsi believed it was true to the extent necessary to avoid liability.further,the jury could have determined that fsi sincerely believed when the police report was filed that the defendants stole computer equipment,but recklessly disregarded the truth when fsi accused defendants of stealing the company intellectual property in statements made two months later.the statements are therefore easily reconcilable.
spillover prejudice 
in united states edwards,cir,this court considered whether evidentiary spillover from invalid claims can be a basis for granting a new trial.we stated that to make such a claim,a party must a t a minimum show that it has experienced some prejudice as a result of the joinder of invalid claims,that otherwise inadmissible evidence was admitted to prove the invalid claims.id.at.fsi argues in this appeal that the jury defamation findings were improperly prejudiced by other allegedly defamatory statements that were admitted by the district court and submitted to the jury even though the court held that they were nondefamatory as a matter of law.defendants,in addition to arguing that the
