background 
because neca appeal arises from the district court grant of a motion to dismiss,we draw the relevant facts from the class complaint.in re cerner.sec,cir.
hutchinson is a leading manufacturer and supplier of suspension assemblies for all sizes and types of computer hard disk drives.suspension assemblies are critical components of disk drives that hold the recording heads of the drives in a position above spinning magnetic disks.in fiscal year,hutchinson five largest customers for suspension assemblies accounted for almost of its net revenue,and sales of suspension assemblies accounted for of hutchinson total net revenue.
on october,the first day of the class period,hutchinson reported that it expected to exceed its guidance for the fourth quarter of,which ended on september.previously,in a guidance given during july,hutchinson had said it expected to report earnings per share eps of breakeven to.however,in this announcement,on the first day of the class period,hutchinson reported eps of to for,exceeding its predicted eps.in this same announcement,hutchinson reported that it expected demand for its products to increase in.in response to this announcement,on october,hutchinson stock price increased from to.

on november,in line with the above prediction,hutchinson released its financial results,and the company reported eps of.on the same day,hutchinson executive officers fortun and ingleman hosted a conference call for analysts and investors,and during the call,president fortun stated that overall,we continue to expect suspension assembly demands to trend upward.however,hutchinson stock price fell to around per share.over the next few days,after the stock price declined further,company officers fortun,ingleman,graczyk,schaefer,and penn sold a combined total of shares of hutchinson stock at to per share,receiving about million in net proceeds.
on january,hutchinson announced that it had exceeded an earlier shipment guidance for,and on january,hutchinson released its financial results.on both dates,fortun stated that demand for suspension assemblies in was stronger than the company had expected.on a january,conference call for analysts and investors,fortun reported that at current levels of demand we are operating at close to full capacity and that hutchinson was struggling to figure out how we going to meet the general demand requirements and build some inventory at the same time we do know if we going to necessarily make that happen.a few days later,executives graczyk and schaefer sold a combined total of,shares of hutchinson stock at to per share,resulting in net proceeds of almost million.on february,hutchinson filed its form with the sec in which it reiterated previously announced financial results and included fortun and ingleman certifications.the form reported that hutchinson return allowances were increased by in,which was a smaller increase than that of.
on march,hutchinson again announced that it had exceeded an earlier shipment guidance,this time for.in the related press release,fortun said that demand grew steadily through the quarter and that hutchinson planned to increase manufacturing capacity from approximately million suspension assembly units per week to million units per week.to facilitate this growth,hutchinson had increased its capital spending budget from million to million.
on april,hutchinson released its financial results and stated that demand was strong industry wide.on that same day,during a conference call with investors and analysts,fortun said that we believe we are on a number of new disk drive programs that will be transitioning into volume production in the coming months and we have been on a forced march since about last year.we have not been able to hold inventories to where they need to be we going to have to really scramble to stay with it.the next day hutchinson stock price went up to.on april,graczyk sold a combined total of shares of hutchinson stock at to per share,resulting in approximately of net proceeds.the next day hutchinson filed its form which included previously announced financials,fortun and ingleman certifications and a report that hutchinson return allowance was being increased by,which was more than the amount the allowance had increased in.
on july,near the end of the class period,hutchinson announced that it had not met its shipment projections because of capacity constraints and had only met its income projection due to a tax refund it had received.hutchinson noted that the gross margin increase in was partially offset by inefficiencies resulting from operating at peak capacity while bringing new units into production and by higher costs for expedited production and shipping.however,hutchinson also reported that demand remained strong,shipments and sales prices exceeded both the previous quarter and,and it expected sales to increase in.the day after this announcement hutchinson stock price dropped from to.a few days later fortun,ingleman,and green sold a combined total of shares of hutchinson stock at to per share,resulting in net proceeds over million.

the complaint includes allegations from five confidential witnesses cws.confidential witness cw,a manufacturing supervisor at hutchinson sioux falls,south dakota manufacturing plant,indicated that beginning in may there was a significant increase in detection and production of defective suspension assemblies.according to,hutchinson customers returned approximately one million assemblies per week to the sioux falls plant from may through december when he left hutchinson.cw claimed that in the six months before may,hutchinson product return rate had increased by and approximately of the returned defective assemblies were not reusable.by june,according to,the sioux falls plant began missing its production quotas.
according to,a quality engineering manager at hutchinson plymouth,minnesota plant,from november through june hutchinson added approximately additional capacity each quarter.during this same period,stated that hutchinson production of defective product increased from of total units produced to of total units produced.said that each week the plant manager at the plymouth,minnesota plant would create a weekly activity report that detailed the plant production for the week,and the report was emailed to vice president.noted that if there were any product yield problems,the report would contain the plant manager analysis of the root cause of the problem and what steps were being taken to correct the problem.
one of hutchinson plant managers who reported to penn,said that plant managers were responsible for producing weekly reports to penn executive assistant detailing output,product yield,scrap rates,quality control issues,and production problems that occurred during the week.stated that penn executive assistant created a consolidated report,after receiving all of the individual reports,which was then forwarded back to each plant manager.according to,in september,one of hutchinson major customers began returning approximately suspension assemblies per week over the course of a month because of defective parts.
a human resources manager at the eau claire,wisconsin plant,participated in weekly video conference calls with hutchinson plant managers and executives fortun,penn,graczyk,ingleman and schaefer.these calls,according to,focused on weekly plant manager review reports.call participants discussed suspension assembly output,production projections and production problems.said that the weekly reports informed all individual defendants that for each increase in production capacity,hutchinson experienced a increase in the product defect rate.
was a human resource generalist at the eau claire,wisconsin plant.according to,the number of defective disk drive suspension assemblies noticeably increased during the class period.
in response to the class complaint,hutchinson and the individual defendants filed a motion to dismiss.the district court granted the motion to dismiss,holding that the complaint did not meet the heightened pleading standards for falsity and scienter required by the pslra.see b.the court also dismissed the section controlling persons claim,finding that it was derivative of neca section b claim.see.the district court further found that amending the complaint would be futile and thus denied neca leave to amend.
ii.discussion 
on appeal neca argues that the district court erred in holding that neca failed to state a claim under the requirements of the pslra dismissing its controlling persons claim and denying leave to amend the complaint.
standard of review 
we review the district court grant of a motion to dismiss a securities fraud complaint de novo.in re cerner.sec,at.we may affirm the district court dismissal of the complaint if neca can prove no set of facts that would entitle it to relief.id.
also,a s a check against abusive litigation by private parties,congress enacted the pslra.exacting pleading requirements are among the control measures congress included in the pslra.tellabs,makor issues rights,d internal citation omitted.the pslra heightens the federal rule of civil procedure b standard in two important ways.first,the pslra provides that to survive a motion to dismiss,the complaint must specify each statement alleged to have been misleading,the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading,and,if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief,the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.b.second,the complaint must,with respect to each act or omission alleged to violate this chapter,state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.b.although we construe the complaint liberally and accept the facts pleaded as true,we reject unwarranted inferences and conclusory or assertions of law.in re cerner.sec,at.
neca argues that it alleged,with the specificity required by the pslra,that hutchinson made materially false or misleading statements.
in order to satisfy the reform act falsity pleading standard,a complaint may not rest on mere allegations that fraud has occurred.instead,the complaint must indicate why the alleged misstatements would have been false or misleading at the several points in time in which it is alleged they were made.in other words,the complaint facts must necessarily show that the defendants statements were misleading.
id.at internal citations and quotations omitted.
neca complaint alleges two types of false and misleading statements during the class period.first,neca alleges that hutchinson reported financial results during the class period,eps,were false and misleading because return allowances were understated.second,neca alleges that individual defendants,such as fortun and ingleman,made false and misleading statements regarding customer demand,hutchinson ability to meet demand,and sales and earnings projections.
neca alleges that return allowances were too low during the class period and therefore,hutchinson eps were overstated.neca claims that financial statements regarding eps were false because during the class period product quality was down and the number of defects were up,as were returns 
neca claims that the increases in return allowances through the class period were inadequate because customer return rates and product defect rates were rapidly increasing.neca focuses on the increases in return allowance for,and.neca argues that for the return allowance increase was lower than it should have been.for,neca argues that the return allowance increase was lower than it should have been.and the return allowance for,neca alleges,was lower than it should have been.
these numbers,and the backbone of neca allegations,come from statements made by the cws.neca relies on the statements made by that from november through june hutchinson added additional capacity each quarter,and the rate increased from to of total units produced.neca alleges that for each increase in production per quarter from november to june,hutchinson generated more defective products per quarter.neca also relies on statement that customer returns increased from late through may.neca alleges that because quarterly return allowances were not increasing at rates higher than they had in the previous year the increases were inadequate.
neca allegations that earnings were overstated fail under the pslra because they are either bare allegations or allegations supported by anecdotal information about specific customers with no historical context.as the district court noted,provided the only basis for an allegation of an actual increase in the customer return rate,and without any allegations showing the basis of knowledge,neca claim that the return allowances were inadequate because of rising customer returns does not meet the standard of the pslra.nothing in the complaint puts the returns spoken of by in perspective or suggests that they were something other than normal business fluctuations.and these anecdotes offered by the cws about specific plants and specific customers are the only information that support the claim that return allowances were inadequate.for example,the complaint alleges,according to,that in september one customer returned assemblies per week for one month.events at one specific plant or with one individual customer are not enough to meet the pslra heightened standard.see in re amdocs.sec,cir wollman,concurring stating that a complaint that described problems on individual projects staffed by the defendant and a number of general impressions shared by employees and contractors was not enough to show that the defendant representations about strong demand were false.allegations that production and errors were up at certain plants is not enough to support a claim that hutchinson knew their eps statements were false.we agree with the district court that without allegations showing the basis of cw knowledge,neca claim that return allowances were inadequate is not sufficient under the pslra.
neca has not even alleged that the returns materially exceeded the return allowances.instead,neca relies on the cws statements.even under prior,less rigorous pleading standards,neca needed to plead facts that showed that the allowances were ultimately inadequate.see in re acceptance ins.sec,cir even under the liberal pleading requirements of federal rule of civil procedure a,the district court found that the appellants had failed to state any facts to support their claim.notably missing was any fact alleged in the complaint that indicated acceptance reserves were inadequate in light of the montrose decision.hutchinson has never restate
