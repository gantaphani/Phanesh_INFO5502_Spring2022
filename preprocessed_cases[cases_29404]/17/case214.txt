this diversity action concerns claims for breach of trust,shareholder oppression,and fraud and misrepresentation as governed by michigan law.it also presents an interesting federal question as to the breadth of the probate exception to federal jurisdiction.plaintiff jane evans has an interest in three trusts,whose primary assets are voting and nonvoting stock in ervin industries,a corporation.evans family members,who have interests in two of the three trusts,are the other beneficiaries of the trust.in,evans sued her siblings,the trust company defendant bank one,and defendant ervin industries in michigan probate court.the essence of her claim was that bank one lending relationship with ervin industries caused bank one to have a conflict of interest and abdicate its responsibilities as trustee in the course of three business transactions,occurring in,and.the probate court dismissed her suit,and the michigan court of appeals recently affirmed.
before the probate court dismissed her suit,evans brought similar claims in federal district court.she alleged tortious conduct in connection with the same three business transactions and sued ervin industries,pearson enterprises,bank one trust company,bank one,her brother john pearson,and bank one trust officer james meretta.the district court dismissed all of her claims in response to defendants motions to dismiss.the district court held that the probate exception to federal jurisdiction divested it of jurisdiction to entertain evans claim for breach of trust.the court dismissed all of evans other claims on grounds of collateral estoppel or inadequate pleading.the lower court also refused or declined to consider evans requests to amend her complaint.evans appeals,challenging the dismissal of her claims for breach of trust,shareholder oppression,and fraud and the denial of her request to amend her complaint.for the following reasons,we affirm.
in reviewing the grant of a motion to dismiss under rule b,we must accept all factual allegations of the complaint as true and construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,benzon morgan stanley,cir.doing so,we conclude that dismissal was proper,in part,on collateral estoppel grounds and,in part,for failure to plead with sufficient particularity.
the trusts and the parties 
there are three trusts involved in this litigation.two of these trusts are testamentary.the first testamentary trust was created by john ervin,who founded defendant ervin industries,which manufactures steel abrasives.ervin industries is a michigan corporation with its principal place of business in michigan,and ervin grandson,defendant john pearson,is its current president,ceo,and director.the primary asset of ervin testamentary trust was ervin industries class a voting stock.his daughter and four grandchildren are the income beneficiaries,and two of those grandchildren,plaintiff evans and defendant pearson,are parties to this suit.this substantial trust was divided into five separate trusts in so that each beneficiary had his or her own trust.the second testamentary trust was established by ervin wife,and its primary asset was the remaining class a voting stock in ervin industries.evans and her siblings have beneficial interests in this testamentary trust as well.
the final trust at issue in this case is not testamentary.evans established her own revocable trust in.the res of the revocable trust is class b nonvoting stock in ervin industries.evans named herself the income beneficiary of her revocable trust and another trust company as the remainder beneficiary of any trust property in existence at her death.because evans trust is revocable,she concedes that she has control over the trust.
defendant bank one trust company bank one trust is the sole trustee of the testamentary trusts.therefore,bank one trust controls all of the class a voting stock in ervin industries by acting as trustee of all rights.bank one trust was also the,along with evans,of the revocable trust.defendant james meretta is employed as a trust officer for bank one trust,and he also serves on the board of directors of both defendants pearson enterprises and ervin industries.the district court found that meretta was the trust officer for the revocable trust.it is unclear from the record whether he is also the trust officer for the other trusts.bank one trust,bank one,and meretta have the same counsel and are referred to collectively as the bank one defendants.
pearson enterprises was incorporated in michigan in and has its principal place of business there.pearson enterprises was a participant in two of the three transactions at issue in this case.john pearson is also the president,ceo,and director of pearson enterprises.john pearson,pearson enterprises,and ervin industries have the same counsel and are referred to collectively as the pearson defendants.
the three business transactions at issue 
evans claims arise out of three business transactions.the first transaction was a acquisition of barton abrasives,a company located in the united kingdom,for million.the defendants created a limited partnership to complete this transaction.the general partner was the incorporated pearson enterprises,and the limited partner was ervin industries.evans purchased more than shares of stock in pearson enterprises with over million that she had received in trust distributions.evans alleges that she ultimately lost all of this investment.evans complaint alleged that the defendants had false valuation reports prepared,made false descriptions of,charged her an excessive price in the acquisition,failed to supervise agents,failed to perform due diligence,concealed material facts,and negotiated unreasonably.evans alleged that bank one and meretta approved this transaction.she also alleged that the defendants concealed their misrepresentations until.
the second transaction was ervin industries and pearson enterprises acquisition of a interest in ervin leasing company from great lakes.evans alleged that she purchased an additional worth of pearson shares to help finance the acquisition.according to her complaint,she invested her directly and through her revocable trust.evans alleges that she also lost this entire investment because of the defendants misrepresentations and concealment.she also alleged that the defendants failed to disclose that the acquisition was a poor investment and that evans would not receive dividend income for the foreseeable future.her allegations continue that the defendants failed to engage in due diligence and that bank one failed to inform her of its conflict of interest,which resulted from its and its affiliates loans to ervin leasing company.evans again alleged that the defendants concealed the misrepresentations until.
the final transaction at issue is ervin industries acquisition of the barnsteel company for million.evans alleged that bank one trust and meretta failed to perform due diligence,disclose that the terms of the transaction were unreasonable and imprudent,and disclose that bank one trust had a conflicting lending relationship.barnsteel closure in resulted in a substantial loss to ervin industries and to the value of evans stock.evans has not alleged that she invested any of her own money in this transaction.
procedural history 
evans first brought suit in michigan probate court on august,for the removal and surcharge of bank one trust as the trustee of the testamentary trusts.ervin industries and john pearson were also parties to the suit.in connection with the three transactions described above,evans alleged that she suffered substantial lost income because bank one trust had a conflict of interest due to its lending relationship with ervin industries,failed to perform due diligence,and administered the trusts in contravention of its fiduciary duties.the parties filed for summary judgment.
the probate court,on december,ruled in favor of bank one trust.the probate court held that bank one trust loans to ervin were proper under michigan law.that court also determined that evans claims were barred by the applicable statutes of limitation and by principles of res judicata because the probate court had entered orders approving bank one accounts.as for evans argument that the statute of limitations should be tolled because of fraudulent concealment,the probate court held that she failed to allege fraud or fraudulent concealment in her petition and that,in any case,she had notice of the significant transactions years before filing suit.evans appealed,and the michigan court of appeals affirmed on february.see in re ervin evans bank one trust,wl.the michigan supreme court recently denied leave to appeal.see in re john ervin testamentary trust,table.
evans filed the case at bar in the district court below on november.she brought seven claims relating to the three business transactions improper discharge of corporate duties in violation of a,shareholder oppression under,breach of trust,fraud,silent fraud,innocent misrepresentation,and civil conspiracy.on april,the district court,in response to the defendants motion to dismiss,dismissed most of evans claims.
first,the court dismissed the claim for improper discharge of corporate duties because the statute of limitations had run.second,the court dismissed the claims based on the barton abrasives and ervin leasing transactions because the applicable statute of limitations had run against evans.the court held,however,that evans met the limitations period regarding her claim based on the barnsteel transaction.third,the court held that the probate exception to federal jurisdiction deprived the court of jurisdiction to hear evans claim for breach of trust.fourth,the district court disposed of the fraud and misrepresentation claims together and determined that the statute of limitations barred the claims concerning the barton abrasives and ervin leasing transactions.the court also determined that evans had not pled sufficient facts of fraudulent concealment to toll the statute,and,even if she had,she failed to qualify for michigan grace period in the case of fraudulent concealment because she should have discovered the concealment by the time she filed her probate action.fifth,the district court dismissed her fraud claim concerning the barnsteel transaction,but the court did not expressly state its rationale.presumably the court accepted the defendants argument,which the court described in its order,that evans failed to plead reliance.finally,the court allowed her claim for civil conspiracy to proceed because at least one of her other claims count two survives 
the filings leading up to the district court order included one styled plaintiff response to the ervin defendants motion to dismiss and plaintiff for leave to amend.the stated in its entirety,in the alternative,plaintiff respectfully moves this court to grant her for leave to amend her complaint and jury demand pursuant to.the district court denied the motion as futile because evans had not offered an amended complaint or specifically stated how the amendments would create causes of action that could survive the limitation periods or the court limited jurisdiction.
on august,the district court considered the remaining claims for shareholder oppression and civil conspiracy concerning the barnsteel transaction.the pearson defendants brought a motion to dismiss.the bank one defendants submitted a motion for summary judgment.
the district court dismissed both of the remaining claims on august,pursuant to the motion to dismiss.the court held that evans could not satisfy any of the statutory requirements for a claim of stockholder oppression under.the court first held that the probate court earlier order collaterally estopped evans from arguing that the defendants lending relationship was illegal.the court then held that evans shareholder claim was defective because,without investing in the barnsteel transaction,she could not plead reliance.last,the court held that evans could not maintain a claim for willfully unfair and oppressive acts because she was collaterally estopped from arguing that bank one acted illegally and because she failed to plead a separate and distinct injury regarding the barnsteel transaction.because the court had determined that all other claims had to be dismissed,it ruled that evans conspiracy claim failed as a matter of law.
in two filings styled response,each accompanied by a brief,evans provided the following short request in the alternative,plaintiff respectfully moves this court to grant her for leave to amend her complaint and jury demand pursuant to.an amended complaint was attached as an exhibit to evans response to the ervin defendants motion to dismiss,but it was only mentioned on page ten and in footnote five of her brief.the parties disagree as to whether evans request constituted a motion.in the section of its opinion denying the remaining motions,the court did not mention evans requests for leave to amend.the district court mentioned in a footnote to its order that it would not consider any of evans references to her proposed amended complaint because the court determined that evans was attempting to circumvent the court earlier order denying her original,general request for leave to amend.
on appeal,evans challenges the district court rulings as to her claims for breach of trust,shareholder oppression,and fraud.she also challenges the district court denial of her requests for leave to amend.
the district court properly dismissed all of evans claims.although the district court had federal jurisdiction to decide whether bank one breached its fiduciary duties,evans claim was properly dismissed because she is collaterally estopped from arguing fraudulent concealment and thus that her claim survives the applicable statute of limitations.evans shareholder claims based on the and transactions are barred by the statute of limitations because evans failed to plead fraudulent concealment with particularity and because collateral estoppel bars evans from arguing fraudulent concealment.her claim concerning the transaction also fails because collateral estoppel precludes her from alleging the facts that support her claim.evans fraud claims concerning the and transactions fail because,as she did not plead fraudulent concealment with particularity,she can not satisfy the statute of limitations.her fraud claim relating to the transaction fails because she did not plead reliance with particularity.finally,the district court did not improperly deny evans requests for leave to amend.
we review de novo the district court order to dismiss pursuant to.b.see columbia,tatum,cir.we must accept evans factual allegations as true and construe all reasonable inferences in her favor.see id.on the other hand,this liberal standard of review requires more than recitation of bare legal conclusions id.
the district court had jurisdiction to decide evans claim against the bank one defendants for breach of trust because the probate exception is not applicable to evans claim.evans claim involves only an action in personam regarding her revocable trust,an inter vivos trust that is unrelated to any probate proceedings.the probate exception to federal jurisdiction is defined by federal law.the supreme court,appropriately,has shaded its contours.in markham allen,the key supreme court case on the subject,the supreme court explained that the equity jurisdiction of the courts does not extend to claims requiring interference with probate proceedings,assumption of general jurisdiction over probate,or assumption of control over property in the custody of a state court.because evans claim does not require the federal court to interfere with probate proceedings,assume general jurisdiction over probate,or assume control over property in the custody of a state court,the district court has jurisdiction to consider her claim.
evans claim for breach of inter vivos trust does not concern probate issues and therefore does not interfere with any probate matters.first,evans claim does not interfere with any probate proceedings because it concerns business transactions and stock that are not tied to any probate proceedings.she did not place her nonvoting stock into trust until,and the administration of the revocable trust has no relation to any decedent or decedent estate.unlike other cases in which courts have found interference,evans claim is not a disguised probate claim.see marshall marshall,cir,cert.granted,d declaring the plaintiff claim a thinly veiled will contest storm storm,cir same.that the claim evans brought in federal court shares similar facts and allegations with her earlier claims regarding her interest in the testamentary trusts is insufficient to demonstrate that her claim in federal court interferes with probate proceedings.the question is not of similarity but of interference bank one proffers no explanation of how the exercise of federal jurisdiction will obstruct the state probate court.
second,the district court would not assume general jurisdiction over probate by hearing evans claim.evans claim does not require the court to administer an estate,evaluate the validity of a document,or determine the rights of interested parties to property.because no general probate is occurring or envisioned regarding this claim,this is not a case of the district court usurping the general jurisdiction of the probate court.
last,evans action is in personam and does not require the federal court to take custody of any property already in state custody.because the revocable trust has never,as far as the record demonstrates,been the subject of any litigation or other legal proceedings,the state courts have no custody of any property in the revocable trust.but even if the state courts had property in custody,there is no conflict over the custody of trust property because evans has not brought an action in rem or,asking the federal court to take custody of property away from state court to determine the rights of interested parties in that property.in rogers girard trust,cir,we held that the probate exception did not extend to an in personam action for breach of a testamentary trust where the action did not affect the possession of property already in the control of the probate court.evans claim,accordingly,implicates none of markham three forbidden infringements on exclusively state probate jurisdiction.
to argue,as bank one does obliquely,that state legislation always defines the boundaries of the probate exception,and thus federal jurisdiction,would contravene markham and misinterpret precedent from this circuit that is wholly consistent with markham.bank one contends that federal courts have no jurisdiction to hear evans claim for breach of trust because this circuit has examined a probate court exclusive jurisdiction when mapping the contours of the probate exception and because michigan law places issues regarding all trusts not simply testamentary trusts within the exclusive jurisdiction of the probate court,see b.although this court has held that t he standard for determining whether federal jurisdiction may be exercised is whether under state law the dispute would be cognizable only by the probate court,lepard nbd bank,cir citing mckibben chubb,cir this court has examined the exclusive jurisdiction of probate courts only when a claim concerned a decedent estate.see,bedo mcguire,cir starr rupp,ohio misc,cir.these examinations of probate jurisdiction are consistent with markham because we were ensuring that federal jurisdiction did not interfere with probate administration.because the supreme court,in determining that a suit could proceed despite its relationship with estate administration,held that federal equity jurisdiction can not be curtailed by state legislation as to its the state own courts,waterman bank trust,it follows that state legislatures can not circumscribe federal jurisdiction over trusts.see golden golden,cir.
trusts as a general matter have historically been subject to federal jurisdiction,and m any,if not most,courts have held that the probate exception does not apply to actions involving trusts.sianis jensen,cir see also peter nicolas,fighting the probate mafia a dissection of the probate exception to federal court jurisdiction,cal.congress granted federal courts jurisdiction over suits that could have been brought in that english chancery court,see nicolas at,and,in colonial times,the english high court of chancery had exclusive jurisdiction over trusts,see id.at.in contrast,the probate exception exists,in part,because probate matters,as opposed to trusts,were not heard in the english high court of chancery or courts.see markham,at.
although it is true that federal courts have properly applied the probate exception to claims concerning trusts that act as will substitutes,the revocable trust in this case is not a will substitute.refusing to hear cases regarding will substitutes is consistent with markham because adjudication concerning will substitutes would frequently interfere with probate administration.the cases to which bank one refers for the proposition that federal courts do not have jurisdiction to hear any claim regarding inter vivos trusts involve deaths and trusts that were will substitutes.see storm storm,marshall,golden,georges glick,cir.evans claim does not involve any death or estate management.instead,evans is the settlor,who controls the res of her revocable trust and brings an in personam action against the trustee for damages.the circumstances surrounding the revocable trust do not impinge the concerns of a trust acting as a will substitute,and there is no justification,therefore,for the federal courts to invoke the probate exception to avoid hearing her claim for breach of revocable trust.
if,in contrast,exclusive probate jurisdiction under state law were to determine federal jurisdiction,nothing would prevent a state from purposefully moving whole bodies of law into its probate courts to constrict federal diversity jurisdiction.moreover,such a holding would create a perverse incentive for parties to structure transactions with trusts to avoid federal jurisdiction.for these reasons,the district court had jurisdiction to hear evans claim for breach of the revocable trust.
although we conclude that the district court had jurisdiction,we need not remand evans claim because evans is collaterally estopped from arguing that her claim satisfies the applicable statute of limitations.federal courts sitting in diversity must give to a judgment the same preclusive effect as would be given that judgment under the law of the state in which the judgment was rendered.migra warren city sch.dist.bd.of,d.under michigan law,c ollateral estoppel precludes relitigation of an issue in a subsequent,different cause of action between the same parties where the prior proceeding culminated in a valid,final judgment and the issue was actually litigated,and necessarily determined.see people gates.all of the requirements for issue preclusion under michigan law are satisfied in this case.
despite evans argument to the contrary,the facts underlying evans claims for breach of trust are the same for all three trusts.in both suits,she alleged that the bank violated its fiduciary duty by having a conflict of interest,failing to invest prudently,failing to be loyal,and failing to disclose information to her.evans federal suit concerns bank one actions in the same three business transactions that were at issue in the state proceeding.that evans now sues for breach of her revocable trust that contained nonvoting stock and over which the probate court determined that it lacked jurisdiction as opposed to her grandfather trust that contained voting stock and was testamentary is a distinction without a difference for purposes of collateral estoppel.because the factual issues and the applicable statutes of limitation are the same in both suits,collateral estoppel is relevant.
all of the requirements for collateral estoppel are satisfied in this case,and michigan law therefore precludes evans from asserting her claim for breach of trust.bank one and evans,parties to this suit,were parties to the probate proceeding,which resulted in a valid,final judgment in the probate court against evans.the michigan court of appeals affirmed the judgment in february,see in re ervin evans bank one trust,wl,and the michigan supreme court has since denied leave to appeal,see in re john ervin testamentary trust,table.the issue of whether bank one breached its fiduciary duties in the course of the three acquisitions was decided in the probate court and on appeal and thus actually litigated.see monat,at.as for the final requirement that the issue be necessarily determined,evans alleged in her complaint to the probate court that bank one breached its fiduciary duties regarding the testamentary trusts because of its lending activities concerning the three major acquisitions.the state appellate court held that all of evans claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitation used for breaches of fiduciary duty.evans,wl,at.the appellate court also held that,because evans was presented with sufficient evidence to place her on notice of the events,she was not entitled to plead fraudulent concealment.id.at.deciding this limitations issue was necessary to the suit because it concerned the timeliness of her claim and thus whether evans could state a cause of action.accordingly,all four criteria for issue preclusion have been met in this case,and the district court therefore properly dismissed evans claim for breach of trust.
evans claims for shareholder oppression against the bank one defendants and john pearson concerning the and transactions are barred by michigan statute of limitations,and she is not entitled to an extended limitations period by alleging fraudulent concealment.none of the parties challenge the district court ruling that,providing a limitations period,applies to evans claims.evans argues,however,that her claims are not barred because she alleged fraudulent concealment pursuant to,which gives her two years after discovery of the concealment to bring her claim.evans can not rely on fraudulent concealment because she failed to plead fraudulent concealment with particularity,as required by.b.the decision of the michigan court of appeals in the probate litigation also collaterally estops evans from arguing that she did not have the information to uncover the oppression relating to the and transactions.
evans did not sufficiently plead all of the required elements of fraudulent concealment.the federal rules of civil procedure,which control pleading in diversity cases,see charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure ed,require that the acts constituting fraudulent concealment of a claim be pled in the complaint.see.b.the acts constituting concealment are wrongful concealment of their actions by the defendants failure of the plaintiff to discover the operative facts that are the basis of his cause of action within the limitations period and plaintiff due diligence until discovery of the facts.dayco goodyear tire rubber,cir.whatever the status of the first two requirements,evans failed to plead that she exercised any due diligence in discovering the facts that she alleged regarding the and transactions.because evans failed to plead fraudulent concealment with particularity,the district court properly dismissed her claims relating to the and transactions.
moreover,even if evans adequately pled fraudulent concealment,she was collaterally estopped from relying on it.the state appellate court decision squarely determined that evans can not rely on fraudulent concealment because she possessed sufficient evidence to place her on notice of the events.see evans,wl,at.both suits involved evans,bank one,and john pearson,and the probate suit progressed to a final,valid judgment that was affirmed on appeal.the limitations issue was actually litigated and necessarily determined.thus,all four collateral estoppel criteria are once again satisfied.
evans claims concern the same events as her claims brought in the probate court.evans argument that the appellate court was considering only whether she had notice of actions that were illegal,but not actions that were fraudulent,or willfully unfair,fails because the nature of the claims and the underlying facts are identical.the relevant distinction between her shareholder and trust claims is not the description of malfeasance but rather the identity of the plaintiff she sues as a shareholder in federal court,while she sued as a beneficiary in state court.ultimately,evans alleged the same facts to support both claims and argues that,contrary to the appellate court conclusion,these facts were concealed.her claims for shareholder oppression,therefore,are barred by the statute of limitations,and the exception for fraudulent concealment is inapplicable.
evans action against the bank one defendants and john pearson concerning the transaction can not succeed because she is collaterally estopped with respect to the facts in her complaint relating to the transaction.the only allegations evans makes regarding the transaction,which she incorporates into the section of her complaint concerning the shareholder action,were that the defendants failed to disclose that the trustee failed to perform due diligence,a conflicting lending relationship existed,and the acquisition was not reasonable.because the michigan court of appeals determined that evans three allegations were meritless,evans is collaterally estopped from asserting the only facts that she alleged to support her shareholder claim of illegality,fraud,or oppressive acts regarding the transaction.
the michigan court of appeals decision that the bank disclosed information,the lending relationship was proper,and the transactions were reasonable collaterally estops evans from alleging the facts upon which she grounds her claim.the state appellate court determined that evans admitted in her depositions during the probate proceedings that she did not read the information sent to her,that she attended biannual shareholder meetings in which few questions were asked,and that bank one had always attempted to answer her questions and complied with her requests for information.from these findings,the appellate court determined that she could not argue that full disclosure in the trust accounts had not been made.see evans,wl,at.the state court then held that the lending relationship in this case was proper.see id.at.finally,that court determined that the loans were proper on two statutorily approved grounds they were both fair and approved by the directors after the disclosure of material facts,see id.at,and that the investment was prudent because it was an attempt to protect or increase ervin market share,see id.at.the resolution of these issues,as discussed earlier in this opinion,is binding on evans the same factual issues disclosure,conflict of interest,and reasonableness are relevant here,the same parties are involved,and the issues,as central to evans claims in probate court,were necessarily resolved after having been actually litigated.because evans is collaterally estopped from arguing the only facts that she alleged regarding the transaction,she has no factual basis on which to state her claim,and the district court properly dismissed evans claim relating to the transaction.
evans fraud claims against all defendants regarding the and transactions are barred by the statute of limitations,and her fraud claim based on the transaction is barred because she insufficiently pled the element of reliance.all parties agree that a limitations period applies to fraud claims pursuant to.evans claims based on the and transactions are barred by this statute,although evans argues that,as with her claims,the defendants fraudulent concealment allows her claims to proceed under for two years after learning facts that put her on notice.but,as with her claims for shareholder oppression,evans can not invoke the fraudulent concealment exception as to her claims concerning the and transactions because she insufficiently pled that she exercised due diligence,as required by.b.
as for evans claim regarding the transaction,evans failed to plead reliance sufficiently and therefore is unable to state a claim for fraud.evans did not allege that she invested money in the transaction,as she had done in the prior transactions.evans unavailingly argues instead that she alleged in paragraph of her complaint that she relied implicitly on the representations and that
