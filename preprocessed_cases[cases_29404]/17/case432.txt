the principal issue in this appeal is whether a local parish or the general church and its diocese own property held in the parish name,after the parish vestry and a majority of the congregants voted to disaffiliate the parish from the general church and affiliate with another church.after the parties completed their briefing,the california supreme court resolved the church property issue against a local parish in a case with facts substantively the same as those here.we are,of course,bound by that precedent.episcopal church cases cal th,d.further,under our opinion in new kroeger th,d kroeger,we reject the assertion the trial court erred by finding that by voting for disaffiliation,the defendants lost the authority to direct the parish corporation,and thus their purported amendments to the parish governing documents were ultra vires.as there are no material facts requiring trial,we affirm summary judgments for the general church and its diocese.
factual and procedural background 
the episcopal church,also known as the protestant episcopal church hereafter episcopal church,a nonprofit unincorporated association,was organized in the united states in.it is a hierarchical church comprised of dioceses.collectively,the dioceses have thousands of individual churches,called parishes and missions which do not meet all qualifications to be parishes,where congregants worship.dioceses are governed by bishops and an annual convention,and parishes are governed by a vestry,consisting of a rector,who is an ordained priest,and a group of elected laypersons.at the national level,the episcopal church is governed by a general convention composed of bishops and deputies,the latter of which include members of parish vestries.the episcopal church constitution and other rules called canons are binding on all episcopal dioceses and parishes,and the dioceses constitutions and canons are binding on all parishes.
the episcopal church entrusts the establishment of parishes to the dioceses.in,luke of the mountains parish of la crescenta luke parish,then an unincorporated episcopal mission,sought permission from the diocese of los angeles to become a parish.in its application,as required by a canon of the los angeles diocese,the representatives of the proposed parish submitted this oath w e hereby solemnly promise and declare that the said parish shall be forever held under the ecclesiastical authority of the bishop of los angeles,and of his successors in office and in conformity with the constitution and canons of the church now known as the protestant episcopal church in the of,and the constitutions and canons of the diocese of los angeles,the authority of which we do hereby recognise sic,and bind ourselves to make part of the constitution of said parish,to whose liturgy,doctrine,discipline rights and usages,we do promise at all times,for ourselves and our successors,corporate obedience and conformity.
on or about january,luke parish was admitted as a parish of the los angeles diocese.in july luke parish filed its original articles of incorporation with the secretary of state,entitled articles of incorporation of the rector,wardens,and vestrymen of luke of the mountains episcopal church in la crescenta,incorporated.the articles stated the purposes for which the said corporation is formed are a to establish and maintain a parish which shall form a constituent part of the diocese of los angeles,b to hold all property of the association owned prior to incorporation,and such as may be acquired hereafter in any manner to transact all business relating thereto,to encumber or alienate property under such conditions and restrictions as may be prescribed by law and by the constitutions and canons of the said church.the articles also stated the constitution and canons,rules,regulations and discipline of the said branch of the episcopal church,and the constitutions and canons of the said church in the diocese of los angeles,for the time being,shall,unless they be contrary to the laws of this state,always form a part of the,ordinances,constitution and articles of incorporation of this corporation.
in,louisa janvier had deeded real property to the bishop of the los angeles diocese.the deed stated provided always and this grant is made upon the express condition that said lot shall be used for church purposes only according to the canons,usages,and doctrines of the protestant episcopal church,and that a church or chapel shall be erected on said property within ten years.a church was constructed on the property,and in august the bishop of the los angeles diocese deeded the property to luke parish for a consideration of.the parish purchased two other parcels in the with parish funds.
a number of canons of the episcopal church pertain to parish property and have historically prohibited a parish from alienating property without obtaining permission from the higher authorities.for instance,canon ii provides.no church or chapel shall be consecrated until the bishop shall have been sufficiently satisfied that the building and the ground on which it is erected are secured for ownership and use by a parish,mission,congregation,or institution affiliated with this church and subject to its constitution and canons.it shall not be lawful for any vestry,trustees,or other body authorized by the law of any state or territory to hold property for any diocese,parish or congregation,to encumber or alienate any dedicated and consecrated church or chapel,or any church or chapel which has been used solely for divine service,belonging to the parish or congregation which they represent,without the previous consent of the bishop,acting with the advice and consent of the standing committee of the diocese.episcopal church cases,supra,cal th at,d.the episcopal church adopted the original version of section of canon ii in,and it added section in.id.at,d.
further,at its annual meeting the episcopal church adopted canon,which expressly confirms that on a parish disaffiliation from the church,parish property belongs to the episcopal church or the diocese.canon provides all real and personal property held by or for the benefit of any parish,mission or congregation is held in trust for this church and the diocese thereof in which such parish,mission or congregation is located.the existence of this trust,however,shall in no way limit the power and authority of the parish,mission or congregation otherwise existing over such property so long as the particular parish,mission or congregation remains a part of,and subject to,this church and its constitution and canons.luke parish was officially represented at the annual meeting by its rector and lay delegates.
before the instant dispute arose,luke parish had last amended its bylaws in.the bylaws acknowledged that the corporation or parish is an integral subordinate unit and constituent part of the p rotestant episcopal church in the diocese of los angeles and of the protestant episcopal church in the united states of america.the constitution and canons of those entities,now or hereafter in effect,are incorporated,by reference,in these bylaws,as a basic and essential part hereof.italics added.
in the episcopal church ordained an openly gay man as a bishop in new hampshire.episcopal church cases,supra,cal th at,d.in november the vestry of luke parish purported to revise the corporation bylaws to eliminate references to the episcopal church.the vestry,however,did not then notify the congregation.in february the vestry and a wide majority of the congregants of luke parish voted to disaffiliate from the episcopal church and join the anglican church of uganda anglican church.shortly thereafter,the vestry caused to be recorded amended articles of incorporation that purported to rename the corporation luke of the mountains anglican church in la crescenta.
the bishop of the los angeles diocese quickly advised luke parish vestry members they were no longer entitled to control parish property or act on behalf of luke episcopal parish.further,under an episcopal church canon,the bishop appointed a of the parish to manage the affairs of the parish and to minister to the parish remaining faithful episcopalian members until a new vestry and rector can be properly elected.the dissident faction,however,refused to surrender the property and continued to use it in their association with the anglican church.the congregants who remained loyal to the episcopal church were no longer allowed to use their own parish as episcopalians.
in april the los angeles diocese,its bishop,the of the parish,and a parish member who remained faithful to the episcopal church,sued the former rector and other former vestry members of luke parish defendants,for declaratory and injunctive relief and breach of contract.the complaint also named the parish corporation as a nominal d efendant because it is currently under the de facto control of individuals who claim authority to divert the property of the parish for their own use.a first amended complaint alleged the parish property was held in trust for the episcopal church and the los angeles diocese,after defendants disaffiliation they and their new parish have no right in the property,and their purported changes to the corporate structure were ultra vires.the episcopal church filed a complaint in intervention.
all parties moved for summary judgment,agreeing the material facts are undisputed.the court granted the episcopal church and the los angeles diocese motions and denied the defendants motion.the judgment provides that a ll real and personal property held by or for the benefit of luke parish on or before february,is held in trust for the episcopal church and the los angeles diocese defendants may not retain possession,ownership,or control of the property defendants actions in attempting to disaffiliate luke episcopal parish from the episcopal church and the diocese were ultra vires the episcopal church hierarchy has resolved the dispute between plaintiffs and defendants by determining a which congregants are the actual members of luke,b the authorized parish leadership to be the duly appointed and the episcopal vestry at such time as it may be reconstituted,and c that the authorized parish leadership has the right to use,manage and control the property in accordance with the episcopal church and diocesan constitutions and canons defendants may not divert,alienate or use the property for any purposes whatsoever and luke episcopal parish shall be exclusively comprised of those individuals recognized by the diocese and the episcopal church.

a party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that he or she is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.a defendant satisfies this burden by showing one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established,or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.ibid.we review the trial court ruling on summary judgment de novo.guz bechtel national,cal th,d.
supreme court precedent episcopal church cases opiniona 
defendants contend the trial court erred by not deciding the church property dispute under the neutral principles of law approach,and instead deferring to the position of the episcopal church and the los angeles diocese under an appellate opinion that applied a principle of government approach to such a dispute,but is no longer good law because the california supreme court accepted the review of the case.defendants assert the rule of deference applies only when a dispute can not be resolved without deciding a religious issue,and this is not such a case.defendants submit that under a neutral principles of law approach,they should prevail,particularly since the parish holds record title to the property rather than the higher church authorities.
the supreme court has now decided the case to which defendants refer,episcopal church cases,but not in a manner helpful to them.to the contrary,the opinion resolves the property dispute here in favor of the episcopal church and the diocese.the court held that a neutral principles of law approach applies to a church property dispute when it can be decided without reference to religious principles,but under such an approach a local parish held property in trust for the national church under facts substantively the same as those here.episcopal church cases,supra,cal th at,d.
the first amendment to the united states constitution,made applicable to the states by the fourteenth amendment cantwell connecticut,provides congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.because of the risks of inhibiting the free development of religion and entangling secular interests in ecclesiastical concerns,the first amendment severely circumscribes the role that civil courts may play in resolving church property disputes.episcopal church cases,supra,cal th at,d,conc.dis.opn.of kennard.
as the united states supreme court explained in jones wolf,d,a state has an obvious and legitimate interest in the peaceful resolution of property disputes,and in providing a civil forum where the ownership of church property can be determined conclusively.however,the first amendment prohibits civil courts from resolving church property disputes on the basis of religious doctrine and practice.citations.as a corollary to this commandment,the amendment requires that civil courts defer to the resolution of issues of religious doctrine or polity by the highest court of a hierarchical church organization.ibid.subject to these limitations,however,the first amendment does not dictate that a state must follow a particular method of resolving church property disputes.indeed,a state may adopt any one of various approaches for settling church property disputes so long as it involves no consideration of doctrinal matters,whether the ritual and liturgy of worship or the tenets of faith.ibid.
in jones wolf,supra,at pages and,the court held a state could constitutionally adopt a neutral principles of law approach to resolving church property disputes.this approach considers the language of the deeds,the terms of the local church charter,the provisions of the general church governing documents pertaining to property ownership,and any relevant state statutes governing the holding of church property.id.at.the primary advantages of the approach are that it is completely secular in operation,and yet flexible enough to accommodate all forms of religious organization and polity.the method relies exclusively on objective,concepts of trust and property law familiar to lawyers and judges.it thereby promises to free civil courts completely from entanglement in questions of religious doctrine,polity,and practice.ibid.
the majority in jones wolf rejected the dissent argument that the first amendment compels use of the approach for hierarchical churches approved in watson jones wall,under which the higher church authorities would necessarily win.episcopal church cases,supra,cal th at,d.the majority in jones wolf wrote the dissent argument assumes that the method would somehow frustrate the rights of the members of a religious association.nothing could be further from the truth.the approach can not be said to inhibit the free exercise of religion,any more than do other neutral provisions of state law governing the manner in which churches own property,hire employees,or purchase goods.under the approach,the outcome of a church property dispute is not foreordained.at any time before the dispute erupts,the parties can ensure,if they so desire,that the faction loyal to the hierarchical church will retain the church property.they can modify the deeds or the corporate charter to include a right of reversion or trust in favor of the general church.alternatively,the constitution of the general church can be made to recite an express trust in favor of the denominational church.the burden involved in taking such steps will be minimal.and the civil courts will be bound to give effect to the result indicated by the parties,provided it is embodied in some legally cognizable form.jones wolf,supra,at,italics added.
episcopal church cases,supra,cal th,d,involved the james parish in newport beach james parish,a former parish of the los angeles diocese,which also disaffiliated itself from the episcopal church after it ordained a gay bishop.a disagreement arose as to parish property.the los angeles diocese and various individuals sued persons affiliated with james parish,and the episcopal church intervened.id.at,d.
after discussing jones wolf at length,the court in episcopal church cases held s ecular courts called on to resolve church property disputes should proceed as follows state courts must not decide questions of religious doctrine those are for the church to resolve.accordingly,if resolution of a property dispute involves a point of doctrine,the court must defer to the position of the highest ecclesiastical authority that has decided the point.but to the extent the court can resolve a property dispute without reference to church doctrine,it should apply neutral principles of law.the court should consider sources such as the deeds to the property in dispute,the local church articles of incorporation,the general church constitution,cannons,and rules,and relevant statutes,including statutes specifically concerning religious property,such as corporations code section.episcopal church cases,supra,cal th at,d.
on the merits,the court found in favor of the episcopal church.the court noted that shortly after the jones wolf decision,and in apparent reaction to it,the episcopal church added canon,which recites an express trust in favor of the denominational church.this occurred some years before the instant dispute erupted.episcopal church cases,supra cal th at,d.canon states that the trust does not limit the authority of the parish over the property so long as the particular parish remains a part of,and subject to,this church and its constitution and canons.other canons adopted long before james parish existed also contained substantial restrictions on the local use of church property.episcopal church cases,supra,at,d.the court concluded that jones wolf together with the episcopal church adoption of canon in response,strongly supports the conclusion that,once defendants left the general church,the property reverted to the general church.episcopal church cases,supra,at,d.
additionally,the court explained that section,subdivisions c and d,enacted in shortly after jones wolf was published,compels the conclusion that once defendants voted to disaffiliate,the parish property reverted to the episcopal church.episcopal church cases,supra,cal th at,d.as relevant,the statute provides c no assets of a religious corporation are or shall be deemed to be impressed with any trust,express or implied,statutory or at common law unless one of the following applies unless,and only to the extent that,the articles or bylaws of the corporation,or the governing instruments of a superior religious body or general church of which the corporation is a member,so expressly provide.d trusts created by paragraph of subdivision c may be amended or dissolved by amendment from time to time to the articles,bylaws,or governing instruments creating the trusts,italics added.
the court elaborated that the statute appears to be the type of statute the united states supreme court envisioned in maryland virginia eldership of churches of god church of god at sharpsburg,d church of god,in approving a court reliance on provisions of state statutory law governing the holding of property by religious corporations episcopal church cases,supra,cal th at,d.in church of god,justice brennan added in his concurring opinion that a possible approach to resolving church property disputes is the passage of special statutes governing church property arrangements in a manner that precludes state interference in doctrine.such statutes must be carefully drawn to leave control of ecclesiastical policy,as well as doctrine,to church governing bodies.episcopal church cases,supra,at,d,quoting church of god,supra,at.at conc.opn.of brennan.in episcopal church cases,supra,at pages,d,the court explained s ection,subdivisions c and d,does not permit state interference in religious doctrine and leaves control of ecclesiastical policy and doctrine to the church.subdivision c of that section permits the governing instruments of the general church to create an express trust in church property,which canon does.subdivision d permits changing a trust,but only if done in the instrument that created it.canon has not been amended.
in episcopal church cases,the court noted that although james parish held record title to the property,the parish agreed from the beginning of its existence to be part of a greater denominational church and to be bound by that greater church governing instruments,and held t hose instruments make clear that a local parish owns local church property in trust for the greater church and may use that property only so long as the local church remains part of the greater church.respect for the first amendment free exercise rights of persons to enter into a religious association of their choice,as delineated in jones wolf,supra,d as well as the provisions of section,requires civil courts to give effect to the provisions and agreements of that religious association.episcopal church cases,supra,cal th at,d.
here,neither the episcopal church nor the los angeles diocese held record title to the property at issue.as the parish in episcopal church cases,however,luke parish agreed from the time it became a parish to be an integral part of the episcopal church and the los angeles diocese and to be bound by their governing documents.luke parish was admitted as a parish after submitting an oath of obedience,and its articles of incorporation and bylaws promised allegiance to the national church and the diocese.further,the bylaws do not allow amendment of the allegiance provision without permission from the higher authorities.
contrary to defendants position now,their agreement to be bound by the governing documents of the episcopal church extends to canon.as the court concluded in episcopal church cases,i t is a bit late to argue that canon was not effectively adopted,a quarter of a century later,and,in light of the consistent conclusions of cases that that canon is,indeed,part of the episcopal church governing documents,the argument seems dubious at best.but,in any event,this is one of those questions regarding religious doctrine or polity citation on which we must defer to the greater church resolution.citation.over the years,the episcopal church has consistently taken the position that canon was effectively adopted.episcopal church cases,supra,cal th at,d.luke parish representatives were present when the national church adopted canon.moreover,in,luke amended its bylaws to confirm that it was an integral part of the episcopal church and the los angeles diocese and their governing documents now or hereafter in effect,are incorporated,by reference,in these bylaws,as a basic and essential part hereof.italics added.the amendment expressly embraces canon.
to any extent the court here applied a standard deferential to the episcopal church rather than a neutral principles of law approach,there was no prejudicial error because application of the latter approach would not give defendants a more favorable result.in re ponce de leon th,d.under the holding of episcopal church cases,luke parish holds the property in question in trust for the episcopal church and the los angeles diocese,and by disaffiliating from the church defendants and their new parish under another church have no right in the property.the individual defendants were free to disaffiliate from the national church and the diocese,but the problem lies in defendants efforts to take the church property with them.this they may not do.episcopal church cases,supra,cal th at,d,quoting protestant episc.church diocese of graves,see also guardian angel polish nat.catholic church of,grotnik th,d korean united presbyterian church presbytery of the pacific d.korean united,overruled on an unrelated issue in morehart county of santa barbara cal th,fn,d.
collateral estoppel 
defendants also contend the trial court erred by rejecting their argument the episcopal church and the los angeles diocese are collaterally estopped from claiming entitlement to the parish property since it litigated a similar issue in an earlier case and lost.collateral estoppel,one of two aspects of the res judicata doctrine,precludes the relitigation of an identical issue necessarily decided in previous litigation.vandenberg superior court cal th,d.the collateral estoppel doctrine may allow one who was not a party to prior litigation to take advantage,in a later unrelated matter,of findings made against his current adversary in the earlier proceeding.id.at,d.
defendants rely on protestant episcopal church barker d.barker.in barker,the court applied a neutral principles of law approach,and held that three local churches did not hold property in trust for the episcopal church.the court noted the local churches held record title to the properties and paid for them out of their own funds,their articles of incorporation did not expressly alienate the properties,and they did not subject themselves to express restraints on their property by reason of the constitution,canons,and rules of the episcopal church and the los angeles diocese.id.at.
as the court explained in episcopal church cases,supra,cal th,d,however,barker is distinguishable largely due to the passage of time.in that case,the dispute arose and indeed,the trial court judgment was entered before the decision in jones wolf,supra,the episcopal church adopted canon,and the legislature enacted section,subdivisions c and d.the appellate court in barker did not mention any of the general church canons.accordingly,that decision does not control a dispute that,here,arose years after the high court decision and the adoption of canon.episcopal church cases,supra,at,d.further,we now have supreme court precedent on the matter.collateral estoppel does not apply where there are changed conditions or new facts which did not exist at the time of the prior judgment,or where the previous decision was based on different substantive law.united states golf arroyo software th,d.
control of luke parish corporation 
defendants concede the episcopal church and the los angeles diocese certainly may make a pronouncement that some group of individuals is the true luke episcopal parish,and they are free to decree that whomever they wish is the authorized episcopal parish in la crescenta.indeed,i t has long been the law in california that the identification of a religious body as the true church is an ecclesiastical issue.korean united,supra,d at.california decisions on the point are consistent with the constitutional mandate of the united states supreme court that civil courts may not overrule actions of authorities of hierarchical denominations with respect to matters of church polity.id.at.
defendants,however,contend the court erred by determining their actions in purporting to amend the corporation articles of incorporation and bylaws to disaffiliate luke parish from the episcopal church and the los angeles diocese were ultra vires.defendants complain that the ruling vaporiz ed the corporation board of directors and the rights of its more than voting members.defendants claim the corporation has an independent existence from the national church and the diocese,and after the disaffiliation they lack standing to raise any issues pertaining to the corporation 
we have,however,already decided the corporate control issue in favor of the national church in similar circumstances.kroeger,supra,th,d.kroeger arose from a dispute over the governance of john parish,which was a member of the episcopal church.as here,the members of john parish clergy,members of the governing board and a majority of parish members collectively the defendants resigned their membership in the episcopal church and voted to become affiliated with a anglican church in africa.the bishop of the diocese of san diego determined the remaining loyalist members of john parish collectively the individual plaintiffs constituted the true membership of the parish,the resigned dissident members were no longer qualified to serve as members of the governing board,and a new governing board should be elected.the individual plaintiffs elected a new board,but the resigned members of the board refused to relinquish their seats or control over the assets of john parish,which were held by a corporation known as john parish corporation parish corporation.id.at,d.
the individual plaintiffs and the san diego diocese filed a lawsuit under california corporations law,seeking a declaration they were the true and lawful directors of john parish.the trial court found for the defendants,but we reversed the judgment.we held that applying neutral principles of law,defendants lacked the power and authority to amend the bylaws and articles of incorporation of the parish corporation to make it part of the anglican church in africa,and their actions in this regard are a legal nullity by taking the actions they did,defendants were no longer a part of the episcopal church and could not be the lawful directors we must give deference to the episcopal church and san diego diocese determination as to who constituted the true members of john parish,and consequently the election of the individual defendants as board members of the parish corporation was a legal nullity and applying neutral principles of law to the actions of the episcopal church and san diego diocese in determining who were the true members of the church,the result is the same.kroeger,supra,th at,d.
in kroeger,we explained the trial court fundamental mistake in deciding this matter under the neutral principles of law approach is that it believed that under this approach it was restrained to rely solely on california corporations law in a vacuum,without reference to the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the parish corporation,as well as the constitution and canons of the episcopal church and the san diego diocese,and it fail ed to recognize that religious corporations are,in their basic sense,different from ordinary corporations.kroeger,supra,th at,d.we pointed out that the canons of the episcopal church mandate that the vestry members well and faithfully perform the duties of that office in accordance with the constitution and the canons of the episcopal church and of the diocese in which the office is being exercised.further,the diocesan canons require vestry members to be qualified electors of the episcopal church.in order to serve as a warden of a vestry one of a vestry lay officers,one must be a communicant in good standing.finally,the diocesan canons provide that parishes must follow specific procedures for dissolution,which include consent of the bishop.in the event of such change,title to parish assets reverts to the diocese thus,when defendants resigned from the episcopal church,they were no longer empowered to act,and their actions in attempting to amend the bylaws and articles of incorporation were a nullity.they also ceased being directors of the parish corporation as they were not members in good standing of the episcopal church.id.at,d.
further,the bylaws of the parish corporation state that the constitution and canons of the episcopal church shall always form part of the,ordinances,constitutions,and discipline of the parish and prevail against any resolutions,or other enactment by this parish that may appear to be repugnant to such constitutions,canons,rules,regulations,or discipline.the articles of incorporation similarly state that the parish church shall continue perpetually to be,a constituent unit or part of the episcopal church,pursuant to and in accordance with the constitutions and canons,rules,regulations,and discipline of said church kroeger,supra,th at,d.we concluded the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the parish corporation dictate that defendants,once they resigned their membership in the episcopal church,were no longer members in good standing,had no power to amend the bylaws or articles of incorporation of the corporation,and,most important for this case,were no longer directors of the corporation.id.at,d.
in korean united,supra,d,the court also decide
