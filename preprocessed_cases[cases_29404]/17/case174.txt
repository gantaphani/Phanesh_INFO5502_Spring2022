torch liquidating trust,through its trustee bridge associates,brings this suit alleging breach of fiduciary duties by the officers and directors of torch offshore,torch offshore,and torch express.the district court dismissed plaintiff amended complaint under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure on the ground that the amended complaint allegations of injury to the creditors of torch offshore,torch offshore,and torch express,failed to state a claim on behalf of torch liquidating trust and on the ground that delaware business judgment rule applied to preclude liability of the officers and directors.we affirm because the amended complaint fails to allege injury to torch offshore,torch offshore,and torch express,and thus fails to state a claim on behalf of the torch liquidating trust.
factual and procedural background 
factual background 
torch offshore,torch offshore,and torch express,collectively,torch or debtor operated a fleet of specialized vessels used in offshore underwater construction and in laying submerged oil and gas pipelines.although torch historically operated on the gulf of mexico outer continental shelf,a slump in offshore oil and gas facility development led torch to undertake operations in.for this new business model,torch raised capital by completing an initial public offering and borrowing additional sums of money from creditors to upgrade its fleet with new or overhauled the midnight rider,midnight express,and midnight wrangler.
starting in,torch business deteriorated.by the end of,it may have been insolvent,although it continued to incur trade debt.by december,its loans were in default,leading the company to stop paying its vendors.on january,it filed a voluntary petition for relief under c chapter of the bankruptcy code in the eastern district of louisiana.the bankruptcy court confirmed torch proposed first amended joint chapter plan of reorganization the plan on april.pursuant to the plan,debtor executed an agreement creating the torch liquidating trust the trust.the trust was comprised of all property of the debtors estates which has not previously been transferred.the confirmation order and trust agreement appointed bridge associates bridge associates as the trust administrator and trustee.the plan,confirmation order,and trust agreement preserved and transferred,inter alia,certain claims against torch directors and officers claims to the trust,authorized bridge associates to retain and prosecute those claims,and empowered it to distribute to creditors any recovery of claims proceeds the plan defined claims as any claims arising prior to january,the date torch filed its chapter petition and recoveries against the debtors directors,officers,and other principals which are related to the debtors insurance.the parties do not dispute that the breach of fiduciary duty claims at issue on appeal are claims.
procedural background 
on january,bridge associates filed a complaint on behalf of the trust against torch former directors and officers the directors the complaint alleged that the directors breached fiduciary duties owed to torch creditors when torch entered the zone of insolvency and after it became insolvent.defendants moved to dismiss the complaint or for a more definite statement.they sought the latter in part because the complaint appeared to allege fraud,which under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure requires plaintiff to state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud.after bridge associates clarified that it was not alleging fraud but instead only breach of fiduciary duties the court denied defendants motion.
in the intervening period,the delaware supreme court issued its opinion in north american catholic educational programming foundation,gheewalla.in gheewalla,the court held that the creditors of a delaware corporation that is either insolvent or in the zone of insolvency have no right,as a matter of law,to assert direct claims for breach of fiduciary duty against the corporation directors.id.at emphasis added.the court reasoned that the general rule is that directors do not owe creditors duties beyond the relevant contractual terms.at quotation marks and footnotes omitted.gheewalla,thereby,rendered meritless plaintiff claim that the directors breached fiduciary duties owed to torch creditors.nonetheless,the creditors of an insolvent corporation have standing to maintain derivative claims against directors on behalf of the corporation for breaches of fiduciary duties.id.at second emphasis added 
in the aftermath of gheewalla,plaintiff moved for leave to amend its complaint defendants opposed the motion on the grounds of futility and undue delay.the district court granted the motion to amend,and plaintiff then filed its amended complaint.in the amended complaint,plaintiff replaced nearly all of its prior references to creditors with new references to creditors and shareholders and sought damages on behalf of creditors and shareholders.see,am.compl.t he torch creditors and shareholders have suffered damage in the amount of not less than,and in an amount to be proven at trial,and plaintiff is entitled to recover such damages from the defendants herein on behalf of the torch creditors and shareholders.it also alleged that t his matter is in the nature of a derivative suit in that plaintiff sues on behalf of the shareholders and creditors alike of torch.id.at d.as such,any recovery was to become property of the trust for distribution according to the plan.see id.at d all net recoveries,if any,shall go to the trust for distribution in accordance with the plan,all as ordered by the court.
substantively,plaintiff alleged that the directors inflat ed the estimated fair market value of the torch fleet in order to portray in published financial statements that it was solvent,id.at see also id.at deferr ed paying unsecured creditors to the maximum extent possible while at the same time entering into an intensive campaign to mislead torch unsecured creditors as to its true financial condition and cajole torch unsecured creditors into continuing to supply goods and services to torch on credit,id.at delayed for as long as possible admitting that torch would be unable to fund its ongoing operations without new capital,id.at postponed admitting that the delayed delivery of the midnight express would probably destroy the company,id.at and orchestrated a public relations campaign to obscure and minimize the market impact of the financial data torch was compelled to release in public reporting,id.at.the directors public relations campaign allegedly included interviews and articles that misrepresented torch financial condition and the progress on midnight express in order to mislead torch creditors and shareholders and to permit torch to continue to purchase essential supplies and services on credit.id.at.
the directors filed a motion to dismiss under rule b,asserting that bridge associates lacked standing to bring the suit,that delaware business judgment rule applied to preclude the directors liability,and that exculpatory provisions in torch certificate of incorporation shielded the directors from liability for certain alleged breaches of their fiduciary duties.
the district court granted the motion,holding that plaintiff lacked standing to assert many of its claims,which the district court interpreted as continuing to allege direct creditor claims barred by gheewalla,and,to the extent any of the claims were properly derivative,that delaware business judgment rule defeated those claims.the district court concluded that plaintiff failed to state a claim that it had standing to bring because the amended complaint does not allege that the creditors are bringing the derivative action on behalf of the corporation,but rather states that the trust is entitled to recover damages from the defendants herein on behalf of the torch creditors and shareholders.torch liquidating trust ex rel.bridge,stockstill,wl,at.the court determined that t he gheewalla court was specific in its findings that such direct claims as these by creditors are not actionable,id.at,and held that 
plaintiff arguments and its amended complaint blur the distinction made by the gheewalla court between creditors and shareholders.the creditors,and therefore the trust on its behalf,do have standing to assert any derivative claim on behalf of the corporation.however,neither the creditors nor the trust have standing to assert the claims raised in the amended complaint that allege direct breach of fiduciary duty claims by the directors owed to the creditors.such direct claims do not exist under the current state of delaware law.
accordingly,the court finds that the amended complaint fails to state a cause of action by the creditors for breaches of fiduciary duties during torch zone of insolvency or when torch was in fact insolvent and,therefore,the trust can not raise such claims against the directors on behalf of the creditors.
id.at footnotes omitted.
the district court simultaneously concluded that both shareholders and creditors claims were subject to dismissal under delaware business judgment rule.id.at.plaintiff raised numerous points in opposition to the applicability of the business judgment rule,including that court review would be inappropriate in a motion to dismiss,defendants fail to demonstrate the requisite board action,the rule does not protect the directors from their intentional misrepresentations,a different standard applies when a fiduciary duty is owed to the creditor during insolvency or in the zone of insolvency,and the rule is inapplicable to situations evidencing bad faith or.the district court rejected each of these arguments.id.at.thus,the court held that the creditors did not have a direct cause of action for breach of fiduciary duties against the directors,alleged an improper derivative suit on behalf of the creditors,and did not state a claim that falls outside of the business judgment rule.id.at.consequentially,it granted the motion,dismissed the suit with prejudice,and entered a final judgment for the directors.
bridge associates timely filed a notice of appeal.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
ii.discussion 
we review de novo the district court order granting a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under rule b.see vanderbrook unitrin preferred ins.in re katrina canal breaches litig,cir.we may affirm dismissal on any basis supported by the rule b record.see invs.ldc phillips,cir.when considering a rule b motion,we accept all facts of the complaint as true,viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.in re katrina canal breaches,at quotation marks and citation omitted.the plaintiff must plead enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.bell atl.twombly,d.that is,f actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level,on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true even if doubtful in fact.id.at quotation marks,citations,and footnote omitted.to raise a right to relief,the complaint must contain either direct allegations or permit properly drawn inferences to support every material point necessary to sustain a recovery thus,d ismissal is proper if the complaint lacks an allegation regarding a required element necessary to obtain relief.campbell city of san antonio,cir quotation marks and citations omitted.
in this case,the parties contest bridge associates standing to bring a derivative suit on behalf of creditors or shareholders.in so doing,they misconstrue the nature of bridge associates standing to assert the claims.as the trustee,bridge associates may bring claims that were part of debtor estate on behalf of the trust it need not allege a derivative suit based on either shareholder or creditor derivative standing.although plaintiff has standing,it fails to state a claim for which the court may grant relief.it argues that it is attempting to assert a breach of fiduciary duties owed to torch but fails to allege necessary elements of such a,but not limited to,injury to torch.as the district court recognized,when plaintiff amended its complaint,it failed to allege a claim on behalf of torch and continued to maintain what appear to be impermissible direct claims on behalf of creditors,now clothed in the unnecessary pleadings of a derivative action ostensibly,but never expressly,on behalf of torch.the district court therefore did not abuse its discretion in denying plaintiff an opportunity to amend.
the trust,through its trustee bridge associates,attempts to the form of a shareholder and creditor derivative the directors breached their fiduciary duties.this pleading posture distracts from bridge associates standing as trustee to bring a direct suit on the trust behalf for torch claims against the directors.
under delaware law a claim alleging the directors or officers breach of fiduciary duties owed to a corporation may be brought by the corporation or through a shareholder derivative suit when the corporation is solvent or a creditor derivative suit when the corporation is insolvent.see gheewalla,at.a derivative suit enables a stockholder to bring suit on behalf of the corporation for harm done to the corporation.tooley donaldson,lufkin jenrette.the derivative action developed in equity to enable shareholders to sue in the corporation name where those in control of the company refused to assert a claim belonging to it.aronson lewis,partially overruled on other grounds by brehm eisner.the nature of the action is.first,it is the equivalent of a suit by the shareholders to compel the corporation to sue.second,it is a suit by the corporation,asserted by the shareholders on its behalf,against those liable to it.aronson,at.shareholders have standing to enforce claims on behalf of a solvent corporation through a derivative suit because they are the ultimate beneficiaries of the corporation growth and increased value.gheewalla,at.if a corporation becomes insolvent,however,its creditors become the appropriate parties to bring a derivative suit on behalf of the corporation where those in control of it refuse to assert a viable claim belonging to it because the creditors are the beneficiaries of any increase in value.see id.when a corporation is insolvent,however,its creditors take the place of the shareholders as the residual beneficiaries of any increase in value consequently,the creditors of an insolvent corporation have standing to maintain derivative claims against directors on behalf of the corporation for breaches of fiduciary duties.whether brought by shareholders or creditors,a derivative suit is being brought on behalf of the corporation,so the recovery,if any,must go to the corporation.tooley,at.
having reviewed delaware law on derivative suits,we now turn to consider the impact of a chapter filing and plan confirmation on the standing of various parties to bring a suit on behalf of the debtor corporation and its bankruptcy estate.the filing of a chapter petition creates an estate comprised of all the debtor property,including all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.a.we interpret all legal or equitable interests broadly the estate includes causes of action belonging to the debtor.see acquisition,eastway delivery,in re acquisition,cir am.bank mortgageamerica in re mortgageamerica,cir.by definition then,a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty owed to the corporation that is property of the corporation at commencement of the chapter case becomes property of the debtor estate,regardless of whether outside of bankruptcy the case was more likely to be brought by the corporation directly or by a shareholder or creditor through a derivative suit.see meyer fleming.the claim sought to be enforced in a derivative suit may be an important asset of the estate.world exposition fed.ins,cir holding that a corporation cause of action against its officers and directors is property of the estate mixon anderson in re ozark rest.equip,cir concluding that breach of fiduciary duty is an example of a cause of action belonging to the debtor at the commencement of the case that is included within the definition of property of the estate delgado oil torres,cir plaintiff suit is akin to a shareholder derivative action which,upon the filing of a petition in bankruptcy,is property of the estate.mitchell excavators,mitchell,cir holding that the right to prosecute an action against a corporation officers and directors pass es to the estate created by the commencement of the bankruptcy proceeding 
a chapter plan of reorganization or liquidation then settles the estate causes of action or retains those causes of action for enforcement by the debtor,the trustee,or a representative of the estate appointed for the purpose of enforcing the retained claims.see b a plan may provide for a the settlement or adjustment of any claim or interest belonging to the debtor or to the estate or b the retention and enforcement by the debtor,by the trustee,or by a representative of the estate appointed for such purpose,of any such claim or interest.to achieve the plan goals,the retained assets of the estate may be transferred to a liquidating trust.see a b a plan shall provide adequate means for the plan implementation,such as transfer of all or any part of the property of the estate to one or more entities,whether organized before or after the confirmation of such plan.section therefore allows a plan to transfer to a trustee of a liquidating trust the authority to enforce an estate claims for breach of fiduciary duties owed to the corporation and to distribute the proceeds of successful suits.see mcfarland leyh in re.petroleum,cir section b b allows a plan to transfer avoidance powers to a party other than the debtor or the trustee.collier,collier on bankruptcy a ed.section b b permits the plan to provide for the retention and enforcement of causes of action that are not settled under the plan,by the debtor,the trustee or a representative of the estate appointed for the purpose of pursuing and enforcing such claims.to show standing based on the plan effectuation of such a transfer,the trustee must show that it has been appointed,and that it is a representative of the estate.in re.petroleum,at citing,retail marketing king in re mako,cir.the bankruptcy court approval of a plan that clearly appoints an independent trustee to administer the liquidating trust satisfies the first element.id.although the courts apply a approach to determine the second element,it is generally satisfied if a successful recovery by the trustee would benefit the debtor unsecured creditors.id.
in this case,bridge associates has standing to bring a suit on behalf of the trust for the amended complaint allegations that the directors breached the fiduciary duties that they owed to torch.when torch filed its chapter petition,all claims owned by it,including claims against the directors for breach of fiduciary duties,became part of the estate.in turn,the plan,as confirmed by the bankruptcy court,transferred all of the debtor estate remaining assets to the trust.as part of that transfer,the plan and the court order expressly preserved and transferred all claims.to administer the estate and the trust,the plan provided for the appointment of a plan administrator and trustee,which was granted the rights and powers of a under section of the bankruptcy code,including the duty to prosecute any claims and distribute the proceeds of such claims,and other rights and powers set forth in the liquidating trust agreement.the court confirmation order and the trust agreement named bridge associates as the administrator and trustee of the trust.under the plan,the court confirmation order,and the trust agreement,bridge associates was to distribute proceeds of the trust assets according to the plan,which allocated the proceeds of claims to debtor unsecured creditors by pro rata share.pursuant to section,therefore,bridge associates has standing to bring claims on behalf of the trust for injuries to torch 
even excusing the amended complaint confusing construction of plaintiff standing,however,dismissal pursuant to rule b was still appropriate because plaintiff fails to allege a cause of action on behalf of torch for breach of the directors fiduciary duties.under delaware law,d irectors owe their fiduciary obligations to the corporation and its shareholders.gheewalla,at citing malone brincat,guth loft.when the directors are not seeking shareholder action,but are deliberately misinforming shareholders about the business of the corporation,either directly or by a public statement,there is a violation of fiduciary duty.malone,at the amended complaint alleges this type of breach.the elements of a claim for misrepresentation of a corporation financial condition where no shareholder action is requested are deliberate misinformation either directly or through public statement reliance causation and actual,quantifiable damages.see id.at,comparing an action for breach of fiduciary duty w hen the directors are not seeking shareholder action,but are deliberately misinforming shareholders about the business of the corporation with a n action for a breach of fiduciary duty arising out of disclosure violations in connection with a request for stockholder action,which does not include the elements of reliance,causation and actual quantifiable monetary damages emphasis added metro commc advanced mobilecomm techs,in the malone context,a plaintiff had to prove that the directors knowingly disseminate d false information.this level of proof is similar to,but even more stringent than,the level of scienter required for common law fraud.alternation in original demarco,ocean spray cranberries,no.civ,wl,at,when shareholder action is absent,plaintiff must show reliance,causation,and damages.transworld healthcare,holding that,for a disclosure claim arising out of a communication that does not contemplate stockholder action and which implicates the broader duties of loyalty,good faith and care,the plaintiff must plead causation and identify actual quantifiable damages.while we have some difficulty conceptualizing such a claim on behalf of a corporation any such claim necessarily requires the pleading of damages and causation.
the amended complaint fails to meet this burden.it alleges no actual,quantifiable damages suffered by torch.it alleges only that the creditors and shareholders were misled and harmed.see am.compl.alleging that the directors breach damaged the creditors and shareholders id.at alleging that the directors breach aimed to cajole torch unsecured creditors into continuing to supply goods and services to torch on credit and the shareholders to hold their stock interests id.at the damages suffered by the torch creditors and shareholders as alleged herein are covered by the insurers id.at t he torch creditors and shareholders have suffered damage in the amount of not less than,and in an amount to be proven at trial,and plaintiff is entitled to recover such damages from the defendants herein on behalf of the torch creditors and shareholders.when asked during oral argument to identify any specific pleading permitting an inference of injury to torch,plaintiff could identify none.we conclude that the amended complaint thus fails to state a claim for breach of the fiduciary duties that the directors owed to torch.reaching this conclusion,we refrain from wading into the parties contentions regarding the district court other bases for dismissal.
remand to amend 
plaintiff asks us to remand to allow it to amend its amended complaint to allege injury to torch.typically,we review the district court decision not to grant leave to amend for abuse of discretion.ellis liberty life assurance,cir.yet,at no point did plaintiff move the district court for leave to amend its amended complaint to allege a claim showing injury to torch even assuming that plaintiff has properly raised and preserved the issue,we conclude that it is not entitled to relief.
rule of the federal rules of civil procedure states that a court should freely give leave to amend when justice so requires.although rule evinces a bias in favor of granting leave to amend,it is not automatic.southmark schulte roth zabel in re southmark,cir quotation marks and citation omitted.under rule,the courts consider such equitable factors as undue delay bad faith dilatory motive on the part of the movant repeated failure to cure deficiencies by any previously allowed amendment undue prejudice to the opposing party and futility of amendment.ellis,at.
we conclude that justice does not require allowing plaintiff additional opportunity to amend.plaintiff had ample opportunity to cure the noted defects when it amended its complaint in the aftermath of gheewalla and in its arguments to the district court.see germain howard,wl,at cir affirming denial of a motion for leave to amend where a ppellants had several opportunities to state their best case citing price pinnacle brands,cir affirming denial of a motion for leave to amend where the plaintiffs,represented by counsel,had three opportunities to articulate their damage theory.over defendants opposition,the district court granted plaintiff prior motion to amend its complaint.in its amended complaint,plaintiff still fails to allege injury to torch,even though it expressly converted the direct claims of the creditors to derivative claims which,it bears repeating,could only have been on behalf of torch.
the way in which plaintiff amended its original complaint also lends support to our conclusion.plaintiff substituted creditors with creditors and shareholders,labeled its previously direct claim derivative,and asserted the same substantive facts without determining whether those facts supported a claim on behalf of torch.this pleading practice demonstrated a complete disregard for its burden to allege facts that state a claim under existing law.nor is it an appropriate answer for plaintiff to suggest that gheewalla changed the applicable law.even before gheewalla,the delaware supreme court in malone identified the necessary elements to state a claim for deliberate misinformation when the directors are not seeking shareholder action.that plaintiff was responding in one way to new delaware case law does not forgive its burden to research and plead the necessary elements of the claim it attempts to bring in its amended complaint.
to cure the present deficiency,plaintiff informed the court during oral argument that it could easily amend paragraph of the complaint to delete the reference to creditors and shareholders to say torch has suffered damages in the amount of not less than find and replace exercise.in light of its prior substitution of creditors and shareholders for creditors,we are not inclined to oblige a simple substitution now without better explanation regarding how the amendment would allow the complaint to sustain plaintiff burden of alleging a complete,properly pleaded,and plausible claim.lacking a viable theory to support its claim of injury plaintiff asserts that discovery would entail finding out what would have happened had the directors made their disclosures earlier.this sounds like a request to discover a claim.the role of discovery,however,is to find support for properly pleaded claims,not to find the claims themselves.brown texas a m,cir refusing to allow the plaintiffs to continue to amend or supplement their pleadings until they stumble upon a formula that carries them over the threshold of an immunity defense quoting jacquez procunier,cir.by our view,plaintiff is not attempting to recover for injury to torch but instead attempting yet again to repackage creditor claims against the directors that are defunct under delaware law after gheewalla.under these circumstances,we are not inclined to allow plaintiff to continue.
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the decision of the district court.costs shall be borne by plaintiff.
the plan granted bridge associates the right,power,and duty to,inter alia,prosecute any claims and distribute the proceeds of such claims.first amended joint chapter plan of reorganization for torch offshore,torch offshore,and torch express,at,in re torch offshore.it also stated that debtors hereby preserve any and all causes of action they may have including claims.upon the effective date,all claims shall,pursuant to i bankruptcy code section b b,ii this plan and iii the confirmation order,be retained by the plan administrator and trustee as the duly appointed representative of the estates.subject to the provisions of this plan,the plan administrator and trustee may prosecute,settle,or dismiss any and all causes of action as the plan administrator and trustee sees fit without bankruptcy court.at.the bankruptcy court confirmation order reiterated substantially the same content.see in re torch offshore,slip op.at,order confirming the plan.the trust agreement likewise authorized trustee action the plan administrator and trustee shall be empowered to and may,sic take all appropriate action with respect to the liquidating trust assets consistent with the purpose of the liquidating trust,including,without limitation,the filing,prosecution including objections,estimation,settlement or other resolution of claims and oversee the management of any liquidating trust assets.the plan administrator and trustee is expressly authorized to settle and compromise the claims without further bankruptcy court approval liquidating trust agreement at,in re torch offshore.may.
the directors include lyle stockstill,lana hingle stockstill,andrew michel,jere shopf,ken wallace,curtis lemons,and robert fulton.other defendants were xl specialty insurance company and greenwich insurance company.
bridge associates specifically argued that its complaint did not allege intent or actual motive to deceive.
the court reasoned that it is well settled that directors owe fiduciary duties to the corporation.when a corporation is solvent,those duties may be enforced by its shareholders,who have standing to bring derivative actions on behalf of the corporation because they are the ultimate beneficiaries of the corporation growth and increased value.when a corporation is insolvent,however,its creditors take the place of the shareholders as the residual beneficiaries of any increase in,the creditors of an insolvent corporation have standing to maintain derivative claims against directors on behalf of the corporation for breaches of fiduciary.at quotation marks and footnotes omitted.
in an attempt to comply with rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,plaintiff alleged that it was neither a shareholder or nor sic a creditor of torch at the time the transactions complained of occurred but represents the interests of the shareholders and creditors of torch that w ritten demand was made upon the directors of torch by counsel for the official committee of unsecured creditors of torch and that p laintiff has not made demand upon the directors nor shareholders of torch to undertake the prosecution of this action because i the plan and the confirmation order have vested the right to bring the action in the plaintiff ii there are no directors of torch iii the shareholders can take no action to force the directors to sue,there being no directors and iv plaintiff is the only legal person who can bring this action.see am.compl.b,c see also.
the amended complaint also dropped greenwich insurance company as a defendant.
the parties apply delaware substantive law to this case.we agree that delaware law controls.in a diversity action,a federal court must apply the choice of law rules of the state in which the district court where the complaint was filed sits.see klaxon stentor.this case was filed in the eastern district of louisiana,so louisiana choice of law rules apply.under louisiana law,the law of the place where the corporation was incorporated governs disputes regarding the relationship between the officers,directors,and shareholders and the officers and directors fiduciary duties.see patin thoroughbred power boats,cir lone star,redwine,cir mansfield hardwood lumber johnson,cir.because torch was incorporated in delaware,delaware substantive law applies.
notably,the fiduciaries never owe duties to the creditors recognizing that directors of an insolvent corporation owe direct fiduciary duties to creditors would create uncertainty for directors who have a fiduciary duty to exercise their business judgment in the best interest of the insolvent corporation.to recognize a new right
