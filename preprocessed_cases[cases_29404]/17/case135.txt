opinion of the court 
this case is part of the massive litigation.the on this appeal is whether the district court erred by refusing to allow the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint with additional materials they had proffered to the court to show that amendment would not be futile 
this is a shareholder suit,so in the typical situation the plaintiffs would have been required to first make demand upon merck board of directors.however,the plaintiffs pled demand futility.the district court dismissed the suit because the plaintiffs did not meet the narrow exception where demand may be excused.specifically,the plaintiffs did not plead with particularity facts establishing that demand would have been futile at the time they commenced the lawsuit.the district court concluded that the plaintiffs allegations of demand futility were patently conclusory.in re merck,wl,mdl src,at may.the district court did not permit the plaintiffs to amend their complaint with information obtained as a result of a discovery stipulation between the parties.id.at.
we conclude that the district court erred in denying the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint with additional materials on the ground that the materials were acquired as a result of a consensual discovery agreement made by merck and the derivative plaintiffs.we remand the case to the district court to determine whether,even with these additional materials,amendment would have been futile.
the district court has stated the facts of this complicated case concisely and accurately,so we repeat them here 
merck is a global pharmaceutical company incorporated in new jersey,which researches,develops,manufactures and markets a broad range of medicines and vaccines that improve human and animal health.plaintiffs are shareholders bringing this action on behalf of merck against all individuals who were serving on merck board of directors as of march,date the first shareholder derivative action relating to vioxx was well as thirteen other current or former directors and officers of the company.
vioxx is a member of a class of pain medications known as drugs nsaids.vioxx is one of a new generation of selective nsaids called inhibitors,which are designed to reduce inflammation and pain while avoiding the risk of serious gastrointestinal side effects associated with traditional nsaids.after receiving approval from the food and drug administration fda,vioxx was introduced to the market in may.vioxx was marketed and sold for over five years until september,when merck voluntarily withdrew the medication.
plaintiffs contend that scientists within merck were aware that vioxx may cause cardiovascular problems for its users as early as.plaintiffs allege that,from approximately to,merck made public statements which promoted the use of vioxx for treatment of arthritis,and for other pain sufferers.none of these statements,however,mentioned any cardiovascular risks associated with the use of vioxx,despite defendants alleged knowledge of this problem.plaintiffs contend that defendants continued to have the company conceal vioxx health risks and repeatedly emphasized safety despite scientific data to the contrary.
in,merck initiated an vioxx gastrointestinal outcomes research vigor trial designed to prove the drug gastrointestinal safety benefits.the trial compared people taking a high dose of vioxx with those taking naproxen,and excluded those at a high risk of heart problems.the results of the vigor study came in on march.the results showed that vioxx patients suffered fewer stomach problems than the naproxen group,but significantly more related problems.these results were published in the new england journal of medicine in november of.although the article discussed vioxx benefits for the stomach,it did not discuss in any detail information about potential cardiovascular complications.
on february,merck executives met with the fda arthritis advisory committee to discuss vioxx and the vigor trial.during the meeting,approximately seven doctors discussed cardiovascular complications associated with vioxx.plaintiffs maintain that defendants,nonetheless,caused merck to issue a press release on may,in which the company reconfirmed the favorable cardiovascular safety profile of vioxx.
on august,researchers at the cleveland clinic published a study in the journal of the american medical association jama which discussed the vigor study and celecoxib arthritis safety study class studies.the article stated that t he annualized myocardial infarction rates for inhibitors in both vigor and class were significantly higher than that in the placebo group the available data raise a cautionary flag about the risk of cardiovascular events with inhibitors.plaintiffs allege that prior to the publication of the article,defendants caused merck to publicly claim that vioxx does not result in any increase in cardiovascular events compared to placebo,and that it had additional data beyond what the cleveland clinic cite s,and the findings are very,very reassuring.on september,the fda sent defendant gilmartin a warning letter stating that merck promotional campaign minimizes the potentially serious cardiovascular findings that were observed in the vigor study,and thus,misrepresents the safety profile for vioxx.in may,harvard researchers published the results of a study which found vioxx was associated with an elevated risk of heart attacks higher,compared to the use of celebrex or a placebo.plaintiff alleges that defendants demanded that researchers delete or tone down their findings,and that prior to publication of the results,defendants removed the name of a merck employee who had worked on the study from the list of authors.
on august,david graham,an fda researcher,presented the results of an fda study at a medical conference.the results showed that higher doses of vioxx may have led to more than heart attacks and sudden cardiac deaths and triple the risk of heart attacks and death.plaintiffs contend that the following day,defendants caused merck to state publicly that they strongly disagree d with graham conclusion,and that merck stands behind the efficacy,overall safety and cardiovascular safety of vioxx.
plaintiffs further allege that defendants threatened and intimidated numerous academics who publicly questioned or discussed the safety of vioxx.plaintiffs maintain that certain merck directors held the power to withdraw important funding from academic research and also cancelled the presentations of doctors who questioned the safety of vioxx.
see in re merck,wl,at internal citations omitted.
because of the harm allegedly caused by vioxx,merck now faces thousands of lawsuits.these lawsuits come in a variety of forms,including product liability and shareholder derivative actions.on february,the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation transferred all derivative,securities and erisa actions to the district of new jersey for consideration coordination.consolidation occurred on may.the plaintiffs in this case filed their complaint on june,arguing that demand on merck board of directors would be futile.on june,the magistrate judge approved a discovery stipulation agreement between the parties that stated,in relevant part,that all discovery in the consolidated derivative action,except for requests for production of documents focused on the merck board of directors actions concerning vioxx prior to merck voluntary withdrawal of vioxx on september,shall be stayed pending the court ruling on the motion to dismiss the consolidated derivative complaint,unless the court enters an order permitting such discovery to proceed.
in late august,merck filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the plaintiffs had failed to make a demand upon the march board and had failed to adequately plead demand futility.in november,the plaintiffs filed a redacted version of their memorandum in opposition to the defendants motion to dismiss.the plaintiffs also filed an unredacted version of their opposition under seal,which contained arguments and factual assertions that relied on information the plaintiffs obtained during the course of discovery.on december,merck filed a motion to strike the extraneous documents in the plaintiffs opposition memorandum.at an april,hearing,the district court granted merck motion to strike because it concluded that much of the information in the plaintiffs unredacted brief was not contained in the complaint and did not constitute the type of material that can be considered on a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b.the general rule in demand futility cases is that discovery may not be used to supplement demand futility allegations.
on may,the district court granted merck motion to dismiss the plaintiffs complaint with prejudice,and also denied the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint to supplement their demand futility allegations based on information acquired through discovery 
the district court exercised diversity jurisdiction over this case pursuant to a.our jurisdiction is pursuant to,because the district court dismissal with prejudice constituted a final order.
we review both a district court refusal to grant the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint and a district court ruling on demand futility under federal rule of civil procedure for abuse of discretion.kanter barella,cir hill city of scranton,cir.to the extent that the district court made conclusions of law,our review is de novo.see blasband rales,cir.
in this case,we are confronted with the decision by the district court that held,as a matter of law,that information obtained through the stipulated discovery agreement could not be used to supplement the plaintiffs demand futility allegations.we review this conclusion of law de novo.both parties agree that we should apply new jersey law to this case,as federal courts hearing shareholders derivative actions involving state law claims apply the federal procedural requirement of particularized pleading,but apply state substantive law to determine whether the facts demonstrate demand would have been futile and can be excused.kanter,at.
shareholder derivative suits typically require plaintiffs to make demand on the board of directors that the board bring suit on behalf of the corporation.blasband,at.the reason for this requirement is that t he decision to bring a lawsuit or to refrain from litigating a claim on behalf of the corporation is a decision concerning the management of the corporation and consequently is the responsibility of the directors.id.citations omitted.there are narrow exceptions when shareholders will be excused from making demand.the new jersey supreme court has adopted delaware demand futility standard.in re pse g,kanter,at because the new jersey supreme court in pse g sought guidance from delaware decisional law,we will do the same here.as the new jersey supreme court stated,for shareholder plaintiffs in new jersey to withstand a motion to dismiss for failure to make a demand,they must plead with particularity facts creating a reasonable doubt that the directors are disinterested and independent,or the challenged transaction was otherwise the product of a valid exercise of business judgment.in re pse g,at.if,as in this case,the board of directors is being accused of a failure to act,then the second prong technically does not apply and demand futility must be shown through the first prong id.at.the first prong nonetheless requires us to look to the business judgment rule,as the entire question of demand futility is inextricably bound to issues of business judgment.aronson lewis,id.at stating that a conscious decision to refrain from acting may nonetheless be a valid exercise of business judgment and enjoy the protections of the rule.in this regard,when the complaint asserts inaction by the board,as here,courts will not excuse demand in the absence of allegations demonstrating why the board is incapable of considering a demand.kanter,at quoting in re prudential ins.derivative,rales blasband.w here inaction is the heart of the allegation,the plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating a reasonable doubt as to the validity of the business judgment presumption.kanter,at.
as we have stated,derivative plaintiffs are required to establish that demand would have been futile at the time they commenced litigation.a corollary of this rule is that discovery generally may not be used to supplement allegations of demand futility.beam stewart,in general,derivative plaintiffs are not entitled to discovery in order to demonstrate demand futility.in re pse g,at stating that when a court decides a defendant motion to dismiss a shareholder suit for failure to make a demand as required under rule,the court review is generally limited to the pleadings rales,at d erivative plaintiffs are not entitled to discovery to assist their compliance with rule.this rule serves the underlying purpose of the demand requirement.as the district court stated,t he demand requirement would be rendered meaningless if a plaintiff who can not establish demand futility when he files suit is nonetheless permitted to amend his pleading using materials later obtained during discovery to justify his failure to make a demand.in re merck,wl,at.if derivative plaintiffs are allowed to obtain discovery after making conclusory allegations in their complaints to strengthen those very complaints,then shareholder plaintiffs will have incentive to make baseless allegations and then engage in discovery fishing expeditions.further,except in narrow circumstances,directors and officers should not be burdened with engaging in discovery from shareholders who might have no legitimate basis to sue.the demand requirement would be effectively circumvented if we were to adopt a contrary rule.
the district court began its discussion by laying out the parameters of federal rule of civil procedure a,which states in relevant part that a party may amend its pleadings only by leave of court or written consent of the adverse party and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires.the district court then cited foman davis,d,for the proposition that i n the absence of undue delay,bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant,leave to amend should be freely given.in re merck,wl,at see also lorenz csx,cir.
futility is also a sufficient ground to deny leave to amend.kanter,at.futility means that the complaint,as amended,would fail to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.in re burlington coat factory sec,cir.the district court concluded that amendment would have been futile because it held that the plaintiffs could not rely on information to bolster their conclusory allegations of demand futility.
the plaintiffs argue that the district court improperly adopted a rule whereby information can never be used in demand futility complaints.the plaintiffs rely primarily on our court decision in blasband as well as the sixth circuit in mccall scott,cir.merck contends that the plaintiffs position contradicts the rule that discovery may not be used to supplement demand futility allegations.
in blasband,a plaintiff filed a derivative action alleging that demand was excused.at.the two issues were whether blasband had standing to bring the action and whether he established demand futility.the district court dismissed the complaint,concluding that blasband did not have standing and did not adequately plead that demand would have been futile.this court vacated the district court decision and remanded,concluding that w e agree with the district court that blasband has not adequately established that he is excused from making a proper demand.however,we also believe that blasband does have standing to maintain this derivative action,and we therefore hold that blasband should be given the opportunity to move to amend the complaint to allege additional facts establishing that a proper demand would have been futile.id.although the opinion did not address whether blasband could use discovery,the court did not place any limitations on the type of information that blasband could include in his amended complaint.merck argues that blasband is inapposite because it does not specifically address the use of discovery to amend demand futility allegations.
in mccall,the sixth circuit reversed a district court decision to n
