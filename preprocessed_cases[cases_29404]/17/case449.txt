plaintiff miles harvey appeals the judgment under code of civil procedure section for defendants the landing homeowners association,a california nonprofit mutual benefit corporation lha,certain members of the board of directors board of lha,and various residents of the landing residing on the fourth floor of the condominium development collectively defendants.harvey contends the trial court erred when it granted summary judgment for defendants because a the board acted outside the scope of its authority when it determined fourth floor homeowners could exclusively use up to square feet of inaccessible common area attic space,appurtenant to their units,for rough storage b the board lacked the power to make a material change in the restated declaration of restrictions cc r for the landing by allowing fourth floor homeowners to use the attic space common area for storage and c the various resolutions passed by the board,permitting use of that space for storage,were invalid because the board vote lacked a disinterested majority.
we conclude the board acted within its authority under the cc r,and the undisputed evidence shows it properly exercised its discretion when it determined fourth floor homeowners could use up to square feet of inaccessible attic space common area for storage.we further conclude the actions of the board were not invalid because directors who owned units on the fourth floor of the project voted in favor of allowing limited exclusive use of the attic space common area.we therefore affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
the landing is a,condominium complex located in coronado,california.on the fourth floor of the landing,each of the units has attic space adjacent to the units designated on the condominium plan as common area.the attic space common area is accessible only to the unit adjacent to it.
for many years,several fourth floor homeowners used the vacant attic space for storage.in,a homeowner complained to the board about that use,which prompted the board to inspect the fourth floor units.of the units on the fourth floor,the board discovered of the homeowners were using between and square feet of the common area attic space for storage,with homeowners using in excess of square feet of that space as storage.in addition,one other fourth floor owner had converted a portion of the common area attic space into habitable living space.
after the inspections were completed,harvey,who was then president of the board,and two members of the landing architectural review committee arc prepared a memorandum to the board with the results of the inspection.the arc memorandum recognized fourth floor homeowners had been using the attic space common area for at least years,with many of these homeowners improving the space by adding features such as wallboard,lights,flooring,carpeting,closets,shelves and doors.the memorandum also recognized the homeowners use of the attic space was governed by article iv,section of the cc r,which provides 
the board shall have the right to allow an owner to exclusively use portions of the otherwise nonexclusive common area,provided that such portions of the common area are nominal in area and adjacent to the owner exclusive use area s or living unit,and,provided further,that such use does not unreasonably interfere with any other owner use or enjoyment of the project.
the arc memorandum found the use of the attic space common area as storage by the fourth floor homeowners did not interfere with any other owner use or enjoyment of the project,and with one exception,the memorandum concluded the homeowners use of that space was nominal within the meaning of section of the cc r.the arc memorandum concluded by making several recommendations,including having the lha enter into a license agreement with each of the fourth floor homeowners using the attic space common area.
the memorandum outlined the proposed terms of the license agreement,including,among other things,requiring the fourth floor homeowners to obtain insurance to cover their use of the attic space,preventing additional modifications or improvements to the space without written approval from the board and imposing a assessment of to cover the costs and fees associated with the drafting and recording of the license agreement.
harvey decided to meet with legal counsel regarding the fourth floor homeowners use of the attic space common area.among other things,legal counsel opined the lha lacked authority to grant the encroaching owners the right to continue their use of the common area because using an attic for storage is not a nominal use.based on legal counsel report,at the next board meeting harvey requested the board issue notices of violation under the cc r to the fourth floor homeowners using the attic space common area.when the board refused,harvey immediately resigned as president of the lha,although he remained a director on the board.
the city of coronado city became involved in the matter when,in response to a complaint by a disgruntled homeowner regarding the continued use of the attic space common area,it issued to the board a notice of violation under the california building code.several board members,including harvey,met with two building inspectors for the city.the inspectors advised the board the attic space could be used for storage,but not living space.the board agreed to provide monthly updates to the city regarding the board progress in mitigating all aspects of the notice of violation.
at its next meeting,the board voted four to one in support of a motion finding a violation of the cc r and the building codes by the fourth floor homeowners using the attic space common area.during the meeting,the board recognized its authority under the cc r to permit a homeowner to use a nominal area of the common area provided it is adjacent to the owner unit and such use would not interfere with any one else use.by the same vote in a renewed motion,the board purportedly decided square feet or less of the attic space common area could be used for rough storage example boxes,christmas decorations,luggage,the homeowners would have to ask the board for permission to use the square feet for storage and this resolution would also apply to storage space in the pillars that are located in the entrance to front patios.the board also agreed to hold a workshop for homeowners to discuss ideas to organize the restoration of the units that have violations.
as it turns out,the average size of the fourth floor living units is about square feet.the landing has approximately square feet,which includes approximately square feet of common area.the total area approved for attic storage for all fourth floor units combined is square feet,units x square feet,or a little more than percent of the total building area,or approximately percent of the total common area.
the board issued notices of violation to the fourth floor homeowners,telling them their use of the attic common area violated the cc r and the california building code,directed them to restore the attic space to its original condition and advised them they could make a formal request to the board for permission to use up to square feet of common area for rough storage under certain conditions.in response to the notices of violation,several homeowners retained legal counsel who claimed those owners had obtained irrevocable rights to use the attic space that could not be disturbed by the board.
to effectuate the board resolution regarding the attic space common area,and to avoid litigation with the fourth floor homeowners,the board prepared a standard permission form to be signed by those homeowners.among other provisions,the form provided that the homeowner could use no more than square feet of common area for rough storage only,that use of that space was subject to all provisions of the landing bylaws,the cc r and governmental laws,rules and regulations,and that the board reserved the right to terminate its approval of such use for cause.in the board unanimously approved the permission form,after myriad revisions,which included three votes by homeowners who did not live on the fourth floor.
the board also took steps to ensure the lha insurance coverage would not be affected by the fourth floor homeowners use of the attic space common area.the board consulted the lha insurance broker,who determined the use of the common area attic space in the landing for storage purposes has not impacted the landing insurance coverage and has not jeopardized the insurability of the landing premises.the board also required each fourth floor homeowner seeking to use the attic space to obtain liability insurance coverage of million.
the city continued to conduct periodic inspections of the fourth floor units to ensure full compliance with applicable laws and regulations.after an inspection in,the city found no unit with storage exceeding square feet,and further concluded the units in question were in compliance with the building and fire codes.the city conducted another inspection of the subject units in late to ensure fire code compliance.the city report stated a ll units that had storage were within the maximum allow ance of square feet.the report did note,however,some minor noncompliance items,and asked the lha to contact the city when they were corrected.
harvey requested the board call a special meeting of the members of the lha after the board in amended the rules and regulations of the lha to set forth the common areas determined by the board to be appropriate for storage use.under the rule change,residents of the landing could not store property in the common area other than in the garage storage lockers,or in cabinets installed in the pillars of entry patios,or in the attics of living units to the extent permitted by the board the homeowners approved the rule change by a vote.
the board passed a resolution in transferring to the fourth floor owners the exclusive right to use the common area attic space in that owner unit,as allowed under civil code section a e.the board resolution provided 
a all fourth floor common area attic space is accessible only from the inside of a condominium 
b all fourth floor common area attic space is freely accessible only by the owner of the unit in which it is located 
c all fourth floor common area attic space is inaccessible to owners other than the owner of the unit in which it is located 
d all fourth floor common area attic space is of no general use to the membership at large,but only to the owner of the unit in which it is located and 
e the maintenance and management of fourth floor common area attic space is a burden to the lha because such space is located inside of the condominium,is generally inaccessible to the membership,and is of little use or benefit to the lha.
harvey filed a lawsuit against defendants alleging causes of action for trespass,breach of fiduciary duty and injunctive relief.defendants moved for summary judgment.the trial court granted the motion,finding the language of the cc r grants the board broad authority and discretion to determine whether to allow an owner to exclusively use portions of the common area and this necessarily includes determining what portions are nominal in area.the court found the board acted within the scope of authority given to it under article ii,section of the cc r when it exercised its discretion in interpreting section of the cc r and its application to requests from homeowners to use their attic space.the court deferred to the board presumed expertise on the use of the attic space common area,based on undisputed evidence showing the board conducted a reasonable investigation,in good faith and with regards for the best interests of the community association and its members and exercised discretion within the scope of its authority.the court also ruled directors who voted in favor of allowing limited use of the attic space common area had no conflict of interest with the lha merely because they owned units on the fourth floor of the project,and,in any event,the vote of all the homeowners overcame any such potential conflict.
finally,the court concluded harvey trespass claim failed because the attic space common area was being used by the fourth floor homeowners with the board express permission.because no causes of action remained against defendants,the court concluded harvey was not entitled to injunctive relief.in a separate hearing,the court awarded defendants costs of suit in the amount of,and attorney fees in the amount of

b.the cc r 
the issue here concerns the interpretation of the lha cc r,including the language nominal in area in article iv,section in connection with an owner exclusive use of the attic space common area.
article ii,section of the cc r provides in part 
t he activities and affairs of the lha shall be managed and all corporate powers shall be exercised by and under the ultimate direction of the board.except as may be otherwise provided herein,the lha acting through the board and officers shall have the sole and exclusive right and duty to manage,operate,control,repair,replace or restore all of the common area or any portion thereof,together with the improvements 
article ii,section provides in part 
the board shall have the right to adopt reasonable rules and regulations not inconsistent with the provisions contained in these cc r,and to amend the same from time to time relating to the use of the common area and the recreational and other facilities situated thereon by owners and by their lessees or invitees 
article iv,section of the cc r provides in part 
no part of the common area shall be obstructed so as to interfere with its use for the purposes herein above permitted,nor shall any part of the common area be used for storage purposes except as incidental to one of such permitted uses,or for storage of maintenance equipment used exclusively to maintain the common area or in storage areas designated by the board.emphasis added.
as noted above,article iv,section of the cc r gives the board authority to allow an owner to use exclusively common area provided such use is nominal in area and adjacent to the owner exclusive use area or living unit,and provided further,that such use does not unreasonably interfere with any other owner use or enjoyment of the project.
the cc r make clear the board has the sole and exclusive right to manage the common area art.ii,to adopt reasonable rules and regulations not inconsistent with the provisions contained in the cc r relating to that use art.ii,to designate portions of the common area as storage areas art.iv,and to authorize it to allow an owner to use exclusively portions of the common area nominal in area adjacent to the owner unit,provided such use does not unreasonably interfere with any other owner use or enjoyment of the project.art.iv.
c.the rule of judicial deference applies to the board decision allowing fourth floor homeowners to use up to square feet of inaccessible attic space common area for rough storage 
harvey contends the grant of summary judgment was improper because the board had no discretion to overrule or modify the mandate of art.iv,that the common area shall not be used for storage.harvey relies on nahrstedt,supra,cal th,d,to support his position.
in nahrstedt,the supreme court addressed the validity of a pet restriction under civil code section,subdivision a contained in the cc r prohibiting residents from keeping all animals including cats and dogs in their units except domestic fish and birds.nahrstedt,supra,cal th at,fn,d.under civil code section,subdivision a,use restrictions in cc r are enforceable equitable servitudes,unless unreasonable the nahrstedt court concluded section presumption of reasonableness could only be overcome if the party challenging the restriction could prove the restriction violates public policy bears no reasonable relationship to the protection,preservation,operation or purpose of the affected land or otherwise imposes burdens on the affected land that are so disproportionate to the restriction beneficial effects that the restriction should not be enforced.nahrstedt,supra,cal th at,d.applying that standard to the facts before it,the court in nahrstedt held a complete ban on animals was not unreasonable and was therefore enforceable under civil code section.nahrstedt,supra,cal th at,d.
harvey further argues the trial court erred when it relied on the other leading supreme court case concerning condominium homeowner associations,lamden la jolla shores clubdominium homeowners ass cal th,d,lamden.there,an owner sued the condominium community association for injunctive and declaratory relief,claiming the board of directors of the community association caused her unit to decrease in value because of the board decision to rather than fumigate plaintiff unit for termite infestation.id.at,d.in affirming the board action,the court concluded,w here a duly constituted community association board,upon reasonable investigation,in good faith and with regard for the best interests of the community association and its members,exercises discretion within the scope of its authority under relevant statutes,covenants and restrictions to select among means for discharging an obligation to maintain and repair a development common areas,courts should defer to the board authority and presumed expertise.ibid.
the lamden court thus adopted a rule of judicial deference to community association board decision making,which affords homeowners,community associations,courts and advocates a clear standard for judicial review of discretionary economic decisions by community association boards,mandating a degree of deference to the latter business judgments sufficient to discourage meritless litigation,yet at the same time without either eviscerating the duty to guard against unreasonable risks to residents personal safety owed by associations that function as a landlord in maintaining the common areas citation or modifying the enforceability of a common interest development cc r citations.lamden,supra,cal th at,d.
harvey contends the trial court here erred when it relied on lamden,and not nahrstedt,asserting lamden is distinguishable from the present case because the issue in lamden involved the court review of a discretionary and repair of a common area in connection with termite control,whereas the issue here involves the enforcement of the plain language of the governing documents.harvey thus argues lamden does not provide defendants support for their contention that the board of directors of the lha had authority and discretion to override the prohibition in the cc r against using common area for storage lacking that discretion,defendants evidence regarding the reasonableness of their investigation,and the fairness of their decision to authorize the use of up to square feet of the common area for storage,is beside the point.
the cc r do not,however,provide a blanket prohibition against the use of common area for storage,as harvey suggests.section of article iv expressly allows the board to designate storage areas in the common area.section of article iv further gives the board the authority and discretion to allow an owner to use exclusively the common area provided certain conditions are met,including the conditions the use be nominal and the use not unreasonably interfere with any other owner use or enjoyment of the project.the cc r further grant the board the exclusive right to manage,operate and control the common areas of the condominium development,providing additional support for the board decision to interpret the cc r to allow up to square feet of attic space common area to be used as storage area.see art.ii,and.
unlike the situation in nahrstedt where the challenged provision in the cc r did not afford the board of the community association with any discretion,prohibiting all animals except domestic fish and birds,here the challenged provisions art.iv,and provide the board with the authority and discretion to allow fourth floor homeowners to use,under certain conditions,portions of the common area for rough storage.we thus conclude lamden,and not nahrstedt,governs here 
under the rule of judicial deference adopted by the court in lamden,we defer to the board authority and presumed expertise regarding its sole and exclusive right to maintain,control and manage the common areas when it granted the fourth floor homeowners the right,under certain conditions,to use up to square feet of inaccessible attic space common area for rough storage the undisputed evidence in the record shows the board conducted an investigation in regarding homeowners use of the fourth floor attic space,which had been ongoing for approximately years met with officials from the city to ensure the use of the attic space complied with building codes consulted its insurance broker,who determined the use of the fourth floor common area attic space in the landing for storage purposes has not impacted the landing insurance coverage,has not increased the premiums for the landing condominium policy,and has not jeopardized the insurability of the landing premises agreed to conduct a workshop for homeowners to discuss ideas to organize the restoration of the units that have violations prepared and revised a standard permission form signed by each fourth floor homeowner to ensure compliance with all provisions of the landing bylaws,the cc r and governmental laws,rules and regulations required each fourth floor homeowner seeking to use the attic space to obtain liability insurance coverage of million took steps to correct some minor noncompliance items discovered by the city in during the city annual inspection of the subject units to ensure fire code compliance called a special election of all owners of the landing to determine whether the board should permit homeowners to use the fourth floor attic space common area for rough storage and passed a resolution in transferring to the fourth floor owners the exclusive right to use the common area attic space in that owner unit,as purportedly allowed under civil code section a e.
this undisputed evidence shows the board,upon reasonable investigation,in good faith and with regard for the best interests of the community association and its members,properly exercised its discretion within the scope of the cc r when it determined the fourth floor homeowners could use exclusively up to square feet of inaccessible attic space common area as rough storage 
summary judgment was properly granted on harvey fourth cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty against the fourth floor directors 
breach of duty is usually a fact issue for the jury.lysick walcom d.breach may be resolved as a matter of law,however,if the circumstances do not permit a reasonable doubt as to whether the defendant conduct violates the degree of care exacted of him or her.ibid.
harvey contends summary judgment was improper as to his fourth cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty against certain interested directors because a triable issue of fact exists regarding whether those directors breached that duty to the lha.harvey argues the resolutions passed b
