plaintiffs in this derivative action allege that the officers and directors of merck,and medco health solutions,violated their fiduciary duties to shareholders and failed to prevent harm to the corporations.shareholders bringing,on behalf of their corporations,actions derived from alleged wrongs to those entities must make demand on the boards of directors unless to do so would be futile.claiming demand futility as to medco board and in part as to merck board,plaintiffs made demand on merck board to take action as to certain of their claims.in response,that board retained counsel to launch a investigation.upon receiving counsel report,the board refused plaintiffs demand to sue.after plaintiffs filed their derivative claim,defendants attached the merck counsel investigatory report to their motion to dismiss.federal rule of civil procedure b requires conversion from a motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment when materials outside the pleadings are considered.the district court said it excluded the report,but its analysis relied on facts that seem to come only from the report.did the apparent inclusion of the report,which was not incorporated into plaintiffs complaint,require that the motion to dismiss be converted into a motion for summary judgment we believe the answer here is yes and thus remand the issue to be decided on summary judgment.
factual background and procedural history 
merck,a new jersey corporation,is a global pharmaceutical company,and medco,a delaware corporation,was its wholly owned subsidiary.plaintiffs ellen fagin and judith fagin are merck shareholders.defendant raymond gilmartin is chairman and ceo of merck.the other defendants are directors and officers of merck or medco.arthur andersen,merck former auditor,was named as a defendant initially,but plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed it from the suit.
medco is a pharmacy benefits manager it saves its clients money by negotiating discount rates with pharmacies.when a customer buys drugs at a pharmacy,the pharmacist checks with medco to ensure that the customer is an approved beneficiary.then the customer pays a,which goes directly to the pharmacy,not to medco.
in january merck announced plans to spin medco off in an initial public offering.merck filed its first form with the securities and exchange commission for the medco ipo on april merck final was not approved until july.in june the wall street journal reported that medco had been recognizing as revenue and estimated that billions of dollars in pharmacy had been recognized this way.less than a week after this article,merck dropped medco offering price.in july merck disclosed in an amended that medco had recognized over billion in revenue from to.a few days later merck announced that it would postpone the medco ipo indefinitely and later canceled it completely.merck has now been sued in several securities fraud class actions.
merck had other troubles.in the government and several states joined in qui tam actions against merck and medco,charging various wrongful business conduct violations of the federal false claims act,et.merck also settled an erisa class action suit for over million in december.
plaintiffs brought a derivative claim on behalf of merck and medco against merck and medco executives,charging them with unjust enrichment because their bonuses were based in part on reported revenues,the accuracy of which was their responsibility.plaintiffs also charged the executives and directors with a breach of fiduciary duty for their roles in the companies troubles.
in september plaintiffs made demand on merck board for claims arising from the overstatement of merck revenues,but the board refused this demand in december.plaintiffs claim that demand on the merck board for claims arising from the qui tam actions would be futile.they claim futility as well for any demand on the medco board.
plaintiffs filed their shareholder derivative complaint in new jersey state court in may,and in june the defendants removed it to the district court for the district of new jersey.plaintiffs amended their complaint in july.in september the defendants filed a motion to dismiss under federal rules b and.plaintiffs filed a to convert the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment,as the defendants had sent the court a report created by merck outside counsel.the district court granted the motion to dismiss and denied the in august.plaintiffs now appeal to our court.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had subject matter jurisdiction under,as part of the claim involves the federal securities laws.it took jurisdiction of this case under after the case was removed from the state court.because the court granted a motion to dismiss under rule b,we have jurisdiction under.we exercise plenary review of its grant of a b motion,and we apply the same test as the district court.maio aetna,cir.in reviewing the motion to dismiss,we must accept as true the facts alleged in the complaint and view them in the light most favorable to plaintiffs.id.at.
although we normally would review the district court determination of demand futility for abuse of discretion,the legal precepts used by it in making that determination have been challenged,so we exercise plenary review here.blasband rales,cir see also salve regina coll.russell,d c ourts of appeals must review the determinations of district courts de novo.
iii.discussion 
would demand on merck board be futile 
the district court held that plaintiffs did not establish demand futility for the claims arising from the qui tam actions for three reasons plaintiffs did not sufficiently plead that the directors were not independent or disinterested because of their participation in the wrongful conduct or their exposure to personal liability they did not show by particularized facts that members of merck board were unable to act independently because of their business and personal relationships and the complaint did not demonstrate that the merck directors were because of their personal gain from the alleged wrongful conduct.
plaintiffs argue that the test applied by the district court was inapplicable because the merck board conduct constituted an active decision not to act rather than inaction.they also argue that,because medco business conduct was unlawful,merck directors were not exercising business judgment by allowing medco to persist in this conduct.
in a case where state substantive law applies,we must apply the forum state rules.see klaxon stentor.under new jersey rules,the law of the state of incorporation governs internal corporate affairs.see brotherton celotex,div.merck is a new jersey corporation,so we apply new jersey law.the new jersey supreme court recently adopted delaware demand futility standard.in re pse g.that standard requires a plaintiff to create a reasonable doubt that either the directors are disinterested and independent,or the challenged transaction was otherwise the product of a valid exercise of business judgment.id.adopting the test as set out in aronson lewis,overruled on other grounds by brehm eisner.
for the second prong of the demand futility test,pse g adopted the gloss applied by another new jersey court,in re prudential ins.deriv.ch.div,cited by pse g,at,which noted that the test second prong does not apply to situations in which the board has not taken an action,prudential,at citing rales blasband,see also pse g,at.plaintiffs alleged that merck board failed to act by allowing medco to continue wrongful business practices and inflate revenue.the issue is therefore whether the second prong of the demand futility test applies.
in its rales blasband decision,at,the delaware supreme court created the second prong inaction exception later followed by pse g and prudential the demand futility test does not apply where,inter alia,there was no business decision of the board,id.at.the rales court suggested that a failure to oversee subordinates would fall under this exception.id.at.prudential followed this suggestion,holding that a company directors failure to oversee both subordinates and a subsidiary corporation fell within the exception and t
