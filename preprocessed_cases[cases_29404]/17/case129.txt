background 
first amended complaint the first amended complaint the complaint alleges that a conspiracy,that extended from the to the present,was perpetrated by members of an international organized group of russian and american racketeers and was carried out in the united states and russia.the conspirators were chernoi,deripaska,makmudov,nekrich and kislin the conspirators.by means of,threats,physical seizure of property,bribery,a sham bankruptcy,and corrupt judicial proceedings,the conspirators,it is alleged,acquired control of kachkanarsky gok gok,of which appellants were the majority shareholders.gok is a russian company that maintains russia largest vanadium ore plant in the town of kachkanar in the sverdlovsk oblast in the ural mountains.
the complaint alleges in detail the multitude of actions the conspirators,and persons and entities associated with them,took to further their scheme to seize gok and to prevent appellants from obtaining redress in the russian courts.for the purposes of this opinion it is necessary to describe only the general nature of these actions.
the conspirators were a part of the izmailovo mafia,one of the most powerful organized crime groups.as such they engaged in the fraud on the russian central bank that procured the funds in the united states that became the seed money for their criminal ventures,including the seizure of gok.in the conspirators and members of the russian mafia threatened gok general director,jalol khaidarov,with death unless he sought to persuade gok shareholders to turn over first and later of their shares to the conspirators.
khaidarov transmitted the demands to the gok shareholders,but the shareholders did not comply.next,makmudov asked khaidarov to meet with him in moscow.the two were joined by malevsky,a leader in the russian mafia conspirators deripaska,kislin,and nekrich and five armed thugs.makmudov demanded that khaidarov arrange for the gok controlling shareholders to transfer of gok shares to chernoi without payment.khaidarov said he thought makmudov was crazy,but that he would transmit the message.he was told,this is the last time you will leave here alive.
in,eduard roussel roussel was the governor of sverdlovsk oblast,where gok was located.the conspirators bribed him for his support of their efforts to do business in sverdlovsk oblast.
in january,the conspirators sent armed persons to take physical control of the gok plant.by threats of physical harm the conspirators caused four of the seven members of gok board of directors to remove khaidarov as general director and to replace him with andrey kozitsin kozitsin,an agent of the conspirators.in response to a legal challenge to the takeover,a member of russia supreme court issued a directive that invalidated the ruling of a lower court approving the action of the rump board of directors and remanded the case to the lower court for reconsideration.the lower court has taken no action.
three of the remaining board members filed criminal complaints challenging the illegal takeover.malevsky people threatened these directors and their families with death if they continued to resist the takeover,and the cooperation of two other directors was secured with bribes.
the complaint sets forth in considerable detail the steps the conspirators took to place gok out of the reach of its shareholders should the shareholders prevail in their legal proceedings.the conspirators arranged for the new general director,kozitsin,to enter a number of sham transactions,as a result of which a shell company,lebaut,accumulated a total of gok promissory notes with a face value of approximately million.the conspirators,through collusive means,then arranged for gok to be placed into bankruptcy.the sverdlovsk arbitrazh court appointed oleg kozyrev kozyrev,an agent of the conspirators,as provisional manager of gok.
at an august first meeting of creditors,lebaut fraudulent claim amounted to of creditor votes,giving it the power to elect kozyrev external manager of gok,a position that gave him management authority over the company.thereupon the conspirators arranged for appellants to be removed from the registry of gok shareholders and for their shares to be transferred secretly to delaware shell companies new start,venitom and other companies controlled by the conspirators.the complaint sets forth in detail the multiple transactions that the conspirators were alleged to have orchestrated in order to transfer the davis,omni,foston and holdex shares to venitom and other companies that the conspirators controlled.
having achieved their objective of transferring all the gok shares,the conspirators no longer needed the bankruptcy proceedings.accordingly,in march kozyrev held a second meeting of creditors at which,based on lebaut huge claim,the creditors approved a sham settlement agreement which had the effect of making the claims of legitimate creditors worthless and transferring control of gok to its new shareholders.under russian bankruptcy law,shareholders had no standing to challenge this agreement.
in retaliation for their opposition,the conspirators arranged for false criminal charges to be brought against khaidarov and joseph traum,a managing director of appellant davis.these charges and threats of violence forced khaidarov and traum to flee to israel.
this summarizes the allegations that form the factual basis of the complaint.
b.the base metal action on december,base metal trading,sa and two other corporations filed a complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,charging that the named defendants,using tactics similar to those alleged in the complaint in the instant case,sought to take control of nkaz,an aluminum corporation,as part of their effort to monopolize the russian aluminum industry.
of particular significance in the instant case is the amended complaint that the plaintiffs filed on august.the amended complaint advanced claims based on the alleged illegal takeover of gok through physical force,bribery and extortion.the plaintiffs in base metal included the four appellants in the instant case.the defendants in base metal included seven of
