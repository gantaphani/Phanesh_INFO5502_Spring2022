during a telephone conference on or about july,between and among peter dunning,greg bush,frank mccarthy and their respective attorneys,a general discussion of the business affairs and contract provisions of the stock purchase agreement took place.subsequently,section of the stock purchase agreement was first mentioned around the end of july,and was first drafted by defendants attorneys on july.peter dunning discussed section of the stock purchase agreement with his attorney and read the stock purchase agreement before he signed it.section was discussed and included in the stock purchase agreement as a result of peter dunning desire to protect his earning stream in the event that defendants or one of their companies purchased aggregate interest in superior.
at about this same time,representatives of aggregate were negotiating a resolution of the joint venture.by july,aggregate had notified the defendants of the essential terms of a potential resolution whereby lehigh would cancel superior debt.lehigh would retain assets used in the joint venture,superior would receive tons of cement per year for five years,and aggregate would receive a guaranteed supply of cement at market price for a term of years.peter dunning knew that a resolution was being negotiated and that superior relationship with lehigh was affecting superior financial position in a negative fashion.defendants did not disclose the status of the negotiations between aggregate and lehigh to peter dunning and dunning did not inquire further about it.negotiations continued throughout the fall of and were finalized in a settlement agreement dated november.the cement due to superior under the agreement was assigned to aggregate as part of superior redemption of aggregate stock in superior.using gaap,aggregate valued the cement at.superior purchased aggregate interest in superior by way of a redemption on december.the superior redemption agreement defined superior as the buyer and aggregate as the seller and provides that aggregate wishes to sell its interest in superior.

one week after the plaintiffs signed the stock purchase agreement and before closing,defendant frank mccarthy told bank that superior intended to pay off its loans and terminate its relationship with bank.superior loan application with its new lender,the national bank,was prepared on august,approved on september,and closed on september.
the common stock of twin city owned by the plaintiffs were securities within the meaning of section of the iowa securities act.the purchase of the plaintiffs stock by the defendants was consummated in the state of iowa.
defendants notified peter dunning of the transaction between aggregate and superior shortly after it was complete,and defendants claimed that this transaction triggered section of the stock purchase agreement.based upon this,plaintiffs shares would be at approximately.aggregate valued the free cement contract at using accounting standards used in the united kingdom,which do not require that the value be discounted to a present value

as damages,dunning claims that defendants failed to make payments due to him under section of the spa,which provides for a fixed payment of and a performance payment equal to of superior annual gross profits for ten years following the execution of the spa defendants claim that dunning was no longer entitled to payment under section of the spa because the aggregate redemption triggered section of the spa and therefore under section,dunning was only entitled to a lump sum equal to an amount as calculated under section of the spa.as a result,dunning received substantially less for his shares in twin city than he expected under the spa.

on plaintiffs securities fraud claims 
on plaintiffs breach of contract claim 
on plaintiffs second breach of contract claim by failing to consider damage evidence 
did the district court abuse its discretion by striking the second report of plaintiffs expert witness 
we address each issue.
ii.standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party.see offutt lexington ins,cir.we review the district court order to strike an expert witness supplemental report for abuse of discretion.see heartland bank heartland home finance,cir.
iii.common law i and ii 
the district court summarized dunning fraud claims as follows 
plaintiffs dunning make one claim of fraudulent misrepresentation and three claims of fraudulent concealment.first,plaintiffs allege that defendant greg bush fraudulently misrepresented to the plaintiffs that aggregate would not sell its interest in superior to twin city for less than five million dollars.second,plaintiffs assert that the defendants concealed the fact that they had commenced negotiations to purchase aggregate interest in superior prior to the time plaintiffs sold their stock in twin city.third,plaintiffs assert that defendants fraudulently concealed their knowledge of the essential terms of the settlement between superior and lehigh.fourth,plaintiffs assert that defendants fraudulently concealed information that aggregate had withdrawn its financial support and that refinancing was necessary.
although the district court discussed other aspects of the fraud claims,the key to its rulings denying the several claims of fraud rests on a record,which is absent of evidence that gregory bush,representing all defendants,intended to deceive the plaintiff peter dunning,representing all plaintiffs,in the making of the contract to purchase the dunning stock in twin city.
although in its brief dunning refers to other false statements and failures to disclose matters relating to lehigh and discussions of the purchase of aggregate interest in superior,none of that evidence shows the scienter,intent to deceive,necessary to support the fraud claims against defendants.thus,we affirm on the rejection of all the fraud claims including rescission of the contract based on fraud counts i and ii and the securities fraud claim count iv based on the iowa uniform securities act.
we turn to other issues where we reverse.
iv.fiduciary iii 
dunning fiduciary duty claim rests upon essentially the same allegations underlying his fraud claims.dunning claims that a fiduciary relationship existed between himself and defendants requiring defendants to disclose their discussion relating to a buyout from aggregate the status of the lehigh settlement and developments regarding the state of superior financing,including its favorable financing arrangements with bank.
dunning also asserts that defendant gregory bush made misleading statements to him regarding aggregate desire to sell its interest in superior.according to dunning,bush told him that aggregate would not sell its interest cheaply,and not for less than.dunning also claims that bush told him to trust me when negotiating section 
pursuant to section,if defendants acquired aggregate interest in superior at a low figure,dunning would get less than if no such acquisition had been made.if the acquisition price was high,on the other hand,dunning might receive more than or equal to the total purchase price stated in section of the spa.dunning claims that full disclosure was required from defendants,who occupied a fiduciary position in the proposed purchase of dunning stock in twin city.according to dunning,defendants breached their fiduciary duty by failing to disclose the status of the lehigh settlement,superior bank financing prior to executing the spa,and,more importantly,defendants withheld information about discussions with aggregate preliminary to the buyout
