following a precipitous decline in stock value,shareholders sued among others the director and officers of a texas corporation formed through merger.after the suit settled,the corporation sued its insurer for coverage under its directors and officers liability policy.at issue was whether the policy covered the directors and officers wrongful acts that were the same as or related to their wrongful acts.a jury concluded that there was no coverage.the corporation now appeals the district court pretrial grant of partial summary judgment,its rulings on three motions for judgment as a matter of law at the close of the evidence,and its judgment on the verdict.we affirm.
in the summer of,medical care international,mci and critical care america cca announced that they would merge to become wholly owned subsidiaries of a new company,medical care america,medical care.the companies issued statements trumpeting expectations for medical care increased earnings.on august,they filed a joint with the securities and exchange commission sec and sent copies of the filing to their shareholders.the merger became final on september,at which time the directors of mci and cca became the directors of medical care.
in anticipation of the merger,medical care risk management director,theresa,consulted larry waldie,an insurance broker employed by marsh mclennan,marsh,about purchasing directors and officers liability insurance for medical care going forward from the date of the merger.in conjunction with this consultation,medical care appointed marsh its exclusive agent of record.acting on medical care behalf,waldie solicited quotes from several insurance companies,including national union fire insurance company national union.subsequently instructed waldie to bind national union quote.on september,national union sent waldie a letter that represented a temporary conditional binder outlining its agreement to provide medical care with million worth of coverage from september,to september.the temporary conditional binder conditioned coverage on national union receipt,review,and acceptance of certain information from medical care,including a completed application.it explained that the policy would be issued with ten endorsements,including one for prior acts as of september.waldie summarized the temporary conditional binder in a separate binder binder he sent to on september.the binder indicated that the policy would exclude all prior acts prior to policy inception date.on september,medical care satisfied the conditions of the temporary conditional binder.
the expectations for medical care proved overly optimistic,and on september,the new company announced flat earnings.the announcement caused share value to plummet over in one day,at which point the new york stock exchange suspended trading of medical care stock.in response,at least shareholder class action lawsuits were filed against medical care,cca,mci,and the directors and officers.the lawsuits were consolidated into a single action in the united states district court for the northern district of texas.the consolidated suit alleged violations of b and a of the securities exchange act of and of sec rule the complaint alleged that the defendants made misrepresentations and failed to make necessary disclosures in public statements and filings.
on january,national union issued the liability policy that medical care had applied for the previous september.endorsement of the policy provided 
in consideration of the premium charged,it is hereby understood and agreed that this policy only provides coverage for loss arising from claims for alleged wrongful acts occurring on or after september,and prior to the end of the policy period and otherwise covered by this policy.loss es arising out of the same or related wrongful act s shall be deemed to arise from the first such same or related wrongful act.
by letter dated january,national union denied coverage for the claims asserted in the class action based on the related acts language of the second sentence of endorsement.on march,the class action plaintiffs filed an amended complaint.national union restated its denial of coverage by letter dated may,repeating its reliance on endorsement 
the shareholder suit was settled in principle pursuant to mediation for million and the full release of all claims asserted against the defendants.medical care advised national union of the settlement,asking it to reconsider its denial of coverage and to participate in the settlement,which had not yet been funded or approved by the court.national union reiterated its previous position.after the district court approved the settlement,the million was paid to the class action plaintiffs and the claims against medical care,mci,cca,and their respective officers and directors were released.in february,the defendants entered into an agreement that allocated responsibility for the million settlement among five of the six defendants.under that agreement,medical care owed a contribution to the settlement but its directors and officers,who were separate defendants in the shareholder suit,did not in may,however,the defendants revised their allocation agreement,requiring medical care directors and officers to contribute million to the settlement because medical care had indemnified its directors and officers,it ultimately bore responsibility for that million.
medical care filed the present lawsuit in november after national union denied coverage under the policy.it stated claims for breach of contract,breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing,and violations of the texas insurance code the district court granted in part and denied in part the parties competing motions for summary judgment.of relevance to this appeal,the court ruled for medical care in holding that the binder agreements are the controlling contracts of insurance at issue in this case ruled against medical care in finding that there was a triable issue as to whether national union was estopped from relying on the related acts exclusion and ruled for national union in dismissing with prejudice medical care extracontractual claims.
medical care remaining claim for breach of contract was tried to a jury.at the close of the evidence,both parties filed motions for judgment as a matter of law jmol.the court denied medical care motion in toto.of relevance here,it held that medical care had not shown that it was due coverage as a matter of law.the court granted national union motion in part,ruling that the insurance contract included a related acts exclusion and that national union was not equitably estopped from relying on that related acts exclusion.the jury returned a verdict for medical care,finding that medical care proved that its directors and officers had incurred loss arising from the shareholders claims about their alleged wrongful acts occurring on or after september,and that medical care had indemnified its directors and officers for such loss.the jury found,however,that national union proved that all the directors and officers wrongful acts occurring after september,were the same as or related to wrongful acts occurring prior to september.
after the court denied its motion for a new trial and its renewed motion for jmol,medical care appealed.
we review summary judgment de novo,following the same standard applied by the district court summary judgment is appropriate only if the movant demonstrates that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that it is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law 
we also review judgment as a matter of law de novo jmol is appropriate when a party has been fully heard with respect to an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to have found for that party with respect to that issue.in reviewing the record,we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmovant,make no credibility determinations,and do not weigh the evidence we give credence to evidence supporting the movant only if it is uncontradicted and unimpeached,at least to the extent that that evidence comes from disinterested witnesses.if,after reviewing the evidence in this manner,the facts and inferences point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of one party that the court believes that reasonable men could not arrive at a contrary verdict,granting of jmol is proper.but if there is substantial evidence opposed to jmol,that is,evidence of such quality and weight that reasonable and men in the exercise of impartial judgment might reach different conclusions,jmol should be denied.
the parties agree that under texas law an insurance binder provides coverage according to the terms and provisions of the ordinary form of the contemplated policy in this case,the binder expressly states that the policy would exclude coverage of all prior acts prior to policy inception date,but it is silent as to coverage of subsequent acts that are related to the prior acts.at issue is whether the ordinary form of prior acts endorsement used in policies contains language excluding coverage of subsequent related acts at the close of evidence,the district court granted a partial jmol for national union on this issue,finding as a matter of law that endorsement,the prior acts endorsement containing related acts language that was used in the policy issued to medical care in january,was the standard form normally or ordinarily issued by national union in its liability policies.the consequence of this ruling under maxey and ranger county was to make the related acts exclusion a term of the binder.we agree that national union met its burden under rule a and that jmol was appropriate on this issue.
two disinterested witnesses testified that national union standard practice,like that of the industry,was to use related acts language in prior acts endorsements.lawrence waldie,the insurance broker who served as medical care agent,testified that endorsement was in a form that was the customary and normal form of a prior acts endorsement issued by national union and other carriers writing policies under similar circumstances hence,he was not surprised that it contained related acts language.on the contrary,he agreed that endorsement was the type of prior acts endorsement that he had anticipated when he wrote out the binder in september.he testified that he had no recollection of ever negotiating a prior acts endorsement that did not contain related acts language on behalf of any client with either national union or any other insurer.furthermore,he could not recall ever seeing a policy with a prior acts endorsement that did not contain related acts language.indeed,he was not aware that any such policy was available in the industry.
anthony codding testified similarly.codding,a former assistant division manager of national union division,was involved in underwriting between and policies at national union.he testified that in his experience national union had never used a prior acts endorsement that did not include related acts language.he explained that,based on his experience,he would interpret a reference in a binder to a prior acts endorsement to mean that the subsequently issued policy would include a prior acts endorsement containing related acts language.in sum,he testified that the standard form used in by national union for prior acts endorsements contained language such as the second sentence of endorsement number that is,related acts language.
through codding,medical care introduced evidence that national union had seven different forms of prior acts endorsements available for use by its underwriters.one of these did not contain related acts language.codding testified,however,that he could not recall a time when national union had used that lone form.he explained that i t is not a standard endorsement and is not ordinarily and customarily used by national union on policies.
in addition to waldie and codding,elliot rothman appeared on behalf of national union as an expert witness in the area of liability insurance.rothman testified that the standard industry practice was to include related acts language in prior acts endorsements 
medical care offered no evidence to contradict the testimony of waldie,codding,or rothman.instead,it argued that the lone endorsement form that did not contain related acts language and the testimony that all policies were different and subject to negotiation created a triable issue about the scope of coverage under the binder.but neither piece of evidence supports a reasonable inference that the customary and standard form of liability insurance issued by national union did not contain related acts language.there is no evidence that national union ever used the lone endorsement form that does not contain related acts language.and there is no evidence that national union ever issued a policy with a prior acts endorsement that did not contain related acts language.indeed,codding testified that he could not recall a single instance when a broker or client negotiated the related acts language out of a prior acts endorsement.
after carefully reviewing the record,we conclude that the evidence and inferences point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of a finding that national union standard prior acts endorsement normally or ordinarily used in its liability policies contained related acts language that jmol in national union favor is warranted.
medical care asserts that national union was equitably estopped from relying on the related acts language to deny coverage.under texas law,a plaintiff relying on the doctrine of equitable estoppel must show 
a false representation or concealment of material facts made with knowledge,actual or constructive,of those facts with the intention that it should be acted on to a party without knowledge or means of obtaining knowledge of the facts who detrimentally relies on the representations.
the burden of proving an estoppel and the essential elements thereof is on the party asserting it and the failure to prove any one or more of the elements is fatal.at the close of evidence,the district court granted a partial jmol for national union on the applicability of equitable estoppel to the case.the court concluded that medical care had presented legally insufficient evidence to establish the first or fourth elements.because no facts or inferences support a finding of those two elements,we agree that jmol for national union was appropriate as to this issue.
medical care asserts that national union concealed the true scope of the prior acts endorsement by omitting from its binder any reference to related acts.as we discussed above,the uncontroverted evidence shows that the binder indicated that the policy would include a prior acts endorsement that a prior acts endorsement used in the context of a policy would normally and ordinarily be understood to contain related acts language and that national union standard prior acts endorsement normally and ordinarily contained related acts language.there is no positive evidence that national union misrepresented or concealed coverage terms.because the evidence points so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of national union,we conclude that a jury could not reasonably infer that national union had anything to conceal,intended to conceal anything,or in fact concealed anything from medical care.because medical care failed to establish the first element of equitable estoppel,summary judgment was appropriate.
furthermore,under texas law,a party claiming an estoppel must have used due diligence to ascertain the truth of the matters upon which he relies in acting to his detriment.there is no evidence that medical care or any of its representatives made any inquiry of marsh or national union as to either the scope or effect of the prior acts endorsement.nor is there evidence that medical care lacked the means to make such an inquiry or was somehow prevented from doing so.on the contrary,waldie testified that he encouraged to contact him with questions about the binder.in short,our review of the record reveals that it can not reasonably be inferred that medical care used due diligence to ascertain the scope or effect of the prior acts endorsement or that medical care lacked the means of obtaining knowledge of the extent of the prior acts exclusion.thus,medical care
