facts and procedural history 
plaintiffs are former shareholders of pennexx foods,a pennsylvania corporation that provides meat to customers in the northeastern united states.defendants are pennexx smithfield foods,a virginia corporation that produces,processes,and markets a variety of meat products directors and officers of pennexx and smithfield foods and showcase foods,a subsidiary of smithfield foods.
in june,pennexx entered into a stock purchase agreement with smithfield foods.smithfield foods agreed to purchase fifty percent of the outstanding shares of pennexx for million and to extend pennexx a revolving line of credit up to million,secured by pennexx assets.smithfield foods nominated two of its executives,defendants joseph luter iv and michael cole,to pennexx board of directors.in april,pennexx purchased a meat processing facility in philadelphia,the tabor facility.in may,with smithfield foods assistance,pennexx began renovating the building,and in july moved its operations into the tabor facility.renovations continued for the next several months.
shortly thereafter,pennexx defaulted on its repayment obligations to smithfield foods.over the objections of luter and cole,pennexx issued additional stock to raise capital.in january,luter and cole resigned as pennexx directors.subsequently,smithfield foods demanded all delinquent amounts under its credit agreement and pursued a replevin action.on june,under a consent decree,smithfield foods foreclosed on all of pennexx real and personal property.showcase foods then took over the tabor facility.
this class litigation followed.the winer family trust had purchased shares of pennexx stock on may.based on this purchase,winer filed a class action complaint against pennexx,smithfield foods,executives and officers of both companies,and showcase foods.winer claimed pennexx had inflated the price of its stock through public statements and earnings reports that omitted or misstated material facts.winer was appointed lead plaintiff in november.
winer suit alleged federal and state causes of action on behalf of two separate classes.on behalf of public investors who purchased pennexx securities during the period from february,until june,winer alleged violations of b of the securities and exchange act,as amended by the private securities litigation reform act of,b,a,and rule,see,against pennexx and individual defendants michael queen,president of pennexx thomas mcgreal,a director and vice president of sales for pennexx and smithfield foods executives luter and cole individual defendants.winer also alleged violations of a of the securities and exchange act against smithfield foods and the individual defendants.on behalf of public investors who currently own pennexx securities,winer asserted state law claims for breach of fiduciary duty against queen and smithfield foods,aiding and abetting claims against luter and cole,and successor liability claims against smithfield foods and showcase foods.
on september,the district court granted defendants motions to dismiss the rule claims,except for several claims against pennexx and queen based on the challenged statements and omissions made after may,the date winer purchased its stock.the court also granted the motions to dismiss with respect to the breach of fiduciary duty claims against queen,smithfield foods,luter,and cole.the court denied defendants motions to dismiss the a claims and successor liability claims based on rule for several statements and omissions occurring after may.
winer then sought leave to amend,purportedly curing pleading deficiencies and amplifying previous allegations based on new information.this new information came from additional discovery permitted in july involving the june closing of the tabor facility.in an order dated january,the district court denied winer leave to file the proposed amendments,finding them futile.
winer only remaining claims were based on statements made by defendants after the date of winer stock purchase.as a result,smithfield foods filed a motion to dismiss contending winer lacked standing.on february,the court entered an order that by agreement of the parties winer withdrew as lead plaintiff without prejudice to pursue an appeal as former lead plaintiff.after plaintiffs failed in their attempt to substitute other lead plaintiffs,the district court,on june,dismissed the case for lack of prosecution.
winer timely appeals the september,order partially granting defendants motions to dismiss,the january,order denying leave to file its proposed amendments,the february,order withdrawing winer as lead plaintiff,and the june,order dismissing the action.
the focus of this appeal is pennexx statements about its business relationship with smithfield foods and the renovation of the tabor facility.winer contends smithfield foods abused pennexx in a prior business deal,and that pennexx omitted material facts about this prior relationship in a february,press release.the february press release credited smithfield foods loan to pennexx as a factor allowing pennexx to list its stock on the over the counter bulletin board.the press release also referred favorably to pennexx business prospects and growing demand.
winer also challenges statements and filings involving renovations to the tabor facility.on february,pennexx announced its agreement to acquire the tabor facility,stating it was perfectly suited to our needs,and required minimal improvements.in a march,sec filing,pennexx estimated the cost of purchasing,renovating,and equipping the tabor facility to be between million and million.pennexx purchased the tabor facility on april for million and announced the acquisition on april.in an april filing,pennexx revised estimates ranged from million to million total for purchasing,renovating,and equipping the tabor facility.on may pennexx again revised its cost estimate for purchasing,renovating,and equipping the tabor facility to between million and million.pennexx began renovating the tabor facility with smithfield foods assistance in may,and moved into the facility in july 
as lead plaintiff,winer also asserted state law claims for breach of fiduciary duty.winer contends queen breached his fiduciary duty by signing a forbearance agreement on may,which called for a broad release of claims that could have been asserted against smithfield foods by pennexx and its shareholders.in the forbearance agreement,pennexx agreed to pay outstanding loan obligations and expenses totaling approximately million by june,and generally release smithfield foods from all obligations and liabilities other than those set forth in the agreement.smithfield foods agreed to forbear from exercising its rights and remedies until june,provided pennexx complied with its obligations,and to assist pennexx in its efforts to redomesticate itself in delaware.winer maintains that smithfield foods,frustrated in its attempts to purchase pennexx outright,implemented a scheme to undermine pennexx ability to operate so that it could acquire pennexx assets and business opportunities at a discount and to the detriment of pennexx shareholders.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
winer filed this securities class action under b and a of the securities and exchange act of,b and a.the district court had jurisdiction under and supplemental and ancillary jurisdiction over the state law breach of fiduciary duty claims.we have jurisdiction to review the final judgment of the district court under.
we exercise plenary review over the district court dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim under.b,delaware nation pennsylvania,cir,and over the district court interpretation of the applicable federal securities laws.morrison madison dearborn capital partners iii,cir.we review the district court denial of winer request for leave to amend for abuse of discretion.kanter barella,cir.
winer contends the district court erred in dismissing the amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted and abused its discretion in failing to grant winer leave to amend.
constitutional standing requires an,which is an invasion of a legally protected interest that is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of and that it must be likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.danvers motor,ford motor,cir citing lujan defenders of wildlife,d.plaintiffs have the burden to establish standing.id.at citing storino borough of point pleasant beach,cir.winer rule claim is based on its purchase of pennexx securities on may.the district court dismissed all of winer rule claims that were based on representations made after its purchase date.
the plaintiff class under rule is limited exclusively to actual sellers or purchasers of securities.see blue chip stamps manor drug stores,d holding plaintiff did not qualify as either a purchaser or seller of stock and thus lacked standing to pursue a claim under rule.there is no private right of action under rule for mere holders of securities.merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,dabit,d citing blue chip stamps,at.winer must be a purchaser or seller to pursue its rule claims,and accordingly only has standing to assert claims based on activity prior to the date winer purchased its stock.
in class action suits,winer asserts,the lead plaintiff may base claims on statements and omissions occurring after its date of purchase.but it is still necessary for the lead plaintiff to establish its own standing based on a purchase or sale of stock,and not merely the decision to retain stock.see fallick nationwide mut.ins,cir citing brown sibley,cir a potential class representative must demonstrate individual standing sic the defendant he can not acquire such standing merely by virtue of bringing a class action.the initial inquiry in either case is whether the lead plaintiff individually has standing,not whether or not other class members have standing.winer only has standing to pursue fraudulent conduct on or before its may,purchase date.
applicable pleading requirements 
the amended complaint asserts rule claims based upon reckless or intentional misstatements and omissions occurring on or before may.see b it shall be unlawful for any person t o make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made in light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.plaintiffs must also allege defendants made a misstatement or an omission of material fact with scienter in connection with the purchase or the sale of a security upon which plaintiffs reasonably relied and plaintiff reliance was the proximate cause of their injury.id.
the private securities litigation reform act of requires plaintiffs in a private securities action to specify each allegedly misleading statement,why the statement was misleading,and,if an allegation is made on information and belief,all facts supporting that belief with particularity.b b.importantly,the pslra requires the applicable mental state be pleaded with particularity.see id.t he complaint shall,with respect to each act or omission alleged to violate this chapter,state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.the district court held that winer failed to adequately plead scienter.
the supreme court has mandated a uniform construction of the strong inference standard in light of the objectives of the pslra.tellabs,makor issues rights,d see key equity investors,marketing,wl cir,applying the pleading standard laid out by tellabs globis capital partners,stonepath group,wl,at cir.july,the court tellabs decision removes any doubt the pslra scienter pleading requirement is a significant bar to litigation.the twin goals of the pslra are to curb frivolous,litigation,while preserving the investors ability to recover on meritorious claims.id.at.one of the purposes of the pslra heightened pleading requirements is to limit abusive securities suits.see dabit,at.in re advanta,at citing conf,at,reprinted in,noting the pslra is designed to limit the practice of filing lawsuits against issuers of securities in response to any significant change in stock price,regardless of defendants culpability targeting of deep pocket defendants the abuse of the discovery process to coerce settlement and manipulation of clients by class action attorneys.as the supreme court has recognized in the securities context,even class suits with little merit may have disproportionate settlement value.see tellabs.at citing dabit,at.blue chip stamps,at.
the court prescribed a process for considering a motion to dismiss in a b action first,as with any rule b motion,courts must accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true.tellabs.at citing leatherman tarrant county narcotics intelligence and coordination unit,d.second,courts must consider the complaint in its entirety.id.this includes examining additional sources courts normally consider when ruling on a motion to dismiss,in particular,documents incorporated into the complaint by reference,and matters of which a court may take judicial notice.id.citation omitted.courts must inquire whether all of the facts alleged,taken collectively,give rise to a strong inference of scienter,not whether any individual allegation,scrutinized in isolation,meets that standard.id.emphasis in original citations omitted.third,to determine whether the pleaded facts meet the pslra strong inference standard,courts must take into account plausible opposing inferences.id.
in ruling that courts must consider plausible opposing inferences in a motion to dismiss,the court set forth a reasonable person test,stating that the facts must give rise to a strong,a powerful or cogent inference that is at least as compelling as any opposing inference.
but in the pslra,congress did not merely require plaintiffs to provide a factual basis for their scienter allegations instead,congress required plaintiffs to plead with particularity facts that give rise to a strong,a powerful or.
the strength of an inference can not be decided in a vacuum.the inquiry is inherently comparative a court must consider plausible nonculpable explanations for the defendant conduct,as well as inferences favoring the plaintiff.the inference that the defendant acted with scienter need not be irrefutable,of the genre,or even the most plausible of competing inferences,yet the inference of scienter must be more than merely reasonable or permissible it must be cogent and compelling,thus strong in light of other explanations.a complaint will survive only if a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.

tabor facility statements 
winer challenges pennexx february,press release,in which the company announced it had agreed to purchase the tabor facility.in the press release,queen,pennexx president,was quoted as stating 
the tabor facility is perfectly suited to our needs,as it is strategically located in the central northeast corridor and close to our customers.since the new facility requires minimal improvement,we will be able to renovate and automate quickly and plan to be operational in this pristine facility by the second quarter of.
winer contends queen statements were knowingly false and misleading because they failed to disclose the facility needed a major overhaul costing over million and requiring expert supervision.winer maintains defendants never disclosed that smithfield foods,not pennexx,exclusively controlled the purchase and renovation of the tabor facility,which resulted in a facility not designed to meet pennexx needs.winer also contends pennexx press releases and sec filings between march and may,were misleading because they failed to disclose that,during a walking tour of the tabor facility on or about march,joseph luter iii advised the individual defendants that pennexx should spend whatever was necessary to make the tabor facility a operation.
pennexx acquired the tabor facility on april.on april,pennexx disclosed that the total estimated cost for purchasing,renovating and equipping the tabor facility would be between million and million.pennexx later revised this estimate in may to between million and million.
the district court found the most plausible inference from these events was that after the march,walking tour,pennexx realized that the cost of renovations would be more extensive than previously estimated.this was disclosed to investors in the april filing.accordingly,the district court held the amended complaint failed to allege facts giving rise to a strong inference that,as of february,queen knew that the tabor facility would require anything more than minimal improvements.
on appeal,winer contends the district court erred in dismissing these claims because the pslra strong inference pleading standard does not permit the resolution of disputed facts at summary judgment.the district court accepted the facts alleged by winer as true.it viewed those facts holistically in light of all additional facts alleged in the complaint.but the district court found that the most plausible inference flowing from these facts was a inference.
a complaint will survive a motion to dismiss only if a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.tellabs.at.the district court found the most plausible inference from winer alleged sequence of facts was that pennexx revised its preliminary cost estimates as it learned more about the costs of renovating the tabor facility.stated differently,winer purported inference,that the february statements regarding the tabor facility were knowingly false,was not as compelling or as strong as the opposing interest cited by the district court.
in considering these inferences,the district court properly probed documents attached to defendants motion to dismiss.this was appropriate because these documents were integral to were explicitly relied upon by the amended complaint.see tellabs.at c ourts must consider the complaint in its entirety,as well as other sources courts ordinarily examine when ruling on rule b motions to dismiss,in particular,documents incorporated into the complaint by reference,and matters of which a court may take judicial notice.in re burlington coat factory,at holding a document integral to or explicitly relied upon in the complaint may be considered without converting the motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment quoting shaw digital equip,cir superseded on other grounds by the pslra,b tmj implants,aetna,at,wl,at cir although we ordinarily limit our review on a motion to dismiss to the allegations in the complaint,we consider documents incorporated into the complaint by reference.quoting tellabs.at see also newton merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir in reviewing a motion for class certification,a preliminary inquiry into the merits is sometimes necessary to determine whether the alleged claims can be properly resolved as a class action.in considering competing inferences,courts may find it necessary to probe the documents integral to the complaint.
thus,winer inference is neither cogent,nor compelling,nor strong in light of competing inferences a reasonable person would not deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any inference.see tellabs.at see also higginbotham baxter,wl,at cir holding an inference of scienter was neither compelling nor cogent central laborers pension fund integrated electrical services,wl,at cir holding that when examining officer trading as a factor suggesting a strong inference of scienter,courts must consider both culpable and nonculpable explanations citing tellabs.at atsi communications,shaar fund,cir holding that where a plausible nonculpable explanation is more likely than any guilty inference,plaintiffs failed to establish scienter quoting tellabs.at belizan hershon,wl,at remanding to allow district court to determine whether the inference that defendants acted recklessly was at least as compelling as any opposing inference of nonfraudulent intent quoting tellabs.at.
winer also contends the statements made between march,through may,were actionable because they failed to disclose that smithfield foods staff was performing the renovations of the tabor facility.the securities laws do not require a defendant provide the public with all material information.in re burlington coat factory,at citing in re time warner.sec,cir.to impose liability for,a defendant must be under a duty to disclose the omitted information.oran stafford,cir even of material information will not give rise to liability under rule unless the defendant had an affirmative duty to disclose that information.see also basic,levinson,d silence,absent a duty to disclose,is not misleading under rule.as a general matter,an affirmative duty arises only when there is insider trading,a statute requiring disclosure,or an inaccurate,incomplete,or misleading prior disclosure.oran,at.pennexx points to no duty to disclose that smithfield foods staff was renovating the tabor facility.the challenged press releases and sec only to provide an outline of pennexx plans and objectives regarding future renovations.the district court correctly held pennexx had no duty to disclose that smithfield foods staff was renovating the tabor facility.taking the facts pleaded as true and viewing them holistically,a reasonable person would not deem the inference of scienter as cogent and at least as compelling as any inference based upon the omitted facts.see tellabs.at.
foods relationship 
winer challenges statements made in pennexx february,press release about the business relationship between pennexx and smithfield foods.queen stated pennexx common stock registration resulted from the million commitment that smithfield foods,the leading processor and marketer of fresh pork and processed meats in the,made to our company in june.winer contends that a prior venture between smithfield foods and pennexx had been disastrous because smithfield foods had supplied pennexx with pork products.winer maintains the failure to disclose this prior venture in the february press release was misleading.
the district court held defendants had no duty to disclose the previous business relationship.liability may exist under rule for misleading or untrue statements,but not for statements that are simply incomplete.brody transitional hospitals,cir rule prohibit s only misleading and untrue statements,not statements that are incomplete often,a statement will not mislead even if it is incomplete or does not include all relevant facts.emphasis in original and internal citation omitted backman polaroid,st cir en banc the duty to disclose rule does not mean that by revealing one fact about a product,one must reveal all others that,too,would be interesting,but means only such others,if any,that are needed so that what was revealed would not be so incomplete as to mislead.quoting sec texas gulf sulphur.cir.winer fails to specify why the assertion that the equity investment made by smithfield foods helped facilitate pennexx registration of its common stock was misleading or untrue.accordingly,the amended complaint did not sufficiently allege facts giving rise to a strong inference that queen acted with scienter in making the statements at issue.see b.
moreover,winer allegation that queen made the february,statement while cognizant of the prior smithfield relationship does not satisfy the scienter requirements because queen statement does not give rise to a strong inference that he acted with the required state of mind.queen stated the million commitment made pennexx stock listing statement which was true.winer fails to sufficiently allege facts supporting a strong inference that queen knew or recklessly disregarded the possibility that his statement was misleading.the district court properly held winer failed to adequately plead scienter for the february,statement.
leave to amend 
winer contends the district court improperly denied it leave to amend.although leave should be freely given when justice so requires.a,we have held a district court may deny leave to amend on the grounds that amendment would cause undue delay or prejudice,or that amendment would be futile.in re alpharma.sec,cir quoting oran at.the decision to grant a motion for leave to amend is within the sound discretion of the district court.cureton collegiate athletic ass,cir.the district court determines futility by taking all pleaded allegations as true and viewing them in a light most favorable to the plaintiff.see in re alpharma,at.we review for abuse of discretion.see cal.pub.employees ret.chubb,cir.the district court held winer proposed amendments would be futile and denied leave to amend.
tabor facility claims 
winer contends new information alleged in the proposed amendments establishes scienter for queen february,optimistic statements about the renovation of the tabor facility and pennexx march and april,sec filings estimating the cost of the tabor facility.winer proffered new information comes from the july,deposition of mike timmons,a smithfield foods engineer and a project leader for the renovations who stated the tabor facility was in relatively poor shape queen comments during a walking tour of the tabor facility on july,and a budget estimate prepared by robert mcclain,a smithfield foods engineer and a project leader for the tabor facility renovations.winer contends these sources portray the tabor facility as being in disarray prior to renovations and that pennexx understated the magnitude of the renovations required.
winer challenges queen assertion on february,that the tabor facility required minimal improvement.winer cites queen statements in that there had been a problem with the lighting in one area of the tabor facility and a major issue in the plant that started to happen right away was that the floor was coming up.the district court found the proposed amendments futile because winer did not plead that any defendant knew any statement was false or misleading when made.in re nahc.sec,cir to be actionable,a statement or omission must have been misleading at the time it was made liability can not be imposed on the basis of subsequent events.cal.pub.employees,at we have long rejected attempts to plead fraud by hindsight.see also tellabs.at the strong inference formulation was appropriate,the second circuit said,to ward off allegations of fraud by hindsight.citing shields citytrust bancorp,cir quoting denny barber,cir friendly.queen february,statements were made in the early stages of a complex,evolving real estate transaction.within weeks of announcing its decision to purchase the tabor facility and before the acquisition was final,pennexx released preliminary estimates that purchasing,renovating,and equipping the new facility would require substantial expenditures.the district court noted the most plausible inference was that pennexx revised its cost estimates in response to new information and to negotiations during the intervening time period.in this context,the district court noted,the pleaded facts failed to support the requisite strong inference of reckless conduct,much less intentional conduct.stated differently,winer purported inference,that the statements regarding the tabor facility were knowingly false,was not as compelling or as strong as the opposing inference cited by the district court.thus,winer inference is neither cogent,nor compelling,nor strong in light of competing inferences.a reasonable person would not deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any inference.see tellabs.at.
winer also relies on timmons deposition and mcclain preliminary budget estimate to contradict queen february,statement.as the district court noted,timmons had not begun working at the tabor facility until weeks after queen challenged statements.accordingly,the district court found this was an impermissible attempt to prove fraud by hindsight.we agree.
mcclain higher estimate for purchasing,repairing and equipping the tabor facility was dated january.but the district court noted that the version of mcclain preliminary budget estimate cited in the proposed amendments was attached to an email sent to queen on march,a week after queen made the challenged statements.but even assuming queen had seen the mcclain estimate prior to his february,statement,the district court held that it failed to correct the scienter deficiencies.as noted,queen statement was made in the early stages of a complex,evolving real estate transaction.in subsequent filings,pennexx disclosed the tabor facility project would cost more than originally expected.the district court found the collective allegations of the second amended complaint failed to give rise to a strong inference that queen made the february,statement with scienter.we agree.a reasonable person would not deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any inference.see tellabs.at.
the district court also found the mcclain estimate did not cure the scienter deficiencies for allegations based on the march and april sec filings.the district court noted that mcclain estimate was based on the information currently in hand as of march,only nine days after pennexx had entered into a preliminary agreement to purchase the tabor facility and over one month before pennexx finalized the acquisition of the tabor facility.the district court found the cost estimates contained in the challenged sec filings corresponded to the limited principal advances permitted by smithfield foods under the parties credit agreement as of march.mcclain higher cost estimates did not appear to consider the significant constraints on pennexx ability to finance the tabor facility project.the district court found the most plausible inference was that pennexx revised its cost estimates in response to new information and ongoing financial negotiations.stated differently,winer purported inference was not as compelling or as strong as the opposing interest cited by the district court.thus,the inference is neither cogent,nor compelling,nor strong in light of competing inferences.a reasonable person would not deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any inference.see tellabs.at.
moreover,the district court found that timmons opinion could not give rise to a strong inference that queen acted with scienter.winer did not allege that timmons conveyed his opinions on renovation and budgeting to queen prior to his february statement or that queen adopted timmons opinions.as the district court noted,the proposed amendments never alleged that timmons informed queen of the poor condition of the tabor facility.winer failed to adequately plead scienter by failing to link the declarant of the challenged statement with facts that might contradict his statement.see b requiring plaintiffs to plead facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind see also alpharma,at a llegations that williams,a subordinate of an individual defendant,knew of the irregularities occurring in brazil provide an insufficient basis upon which to impute knowledge to that individual defendant.nolte capital one fin,cir affirming dismissal where plaintiffs failed to plead that the speaking defendants adopted an employee opinion that capital one was undercapitalized but then publicly declared that capital one was maintaining sufficient capital.
citing nursing home pension fund local oracle,cir,winer contends timmons testimony provides a substantial window into the state of the tabor facility at the time of queen february statement but oracle is easily distinguishable on the facts.
winer also contends timmons statements prove scienter for prior optimistic statements.but winer relies on statements made at the beginning of the renovation of the tabor facility.timmons had not even started working at the tabor facility at the time of queen february,statement.the underlying facts,when viewed in the context of the complex renovation,fail to support a strong inference of scienter.a reasonable person would not deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any inference.the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the proffered amendments failed to cure the scienter deficiencies of the original complaint.
pennexx financial condition 
winer contends the district court abused its discretion by failing to grant leave to add allegations regarding pennexx financial condition.winer challenges the statements in pennexx sec filings on april,and may,that all adjustments,including normal recurring adjustments,necessary to present fairly the financial position of the company and the results of its operations and cash flows have been included.in support,winer cites a report by bart ellis,vice president for operations at smithfield foods,dated august,a memorandum by jeffrey deel,a smithfield foods employee,dated july,and comments by queen during the tour of the tabor facility in july.according to winer,these sources demonstrate pennexx did not fairly present its financial condition accurately on a timely basis in reports to the sec.
as the district court noted,a complaint is actionable if it alleges that a defendant was aware that mismanagement had occurred and made a material public statement about the state of corporate affairs inconsistent with the existence of the mismanagement.hayes gross,cir discussing the holding in shapiro ujb fin,cir.the district court found none of winer newly asserted facts gave rise to a strong inference that defendants acted with scienter.the ellis report recounts pennexx problems in reporting financial results to smithfield foods on a weekly and monthly basis.but the district court noted the ellis report did not demonstrate that pennexx failed to fairly present its financial condition in its quarterly and annual sec reports.stating that pennexx income statement s and balance sheet s are only published on a quarterly basis on the schedule demanded by sec requirements,the ellis report suggests pennexx was filing timely reports with the sec but not with smithfield foods.the district court found the deel memorandum merely suggested methods for pennexx to improve production and minimize losses.queen statements suffer from the defects already discussed regarding pleading fraud by hindsight.in these statements,queen addressed the ability of pennexx to calculate yield on a monthly basis,specifically referencing a failure to do so in february.the district court found these proposed amendments failed to support a strong inference that defendants knew or recklessly disregarded facts indicating pennexx lack of the internal controls necessary to file accurate financial statements in april and may.
citing in re ikon office solutions.sec,d,winer contends that pennexx history of failed internal controls demonstrates pennexx could not accurately disclose its financial condition.but the allegations in in re ikon were explicit and stronger,demonstrating that the company internal controls were grossly deficient and that the financial data was so pervasively inaccurate and unreliable that reliance on that information for financial statement purposes was precluded by gaap and gaas.id.at.the district court found none of winer proposed amendments supported a conclusion that the challenged statements were false or most they suggested pennexx was not timely in reporting to smithfield foods.
moreover,the district court found the proposed amendments devoid of allegations that defendants consciously or recklessly failed to improve the company financial disclosure controls and procedures in response to the observations and recommendations made in the ellis report and deel memorandum.even in the context of winer other allegations,the ellis and deel documents did not give rise to a strong inference of scienter for the,statements because they were created long after the challenged filings on april,and may.neither document demonstrated the statements concerning pennexx ability to generate accurate financial information were false or misleading.accordingly,the district court held the proposed amendments failed to suggest defendants acted with scienter or that the challenged statements were false or misleading when made.the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding futility.
group pleading doctrine 
assuming winer can properly plead violations of rule,it contends the individual defendants are liable for misrepresentations and omissions based upon the group pleading doctrine.smithfield foods and the individual defendants were responsible for the accuracy of the public reports and releases detailed herein as group published information,and are therefore responsible and liable for the representations contained therein.specifically,winer asserts liability on the basis of the individual defendants access to,control over,and ability to edit and withhold dissemination of pennexx press releases and sec filings.in rejecting this argument,the district court held the group pleading doctrine did not survive the specific pleading requirements of the pslra.we agree.
the group pleading doctrine is a judicial presumption that statements in documents including annual reports and press releases are attributable to officers and directors who have control or involvement in regular company operations.under the doctrine,where defendants are insiders with such control or involvement,their specific connection to fraudulent statements in documents is unnecessary.see wool tandem computers,cir in cases of corporate fraud where the false or misleading information is conveyed in prospectuses,registration statements,annual reports,press releases,or other information,it is reasonable to presume that these are the collective actions of the officers.accordingly,the group pleading doctrine allows a plaintiff to plead that defendants made a misstatement or omission of a material fact without pleading particular facts associating the defendants to the alleged fraud.see thomas lee hazen,treatise on the law of securities regulation ed citing cases.
consistent with the purposes behind the pslra,congress expressly intended to substantially heighten the pleading requirements to reduce abuses in securities class action lawsuits.see in re advanta,at citing conf,at,reprinted in.to plead fraud in a private suit for damages,plaintiffs must specify each statement alleged to be misleading and specify the reasons the statement is misleading.b.for allegations based on information or belief,the pslra requires plaintiffs to state with particularity all facts forming the basis of the belief.id.each untrue statement or omission must be set forth with particularity as to the defendant and scienter must be pleaded in regards to each act or omission sufficient to support a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.b.
the pslra does not address group pleading,nor have we explicitly addressed the doctrine.in tellabs the supreme court recognized the disagreement among the courts of appeals as to whether the group pleading doctrine survived the pslra.tellabs.at.because the issue was not before it,the court did not disturb the court of appeals for the seventh circuit holding that the group pleading doctrine did not survive the enactment of the pslra.id.
winer contends it is untenable to require a plaintiff,at the pleading stage,to identify each individual involved in preparing public statements.but the pslra changed the pleading requirements in private securities actions.a presumption of particularity is inconsistent with the pslra requirement that scienter be pleaded with respect to each act or omission by the defendant.
