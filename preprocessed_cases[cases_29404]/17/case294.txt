allergan,a specialty pharmaceutical manufacturer,produces botox,a cosmetic and therapeutic drug.in,faced with allegations that it had acted illegally in marketing and labeling botox,allergan settled several qui tam suits and pled guilty in a criminal case.allergan ultimately paid a total of million in part for civil settlements and in part as a criminal fine.shortly afterward,plaintiffs,all allergan shareholders,filed a derivative action alleging that allergan directors are liable for violations of various state and federal laws,as well as for breaches of their fiduciary duties to allergan.plaintiffs did not,however,first make a demand on allergan board requesting that allergan bring the derivative claims in its own name.the district court dismissed their action on the ground that plaintiffs failed to allege particularized facts showing that demand was excused,as federal rule of civil procedure requires.in so doing,however,it misapplied governing delaware law and improperly drew inferences against plaintiffs rather than in their favor.we conclude that plaintiffs particularized allegations establish a reasonable doubt as to whether the board faces a substantial likelihood of liability and as to whether the board is protected by the business judgment rule.accordingly,we conclude that demand is excused and reverse the district court.
background 
defendant allergan,is a delaware corporation specializing in specialty pharmaceuticals and medical devices it manufactures botox,a purified toxin sold for cosmetic and therapeutic purposes when injected,botox produces a local and temporary reduction of muscle or gland activity.
from to,the fda approved botox for only a few indications crossed eyes,involuntary eyelid muscle contractions,involuntary neck muscle contractions,and excessive sweating although doctors may prescribe an approved pharmaceutical for purposes other than those listed on the label use and do so regularly federal law imposes numerous limits on drug manufacturers efforts to promote uses of their products.
in,a qui tam action was filed against allergan,alleging violations of the false claims act arising from marketing and branding of botox.that same year,the fbi opened an investigation into allergan marketing of botox.three years later,after two more qui tam actions had been filed,allergan,the united states,and the relators who had filed the qui tam actions entered into a settlement.under this deal,allergan agreed to pay million to the united states and various state governments and to enter into a corporate integrity agreement with the department of health and human services office of inspector general.later in,the united states filed a criminal information against allergan in the northern district of georgia,charging distribution of a misbranded in violation of the fdca.allergan pled guilty and agreed to pay a million fine.
in september,derivative suits against allergan were filed in the central district of california and the delaware court of chancery.ultimately,drawing on the fruits of a third party demand for books and records under delaware law,plaintiffs filed the first amended complaint,which is at issue here.plaintiffs allege that allergan board of directors knew about the limits on promotion of uses that the board was aware that violations of the federal marketing rules could result in significant penalties and that allergan nonetheless repeatedly violated federal laws and regulations from to,creating a number of programs to promote botox for uses,such as spasticity,pain,headaches,and migraines.
meanwhile,litigation proceeded apace in the court of chancery.in both courts,allergan moved to dismiss for failure to adequately allege demand futility.the district court issued its opinion on the demand futility issue first,dismissing the california case in january.it then denied a motion for reconsideration in february.
in june,in a detailed opinion,vice chancellor laster held in the delaware case that the plaintiffs had shown demand futility.see.mun.police emps.ret.pyott.ch.in his lengthy and thorough analysis of how delaware law applies to the issue of demand futility,vice chancellor laster expressly criticized and rejected the district court reasoning.id.at.on appeal,however,the delaware supreme court reversed vice chancellor laster solely on the ground that the delaware plaintiffs were collaterally estopped from pursuing their claims in the court of chancery due to the dismissal of the complaint in this case.see pyott.mun.police emps.ret.
plaintiffs allege that,from to,allergan created and expanded nearly a dozen programs designed to aggressively promote the sale of botox for purposes.plaintiffs elaborate that these programs were part of a concert of illegal conduct and that botox sales skyrocketed as a result.from to,for example,spasticity sales grew by,pain sales by,and headache sales by.by,allergan had over million in annual botox sales for therapeutic uses,of which to was attributable to indications.this was no small sum to allergan botox sales constituted to of total net sales across all product lines from to,and to of total specialty pharmaceutical sales from to.
here,we briefly summarize plaintiffs central allegations.
a.the headache development program 
at the direction of the board allergan aggressively promoted botox to treat several different types of headache conditions in addition to chronic headache for more than a decade,which caused botox sales for that indication to increase by over.even though headache treatment was an use until,and even though no evidence at the time proved that botox treated headaches in fact,nine out of ten clinical trials for headache had failed,starting in allergan sought out headache specialists and promoted botox to them as a treatment.that same year,while aware that headaches were not an fda approved indication for botox,the board saw a slide presentation that detailed allergan headache development program and tracked the prevalence of headache disorders.this fact shows the board awareness of major marketing at allergan in the early the same period in which sales of botox for headache treatment dramatically increased.
b.the cervical initiative cdhi 
cd is a rare disorder that affects only approximately americans.pursuant to the cdhi,allergan maximize d botox sales by encouraging doctors to diagnose headache and pain symptoms as symptoms of botox cd indication.allergan created this plan when clinical data did not support use of botox for headaches it was,in allergan words,a backup strategy to ensure continued expansion into the headache market.then,after the fda rejected a request from allergan to expand the botox label to cover pain,allergan launched a campaign to persuade doctors that cd is and that they should diagnose headaches and pain as mild cd to obtain reimbursement.this plan worked cd quickly became a main driver for botox sales.the board was briefed on strong botox sales resulting from allergan market program in a ceo report.
reimbursement support for off label uses of botox 
unlike most drugs,botox is a buy and bill drug,meaning that doctors buy it from allergan and assume the risk of on the back end.in the relevant time period,one vial of botox cost to and most uses of botox required one to four vials.as allergan recognized,growth in botox sales depended on doctors being reimbursed.
to promote use of botox,allergan doubled the size of its reimbursement support team in with the principal goal of minimizing customer barriers for botox bought to treat headaches,pain,and spasticity.it also established a hotline for doctors to call for help with reimbursement.plaintiffs allege that,t hrough the botox advantage program,allergan provided customized reimbursement support services to doctors expended millions of dollars each year to operate the botox reimbursement hotline,and performed detailed audits or interventions of physician billing records to demonstrate the value of botox to their practice.on average,accounts with such interventions grew six times faster than did other accounts.allergan provided doctors with materials designed to persuade payers to cover uses of botox,including treatment of headaches,and recruited physician advocates to lobby medicare and medicaid to expand coverage for use.plaintiffs allege that the board knew about the details and purpose of the botox advantage program.they allege,for example,that in the board reviewed several botox advantage promotional documents.the board also received multiple reports on reimbursement support as a crucial factor in botox sales.
intentional targeting of specialists practicing in off label fields 
plaintiffs allege that allergan promoted botox by targeting medical specialists who did not routinely treat patients with any of the conditions that botox was approved to treat.this strategy was crucial to growth in use of botox.in alone,for instance,allergan representatives called on thousands of doctors specializing in fields,including pain and headache specialists.allergan also undertook agreements with other companies to allow allergan sales representatives access to physicians specializing in fields.for example,in,allergan had no drug approved for the treatment of headache at the time but agreed to double another company sales force selling headache drugs so that allergan could then also sell botox to the neurologists who were customers of the other company.showed that allergan sought to sell more botox through this program.the board approved these agreements,several of which expressly contemplated of botox and migraine headache treatments.
with board approval,allergan also acquired other companies in order to obtain sales staffs with experience in specialties.for instance,allergan acquired espirit pharma for million in,allegedly to acquire sales staff who could promote botox for uses to urologists.when the board held a strategic planning session at which this acquisition was discussed,it heard the details of the strategic plan,updated to reflect the impact of espirit pharma,and that the successful launches of our planned new products such as new botox indications are critical to the success of our plan.
e.other allergan programs for promoting off label use of botox 
in addition to the programs discussed supra,plaintiffs allege that allergan developed an array of expensive and effective and unlawful schemes to promote use of botox.it instructed sales representatives to promote the message that botox works for uses,even when no clinical trials had proven the efficacy of botox as a treatment.it funded and controlled the content of hundreds of continuing medical education cme seminars,injection workshops,and promotional dinner programs at which paid speakers identified by the company as key opinion leaders advocated botox for indications.it created centers of excellence to create,edit,and control the substance of cmes that promoted botox for uses.it paid honoraria to high volume botox injectors to speak at cmes,and used millions of dollars of medical grants to reward top purchasers of botox.it hosted advisory boards at which it paid physicians each to listen to presentations about botox that covered topics.it created and funded an independent neurotoxin educational organization to promote uses of botox.in dealing with specialists,allergan developed customer team units ctus to coordinate sales initiative and marketing initiatives these ctus often included sales,medical affairs,reimbursement,marketing,and management staff.until january,the ctus met on a quarterly basis to exchange detailed data about doctors purchases of botox for use in selected geographic areas.
plaintiffs allege that the board of directors was involved in and aware of this wrongdoing at allergan.specifically,they allege that the board either adopted plans premised on illegal conduct or made a conscious decision not to take action even when faced with red flags of wrongdoing.plaintiffs support those claims with several dozen paragraphs of particularized allegations,emphasizing more broadly that the board actively oversaw the growth and sale of botox from to,as botox was one of its star products in that period.
starting in,allergan board discussed and approved a number of strategic plans that expressly depended on a significant and,critically,immediate increase in botox sales.the first such plan covered to and was adopted in.in a slide deck summary of the plan,the board described maximizing botox sales for spasticity,pain,and migraine,all uses,as a top corporate priority.the slide deck anticipated major growth in pain,migraine,and spasticity markets,and described botox as allergan fastest growing business with great est peak year sales of any product highest margin.the slide deck noted that the board anticipated fda approval of botox for treatment of pain,migraine,and spasticity four to five years later,in and,but nonetheless stated that a major increase in sales of botox for these uses represent ed immediate growth that could maximize botox now as part of an expansion strategy.
this anticipation of immediate and significant growth in sales of botox was reflected in the strategic plan itself.the plan sought to ensure that we can maximize our immediate opportunities in our core businesses,described botox as one of allergan five core businesses,and stated that botox has tremendous growth potential as we fund opportunities with new indications and uses such as spasticity,pain,migraine and tension headache.the plan emphasized in its discussion of botox that the combined value of the global pain and migraine headache markets would exceed billion by,and that i nvestments in botox sales for new indications of pain and migraine headache represents two of the top three future growth opportunities in our portfolio with combined peak year sales of billion.thus,even when the board admittedly did not anticipate fda approval for any of these indications for at least four years,and a full thirteen years before the fda actually approved of any of these indications,the board embraced a strategic plan expressly premised on immediate and significant expansion of botox sales for the indications of spasticity,pain,headache,and migraines.this anticipated expansion in sales,the board concluded,represented one of allergan most important opportunities for immediate profit.
the board closely and continuously monitored botox sales for on and indications through.at a meeting in,for example,the focus for and beyond was on projects that included botox headache and botox urology both of which involved only sales and were discussed well after the board original expectation of several fda approvals in and had come to naught.in,the board discussed and then authorized continued funding for nominally independent organizations that supported the use of botox for acute and chronic pain.in,still focused on the market for botox,the board adopted a strategic plan in which it described successful launches of our planned new products such as botox as critical to the success of our plan.at that meeting,the board also discussed key assumptions relating to the acquisition of espirit pharma an acquisition that,according to plaintiffs,was designed mainly to afford botox sales representatives access to specialists who practiced in fields.the board discussion of the key assumptions of that acquisition,we may therefore reasonably infer at this stage in the litigation,included allergan plan to use the sales staff to engage in aggressive marketing.
even as the board understood that growth of botox sales for uses was critical to allergan success,and even as the board made growth of such sales a top corporate priority,the board was presented with information indicating a direct link between allergan botox promotions and rates of sales.the strategic plan,for example,explicitly noted a connection between sales staff and sales growth it stated that in allergan added new nmcs sales representatives spasticity grew and in it added new nmcs spasticity est imated.the strategic plan also noted a link between promotion and sales it projected further declines in sales of botox for pain treatment specifically because there would be no promotion for that use.in this regard,the strategic plan echoed a similar conclusion from the strategic planning process,which had concluded that sales for pain,headache,and spasticity had been negatively affected by a decrease in calls to pain doctors ped iatricians.it is reasonable to infer from these allegations that the board knew that allergan sales and marketing efforts drove the substantial increases in sales of botox from.
finally,plaintiffs argue that the board was alerted to unlawful conduct at allergan by a series of fda letters,and by several complaints from physicians and employees.from to,allergan received several letters from the fda concerning 
august,an fda warning letter cautioned that allergan botox promotional activities and materials were misleading and lacking in fair balance within the meaning of the fdac.this letter cited five prior fda letters raising similar concerns,and described the violations noted in this letter as continuing examples of violative promotion or advertising materials disseminated by allergan.
september,an fda warning letter cautioned allergan about misleading statements in botox promotional materials.
june,an fda warning letter cautioned that several of allergan advertisements are false misleading because they falsely identify botox as a cosmetic treatment,fail to reveal material facts about the product use,and minimize the risk information presented.
september,and the schim incident the fda sent a letter to allergan director of advertising and promotional compliance,concerning a presentation by jack schim on behalf of allergan at which schim promoted use of botox as a headache treatment.the letter requested information about allergan relationship with schim and its cme program material.an investigation in which several board members were involved discovered that schim had used the relevant slides at eight dinners over the prior twelve months.allergan ultimately took remedial measures to address schim unlawful conduct.nonetheless,schim remained one of allergan highest paid consultants,speakers,and grant recipients through.
in addition to these fda warning letters most of which concerned only general misconduct in the branding and promotion of botox the board was also made aware of several complaints by physicians about marketing,many of them arising from the schim incident.in the board discussed an ethics complaint by an employee who stated that she was resigning after only six weeks at allergan due to concerns about its marketing program.
discussion 
as required by precedent,we review for abuse of discretion the district court ruling dismissing this shareholder derivative suit on the ground of failure to show demand futility.see,potter hughes,cir in re silicon graphics.sec,cir.although plaintiffs urge us to apply a de novo standard,the authorities that they cite,all of which criticize the abuse of discretion standard,are not intervening,controlling precedents that would compel us to depart from potter and in re silicon graphics.see blue br.at citing israni bittman,app x,cir,and laborers int l union of am.bailey,app x,cir see miller gammie,cir en banc accordingly,we follow potter and in re silicon graphics and review the opinion below for abuse of discretion.

a shareholder seeking to vindicate the interests of a corporation through a derivative suit must first demand action from the corporation directors or plead with particularity the reasons why such demand would have been futile.in re silicon graphics,at citing.the purpose of this demand requirement in a derivative suit is to implement the basic principle of corporate governance that the decisions of a corporation including the decision to initiate litigation should be made by the board of directors or the majority of shareholders.in re pfizer.derivative,d,quoting kamen,at.
although rule supplies the pleading standard for assessing allegations of demand futility,t he substantive law which determines whether demand is,in fact,futile is provided by the state of incorporation of the entity on whose behalf the plaintiff is seeking relief.scalisi fund asset,cir.allergan is a delaware corporation and delaware law therefore applies 
in delaware,a shareholder who declines to make a demand on the board of directors may not bring a derivative action until he has demonstrated,with particularity,the reasons why demand would be futile.khanna mcminn,civ.nc,wl,at.ch.may,internal quotation marks omitted.f utility is gauged by the circumstances existing at the commencement of a derivative suit and concerns the board of directors sitting at the time the complaint is filed.in re am.int l.derivative,d,alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted,aff app x cir.demand futility must be decided by the trial court on a basis and not by any rote and inelastic criteria.id.quotation marks omitted.plaintiffs are entitled to all reasonable factual inferences that logically flow from the particularized facts alleged,but conclusory allegations are not considered as expressly pleaded facts or factual inferences.brehm eisner.
in this case,plaintiffs identify two overlapping grounds that excuse their obligation to make a demand on allergan board.first,they allege that the board decided to pursue a business plan premised on unlawful conduct.second,they allege that the board remained consciously inactive despite actual or constructive knowledge of wrongdoing at allergan.each of these asserted grounds for demand futility finds stable footing in delaware corporate law.
when a shareholder challenges a decision of a board of directors,delaware law provides a,disjunctive test for demand futility 
the first prong of the futility rubric is whether,under the particularized facts alleged,a reasonable doubt is created that the directors are disinterested and independent.the second prong is whether the pleading creates a reasonable doubt that the challenged transaction was otherwise the product of a valid exercise of business judgment.these prongs are in the disjunctive.therefore,if either prong is satisfied,demand is excused.
id.at citing aronson lewis.this is often called the aronson test.
under aronson first prong,a director interest may be shown by demonstrating a potential personal benefit or detriment to the director as a result of the decision.in re goldman sachs,civ,wl,at.ch,alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.for that reason,d irectors who are sued have a disabling interest for demand purposes when the potential for liability may rise to a substantial likelihood.ryan gifford.ch internal quotation marks omitted accord rattner bidzos,civ,wl,at.ch,a substantial likelihood of personal liability prevents a director from impartially considering a demand.internal quotation marks omitted.to meet that standard when presented with a motion to dismiss under rule,plaintiffs must make a threshold showing,through the allegation of particularized facts,that their claims have some merit.rales blasband.
under aronson second prong,the question is whether the pleading creates a reasonable doubt that the challenged transaction was the product of a valid exercise of business judgment.brehm,at.the good faith business decisions of informed,disinterested,and independent directors of delaware corporations are entitled to deference under the business judgment standard of review.hamilton partners,highland capital,civ.vcn,wl,at.ch.may.nonetheless,in rare cases a transaction may be so egregious on its face that board approval can not meet the test of business judgment.aronson,at.these rare cases include those in which a board decides to undertake illegal activity.see,in re massey energy,civ.vcs,wl,at.ch.may,delaware law does not charter law breakers a fiduciary of a delaware corporation can not be loyal to a delaware corporation by knowingly causing it to seek profit by violating the law.metro commc.bvi advanced mobilecomm techs.ch a fiduciary may not choose to manage an entity in an illegal fashion,even if the fiduciary believes that the illegal activity will result in profits.
while aronson applies to board decisions,the applicable framework is less settled for claims that demand is excused on the ground that a board remained consciously inactive when it knew or should have known about illegal conduct.that doctrinal uncertainty is reflected here whereas plaintiffs insist that their conscious inaction claims are subject to aronson analysis,allergan maintains that those claims invoke the theory of oversight liability set forth in in re caremark int l.derivative.ch demand futility for caremark claims is tested under rales blasband,a d,not aronson.rales requires plaintiffs to allege particularized facts establishing a reason to doubt that the board of directors could have properly exercised its independent and disinterested business judgment in responding to a demand.wood baum,quoting rales,at.
here,however,it does not matter whether aronson or rales applies.under either approach,demand is excused if plaintiffs particularized allegations create a reasonable doubt as to whether a majority of the board of directors faces a substantial likelihood of personal liability for breaching the duty of loyalty.see,in re saic.derivative,d,t he difference between rales and aronson may blur in cases like this one,since the particularized allegations essential to creating reasonable doubt as to a substantial likelihood of personal liability for breach of fiduciary duties may also implicate the question whether the board can avail itself of business judgment protections,aff sub nom.welch havenstein,app x cir guttman huang.ch when there are allegations that a majority of the board that must consider a demand acted wrongfully,the rales test sensibly addresses concerns similar to aronson.to wit,if the directors face a substantial likelihood of personal liability,their ability to consider a demand impartially is compromised under rales,excusing demand.the duty of loyalty,in turn,is violated w here directors fail to act in the face of a known duty to act,thereby demonstrating a conscious disregard for their responsibilities and failing to discharge the fiduciary duty of loyalty in good faith.stone ex rel.amsouth bancorporation ritter.in this case,plaintiffs allege precisely that kind of violation of the directors duties.
to summarize plaintiffs claim that the board decided to pursue a plan premised on illegal conduct is subject to aronson analysis.if plaintiffs have made sufficient particularized allegations in support of this claim,demand is excused under both aronson prongs,as the board would face a substantial likelihood of liability for violating the duty of loyalty and would have lost business judgment protection for undertaking illegal conduct.plaintiffs claim that the board knew or should have known about illegal conduct and made a conscious choice to turn a blind eye can be characterized either as a oversight claim or as an aronson type allegation of considered board action.we need not decide which characterization of plaintiffs allegations is correct because,either way,demand is excused if plaintiffs particularized allegations create a reasonable doubt as to whether a majority of the allergan board faces a substantial likelihood of liability for failing to act in the face of a known duty to act.
turning to the particularized factual allegations before us,we agree with vice chancellor lasker of the delaware court of chancery,who considered a complaint,that demand is excused.see.mun.police emps.ret.pyott.ch.because plaintiffs allegations that the board deliberately adopted a plan premised on illegal conduct in many respects builds off the comparatively more modest claim of conscious inaction,we first discuss conscious inaction.
conscious inaction 
plaintiffs allege that the board either knew or,due to a series of red flags,should have known,about allergan promotion of botox this claim essentially turns on whether plaintiffs have adequately alleged scienter.see,rahbari.oros,d,desimone barrows.ch guttman,at.if a majority of the board had actual or constructive knowledge of violations of the law at allergan involving promotions of botox and did nothing,it violated its duty of loyalty and faces a substantial likelihood of liability.see stone,at.
plaintiffs factual allegations tell a story that begins in with board approval of the strategic plan.that year,even as it anticipated that botox approval for pain,migraine,and spasticity would not occur for at least four or five years,the board adopted a plan that described maximizing sales for these uses as a top corporate priority,opportunity for immediate growth,and a means to maximize botox now.notably,the strategic plan contemplated a increase in botox sales in north america from million to million,a growth fueled mainly by sales for uses.the plan noted tremendous growth potential for spasticity,pain,migraine and tension headache sales of botox,carefully reviewed the market for headache and pain treatments,and,most strikingly,described investments in botox sales for pain and migraine headache as two of the top three future growth opportunities in our portfolio.it can be reasonably inferred from this strategic plan that the board was intensely interested in sales of botox,saw sales of botox as a critical driver of growth for allergan over the upcoming years,and planned on very closely monitoring botox sales.it can also be inferred that the board was aware that pain,headache,spasticity,and migraine were all uses,but nonetheless wanted to achieve major growth well before fda approval.over the next years,that is precisely what happened due mainly to a continuing series of illegal allergan programs,sales of botox skyrocketed.
of course,as allergan observes,it is entirely possible for sales to increase on their own,without any illegal promotion by a drug manufacturer.in fact,such increases occur all the time,spurred by developments and discussions within the medical community.for that reason,the bare facts of the board hunger for higher sales and an ultimate increase in those sales do not suffice to show conscious inaction on the part of the board.see,king baldino,d.but contrary to allergan insistence that this case reduces solely to that correlation,plaintiffs offer a battery of particularized factual allegations that strongly support an inference at this stage of the litigation that the board knew of and did nothing about illegal activity.
first,plaintiffs allege with particularity that the board continued to closely and regularly monitor botox sales.in,the board focused its attention on projects related to the sale of botox to treat headaches and urological problems.then,in,it discussed and decided to continue funding for organizations under allergan control that publicly championed the use of botox to treat pain.in,the board emphasized that botox is critical to the success of our strategic plan and discussed key assumptions related to the acquisition of espirit pharma,a company that was allegedly purchased mainly to afford botox sales representatives access to specialists who would prescribe botox for purposes.we can and at this stage,must reasonably infer that the board discussion of these matters afforded its members a view of allergan illegal conduct.
the board also took a particular interest in some of the specific allergan sales programs that plaintiffs describe as a key part of allergan wrongdoing.in,for example,the board saw a slide show that detailed allergan creation of a headache development program and tracked the prevalence of headache disorders.the board,which already knew that nine out of ten clinical trials of botox for headache treatment had failed and that fda approval was nowhere in sight,thus learned in that allergan was launching a major program to treat headaches.the board also learned that the core team involved in the headache development program included a member of allergan global strategic marketing division.then,in,the board reviewed several promotional documents for the botox advantage program,a program that provided detailed support to physicians seeking reimbursement for uses of botox and created a hotline for such assistance,all in an attempt to circumvent reimbursement rules governing uses of botox.in,the board received a ceo report on allergan cdhi program,which was allegedly created after clinical tests for headaches failed in order to persuade doctors to prescribe botox for purposes headaches while reporting an diagnosis of cervical dystonia,even though cd is a rare disorder.finally,in and,the board approved and acquisition agreements that were allegedly designed mainly to facilitate illegal promotion of botox by sales representatives familiar with specialists in fields.these allegations and the inferences that reasonably follow from them are anything but conclusory.accepted as true for purposes of this appeal,they show that allergan board closely monitored botox sales and repeatedly discussed or authorized programs even after learning that those programs involved the same illegal conduct for which allergan was ultimately fined and punished.
second,even as it carefully monitored allergan botox programs and determined that growth of botox sales was critical to achieving desired profit margins,the board received data directly linking allergan sales programs to fluctuations in sales.in,for example,it learned that sales for pain,headache,and spasticity were heavily affected by allergan programs that involved phone calls to pain specialists and pediatricians.in,it projected a decline in sales of botox for pain treatment due to the absence of allergan promotion for that use.the strategic plan,in turn,identified an even clearer connection between allergan programs and sales growth,stating that the addition of new sales representatives in was accompanied by a increase in spasticity sales,and that the addition of representatives in was accompanied by an estimated increase in spasticity sales.
this is exactly the kind of correlation more allergan promotions for use matching up precisely with more sales,and fewer allergan promotions for use matching a drop in sales that qualifies as a red flag of illegal promotions.see mccall scott,cir concluding that it would be just as reasonable for experienced directors to see a suspicious correlation as a sign of possible improper billing activities as it would be for them to see it as the norm,and that their indifference to that correlation supported liability.whereas allergan argues that the board could have viewed the increase in botox sales as the natural operation of the medical community,at this stage of the case we must make reasonable inferences for plaintiffs,not against them and it is reasonable to infer that the data repeatedly presented to allergan board linking allergan programs to fluctuations in sales support a finding of scienter.
third,the board received repeated fda warnings about illegal promotion of botox.to be sure,many of these warnings concerned only misbranding and other violations of the law,not the specific promotions at issue here.only one of the warning letters,in fact,specifically addressed promotion,though it is striking that even after learning of the schim incident in that letter,allergan kept schim as one of its consultants and advocates.nonetheless,these letters also constituted a red flag,waved nearly every year for five straight years,that allergan was breaking federal law in its promotion of botox.given how carefully the board was monitoring botox sales,its relative inaction in the face of these repeated fda warnings supports a finding of liability.see in re abbott labs.derivative,cir excusing demand and emphasizing that even though two fda warning letters contained mere boilerplate language,continuing violations of federal regulations over a period of six years can not be minimized.moreover,this is not a case where the fda warnings dealt with unrelated programs or lacked any other connection to the relevant illegal conduct.see saic,d at.rather this is a case in which one of the fda letters directly concerned promotions and the parade of other fda letters addressed issues immediately parallel to the promotions at the heart of the allegations in this lawsuit.
closely related to the fda warnings,an employee resigned after filing an ethics complaint in charging allergan sales division with improper promotions.although plaintiffs do not allege that this ethics issue was specifically about botox,there is no evidence that the board responded to it by investigating wrongdoing.as vice chancellor lamb has remarked,a claim that an audit committee or board had notice of serious misconduct and simply failed to investigate,for example,would survive a motion to dismiss,even if the committee or board was well constituted and was otherwise functioning.david shaev profit sharing account armstrong,civ.n,wl,at.ch.
fourth,the illegal conduct in this case involved one of the most important drugs at allergan one that was repeatedly identified as crucial by the board itself,which described sales of botox as a top corporate priority and as two of the top three future growth opportunities in our portfolio.in demand futility cases,courts have repeatedly emphasized that it is especially plausible to infer board interest in and knowledge of developments relating to a product that is critical to a company success or is otherwise of special importance to it.see,in re biopure.derivative,d,in re veeco instruments.sec,d,in re keyspan.sec,d.
finally,the illegal conduct was unquestionably of significant magnitude and duration.it persisted for over a decade,involved several divisions at allergan,and constituted nearly a dozen separate programs,all related to one of allergan most important and widely known therapeutic drugs.the combination of widespread and enduring illegality in allergan corporate activity strongly supports an inference of board knowledge and intentional disregard.see saic,d at pfizer,d at yeeco.at in re oxford health plans.
taking all of these allegations together,we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in determining that they do not create a reasonable inference of conscious inaction.it would be surprising,to say the least,if such significant,continuing,and diverse breaches of fda regulations in relation to a star product at allergan passed unnoticed by the board for so long,even as the board carefully monitored sales,repeatedly discussed and authorized a number of the allegedly illegal programs,and built strategic plans around botox sales.
we also note that we find persuasive delaware vice chancellor lasker explanation in the virtually identical allergan case in 
the plaintiffs in this case have alleged a direct connection between the board and a business plan premised on illegal activity.the complaint pleads that from onward,the board discussed and approved a series of annual strategic plans that contemplated expanding botox sales dramatically within geographic areas that encompassed the united states.the plans contemplated new markets for botox that involved applications that were uses in the united states.so significant was the scope of the expansion that it necessarily contemplated marketing and promoting uses within the united states.the board then closely monitored allergan dramatic success in increasing its sales of botox at rates far exceeding what the market for existing uses could support or that could be generated by physicians serendipitously learning about and trying new applications.the board kept allergan business plan in place even after the schim incident and fda inquiries illustrated the extent of allergan regulatory exposure.
mun.police,at 
the district court reached the contrary conclusion mainly on the grounds that plaintiffs failed to allege evidence of a decision by board members to promote marketing,failed to connect promotion programs such as the headache development program to botox or any prohibited marketing,and failed to account for the fact that the board maintained formal compliance policies.in analyzing plaintiffs allegations,however,the district court committed a number of errors,and thereby abused its discretion.
first,it considered the factual allegations in isolation from each other rather than in combination,even though in cases like this one an inference of board involvement or knowledge may depend on a combination of factual allegations.see,mccall,at saic,d at yeeco,d at.second,it repeatedly drew inferences in the board favor,crediting allergan reasonable interpretations of the factual allegations over plaintiffs reasonable interpretations of those same allegations see,westmoreland cnty.emp.ret.parkinson,cir t he district court focus on other hypothetical explanations for the defendants conduct improperly ignores the rule that any inferences reasonably drawn from the factual allegations of the complaint must be viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.quoting abbott,at brehm,at.finally,the district court essentially insisted on a smoking gun of board knowledge,even though precedent holds that plaintiffs can show demand futility by alleging particular facts that support an inference of conscious inaction see brehm,at.
ultimately,this case is in important respects like abbott labs,pfizer,and westmoreland all cases in which particularized allegations made plausible an inference that the directors at issue had remained consciously inactive in the face of wrongdoing at their companies.see westmoreland,at finding demand to be excused where the complaint alleged not only that the company directors consciously flouted fda regulations,but also that the directors knowingly steered the company on a course that was all but certain to prompt the fda to take enforcement action under a consent decree abbott,at we find that six years of noncompliance,inspections,warning letters,and notice in the press,all of which then resulted in the largest civil fine ever imposed by the fda and the destruction and suspension of products which accounted for approximately million in corporate assets,indicate that the directors decision to not act was not made in good faith and was contrary to the best interests of the company.pfizer,d at excusing demand where a fair reading of the particularized allegations of the complaint is that the defendants,at a minimum,knew of a high probability that pfizer was continuing to purposely promote marketing and deliberately decided to let it continue by blinding themselves to that knowledge.to be sure,there are noteworthy differences between those cases and this one.for example,in several of those cases the companies had already been sanctioned by the fda,whereas here the board had merely received a number of warning letters relating to allergan marketing of botox.what all of these cases have in common with this one,however,is that,given the combination of facts alleged,delaware law required a reasonable inference of scienter and thus conscious inaction on the part of the board,at least for purposes of a motion on the pleadings.
adoption of a plan premised on illegal conduct 
having concluded that we must reverse with respect to plaintiffs conscious inaction argument,we only briefly address plaintiffs alternative argument that demand is excused on the ground that allergan board of directors knowingly adopted a business plan premised on illegal promotions of botox.
much like their conscious inaction argument,plaintiffs argument on this point begins with the strategic plan and proceeds through the other allegations recited supra.here,though,plaintiffs make the comparatively bolder claim that allergan conduct is reasonably interpreted as the predictable unfolding of a effort to massively boost botox sales while pushing too hard on regulatory limits.thus,in plaintiffs view,it can reasonably be inferred that the red flags of illegal conduct that actually or constructively alerted the board to wrongdoing were not signs that the marketing team had gone off the rails.rather,they were welcome indicators that a massive,push for sales of botox was going according to plan.
we conclude that,at the pleading stage of this case,this is a reasonable inference from the particular facts alleged and that the district court abused its discretion in concluding that it is not.
allergan and the district court make much of the fact that plaintiffs do not allege that the board formalized or recorded any decision to break the law.they also emphasize that allergan did,as one would expect of a major pharmaceutical company,maintain some formal policies prohibiting promotion of drugs.on their view,these facts render implausible the inference that plaintiffs have asked us to draw from the particularized facts alleged.
these arguments,however,overstate what the law requires of plaintiffs arguing that demand is excused.see.mun.police,at a plaintiff does not have to point to actual confessions of illegality by defendant directors to survive a rule motion particularly at the pleadings stage,a court can draw the inference of wrongful conduct when supported by particularized allegations of fact.for example,an inference that the board decided to break the law can be drawn even without a document stating,we all going to go promote botox now and do so in a way that violate the fda regulations.so long as plaintiffs particularized allegations give rise to a reasonable doubt that a majority of the directors adopted a plan premised on illegal marketing of botox,and therefore face a substantial likelihood of liability for breaching their duty of loyalty,demand is excused.
applied here,that standard requires reversal.as vice chancellor lasker persuasively explained in his opinion in the delaware case 
it is not unreasonable to infer that the allergan board,led by a ceo who earned the nickname botox,could have believed that allergan knew better than the fda which botox applications were safe,particularly uses already approved or at least permitted in other countries.it is not unreasonable to infer that the board and ceo saw the distinction between selling and marketing as a source of legal risk to be managed,rather than a boundary to be avoided.based on this premise,the ceo and his management team devised,and the board approved,a business plan that relied on activities,confident that the risk of regulatory detection was low,that most regulatory problems could be solved,and that dealing with regulatory risk was a cost of doing business.as profits increased and the regulatory risk seemed well managed,the extent of activities grew.the appearance of formal compliance cloaked the reality of,and directors who understood the difference between legal sales and illegal marketing continued to approve and oversee business plans that depended on illegal activity.see massey energy,wl,at crediting inference that outside directors went through the motions rather than making good faith efforts to ensure that the company cleaned up its act.
mun.police,at.
vice chancellor lasker analysis complements the analysis of conscious inaction set forth supra.as alleged by plaintiffs,this is a board that adopted a strategic plan in expressly predicated on massive,immediate growth in sales of botox for indications that even the board did not believe would be approved by the fda until that continued to depend on increased sales over the next decade that carefully monitored botox in meetings and reports,and that took an especially keen interest in uses that heard numerous presentations on some of allergan illegal promotions that approved deals and acquisitions intended mainly to facilitate promotion that received a stream of fda warning letters about improper botox marketing,one of which expressly involved promotions that heard from at least one employee about unethical marketing and that heard information at several points expressly linking allergan expansive marketing programs to fluctuations in the number of sales of botox.
when these allegations are examined together,certainly it is plausible to conclude that they reveal a board committed to very aggressive promotion of of its most important products,highest corporate priorities,and most promising sources of revenue.and certainly it is plausible t
