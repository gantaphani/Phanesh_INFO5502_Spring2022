in this shareholder derivative action,plaintiffs thomas auletta,barbara bencosme,and phillip miller trust collectively plaintiffs appeal the district court dismissal of their complaint for failing to allege,with adequate particularity,that a demand would be futile,and the district court denial of their rule b motion for relief from the judgment.because the district court neither erred in dismissing plaintiffs complaint nor abused its discretion in denying plaintiffs motion for relief,we affirm the district court decisions in their entirety.
background 
plaintiffs brought suit on behalf of nominal defendant ferro corporation ferro against ferro vice president and chief financial officer,thomas gannon,ferro vice president of performance chemicals,dale kramer,and the individual members of ferro board of directors board,namely,hector ortino,michael bulkin,michael mee,william sharp,alberto weisser,sandra austin crayton,jennie hwang,william lawrence,dennis sullivan,and padmassree warrior collectively defendants 
ferro,an ohio corporation,produces performance materials for a broad range of manufacturers,which serve diverse markets worldwide.in fiscal year fy,ferro reported sales of billion.from april to april,ferro announced quarterly increases in sales over preceding years.during this time period,however,ferro performance chemicals segment,including its polymer additives business,suffered due to low demand and high raw material costs.in february,defendant ortino announced that ferro had successfully implemented price increases to offset the increasing costs of raw materials and substantially reduced costs and discretionary spending.in april,ferro reported a revenue increase for first quarter compared to first quarter.in the performance chemicals division,ferro reported an revenue increase,which it attributed to increased demand and pricing.
in july,ferro unexpectedly announced that it would have to lower its earnings expectations for second quarter by more than due to inappropriate accounting entries.ferro shortfall resulted largely from the poor performance of its polymer additives business,requiring ferro to take a charge to earnings to remedy the inappropriate accounting entries.ferro discovered the accounting entries through an internal investigation and stated that it had engaged independent legal counsel jones day and independent auditors ernst young to investigate the accounting entries.
in early august,plaintiffs auletta and bencosme filed separate shareholder derivative suits in federal court against ferro board and its vice president and chief financial officer,raising breach of fiduciary duty,abuse of control,gross mismanagement,waste of corporate assets,and unjust enrichment claims.about a month later,plaintiffs wietschner and phillip miller trust filed separate shareholder derivative suits in state court against ferro board and its vice president and chief financial officer,alleging breach of fiduciary duty based upon defendants failure to comply with federal securities regulations.the state suits were removed to federal court on the basis of federal question jurisdiction.none of the plaintiffs made a demand on the board before filing suit.
a day after the state suits were filed,on september,ferro issued a press release revealing that the securities exchange commission sec had also initiated an investigation into the inappropriate accounting entries.then,in november,ferro announced that it would restructure the polymer additives business,at a cost of million.
the independent investigation undertaken by jones day and ernst young revealed that the accounting irregularities dated back to and extended beyond the polymer additives business.initially,ferro concluded that the irregularities stemmed from the actions of a single employee,but the investigation later identified additional likely instances and sources of inappropriate accounting.in january,ferro disclosed that it would restate its financial statements and its first quarter financial statements.
in april,ferro announced that its auditor,kpmg,could not conclude that the independent investigation by jones day and ernst young was adequate for its purposes.instead of proceeding with the investigation or initiating a new one,ferro audit committee decided to engage an independent firm specializing in investigations to review the original investigative team procedures and conclusions.
on july,plaintiffs submitted an amended consolidated complaint,raising essentially the same claims presented in their individual suits,violations of the act of and breach of fiduciary duty,abuse of control,gross mismanagement,waste of corporate assets,and unjust enrichment claims.defendants filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs complaint pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,asserting,inter alia,that plaintiffs did not have standing to bring a derivative action because they did not first make a demand on ferro,nor did plaintiffs sufficiently allege that their failure to make a demand was excused because a demand would have been futile.the district court dismissed plaintiffs case,without prejudice,and plaintiffs filed a motion for relief from judgment under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure essentially asking the district court to reopen the case,permit them to conduct limited discovery on the issue of futility of a demand,and then,depending on the fruits of the discovery,submit an amended complaint to the court.the district court denied plaintiffs motion.plaintiffs timely appealed both the dismissal of their complaint and denial of their rule b motion.
ii.jurisdiction 
we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to.where the district court dismisses an action without prejudice,the order is final and appealable.robert clemens trust morgan stanley dw,cir quoting sanford motts,cir alteration omitted.a dismissal of the complaint,however,is ordinarily a,nonappealable order since amendment would generally be available.mobley mccormick,cir.here,because the district court dismissed plaintiffs action and not just the complaint,we have jurisdiction to consider this appeal.
iii.analysis 
we review de novo the district court dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.daubenmire city of columbus,cir see also ass of cleveland fire fighters city of cleveland,cir.when determining whether to grant a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b,the district court must accept as true all the allegations contained in the complaint and construe the complaint liberally in favor of the plaintiff.kottmyer maas,cir.a district court need not,however,accept as true legal conclusions or unwarranted factual inferences.id.
in a shareholder derivative action,federal rule of the federal rules of civil procedure requires that the plaintiff allege with particularity the reasons for failing to make a demand.mccall scott,cir.even when the derivative claims are brought under federal law,we apply the substantive law of the state of incorporation,here ohio,to determine whether plaintiffs failure to make a demand is excused.id.t he supreme court made clear in kamen kemper financial services,d,that whether the failure to make a demand is excused must be determined under the substantive law of the state of incorporation.ohio rules of civil procedure and federal rule contain the same requirement 
in a derivative action brought by one or more legal or equitable owners of shares to enforce a right of a corporation,the corporation having failed to enforce a right which may properly be asserted by it,t he complaint shall also allege with particularity the efforts,if any,made by the plaintiff to obtain the action he desires from the directors and,if necessary,from the shareholders and the reasons for his failure to obtain the action or for not making the effort.
ohio civ.emphasis added.if plaintiffs do not comply with the requirements of rule,they do not have standing to bring suit.see davis dcb fin,d,citing grand council of ohio owens,ohio app d,ohio.
in ohio,the directors of a corporation are charged with the responsibility of making decisions on behalf of the corporation and are the proper parties to bring a suit on behalf of the corporation or,in their business judgment,to forego a lawsuit.drage proctor gamble,ohio app d,ohio.under ohio law,it is presumed that any action taken by a director on behalf of the corporation is taken in good faith and for the benefit of the corporation.id.citing ohio c emphasis added.because the board of directors has the primary authority to file a lawsuit on behalf of the corporation,the shareholders may make a demand on the directors to bring a suit on behalf of the corporation,but no shareholder has an independent right to bring suit unless the board refuses to do so and that refusal is wrongful,fraudulent or arbitrary,or is the result of bad faith or bias on the part of the directors.id.
the demand requirement is essentially a requirement that the shareholder exhaust his or her intracorporate remedies before going to court with a derivative suit.the corporate management must be given the first opportunity to institute the litigation since,as a general principle,the responsibility for determining whether a corporation should use the courts to enforce a cause of action is,like other business questions,ordinarily a matter of internal management left to the discretion of the directors.

ohio recognizes an exception to the general demand rule,which permits a shareholder to proceed with an independent suit without making a demand when the shareholder can demonstrate that the demand would have been futile.id.plaintiffs carry the burden of showing that the directors can not exercise independent,unbiased judgment when determining whether to sue themselves.id.at.
futility means that the directors minds are closed to argument and that they can not properly exercise their business judgment in determining whether the suit should be filed.id.at citation and internal punctuation omitted.ohio law presumes that directors can make an unbiased,independent business judgment about whether it would be in the corporation best interests to sue some or all of the other directors.thus,courts have consistently rejected the idea that demand is always futile when the directors are targeted as the wrongdoers in the suit the shareholders wish the corporation to bring.drage,at.
merely alleging futility will not suffice rather,in accordance with rule,plaintiff must state with particularity the reasons for circumventing the demand requirement.granada,dwg,internal citations omitted.that is,the plaintiff must point to facts which show that the presumed ability of the directors to make unbiased,independent business judgments about whether it would be in the corporation best interests to file the action does not exist in this case.davis,d at citing drage,at emphasis added.broad,generalized and conditional statements do not constitute facts pleaded with particularity.in re xcel energy.
ohio courts have found a demand presumptively futile where the directors are antagonistic,adversely interested,or involved in the transactions attacked.bonacci ohio highway express,wl at,ohio app.lexis,at ohio.july,internal punctuation and citation omitted.likewise,for example,a demand may also be excused when all directors are named as wrongdoers and defendants in a suit,when there is by the directors such that the directors gain directly from the challenged transactions,or when there is domination of nondefendant directors by the defendant directors.carlson,at.
here,the bulk of plaintiffs allegations of futility could apply to any board of directors at any corporation.in essence,and despite plaintiffs efforts to package their allegations otherwise,they assert that a demand would have been futile because the directors do not want to sue themselves or expose themselves to liability in order to,for example,protect their compensation packages,to curtail their exposure to liability,to prevent a suit against their friends and colleagues.and as the district court correctly held,in ohio,a bare allegation that the directors would not want to sue themselves or each other does not show that demand would be futile.drage,at.
the district court did find that plaintiffs established that a demand would be futile as to three members of the board ortino,because he allegedly committed insider trading,and weisser and mee,because these men had specialized financial expertise and should have been able to monitor ferro financial records for accuracy and fairness.demonstrating futility as to three board members out of ten,however,does not establish futility as to the board.mccall,at in the context of determining demand futility the issue is whether the particularized factual allegations are sufficient to create doubt about the disinterestedness and independence of a majority of the directors.emphasis added.
on appeal,plaintiffs raise a number of arguments.first,plaintiffs argue that the district court applied the wrong standard to determine whether the complaint presented particularized allegations excusing a demand.plaintiffs assert that they are required to allege with particularity facts that would create only a reasonable certainty that a majority of the defendant board members are not independent or disinterested with respect to the subject matter of the suit.emphasis added.plaintiffs,however,cite to only one ohio case where an ohio court applied a reasonable certainty standard.see jensen republic steel,wl,ohio law abs.ohio.based on our review of ohio case law,we think it is safe to say that jensen is the only ohio case that applies the reasonable certainty standard.moreover,jensen federal rule and ohio rule.the district court did not err in looking to more recent,published ohio court of appeals decisions for guidance on how to determine whether plaintiffs sufficiently alleged futility.
second,plaintiffs argue that the district court required them to prove,establish or demonstrate futility and that this was a higher than necessary burden.plaintiffs argument is without merit.regardless of how the district court characterized the futility requirement,it did no more than apply federal rule and ohio rule,both of which require plaintiffs to plead,with sufficient particularity,factual allegations that provide some sort of indication that a demand should be excused here because it would have been futile.
third,plaintiffs assert that the district court failed to consider their allegations in the light most favorable to them.specifically,plaintiffs insist that the facts and reasonable inferences therefrom establish a pattern of conduct by ferro to downplay and the true extent of the accounting problems and their impact on the company financial performance.plaintiffs argue that the district court ignored the following facts 
defendant ortino july,announcement that inappropriate accounting in the polymer additives business would cause the company to take a second quarter charge 
ferro and ortino follow up assurances on september,that the investigation was over and that all inappropriate accounting entries were corrected 
ferro january,update to its completed investigation that the company would need to restate financial information from,and the first quarter of,and its admission that it had only recently spoken to the alleged wrongdoer six months after first admitting accounting problems 
ferro april,announcement that investigators had now interviewed more than former and current employees contrary to ferro representations that only one employee was responsible for the accounting irregularities and had identified additional instances of inappropriate accounting 
kpmg statement on april,that despite the findings and conclusion of the independent investigation,kpmg was unable to conclude that the investigation was adequate for its purposes the audit committee rejection of kpmg recommendation that ferro hire another independent investigation team to further investigate transactions and the audit committee decision to a hire a new investigation team merely to review the actions of the original independent investigation team and not continue to investigate.
