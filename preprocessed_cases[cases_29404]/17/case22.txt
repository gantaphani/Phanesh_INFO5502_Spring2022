this is an appeal from a preliminary injunction and related orders granted to the plaintiffs in their action.the effect is to freeze pendente lite certain funds,now in the hands of third parties the defendants,due to one or more of the other defendants who owe,or are alleged to owe,money judgments to the plaintiffs.the background is complicated and involves proceedings in several different courts.we begin with a summary.
benistar property exchange trust company,is a delaware corporation that held itself out as an escrow agent for persons seeking to perform,property exchanges pursuant to.these transactions achieved tax benefits but required that certain funds be held in escrow for a period benistar property fulfilled this escrow role.the plaintiffs now appellees in this court,whom we will call the creditors,are former benistar property clients.
in,the creditors filed suit in massachusetts state court alleging that benistar property martin paley,its president daniel carpenter,its chairman and sole shareholder and several others had breached contractual and fiduciary duties by losing escrowed funds in options trading rather than holding the funds in safer,liquid accounts as promised after a trial,the defendants in that case were found liable,and enhanced damages and attorneys fees were awarded under.laws.ch.see cahaly benistar prop.exch.trust,cert.denied.the final we refer to as the cahaly judgement was for approximately million,of which only a portion has been paid.
in september,the massachusetts state court pierced the corporate veil and extended liability to five additional corporate entities controlled by carpenter benistar admin services,benistar employer services trust,benistar,carpenter financial group,llc,and property exchange.in so doing,the court found that carpenter owned each of the entities either by himself or with his wife,molly that carpenter exercised control over all entities that assets were intermingled and that the entities were and failed to observe corporate formalities.
a second law suit now enters the picture frame.in april,a suit the koresko litigation was brought against john koresko and several entities owned by him by two companies engaged as sponsors of welfare benefit plans,step plan services,and benistar plan services,and their common president,wayne bursey,and two other benistar entities,one of admin a party in the earlier cahaly litigation,and one of insurance group,not.the outcome was a settlement from koresko insurers travelers insurance company and certain underwriters at lloyds,london in the amount of roughly million 
in late,the creditors,holding their unsatisfied cahaly judgment,brought suit in massachusetts state court to reach and apply money that the two insurance companies had agreed to pay on behalf of the koresko entities to settle the litigation against them.the state court granted a temporary restraining order at the creditors request enjoining the distribution of any settlement proceeds by either of the defendants this case,the third law suit which is now before us,was thereafter removed to federal district court.
in the district court,the defendants were the insurance companies the other defendants were the plaintiffs in the koresko litigation other than bursey and the judgment debtors in the cahaly litigation.after removal,the defendants other than the insurance companies filed motions to dismiss or transfer venue.rather than granting the motion,the district court temporarily extended the state court tro,thereafter held a hearing on the creditors request for a preliminary injunction,and,on november,granted a preliminary injunction tracking the restraining order.
in granting the required a bond from the court found that step is likely abusing the corporate form,and a substantial risk that,unless enjoined,the benistar defendants will dissipate or conceal the assets gained from the koresko litigation settlement.the court also ordered the creditors to seek clarification from the state court in the cahaly case to confirm that the cahaly judgment did not preclude enforcing the judgment against new alter egos of the original defendants 
the litigation before the district court has proliferated.the creditors have sought to establish alter ego status for the koresko plaintiffs who were not already subject to the cahaly judgment.the insurance companies filed claims of their own in the district court the benistar defendants claimed against the creditors and the insurance companies and also asserted numerous defenses and arguments for dismissal.it appears that there are also proceedings in the koresko case to enforce the settlement.see generally iantosca benistar admin,wl,at.july.
the case is now in a holding pattern while awaiting clarification by the massachusetts superior court,and the preliminary injunctions effect is to preserve funds in the hands of the insurance companies pending disposition of the claims in this case.the preliminary injunction granted by the district court in november was extended in may,motions to vacate and reconsider were denied,and the present step plan and benistar plan.
a preliminary injunction is appealable but review is deferential as to the weighing of considerations under the familiar test.bl a ck tea soc y city of boston,cir although there are exceptions,usually the injunction requires the movant to show likelihood of success,new comm wireless,sprintcom,cir,and two of the arguments offered by step plan and benistar plan contest the district court finding of such a likelihood.
the first of these arguments is that the creditors should have been precluded from bringing claims against the two appellants to make them liable under the cahaly judgment,because the judgment itself prejudice,appellants claims against jane doe affiliates and subsidiaries of the benistar defendants.the relevant portion of the judgment reads as follows 
the claims of all plaintiffs against the defendants jane doe affiliates and subsidiaries of benistar defendants and jane doe entities controlled by daniel carpenter 
that judgment enter against all the plaintiffs and in favor of the defendants jane doe affiliates and subsidiaries of benistar defendants and jane doe entities controlled by daniel carpenter on all the plaintiffs claims against these defendants,and that all such claims be dismissed.
given their ties to other benistar entities,the appellants argue that they qualify as jane does under the judgment that the all such claims be dismissed language applies to them and resolves such claims with prejudice that the creditors claims against them are res judicata and that the creditors are thus unlikely to prevail on the merits of their action,rendering the preliminary injunction erroneous.
the district court disagreed.while requiring the creditors to seek clarification in the state court a request that is still pending,it concluded that the cahaly judgment language was not intended to foreclose prospectively plaintiffs ability to enforce that judgment against an entity later determined to be an alter ego of benistar property and accordingly declined to construe its ambiguous language in that fashion.step plan and benistar plan now say that this determination is reversible error.
res judicata,in its claim preclusion aspect,is intended to prevent the of claims already litigated or that should have been litigated in an earlier action in its issue preclusion aspect,it prevents with qualifications of issues earlier decided even if the subsequent case involves a different claim.in re sonus networks,cir.in considering the preclusive effect of a massachusetts judgment,we look to massachusetts law.mulrain bd.of selectmen,cir.
the inclusion of jane does in the cahaly complaint likely reflected an expectation that,through discovery or otherwise,other participants in the wrongdoing might be identified or other benistar companies with alter ego status made liable.but neither of the current appellants liability nor their alter ego status was actually tried in cahaly and found in the appellants favor.one of the two appellants had not even been acquired by the benistar interests until after the cahaly litigati
