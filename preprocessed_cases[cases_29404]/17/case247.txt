this appeal stems from a civil action brought by appellee barry jewell against appellant the united states the irs seeking a refund of his pro rata share of a tax sanction paid in conjunction with a closing agreement between his former law firm and the irs.on appeal,the irs challenges the decisions of the district court denying the irs motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of standing and granting jewell summary judgment on his claim that the irs procured a closing agreement with jewell by fraud or malfeasance.the irs argues that jewell lacked standing to challenge the closing agreement because the agreement was entered with jewell law firm,and,even if jewell had standing,the district court improperly concluded that the undisputed facts showed that the irs had used fraud or malfeasance in procuring the agreement.we have jurisdiction under,and we reverse.
background 
jewell was a shareholder in the law firm of jewell,moser,fletcher holleman,jmfh.jmfh sponsored four prototype retirement plans,which its clients,mostly small businesses,relied upon to create individual retirement plans.as the plans sponsor,jmfh had an obligation to ensure that its prototype plans complied with federal law and its clients amended their individual plans to comply with changes in federal law.see.
after congress passed a series of laws that affected the retirement plans,the irs required a sponsor to ensure that individual client plans were amended in accordance with the new laws by february,or the last day of the first beginning on or after january,whichever was later.see.but if a sponsor submitted an amended prototype plan for irs approval by december,the irs extended the deadline for amendments made to individual plans to the later of september,or the last day of the twelfth month after the date on which the irs approved the prototype plan.see.
jmfh submitted its four amended prototype plans to the irs on february.because jmfh failed to submit the prototype plans by december,the individual plans that relied on the prototype plans were not able to receive the extension.id.as a result,jmfh had to ensure that its four prototype plans and all of its clients individual plans complied with the new federal laws by,as relevant here,february.but during the summer and fall of,the irs requested that jmfh make several changes to its plans to bring them in compliance with the changes in federal law.thus,these individual plans,the irs argued,were untimely and potentially subject to disqualification or other penalties.
meanwhile,in july,one of jmfh shareholders scott fletcher left the firm.the remaining shareholders jmfh president keith moser,john holleman,and jewell redeemed fletcher interest in the firm and continued to practice together until the end of august.in a september letter,jewell informed the irs that jmfh will stay in existence under my control and will continue to act as the sponsor of the prototype retirement plans.
in may,the irs determined that more than sixty of the individual plans sponsored by jmfh were not timely amended to comply with changes in federal law.the irs proposed that jmfh enter into an umbrella closing agreement,in which it would deem the plans timely amended and jmfh would pay a penalty.jewell,although signaling his willingness to enter into a closing agreement,disputed the nature of the plans deficiencies in a series of letters sent in the summer of.for its part,the irs indicated that jmfh had two options negotiate an umbrella closing agreement with the irs to resolve all of the deficiencies or decline to do so,which would result in the irs review of each contingency that would likely result in plan disqualification or additional penalties.negotiations between the irs and jewell as a representative of jmfh continued through the summer and fall of.
in june,jewell sought judicial dissolution of jmfh in arkansas state court and an accounting of the firm receivables in december,moser,jmfh president,sent the irs a signed form power of attorney and declaration of representative,which authorized only moser and fletcher to represent jmfh before the irs.in a letter that accompanied the power of attorney,moser stated that jmfh had not yet been dissolved,that jewell was not authorized to represent the firm,and that the firm would continue to sponsor the plans.
later that month,moser and fletcher agreed that jmfh would pay one third of the irs initial settlement settle with the irs.in return,the irs would determine that the plans were timely amended.the closing agreement contains a finality provision in accordance with,which provides that the agreement is final and conclusive except that the matter may be reopened in the event of fraud,malfeasance,or misrepresentation of material fact.moser and fletcher signed the closing agreement and returned the closing agreement to the irs.jewell did not sign the agreement.moser,fletcher,and jewell divided the sanction equally,bundled three checks made out to the irs,and sent the checks to the irs.
after unsuccessfully filing a claim for a refund with the irs,jewell filed this action in june against the irs,seeking a refund of,his pro rata share of jmfh payment under the closing agreement.jewell argued that the irs had obtained the closing agreement through fraud,malfeasance,or misrepresentation of fact.the irs moved to dismiss on the ground that jewell lacked standing.the district court denied the motion,holding that because jmfh had stopped operating and jewell had paid the sanction out of personal funds,jewell had incurred direct harm and thus had standing to sue.
after the parties for summary judgment,the district court granted jewell motion and denied the government motion.the district court held that the irs tactics in procuring the closing agreement qualified as fraud or malfeasance and therefore justified setting the agreement aside.specifically,the district court concluded that the irs presented jmfh with a hobson choice in that the irs demanded that jmfh either accept the closing agreement and pay a penalty or subject its clients to individual plan evaluations as late amenders,submitting them to the harsh consequences of disqualification,penalty,or both.the district court also held that the deficiencies in the plans were either insignificant or should have been excused because of jewell good faith attempts to comply with the spirit of the changes to federal law,and ordered judgment to jewell in the amount of plus interest.this appeal follows.
ii.discussion 
the irs contends that the district court improperly concluded that jewell had standing to challenge the propriety of the irs closing agreement with jmfh.we review the district court conclusion that a plaintiff has standing de novo.paul area chamber of commerce gaertner,cir.
a plaintiff must establish subject matter jurisdiction,for which standing is a prerequisite.see jones gale,cir.standing includes both a constitutional and a prudential component.am.ass of orthodontists yellow book usa,cir.the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing consists of three elements.see lujan defenders of wildlife,d.first,a party must have suffered an injury in fact,an actual or imminent concrete and particularized invasion to a legally protected interest second,the injury must be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and third,the injury must be redressable by a favorable decision.gale,at.
even if a plaintiff meets the minimal constitutional requirements for standing,there are prudential limits on a court exercise of jurisdiction.ben oehrleins sons daughter,hennepin county,cir.one such prudential limitation is the requirement that a litigant must assert his or her own legal rights and interest,and can not rest a claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.powers ohio,d.
here,the irs argues that b ecause jmfh is the entity from which the irs collected the sanction,it is the only proper entity to bring suit seeking to set aside the closing agreement and to recover the payment.as a result,jewell does not have standing because he has not satisfied the prudential standing requirement that a litigant may generally assert only his own rights.we find this argument to be persuasive.
this court has stated that s tanding to sue for a tax refund extends only to the taxpayer from whom the tax was allegedly wrongfully collected.murray united states,cir collins united states,in order to maintain an action for the refund of taxes under the internal revenue code,the plaintiff must be the taxpayer who has overpaid his own taxes.emphasis added.here,it is undisputed that the irs imposed the tax sanction against jmfh,not against the principals of the law firm individually.it is also undisputed that the closing agreement,signed by jmfh authorized representative,was between the irs and jmfh.
even though jewell ultimately contributed personal funds to jmfh effort to pay the tax sanction,jewel cites no authority for the proposition that this fact,standing alone,gives him standing to sue.we agree with the irs that the fact that each of the principals of jmfh agreed to contribute of the sanction is simply irrelevant here.to the extent that any party was entitled to sue,jmfh is the appropriate party to raise its alleged injury as a result of the irs conduct and the record contains no evidence that jewell obtained jmfh causes of action as part of the distribution of the firm assets.because jewell was not the taxpayer from whom the tax was collected,he can not raise the rights of jmfh against the irs.accordingly,he lacks standing to sue the irs for a refund.see murray,at fed.a shareholder can not bring a refund suit for taxes paid on behalf of a corporation if the shareholder is not legally or contractually obligated to pay the corporate taxes.
jewell makes two arguments in support of his contention that he has standing.we find each to be unpersuasive.first,jewell asserts that he,not jmfh,was the sponsor of the prototype plans,and,therefore,he has standing to sue the irs.this argument is without merit,as jewell has cited no authority for the proposition that being the sponsor of an prototype retirement plan automatically confers standing to sue for a tax refund.even were we to so hold,jmfh sponsored the plans at issue,as demonstrated by the closing agreement and by jewell own repeated assurances to the irs that jmfh continued to act as the sponsor of the plans.
second,jewell argues that the district court correctly held that he suffered a separate and distinct harm from the harm suffered by jmfh,and,therefore,he should be entitled to assert shareholder standing to sue.we disagree.
it is well established that a shareholder or officer of a corporation can not recover for legal injuries suffered by the corporation.see heart of am.grain inspection,missouri dep t of,cir.but a shareholder may bring a direct suit when he asserts an injury separate and distinct from that suffered by other shareholders.taha engstrand,cir.here,even assuming that the irs caused jewell to be injured in a legally cognizable way,the injury that jewell suffered is indistinguishable from the injury suffered by jmfh as an organization.moreover,if we were to accept jewell argument,personal financial loss alone would become the touchstone for shareholder standing.as we have noted elsewhere,actions to enforce corporate rights can not be maintained by a stockholder in his own name even though the injury to the corporation may incidentally result in the stockholder financial loss.potthoff morin,cir.
iii.conclusion 
accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the district court.because we conclude that jewell does not have standing to bring this suit,we need not reach the irs alternative argument.
because i believe the conclusions of the district court should be affirmed,i respectfully dissent.
the first issue on appeal is whether jewell had standing to bring his claim for a tax refund.as the majority correctly points out,the prudential limits of standing generally require plaintiffs to demonstrate they are asserting their own rights,and not the rights of a third party.see powers ohio,d.this is equally true with respect to suits by corporate officers and shareholders.see franchise tax bd.alcan aluminium,d.equitable restrictions prohibit shareholders from bringing suit solely to enforce the rights of a corporation or to recover for injuries sustained by the corporation.id.what the majority fails to embrace is jewell claim falls squarely within a recognized exception to this equitable restriction.this exception permits a shareholder with a direct,personal interest in a cause of action to bring suit even if the corporation rights are also implicated.id.arkansas courts have repeatedly held a shareholder may bring a direct suit against a third party where the shareholder asserts a direct injury which is separate and distinct from the harm caused to the corporation.see,hames cravens.
an analysis of the unique facts in this case shows jewell had standing.on december,the circuit court of pulaski county,arkansas,determined jmfh had effectively dissolved as of july,the last date upon which business of jmfh could have regularly been conducted.upon the july dissolution,the shareholders individually took possession of the corporation assets.as the district court found,jmfh had undergone a de facto dissolution and distribution long before moser and fletcher signed the irs closing agreement in january.as a result,jewell was forced to pay of the jmfh penalty with his own funds,for which jewell was not reimbursed,nor could he be reimbursed,by the defunct corporation.the irs admitted knowing jmfh was no longer in business,and of the sanction would be paid by fletcher law firm and of the sanction would be paid by jmfh with jewell contributing,under protest.
it is true murray united states,cir,says only the taxpayer from whom the tax was allegedly wrongfully collected has standing to sue for a refund.contrary to the majority conclusion,the was,in fact,collected from jewell,not from jmfh.moreover,the was not a tax.jewell payment was a sanction or penalty relating directly to jewell conduct in filing the amended plans.
the irs also threatened not to join the settlement agreement if jewell did not cooperate by keeping his clients in the settlement,and personally contributing to the penalty payment.the irs informed moser the closing agreement was an all or nothing deal and if jewell did not go along,then jewell had the potential of being sued by moser and fletcher clients.in the irs answer to jewell complaint,the irs admitted the settlement agreement was structured as a blanket agreement that necessarily extended to all individual plans adopted by jmfh clients and was not limited only to plan clients of one stockholder.the irs further acknowledged jewell informed the irs of jewell opposition to the settlement agreement and the payment of any sanction.
the irs is authorized under a to enter into an agreement with any person relating to the liability of such person respecting a tax liability.jewell was such a person.based upon the facts of this case,jewell did sustain a direct injury separate and distinct from any injury sustained by the extinct jmfh,and jewell had standing to file suit for a tax refund.
malfeasance 
upon finding standing,the court should consider the second issue on appeal whether the district court erred in holding the closing agreement was procured by the irs through fraud,misrepresentation,or malfeasance.we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment.see hawkeye life ins.avis indus,cir.summary judgment is proper only if the record,viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,presents no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see also.c.under b,a closing agreement may only be set aside if either party can demonstrate the existence of fraud,malfeasance,or misrepresentation of a material fact.
between and,congress passed several pieces of legislation,collectively referred to as gust,which impacted the retirement plans sponsored by jmfh.see.this legislation required several specific provisions to be included in jmfh retirement plans for those plans to gain or retain qualified status for favorable tax treatment.see b.the deadline for these plan changes
