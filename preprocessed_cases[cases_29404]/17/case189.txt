plaintiffs southland securities corporation,jeffrey fielkow,rick taylor,william wares,ron rumpler,and william white plaintiffs appeal the district court dismissal,pursuant to.b and the private securities litigation reform act pslra,of their securities fraud complaint.we affirm in part and reverse in part and remand 
background 
inspire insurance solutions,inspire,the corporate defendant in this case,provided policy and claims administration to the property and casualty insurance industry and offered outsourcing and software services.in this class action,the defendants are inspire millers mutual fire insurance company,allegedly the original parent corporation and largest shareholder of inspire see note above george dunham dunham,the president,ceo and chairman of the board of inspire during the class period ronald lynn lynn,executive vice president and cio during the class period terry gaines gaines,executive vice president,cfo,and treasurer during the class period robert agazzi agazzi,executive vice president of software and systems during the class period jeffrey robinson robinson,executive vice president of outsourcing and later president and coo during the class period and william smith smith,president and coo from may,to january,collectively defendants.inspire was established in as a wholly owned subsidiary of millers,and remained such until august when millers spun it off through an initial public offering ipo of million shares,millers retaining percent of inspire outstanding shares.plaintiffs generally contend that defendants engaged in a fraudulent scheme to deceive investors about the company performance for the purpose of inflating the price of inspire stock for their own financial benefit.the proposed plaintiff class consisted of all those who acquired inspire common stock between january,and october.
the plaintiffs second amended complaint complaint,from the dismissal of which this appeal is taken,alleges that the defendants committed securities fraud by knowingly,or with severe recklessness,touting inspire software products and contracts despite the software critical flaws issuing inaccurate earnings and revenue estimates and violating generally accepted accounting principles gaap by failing to timely classify receivables as uncollectible,improperly capitalizing software development costs,and failing to write down goodwill associated with purchases of software assets.the plaintiffs allege these misleading statements were made in statements,press releases,and other corporate documents,and relied upon by analysts in their reports.the plaintiffs further allege defendants made stock sales based on insider information,pointing to these sales as evidence of scienter.the plaintiffs seek to recover damages on behalf of all persons who acquired inspire stock between january,and october.
on december,the plaintiffs,on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated,filed their original complaint against the defendants.this case was consolidated with substantially identical suits subsequently filed by other plaintiffs.on june,the plaintiffs filed their consolidated amended complaint.on august,the defendants filed motions to dismiss the plaintiffs consolidated amended complaint,which motions were granted by the court on march.in that dismissal order,the court found that,because the plaintiffs consolidated amended complaint had failed to plead fraud with particularity and improperly relied on the group pleading doctrine in lodging allegations against the defendants collectively,the plaintiffs did not meet the pleading requirements established by.b and the private securities litigation reform act pslra.the court held that the plaintiffs must plead with sufficient particularity wrongdoing and scienter as to each defendant individually.the court also found the plaintiffs failed to allege facts supporting an inference that the statements cited in the consolidated amended complaint were made with actual knowledge that they were false or misleading.
the court gave the plaintiffs an opportunity to amend their complaint.they filed their second amended complaint on may.the defendants filed responsive motions to dismiss.the plaintiffs asserted claims under section b of the securities exchange act of and rule of the securities and exchange commission sec,as modified by the pslra,codified in relevant part at and,against all of the defendants except millers.the plaintiffs also asserted claims under section a of the securities act,a,which provides for liability,against inspire,millers,and dunham.

securities exchange act and pslra 
section b of the securities exchange act provides in relevant part 
it shall be unlawful for any person,directly or indirectly 
b to use or employ,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the securities and exchange commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.b.
rule provides in relevant part 
it shall be unlawful for any person,directly or indirectly 
b to make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading 
in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.
the pslra speaks to the requirements of a securities law class action complaint as follows 
b requirements for securities fraud actions 
misleading statements and omissions 
in any private action arising under this chapter in which the plaintiff alleges that the defendant 
a made an untrue statement of a material fact or 
b omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances in which they were made,not misleading the complaint shall specify each statement alleged to have been misleading,the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading,and,if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief,the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.
required state of mind 
in any private action arising under this chapter in which the plaintiff may recover money damages only on proof that the defendant acted with a particular state of mind,the complaint shall,with respect to each act or omission alleged to violate this chapter,state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.
motion to dismiss stay of discovery 
a dismissal for failure to meet pleading requirements 
in any private action arising under this chapter,the court shall,on the motion of any defendant,dismiss the complaint if the requirements of paragraphs and are not met.b.
federal rule of civil procedure b likewise requires the plaintiffs in securities fraud causes to plead with particularity the circumstances constituting the alleged fraud.to satisfy rule b pleading requirements,the plaintiffs must specify the statements contended to be fraudulent,identify the speaker,state when and where the statements were made,and explain why the statements were fraudulent.williams wmx technologies,cir,cert.denied,d.to state a claim under section b,and rule,plaintiffs must plead a misstatement or omission of a material fact made with scienter on which the plaintiffs relied and that proximately caused the plaintiffs injuries.id.at.a fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that,under all the circumstances,the omitted fact would have assumed actual significance in the deliberations of the reasonable shareholder.grigsby cmi,cir quoting tsc industries,northway,d.materiality depends on the significance the reasonable investor would place on the withheld or misrepresented information.basic levinson,d.
a complaint can be,even prolix,without pleading with particularity.indeed,such a garrulous style is not an uncommon mask for an absence of detail.williams,at.this court has noted that although the requirement for particularity in pleading fraud does not lend itself to refinement,and it need not in order to make sense,nevertheless,directly put,the who,what,when,and where must be laid out before access to the discovery process is granted.abc arbitrage plaintiffs group tchuruk,cir quotations omitted.in securities fraud suits,this heightened pleading standard provides defendants with fair notice of the plaintiffs claims,protects defendants from harm to their reputation and goodwill,reduces the number of strike suits,and prevents plaintiffs from filing baseless claims and then attempting to discover unknown wrongs.tuchman dsc communications,cir.
the pslra reinforces the particularity requirements of rule b,requiring the plaintiffs to state not only the time,place,the identity of the speaker,and the content of the alleged misrepresentation,but also to explain why the challenged statement or omission is false or misleading.williams,at the pslra also requires that the complaint with respect to each act or omission alleged to be false or misleading state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.b emphasis added.
group pleading 
this court has not heretofore considered whether to recognize the group pleading or group published doctrine.this doctrine allows plaintiffs to rely on a presumption that statements in prospectuses,registration statements,annual reports,press releases,or other information,are the collective work of those individuals with direct involvement in the everyday business of the company.in re oxford health plans,quoting in re stratosphere.securities,d,danis usn communications,d.
where the misstatements appear in certain types of documents that plaintiffs believe were written by groups,some courts have allowed plaintiffs to link certain defendants to alleged misrepresentations simply by pleading that the defendants were part of the group that likely put the challenged documents together.in re.sec,d,in re worlds of wonder sec.instead of being required to plead that a defendant actually made,authored or approved an offending statement in a corporate communication,the group pleading doctrine in its broadest form allows unattributed corporate statements to be charged to one or more individual defendants based solely on their corporate titles.under this doctrine,the plaintiff need not allege any facts demonstrating an individual defendant participation in the particular communication containing the misstatement or omission where the defendants are insiders or affiliates of the company.in re.sec,d at.therefore,the group pleading doctrine as so applied would allow the plaintiff to plead the first element of a section b case against an individual defendant without citing particular facts connecting the defendant to the alleged fraud.
congress did not include group pleading in any provision of the securities act.see william fisher,do call me a securities law groupie the rise and possible demise of the group pleading protocol in cases,bus.law.the ninth and second circuits have largely pioneered this doctrine.in wool tandem computers,cir,the ninth circuit fashioned the group pleading doctrine,holding 
in cases of corporate fraud where the false or misleading information is conveyed in prospectuses,registration statements,annual reports,press releases,or other information,it is reasonable to presume that these are the collective actions of the officers.under such circumstances,a plaintiff fulfills the particularity requirement of rule b by pleading the misrepresentations with particularity and where possible the roles of the individual defendants in the misrepresentations.id.at citation omitted emphasis added 
courts have differed as to whether the group pleading doctrine,assuming its existence prior to the pslra,survives that legislation.the pslra requires first,that the complaint must specify each statement alleged to have been misleading,and the reason or reasons why that statement is misleading.b.second,as to allegations made upon information and belief,the complaint must state with particularity all facts on which the belief is formed.id.finally,as to each allegedly misleading statement,the complaint must state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.b emphasis added.
several courts have held that,largely because the pslra does not explicitly make reference to the group pleading doctrine,it does not abolish it.in re smartalk teleservices.sec,d,in re baan.sec,d,in re oxford health plans.sec,in re sunbeam sec,d,in re bankamerica.sec,d,zuckerman foxmeyer health,d,robertson strassner,d.however,several other courts have found that the pslra effectively abolished the group pleading doctrine.schoenfeld asset mgmt.llc cendant,d,coates heartland wireless,d,allison brooktree,chu sabratek,d.
significantly,this court has never adopted the group pleading doctrine,even before the pslra.while the pslra does not explicitly abolish the doctrine,it was not necessary to do so because congress never made this judicial creation law to begin with.even prior to the pslra,section b and rule required plaintiffs to identify the roles of the individual defendants,and describe their involvement,if any,in preparing the misleading statements.in re mdc holdings sec.even if this court were to conclude that the group pleading doctrine existed in the absence of the pslra,it can not withstand the pslra specific requirement that the untrue statements or omissions be set forth with particularity as to the defendant and that scienter be pleaded with regard to each act or omission sufficient to give rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.b.these pslra references to the defendant may only reasonably be understood to mean each defendant in multiple defendant cases,as it is inconceivable that congress intended liability of any defendants to depend on whether they were all sued in a single action or were each sued alone in several separate actions.the court in allison noted 
t o permit a judicial presumption as to particularity simply can not be reconciled with the statutory mandate that plaintiffs must plead specific facts as to each act or omission by the defendant.the group published doctrine permits an inference of wrongdoing not based on defendant conduct,but based solely on defendant status as an officer or director of a corporation.allison.at.
the group pleading doctrine conflicts with the scienter requirement of the pslra because,even if a corporate officer position supports a reasonable inference that he likely would be negligent in not being involved in the preparation of a document or aware of its contents,the pslra state of mind requirement is severe recklessness or actual knowledge.
therefore,we agree with the district court that the pslra requires the plaintiffs to distinguish among those they sue and enlighten each defendant as to his or her particular part in the alleged fraud.as such,corporate officers may not be held responsible for unattributed corporate statements solely on the basis of their titles,even if their general level of involvement in the corporation affairs is pleaded.however,corporate documents that have no stated author or statements within documents not attributed to any individual may be charged to one or more corporate officers provided specific factual allegations link the individual to the statement at issue.such specific facts tying a corporate officer to a statement would include a signature on the document or particular factual allegations explaining the individual involvement in the formulation of either the entire document,or that specific portion of the document,containing the statement.various unattributed statements within documents may be charged to different individuals,and specific facts may tie more than one individual to the same statement.and,the corporation itself may be treated as making press releases and public statements issued by authorized officers on its behalf,and statements made by its authorized officers to further the interests of the corporation.
consistent with our rejection of the group pleading doctrine,we do not construe allegations contained in the complaint against the defendants as a group as properly imputable to any particular individual defendant unless the connection between the individual defendant and the allegedly fraudulent statement is specifically pleaded.while the plaintiffs aver in paragraph of the complaint that the individual defendants each controlled the contents of and participated in writing inspire sec filings,reports and releases,this conclusory allegation fails to specify which of these documents is attributable to each individual defendant,let alone which portions or statements within these documents are assignable to each individual defendant.
corporate defendant 
respecting the potential section b liability of inspire itself,however,as all of the individual defendants were executive officers of inspire whose actions were intended to benefit inspire,we will treat as having been made by inspire the particular complained of statements in the sec filings,reports and releases issued in its name.statements attributed to individual defendants are also treated as having been made by inspire,as all of them appear from the face of the complaint to have been made pursuant to their positions of authority within the company.
nevertheless,liability under rule b requires not only that the party make a statement which contains an untrue statement of material fact or omits a material fact necessary in order to make the statement not misleading,but also that the party have done so with not merely simple or even inexcusable negligence but rather with scienter meaning an intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud or that severe recklessness in which the danger of misleading buyers or sellers is either known to the defendant or is so obvious that the defendant must have been aware of it.broad rockwell int l,cir en banc.for purposes of determining whether a statement made by the corporation was made by it with the requisite rule b scienter we believe it appropriate to look to the state of mind of the individual corporate official or officials who make or issue the statement or order or approve it or its making or issuance,or who furnish information or language for inclusion therein,or the like rather than generally to the collective knowledge of all the corporation officers and employees acquired in the course of their employment see,nordstrom,chubb son,cir there is no case law supporting an independent collective scienter theory in re apple computer.securities litigation,d.it is not enough to establish fraud on the part of a corporation that one corporate officer makes a false statement that another knows to be false.a defendant corporation is deemed to have the requisite scienter for fraud only if the individual corporate officer making the statement has the requisite level of scienter,knows that the statement is false,or is at least deliberately reckless as to its falsity,at the time he or she makes the statement,citing nordstrom this is consistent with the general common law rule that where,as in fraud,an essentially subjective state of mind is an element of a cause of action also involving some sort of conduct,such as a misrepresentation,the required state of mind must actually exist in the individual making or being a cause of the making of the misrepresentation,and may not simply be imputed to that individual on general principles of agency see restatement,agency,comment b comment see,also,woodmont,daniels,cir while in some cases,a corporation may be held constructively responsible for the composite knowledge of all of its agents,whether acting in unison or not citations we are unwilling to apply the rule to fix liability where,as here,intent is an essential ingredient of tort liability as for deceit.see restatement,agency,comment b gutter dupont de nemours,d,the knowledge necessary to form the requisite fraudulent intent must be possessed by at least one agent and can not be inferred and imputed to a corporation based on disconnected facts known by different agents,citing,inter alia,woodmont first equity standard poor,aff,cir while a corporation may be charged with the collective knowledge of its employees,it does not follow that the corporation may be deemed to have a culpable state of mind when that state of mind is possessed by no single employee.a corporation can be held to have a particular state of mind only when that state of mind is possessed by a single individual united states lbs york,although a corporate defendant is considered to have acquired the collective knowledge of its employees citations,specific intent can not be aggregated similarly,citing first equity,and its last above quoted sentence.
the complaint does not assert that any particular individual inspire director,officer or employee,other than the named individual defendants,acted with scienter in or respecting the making or issuing of any of the complained of statements or in ordering or approving any of such statements or furnishing information or language for inclusion therein or omission therefrom,or the like or indeed in any other respect.accordingly,for purposes of evaluating whether the complaint states with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that inspire had the requisite an intent to deceive,manipulate or defraud or equivalent severe any of the complained of statements,it is only necessary for us to address the allegations claimed to adequately show such state of mind on the part of the individual defendants.
insider sales 
as supportive of their scienter claims,plaintiffs allege diverse inspire stock sales by the individual defendants,stating that together they sold over million shares of inspire stock during the entire class period for proceeds totaling approximately million complaint.with respect to the requirement that particular facts be pled which give rise to a strong inference of scienter,allegations of insider trading are essentially a form of motive and opportunity allegations.see,in re comshare.securities litigation,cir allegations that the individual defendants did profit by selling many of their shares at artificially inflated prices during the class period largely tend to illustrate that defendants had the motive and opportunity to commit securities fraud.and,we have stated that our court requires more than allegations of motive and opportunity to withstand dismissal.goldstein mci worldcom,cir.nevertheless,we have also recognized that appropriate allegations of motive and opportunity may meaningfully enhance the strength of the inference of scienter.nathenson,at.however,this is true of insider trading only when in suspicious amounts or at suspicious times.abrams baker hughes,cir.see also in re silicon graphics.securities litigation,cir insider trading is suspicious only when dramatically out of line with prior trading practices at times calculated to maximize the personal benefit from undisclosed inside information,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
based on their january holdings,the plaintiffs allege that during the entire class period agazzi sold percent of his shares,dunham percent,gaines percent,lynn percent,and robinson percent.complaint.the plaintiffs allege three periods of insider sales march,july,and november.plaintiffs do not expressly allege in the complaint that the sales were suspicious in timing or amount and therefore suggestive of scienter,although they do allege that the defendants profit ed from the artificial inflation of inspire stock price their violation of law had created before inspire stock price crashed complaint,
the march sales occurred during the company secondary public offering.on march,inspire filed its prospectus and registration statement and made its secondary public offering covering shares owned by it and shares owned by then selling shareholders.on march,dunham sold shares,accounting for percent of his january holdings.on march,lynn also sold shares,representing percent of his holdings,while robinson sold shares,which amounts to percent of his holdings.while not insubstantial,these sales do not raise a strong inference of scienter for several reasons.first,the plaintiffs do not allege that officer or director sales during a secondary public offering are unusual.the price of inspire stock on march,was,significantly less than its eventual high of over reached in november it traded at or above from november through november.furthermore,following the allegedly misleading february sul america contract announcement,inspire stock rose from on february to on february it had been as high as on february it traded as low as in early march and over from march through march but the defendants sold their stock at approximately this same price after over a month had passed.moreover,the stock generally continued to climb until the revelations of december,suggesting the timing of the march sales was not unusually prescient.the fact that defendants agazzi,gaines,and smith did not sell in or around march also undermines an inference of scienter indeed,smith did not sell inspire stock at any time during the entire class period.the fact that other defendants did not sell their shares during the relevant class period undermines plaintiffs claim that defendants delayed notifying the public so that they could sell their stock at a huge profit.acito imcera group,cir.
the sales are also not inherently suspicious.first,agazzi,lynn,and smith did not sell at this time.combining his sales on july and,dunham sold only percent of his shares.combining his sales on july and august,robinson sold percent of his shares.several weeks later,on august,and,agazzi sold percent of his shares.additionally,the price of inspire stock was not unusually volatile during the interval in which these sales occurred,as it was on july and on august.the low between july and august was on july while the high was on august.
the plaintiffs strongest argument concerns sales made in november.dunham,gaines,lynn,and robinson made sales between november and november.on november and,dunham sold shares,percent of his holdings.on november,gaines sold shares,percent of his shares.on november,lynn sold shares,percent of his holdings.on november,robinson sold shares,percent of his holdings.these sales of inspire stock at between and were not perfectly timed,as inspire stock would hit a high of on november.however,these sales occurred only slightly more than a month before inspire stock fell precipitously from on december,to on december,the day inspire issued a release revising downward its earning estimates.inspire stock would never reach again.the november sales also closely followed inspire announcement of its arrowhead outsourcing contract on november,and the favorable analyst reports it spawned on november and.inspire stock rose from on october,to on november,a percent increase in the share price in a span of ten days 
alleged misstatements 
the plaintiffs allegations of fraud against the defendants essentially relate to misstatements relating to the functionality and capacity of inspire software programs misstatements relating to inspire past,present,and projected economic performance and misstatements in financial reports consisting of violations of generally accepted accounting principles gaap pertaining to classification of receivables,software development costs,and goodwill.the plaintiffs allegations relating to inspire software and those relating to its stated fiscal performance are intertwined to the extent that much of the complaint argues that the inadequacies of inspire software caused the company to be unable to deliver on its software contracts,resulting in subpar performance and inspire ultimate collapse.
the plaintiffs allegations are divided into five time sub periods within the overall january,to october,class period.
we first examine the period of january,to april.the complaint alleges inspire issued results for the fourth quarter of and the year ended,listing dunham and gaines as contact persons.complaint.the plaintiffs allege this statement and all of the statements set forth in the complaint made during this sub period were false when issued and that each such statement failed to disclose information about adverse conditions in and then impacting inspire business,disclosure of which was required to make the statements made not misleading,and which information was then known only to the defendants due to their access to internal inspire data.complaint.the plaintiffs further allege that inspire reported revenues and earnings during this class period were materially overstated due to improper revenue recognition,failure to write off uncollectible receivables,improper capitalization of software development costs,and failure to write down goodwill from inspire purchase of strategic data systems sds in violation of gaap.complaint,k.
the plaintiffs allegation that the defendants committed fraud by reporting the company results for the fourth quarter of and year end fails to meet the pleading requirements outlined above because the plaintiffs fail to explain how or in what particulars the reported earnings and revenues figures were inaccurate,and their conclusory allegation that the defendants knew the figures were false relies on group pleading and fails to plead facts with the requisite specificity to generate a strong inference of scienter.an unsupported general claim of the existence of company reports reflecting contrary information is insufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.such allegations must have corroborating details regarding the contents of allegedly contrary reports,their authors and recipients.abrams,at emphasis added.see also goldstein mci worldcom,cir following abrams and noting that there the allegations that the individual defendants the ceo and cfo received daily,weekly,and monthly financial reports that appraised them of the company true financial status were insufficient and overly general tchuruk,at allegations concerning regular reports from specified subsidiary to parent and to parent ceo and named member of executive committee insufficient because any such regular reports are insufficiently identified as to who prepared them and how frequently they were prepared id.at a plaintiff needs to specify the internal reports,who prepared them and when,how firm the numbers were or which company officers reviewed them internal quotations and citation omitted.
next,the plaintiffs allege that inspire held a telephonic conference call for securities analysts,money and portfolio managers,institutional investors,large shareholders,brokers and stock traders subsequent to the release of the fourth quarter results in which they announced seven new contracts,and that dunham and gaines d uring the in conversations with participants made generally positive statements about demand for inspire products and services,predicted million in revenues for,and earnings per share of and in and,respectively.the plaintiffs cite a january,raymond james associates report on inspire that relied on the new contracts and forecasted earnings outlined in the conference call and in follow up conversations with dunham gaines.
the defendants argue that these alleged false statements in paragraph and many others in the complaint constitute statements protected by the pslra safe harbor provision c a.a statement,which can be either written or oral,is defined under i as 
a a statement containing a projection of revenues,income including income loss,earnings including earnings loss per share,capital expenditures,dividends,capital structure or other financial items 
b a statement of the plans and objectives of management for future operations,including plans or objectives relating to the products or services of the issuer 
c a statement of future economic performance,including any statement contained in a discussion and analysis of financial condition by the management or in the results of operations included pursuant to the rules and regulations of the commission 
to avoid the safe harbor,plaintiffs must plead facts demonstrating that the statement was made with actual knowledge of its falsity.id.at c b nathenson,at.the safe harbor has two independent prongs one focusing on the defendant cautionary statements and the other on the defendant state of mind.c a,c a c b,c b.under the first prong,there is no liability if,and to the extent that,the statement is i identified as a statement,and is accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the statement,or ii immaterial.id.at c a,c a.under the second prong,there is no liability if the plaintiff fails to prove that the statement i if made by a natural person,was made with actual knowledge that the statement was false or misleading,or ii if made by a business entity,was made by or with the approval of an executive officer of that entity with actual knowledge by that officer that the statement was false or misleading.id.at c b,c b.the requirement for meaningful cautions calls for substantive warnings based on a realistic description of the risks applicable to the particular circumstances,not merely a boilerplate litany of generally applicable risk factors.conf,sess.oral statements can qualify for the safe harbor if i the statement is accompanied by a cautionary statement that the particular oral statement is and that actual results could differ materially essentially a formality as to the form of the statement ii the statement is accompanied by an oral statement that additional information that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in a written document iii the statement identifies the document or portion thereof containing the additional information and iv the identified document itself contains appropriate cautionary language.c,c.readily available written documents for this purpose include documents filed with the sec or generally disseminated.id.at c,c.
with regard to the five alleged misstatements cited in paragraph,the predictions of future earnings and revenues in these statements meet the pslra definition of a statement.i a.however,the defendants have not shown that these statements were identified as statements.accordingly,the plaintiffs may properly allege a claim based on these statements if they were made with actual knowledge that they were false or misleading.however,the second and third statements of the five in paragraph are puffery,as they are of the vague and optimistic type that can not support a securities fraud action and contain no concrete factual or material misrepresentation.lain evans,d,citation omitted.because analysts rely on facts in determining the value of a security,these statements are certainly not specific enough to perpetrate a fraud on the market.raab physics,cir rosenzweig azurix,cir.the generalized,positive statements about the company competitive strengths,experienced management,and future prospects are not actionable because they are immaterial.rosenzweig,at.
it is arguable whether the plaintiffs adequately allege when this conference call,and therefore these statements,took place.although the complaint does not date the conference call,it states that it occurred after inspire released its december,results and,because paragraph of the complaint alleges inspire stock price rose following this call between january and,the implication is that the call occurred between january or and january,or at least between january and january.although rule b does not require that a specific date and time always be alleged as to each misrepresentation,several courts have held that simply outlin ing a window during which all of the misrepresentations occurred does not satisfy the pleading standard of rule b.skylon guilford mills,wl,dist.lexis,accord doehla wathne,wl,dist.lexis holding that an allegation that statements were made over the course of a period is insufficient for rule b purposes.however,given the context we will assume arguendo that this allegation provides sufficient notice to the defendants to meet the when requirement under rule b.
we agree with the district court that the alleged statements contained in paragraph are not supported by sufficient particular facts to give rise to a strong inference of knowing falsity.several of the statements,as noted above,are so general as to constitute puffing.and,the dunham or gaines allegations insufficiently charge either one.further,the plaintiffs fail to provide sufficient facts to raise a strong inference of scienter as to the falsity of the revenue and earnings projections when made.the closest the plaintiffs come is in paragraph k of the complaint where they allege inspire reported revenues and earnings were materially overstated due to improper revenue recognition,failure to write off uncollectible receivables,improper capitalization of software development costs and failure to write down sds goodwill in violation of generally accepted accounting principles.the plaintiffs,however,fail to plead facts demonstrating that any of the individual defendants actually knew,or were severely reckless in not knowing,of these alleged infirmities.the plaintiffs complaint pleads more facts relating to scienter as to the flaws in inspire software that formed the basis of the contracts underlying these estimates,but the alleged shortcomings of inspire software do not adequately show scienter on the part of any particular individual defendant respecting projected revenues and earnings that assume the terms of inspire contracts will sufficiently be met.
paragraphs through concern statements made by analysts and brokers in reports on inspire.generally,securities issuers are not liable for statements or forecasts disseminated by securities analysts or third parties unless they have sufficiently entangled themselves with the analysts forecasts so as to render those predictions attributable to the issuers.elkind liggett myers,cir in re navarre.sec,cir.in order to attribute statements to the defendants,the investors must demonstrate that the statements were adopted by the defendants or attributable to the defendants in some way,such as when officials of a company have,by their activity,made an implied representation that the information they have reviewed is true or at least in accordance with the company views.elkind,at navarre,at.the investors could also allege that the defendants used the analysts as a conduit,making false and misleading statements to securities analysts with the intent that the analysts communicate those statements to the market.cooper pickett,cir navarre,at.the plaintiff must plead with particularity how these exceptions apply,including who supplied the information to the analyst,how the analyst received the information,and how the defendant was entangled with or manipulated the information and the analyst.navarre,at raab general physics,cir.since the allegation of entanglement is central to the overall allegation of securities fraud,it must be pleaded with the required degree of specificity.in re caere corporate sec.the pleading should identify the specific forecasts and name the insider who adopted them point to specific interactions between the insider and the analyst which allegedly gave rise to the entanglement and state the dates on which the acts which allegedly gave rise to the entanglement occurred.wool tandem computers,cir.however,analysts statements that reflect their own opinions or forecasts may not be charged to the defendants because the plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged entanglement and the adoption of such statements by the defendants.
the analysts statements in paragraphs through consist primarily of statements for which the plaintiffs do not allege facts sufficient to create a strong inference of scienter on the part of defendants and statements of analysts own opinions for which the defendants are not liable.also,the plaintiffs fail to explain how these statements were false or misleading due to material omissions when they were made.
the statements in paragraph allegedly made by dunham to investor business daily are mere puffery,with the exception of his statement that revenue from outsourcing will increase from its current rate.the plaintiffs do not plead facts sufficient to raise a strong inference that dunham had the requisite scienter respecting the falsity of their latter statement.
paragraph quotes statements from a february,inspire press release announcing inspire contract with brazilian insurer sul america to provide a software system for all of its business that will automate the processing of billion dollars worth of policies,that inspire will install its software system,windows into property and casualty system wpc,in sul america branch locations throughout brazil over a month period,that t he majority of the installation process will be coordinated by inspire branch office in columbia,and sul america home office in rio de janeiro and that t he joint installation team will work closely with inspire software development team.
in paragraph,the plaintiffs allege that defendants not otherwise identified omitted material details about the sul america contract from the february press release by failing to disclose that inspire was required to purchase a performance bond in the amount of million and that the contract was segregated into three phases.which,if any,of the individual defendants knew of those provisions is not alleged.the plaintiffs also allege therein that defendants not otherwise identified knew that the volume at large companies was simply too much for the wpc system to handle that unidentified senior installers told defendants that what inspire was attempting with wpc at sul america was an impossibility that unidentified inspire it personnel told inspire management repeatedly that it was,in effect,installing nothing more than a test product at sul america and that defendants thus knew that sul america would be dissatisfied and that the completion of all phases of the contract would not materialize.these allegations improperly rely on group pleading and fail to identify any individuals made aware of the software purported inadequacies the allegations likewise fail to identify any individuals who made the statements about the software or sul america,or where,when or on what occasion s the statements were made and whether they were oral or written or both.these allegations are hence insufficient to give rise to a strong inference of scienter on the part of any one individual 
paragraph reproduces statements from an analyst report discussing the analyst assessment of the insurance claims administration market and inspire general strategy,none of which contain any alleged misstatements.paragraphs through address inspire march,filing of sec form and its march,statement pursuant to its stock offering.none of the statements in the prospectus cited by the plaintiffs are attributed to any of the individual defendants.the plaintiffs also fail to explain how the general plans outlined in the prospectus were false when made.finally,while the plaintiffs identify omissions such as the surety bond and the alleged limitations of inspire software,they do not plead facts that give rise to a strong inference of scienter as to these omissions,because they do not aver when any individual defendant either became aware of the software problems or acted with severe recklessness in being unaware of them.paragraph cites statements in a broker report for which the defendants are not accountable because they represent the analyst own opinion as to inspire future performance,as indicated by the fact that they are prefaced with the words w e believe.paragraph quotes comments by dunham in his letter accompanying inspire annual report to shareholders that consist of factual statements about inspire business strategy and recent developments,including statements such as an allusion to the sul america contract,and puffing,including statements such as we enter with a great deal of momentum.
paragraph recites alleged omissions that were necessary to make the statements cited earlier not misleading and attempts to plead scienter.the plaintiffs,however,critically fail to plead with particularity facts that would give rise to a strong inference of scienter on the part of any individual defendant.
in paragraph a,note,plaintiffs allege that wpc was first developed solely as an administrative system for personal lines of homeowners auto insurance although defendants sold wpc as a complete solution for the administration of both personal and commercial lines,wpc only been designed for personal auto insurance and was not yet capable of processing commercial lines.plaintiffs also allege the inability of wpc and empower to run simultaneously and interface with each other,that empower originally could not correctly scan typewriting or handwriting,that it was fixed as to typewriting but inspire could not fix it for handwriting,though most applications were handwritten.e.it is also alleged that defendants knew empower did not work when inspire bought it in may and that t he original designer and developer of empower,sds,designed the product for small networks only.inspire therefore knew before the purchase of the empower system that empower was not designed for high volume networks.f.plaintiffs also allege that inspire programmers,despite ongoing efforts to do so,were never able to successfully modify these software programs to process the volume and complexity of policies maintained by sul america and other unspecified clients with whom inspire contracted.they further allege that inspire insiders,including,but not limited to,defendants lynn,robinson,and dunham,were repeatedly told by inspire programmers and developers that empower would never work as defendants had represented it to work.f.this allegation,however,is insufficient because it fails to state when,where or on what occasion or occasions this occurred,fails to in any way identify the inspire programmers and developers involved,and does not indicate whether their statements were oral or written or given any meaningful particulars as to what was stated.
the complaint alleges that at least one inspire officer directed the faking of a demonstration,but does not specify which officer did so,when he did it,or where.complaint,d.similarly,the complaint also fails to specify when other than throughout the class period,where,to whom,whether orally or in writing,in what context or setting,and in reference to what particular products or aspects thereof,the smoke and mirrors remarks were made by unidentified employees in the it department,unidentified managers and even defendant gaines to refer to inspire software products.complaint,b.the plaintiffs likewise fail to specify when and where defendant lynn made his alleged comments that empower,one of inspire software programs,did not work.complaint,f.no date more specific than the class period is provided for these remarks and meetings with upper management is too vague of an indication of where or to whom the alleged comment was made.complaint,f.nor is any indication given as to what particular function of the program lynn was addressing.the plaintiffs also cite robinson alleged statements to unidentified inspire it personnel who questioned the functionality of the company software programs to get with the program or get out the door.complaint,b.while this statement may suggest robinson harbored an intent to deceive,the plaintiffs fail to identify when and where robinson made this statement,or what particular function of what program was being addressed,and therefore do not meet the particularity requirement for pleading facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter on robinson part.the plaintiffs also allege that unidentified inspire engineers regularly read unidentified inspire press releases and joked to one another,i did know it could do that as to unidentified claims made about the capabilities of inspire software.complaint,c.in addition to the fact that this statement is suggestive of the state of mind of the engineers rather than of any other individuals,the plaintiffs again fail to identify the elements of who,when,and where needed to plead scienter with particularity.it is also alleged that the defendants knew that empower was incapable of interfacing with other vendors systems or insurers proprietary systems even while the software was marketed as an integrated,turnkey solution.complaint,g.this allegation fails as to the individual defendants,however,because it relies on group pleading and does not set forth with particularity how and when any of the individual defendants became aware of this alleged problem with empower.the plaintiffs further allege that inspire was manipulating the amounts charged to millers to improve inspire reported results,but they fail to plead when,where,and at who direction this occurred.complaint,h.the remaining allegations enumerated in paragraph rely on group pleading and fail to allege with sufficient specificity the when and where elements needed to meet the requirement of pleading facts with particularity to show scienter.
with paragraph,the plaintiffs move to the second sub period,april,to august.paragraphs through recount statements by inspire and its executives in corporate documents and a newspaper article,as well as statements by brokers and analysts.the statements address earnings and revenue estimates,the paragon acquisition,and contracts inspire entered into with sul america,kemper insurance,atlantic preferred insurance company,harbor insurance,orion capital companies,and patterson insurance company to provide claims administration software.many of the statements in these paragraphs are,and large portions of the analysts reports consist of the opinions and forecasts of the analysts themselves,unaccompanied by any allegation of entanglement or ratification by any defendant.furthermore,many of the statements allegedly made by an identified defendant in these paragraphs are mere puffery,such as dunham statement that t he first quarter of was extremely significant for inspire insurance solutions.with regard to each of the statements alleged by the plaintiffs in these paragraphs,the plaintiffs fail to plead at least one of the following elements with particularity when the statements were made,where they were made,and sufficient allegations for charging any individual defendant with them.as with the allegations concerning the first sub period,the plaintiffs do not explain in connection with or closely following the allegations concerning the making or issuance of the statements alleged in this section how the statement was false or misleading,or how and when any identified individual defendants knew,or was severely reckless in not knowing,the inaccuracy of the statement.to the extent why a particular statement is false or misleading is explained and scienter is pleaded,this occurs in paragraph.
paragraph,like paragraph,is where the plaintiffs attempt to plead scienter as to the facts alleged during this sub period.paragraph simply repeats many of the allegations contained in paragraph,adding only 
n inspire had taken an excessive charge for purchased research and development in connection with its acquisition of paragon,writing off million rather than the which should have been recognized.thus,inspire was understating the goodwill amortization charge which should have been expensed in every quarter after the acquisition.
o as a result of the aforementioned factors,the defendants actually knew that their forecasts of earnings growth in to where in fact unreasonable and false.
these allegations fail to plead with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter because they rely on group pleading insofar as they fail to identify which of the individual defendants knew that the forecasted earnings growth was false.the above allegations also fail to allege which defendants,if any,were aware of the specific factors mentioned in n that form the basis of the allegation in o,which would be merely conclusory absent scienter as to the facts in n.moreover,these allegations also fail because they do not explain how any defendant knew,or was severely reckless in not knowing,the proper way to expense the goodwill amortization charge for the paragon acquisition,or that the earning statements were false when made.the remainder of paragraph suffers from the same fatal group pleading and lack of particularity defects explained above in reference to the essentially identical allegations set forth in paragraph.
with paragraph,the plaintiffs begin their recitation of allegations concerning the sub period running from september,to november.paragraphs through recount inspire september announcement of two software sales contracts,its october press release addressing its third quarter results,and its november,announcement of a outsourcing agreement with arrowhead general insurance agency to use inspire software and personnel to process their claims.the complaint also recites inspire discussions with analysts during this time and the subsequent favorable reports released by these analysts.complaint.the complaint charges that,during this time,durham and other individual defendants took advantage of the alleged inflation of inspire stock price,which had increased to a share,by selling shares of their stock for million.complaint.inspire shares had traded between and from october through october.before october,inspire had traded as high as on only two days on september and on september.from november,through december,inspire did not trade below per share,and for several days traded at or above,reaching its high of on november.on december,inspire issued a press release reducing its estimate of earnings from to per share due to lower than expected margins on the arrowhead contract as well as a decrease in anticipated revenues from another outsourcing contract.complaint.the price of inspire stock fell from on december to the next day.it remained below until the latter part of april,and after december,never traded as high as.
many of the complained of statements alleged in these paragraphs are,represent the opinions of analysts as to which facts are not alleged showing any defendant to bear liability,or consist of mere puffery.except as below noted,with regard to each of the statements alleged by the plaintiffs in these paragraphs,the plaintiffs fail to plead at least one of the following elements with particularity when the statements were made,where they were made,and sufficient allegations for charging any individual defendant with them.as in the earlier two sub periods,the plaintiffs largely fail to explain in connection with or shortly after the allegations concerning the making of the statements alleged in this period how that statement was false or misleading,or how and when any individual defendant knew or was reckless in not knowing the inaccuracy of the statement.instead,to the extent the false or misleading nature of a particular statement is explained and scienter pleaded at all,this is generally saved for paragraph.
paragraph largely replicates the allegations contained in paragraphs and,adding only the following new averments 
o the arrowhead deal would require a major infusion of money to make it profitable and would not provide earnings to inspire for at least a year.
p arrowhead was not servicing enough policies to generate anywhere close to million in revenue in year one under the contract.there were approximately policies involved with the arrowhead deal and this number of policies could not possibly generate million in revenue for inspire.
q inspire was completely unprepared to handle a project as large as arrowhead.inspire did not have employees qualified to install a product for a company such as arrowhead.furthermore,the products sold to arrowhead were not designed to service a company of arrowhead size.
r ultimately,inspire was forced to lay off close to of its workers due to inspire need to discontinue its efforts to develop licensed software packages.the company software services and licensing business deteriorated until this layoff became necessary.
s as a result of the aforementioned factors,the defendants actually knew that their forecasts of earnings growth in to and in to were in fact unreasonable and false.
these allegations are plagued by the same defects as those in the previous class periods.first,the averments in o through s rely on group pleading,as they fail to identify any individual.second,these averments do not themselves allege when,where,and how any individual knew,or was severely reckless in not knowing,that inspire was incapable of performing the arrowhead contract.nor do the plaintiffs explain how or when any individual actually knew the estimate in s was false when made.as such,these allegations by themselves fail to allege with particularity facts that,absent additional evidence,would give rise to a strong inference of scienter on the part of any individual.
paragraph alleges that i n connection with the november,release announcing the arrowhead agreement dunham and smith spoke to securities analysis and d uring these conversations with analysts,dunham and smith directly disseminated important information into the market,stating t he deal would add per share to earnings and beyond that so that the company would be on track to report eps of in and t he cost to inspire would be million in cash and stock options and the deal would generate million in year one revenues.while this is a forward looking statement,it can not be ascertained from the record whether it was accompanied by meaningful cautionary language hence,it is actionable if made with actual knowledge of its false or misleading character.a little more than a month after these statements,on december,inspire revised downward its earnings forecast,citing lower than anticipated margins on the arrowhead contract.nothing in the record suggests any knowledge inspire or dunham had in this respect on december that they lacked in early november.the day following the december announcement,inspire stock fell by about percent of its value the preceding day.on november and,only a few days after the november arrowhead announcement and dunham comments in that respect,dunham sold shares of inspire,of his holdings,for total proceeds in excess of million.his average price per share was over,well above what the stock had been trading for before november,and likewise more than higher than what it would ever trade at after december.
we conclude that these dunham sales and this sequence of events,considered in light of all the other facts and circumstances alleged,including dunham position as ceo,which he had held ever since inspire was spun off,his total sales throughout the class period of over percent of his inspire stock,and his personal involvement in promoting the arrowhead contract and touting the increased revenues and earnings it would produce,suffice,albeit only barely so,to create a strong inference of the requisite scienter on dunham part in regard to his early november statements in connection with the arrowhead announcement because it is alleged that dunham,with the requisite scienter,made these statements as inspire ceo and on its behalf,and in the course of his inspire employment,inspire respondent superior liability for those statements is also adequately alleged.paul newton texas commerce bank,cir.
beginning in paragraph,the plaintiffs outline their allegations relating to the fourth sub period,which runs from december,to august.in december,inspire revealed a decline in earnings growth and disclosed that the arrowhead contract would not generate earnings previously forecast,causing the price of inspire stock to decline from to.complaint.on january,inspire released its fourth quarter and results,followed by its sec and filings on march and.complaint.on march,inspire announced a contract with auto insurer robert plan to provide claims administration using inspire wpc software.this contract was highlighted in the company april release of its first quarter results.complaint.on may,inspire filed its for the first quarter.complaint.on june,inspire announced its contract with island insurance for claims administration,stating that it will produce many positive results.complaint.
many of the statements in these paragraphs are,represent the opinions of analysts as to which defendants do not bear liability,or consist of mere puffery.apart from the sec filings,plaintiffs fail to plead with particularity when the statements in these paragraphs were made or where they were made.as with the previous sub periods,the plaintiffs fail to explain in connection with or shortly after the allegations concerning the making of statements alleged in this section how that particular statement was false or misleading,or how and when any individual defendant knew,or was severely reckless in not knowing,the inaccuracy of the statement.to the extent misstatements or omissions are identified and scienter is pleaded,that is done in paragraph.
paragraph repeats numerous allegations contained in paragraphs,and,adding the following averments relating primarily to the robert plan and island insurance contracts 
g when negotiations began with the robert plan corporation to use the new empower program with their outsourcing,empower still was not close to functioning.the workflow processing capabilities were not working and many of the technical problems outlined above remained.inspire programmers had many conversations with defendants robinson and lynn,telling them explicitly that empower was not ready to be used with the robert plan contract.
h also,as occurred with sul america,wpc was not designed to handle processing for large insurance companies such as robert plan.wpc was designed for insurance companies that processed approximately million in policies per year as opposed to the robert plan which processed more than million in policies per year.because wpc was designed for smaller insurance companies,it had limited processing power and speed.wpc was designed to run a processing cycle each night.during that cycle,the system goes through all of the policies.because of its design,wpc could only process a limited number of policies a night.because rpc had so many policies,however,wpc did not have the capability to process all of robert plan policies every night.although the contract between inspire and robert plan called for full implementation of wpc within a period,defendants knew that this was totally unrealistic.defendants knew that it would take a year just to perform a requirements study and to test the system.
i in a june meeting,defendant robinson told attendees at the inspire senior staff meeting that inspire knew when it signed the robert plan contract that it could not meet the implementation schedule,but that inspire signed the contract anyway to get the business.
j in a january,article in the fort worth,john pergande,the new ceo of inspire,admitted that in revenue failed to materialize and projects lagged largely because the company did have the resources to execute the contracts it signed.in a january,article in the sheboygan press,authored by martha shad,pergande discussed the inspire business model and pergande admitted,i believe that in the past when a customer said they wanted something by a certain date,it was promised whether it was feasible or not.we not going to do that anymore 
k after all the failures enumerated above,inspire then tried to make empower work with wpc.inspire first tried this with customer arrowhead insurance,then at island insurance and robert plan.although inspire was promising workflow solutions to these clients,empower was not even close to functioning with wpc.
l defendants told island insurance that wpc could be used for policy and claims administration of both their personal and business lines of insurance.however,wpc was not functional on administration of business lines of insurance.the inability of wpc to handle commercial processing is the reason that island insurance terminated their contract with inspire.jim strickland,vice president of sales and marketing,at the instruction of dunham,told island insurance that wpc could rate commercial properties.this promise was made even though wpc was not in fact capable of rating commercial lines and was not designed to rate commercial lines and dunham knew it.
the allegation in g that,when negotiations began with robert plan,the empower was not close to functioning does not allege particular facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter on the part of any of particular individual.in addition,the subsequent allegation concerning conversations between unidentified inspire programmers and robinson and lynn fails to indicate when or where such conversations occurred.the allegations set forth in h suffer from the group pleading defect,as they fail to delineate among the individual defendants as to their state of mind with respect to the alleged unsuitability of the wpc software for performing the robert plan contract.these allegations also fail to explain when and how any particular individual defendant came to know,or was severely reckless in not knowing,of the asserted mismatch between the capabilities of the wpc software and the demands of the robert plan contract.the allegation in i that robinson told attendees at a june meeting of inspire senior staff that inspire knew when it signed the robert plan contract in march that it could not meet the implementation schedule,is insufficient because,in addition to its overly vague identification of the meeting,it contains no information suggesting such knowledge on the part of any identified individual nor any indication of any basis on which or when robinson reached the general conclusion he allegedly expressed.the allegations set forth in j concerning january statements lack particularity because they refer only vaguely to the company conduct and state of mind in the past,which is overly vague.the allegation in k that after diverse failures inspire then tried to make empower work with wpc for customers arrowhead,island and robert plan,but empower was not even close to functioning with wpc,does not allege facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter as to any individual.in l the allegation that strickland,at dunham instruction,told island insurance that wpc could rate commercial lines even though it could not and dunham knew it,is likewise insufficient in that no facts are stated as to how or when that was known by dunham,nor when,where,how or to what person strickland so informed island.
on october,inspire announced large and disappointing third quarter results.complaint.after negative reports by analysts reacting to this news,inspire stock price dropped below per share.the complaint describes how a number of inspire clients terminated contracts with the company and,in some cases,sued inspire for breach of contract.complaint.in january,inspire reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended december,all of which showed substantial net losses.complaint.the complaint alleges that,subsequent to december,inspire stock price dropped below per share.complaint.lastly,the complaint avers that inspire then president,smith,resigned effective january,cfo kenneth meister resigned effective march,executive eric yerina resigned,and defendant robinson was fired and sued inspire.complaint.the foregoing paragraphs summarizing inspire decline do not identify alleged misstatements or omissions,nor do they address any individual scienter.we agree with the district court that,because fraud can not be proved by hindsight,subsequent lawsuits are unpersuasive of scienter,as they do not show what any particular individual knew,or was severely reckless in not knowing,at the time the contracts were entered into.the subsequent resignations of inspire executives is similarly unavailing as proof of the commission of fraud by these or other individuals.
financial reporting 
the next section of the complaint concerns inspire allegedly false financial reporting throughout the overall class period.the plaintiffs allege that the defendants reported inflated revenues and earnings,improperly recognized revenues,improperly accounted for goodwill,improperly capitalized software development costs,and failed to record losses for uncollectible receivables.the plaintiffs contend that all of these inspire practices violated gaap.this section relies largely on group pleading and fails to plead facts with sufficient particularity to generate a strong inference of scienter as to any individual.the only reference to any individual defendant in this section is in paragraph where plaintiffs allege 
in fact,during,dunham once threw a financial report back at gaines because dunham did not like the numbers reflected in that report.gaines informed an employee who had witnessed the incident that when dunham did not like the numbers reflected in a financial report,dunham would insist that gaines change those numbers.referring to george dunham,gaines told one inspire employee,he wants me to write down numbers that do exist.dunham also instructed financial reporting managers to contracts in order to inflate inspire revenues for specified periods.
while these allegations bear upon dunham general state of mind,they are not stated with sufficient particularity,as they fail to state when,other than sometime during,and where dunham allegedly acted in this manner,and there is an entire failure to relate or connect the matters set out in the above quoted allegations to any particular alleged misstatement or omission in any of inspire financial reports or,indeed,to any particular such report.
conclusion as to primary violations 
in conclusion,we hold that the complaint fails to properly plead any section b or rule b violations except on the part of dunham with respect only to his november statements made in connection with the arrowhead contract announcement,and on the part of inspire,with respect to those same dunham statements,as having respondeat superior liability for those violations by dunham.
section a control person liability 
the complaint seeks to also impose control person liability under section a of the securities exchange act,a,but only as to dunham and inspire control person liability is secondary only and can not exist in the absence of a primary violation.lovelace software spectrum,cir.accordingly,the district court,having determined that the complaint alleged no primary violation,also dismissed the section a claims.we have concluded that the complaint alleges no primary violations on the part of any defendant except only as to dunham respecting only his november statements in connection with the arrowhead contract announcement and as to inspire,on the basis of respondeat superior,respecting those same statements by dunham.dunham obviously can have no section a liability for his own statements.inspire can have section a liability for a primary violation by its employee dunham,see martin shearson lehman hutton,cir,but inspire would in any event have respondeat superior liability for the referenced primary violations by dunham.paul newton,at accordingly,our holding renders the section a claims against dunham and inspire either invalid,as based on no properly alleged primary violation,or essentially immaterial.
failure to grant leave to amend 
plaintiffs complain that the district court failed to grant them leave to amend the complaint.
at the very end of their lengthy response to defendants motion to dismiss the complaint,plaintiffs stated 
for the foregoing reasons,plaintiffs respectfully request that defendants motion be denied.if,however,the court dismisses the complaint,plaintiffs request leave to replead.federal rule of civil procedure a directs that leave to amend shall be freely given when justice so requires.
so far as the record reflects,this is the entirety of what plaintiffs communicated to the district court concerning amendment to the complaint.plaintiffs never at any time either tendered a further amended complaint or advised the district court of how or in what manner they would amend the complaint or what allegations would be added or deleted if allowed to do so nor have plaintiffs at any time suggested they have relevant information they were unaware of when the
