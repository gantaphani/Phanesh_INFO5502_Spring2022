the district court granted summary judgment both to the law offices and to margelefsky after concluding that the collection letter did not make any misrepresentations and was not deceptive.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.specifically,we conclude that margelefsky can be held individually liable as a debt collector under the fdcpa and that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the collection letter was deceptive.

ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment.int l union cummins,cir.summary judgment is proper where no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in considering a motion for summary judgment,the district court must construe all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.the central issue is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby,d.
margelefsky individual liability 
we will first address margelefsky argument that he should not be held individually liable because either he did not have any involvement with the collection notice that was sent to kistner,or he is not individually liable for the actions of his law firm,which is established as a limited liability company llc.margelefsky argues that,notwithstanding any liability that his business might face,he is entitled to be dismissed from the case as an individually named defendant.
the question of whether an individual member of an llc that is engaged in debt collection may be held liable under the fdcpa without piercing the corporate veil is an issue of first impression in this circuit.liability under the fdcpa attaches only to a debt collector,a term defined by the act as 
any person who uses any instrumentality of interstate commerce or the mails in any business the principal purpose of which is the collection of any debts,or who regularly collects or attempts to collect,directly or indirectly,debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another.
ohio law precludes personal liability for members of an llc on the basis of the llc liability.ohio ann.
margelefsky cites only one case in support of his argument that his lack of involvement with the specific notice at issue precludes his individual liability under the fdcpa.in that case,united states acb sales service,the district court concluded that the director of a corporate entity may be held liable only for fdcpa violations in which he materially participates.id.at.in more recent years,however,the law surrounding this issue has been developed more fully and a split of authority has emerged.
on one side of the split,the seventh circuit and a few district courts have ruled that a shareholder,officer,or employee of a corporate debt collector may not be held personally liable without meeting the requirements necessary to pierce the corporate veil.the leading case for this proposition is white goodman,cir,where the seventh circuit concluded that t he fair debt collection practices act is not aimed at the shareholders of debt collectors operating in the corporate form unless some basis is shown for piercing the corporate veil.id.at.later,in pettit retrieval masters creditors bureau,cir,the seventh circuit clarified that under our holding in white goodman,the extent of control exercised by an officer or shareholder is irrelevant to determining his liability under the fdcpa.id.at.according to the court in pettit,officers and shareholders do not become debt collectors simply by working for or owning stock in debt collection companies.id.the seventh circuit explained that the fdcpa has utilized the principle of vicarious liability and,j ust as in the title vii context,the debt collection company answers for its employees violations of the statute.id.
on the other side of the split are a series of district court decisions concluding that where a shareholder,officer,or employee of a corporation is personally involved in the debt collection at issue,he may be held personally liable as a debt collector without piercing the corporate veil.brumbelow law offices of bennett and deloney,d.for example,the eastern district of california has concluded that 
b y being directly involved in the operation of lundgren associates,including training and managing employees,and reviewing or supervising the review of all accounts,lundgren was both directly and indirectly involved in lundgren associates collection of debts.given the plain language of the fdcpa,defendant lundgren is a debt collector within the meaning of the fdcpa and can be held liable for any acts in which he directly or indirectly attempted to collect debts in violation of the fdcpa.
newman checkrite,referring to.in another case,the eastern district of new york found personal liability in part because each employee is himself a debt collector within the statutory definition,namely each is a person in a business,the principal purpose of which is the collection of any debts or who regularly collects or attempts to collect debts owed or due another.teng metro.retail recovery,quoting.
the district court in arizona,subsequent to the acb sales service,case from that district relied on by margelefsky,has held that personal liability may be found where individual corporate officers materially participated in the activities of a debt collection agency alleged to be collection activities.brink first credit,d.in other words,contrary to margelefsky argument that he can not be personally liable because he did not participate in sending the specific letter to kistner,he may be personally liable on the basis of his participation in the debt collection activities of the llc more generally.
most similar to the instant action is the case of ditty checkrite,in which the district court premised a finding of personal liability on the part of the sole member of a law firm llc on the grounds that 
as the firm sole attorney,developer of the covenant not to sue practice,author of the generic letters utilized by the firm,and supervisor of all of the firm collection activities,deloney was regularly engaged,directly and indirectly,in the collection of debts.
id.at.the court in ditty concluded that the defendant satisfied the fdcpa definition of debt collector and could therefore be held liable without pierc ing the protective veil afforded llcs under utah law.id.at.
in discussing the ditty holding,the court in brumbelow explained that t here is no doubt that in a generic sense a person who authors collection letters,supervises collection activities,and is the sole attorney in a debt collection firm is a debt collector as defined by the fdcpa.brumbelow,d at.the court in brumbelow also articulated a compelling argument against the seventh circuit conclusion that the fdcpa employs the same principles found in title vii 
title vii of the civil rights act of and the age discrimination in employment act both forbid discrimination by an employer,employment agency,or labor organization.the tenth circuit has squarely held that t he relief granted under title vii is against the employer,not individual employees whose actions would constitute a violation of the act.in other words,where the employer under title vii is a corporation,it is the corporate entity which is liable for reinstatement,or backpay,or any other relief awarded,and not the individual who actually engaged in the discriminatory conduct.by contrast,the fdcpa does not limit liability to business entities or employers.rather,under the fdcpa,liability extends to all debt collectors,defined as any person in any business the principal purpose of which is the collection of any debts the point of this is simply that it is much easier to read the language of title vii and conclude that it is based upon the respondeat superior liability of the employer,especially given the remedies available under title vii,than it is to conclude the same thing with the fdcpa.
d at citations omitted.
we find the analysis in brumbelow persuasive.accordingly,we adopt that analysis and hold that subjecting the sole member of an llc to individual liability for violations of the fdcpa will require proof that the individual is a debt collector,but does not require piercing of the corporate veil.
in the instant action,margelefsky alleged liability is not premised solely on the fact that he works for,and is the sole member of,the law offices.rather,margelefsky,like the defendants in ditty,was regularly engaged,directly and indirectly,in the collection of debts.see ditty.at.margelefsky admitted in his deposition that he drafted the form letter that was sent to kistner,is one of only two attorneys at the law firm,is the only member of the llc,and is the one who negotiates terms with the mailing service provider used in the practice.he also states in his brief that he is involved in the debt collection practice to oversee compliance with applicable collection laws and when the intervention by a lawyer becomes necessary.and while margelefsky signature does not appear on the collection notice that was sent to kistner,the remittance voucher directed kistner to make her check or money order payable to margelefsky individually.
the district court did not analyze margelefsky status as a debt collector,but the facts relating to his involvement in the business are in margelefsky own deposition testimony.accordingly,because the determination of whether margelefsky is a debt collector under the statutory definition is reduced to a pure question of law,it is unnecessary to remand the issue to the district court.see united food commercial workers union,local sw ohio reg l transit,cir although we will generally decline to consider in the first instance issues not considered by the district court,we will make an exception where the issue presents only a question of law.quoting city mgmt.chem,cir.based on the foregoing,we conclude that margelefsky is a debt collector as a matter of law and thus subject to individual liability.see ditty.at.
c.the llc collection letter 
this court has not previously had occasion to decide an attorney letterhead case under the fdcpa.debt collectors are prohibited by the fdcpa from using any false,deceptive,or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt.specifically at issue in this appeal is,which prohibits debt collectors from creating t he false representation or implication that any individual is an attorney or that any communication is from an attorney.the statute imposes strict liability for violations.a.an exception to strict liability exists only where a debt collector commits a violation resulting from a bona fide error.c.

margelefsky contends that he personally had no involvement in sending the letter to kistner.but kistner asserts that six aspects of the letter objectively signal to the least sophisticated consumer that the letter is from an attorney,despite margelefsky lack of personal involvement with it the letterhead reads law offices of michael margelefsky,llc,the letter informs the consumer that the account has been referred to this office,the letter includes a detachable payment voucher with instructions to make check or money order payable to michael margelefsky,the payment voucher is to be returned to the law offices of michael margelefsky,llc,there is no disclaimer of attorney involvement in the letter,and the signature block states account representative,the law offices of michael margelefsky,llc.
in granting summary judgment to margelefsky on kistner claim,the district court relied exclusively on the case of rumpler phillips cohen associates,d.the form collection notice in rumpler was on the company letterhead of phillips cohen associates p c and bore a signature line reading adam cohen,executive vice president.id.at.utilizing the test,the court concluded that such a consumer could not reasonably interpret the
