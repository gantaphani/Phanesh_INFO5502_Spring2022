this is a shareholder derivative suit under state law which,after investigation by a special litigation committee,the corporation rejected.it is one of several suits alleging that smith wesson holding corporation smith wesson made misleading public statements in about demand for its products.we previously affirmed a grant of summary judgment for the corporation in a class action alleging that these statements constituted violations of federal securities laws.in re smith wesson holding.sec,cir.
in this case,aaron sarnacki asserts nevada claims against smith wesson officers and directors,including breach of fiduciary duties,waste of corporate assets,and unjust enrichment.in reaction to earlier and parallel cases,in june,smith wesson board formed a special litigation committee slc to investigate and determine the viability of any of these claims and to make a recommendation to the board whether to pursue any of these claims.the slc recommended against filing any claims.on the basis of that decision,the defendants here moved for summary dismissal under delaware law,as adopted by nevada.after limited discovery,the district court granted the motion.we affirm.
smith wesson is a major gun manufacturer incorporated in nevada with its principal place of business in springfield,massachusetts.the defendants are or were officers or directors of smith wesson,including both its ceo and former cfo.sarnacki is a shareholder of smith wesson who is a citizen of maine.
sarnacki suit alleged that,starting in the second quarter of,the defendants made or caused the company to make a series of public statements,including press releases,touting high sales projections due to the company new rifle and shotgun business.for example,on september,the company issued a press release raising sales projections for fiscal year based on growth in their core handgun business as well as their newly established long gun business.through september,the company continued to predict strong sales growth and raised earnings guidance in press releases,on conferences calls,and in federal filings.
sarnacki alleged that all this time,smith wesson and the defendants had evidence that these projections were false.smith wesson had overinvested in production while demand collapsed at the start of the economic downturn,leading to excessive inventory.although aware of this,the defendants continued to tout high projected sales,and some of the defendants sold millions of their shares.
the defendants finally corrected their alleged misrepresentations.on october,the company reduced its net income guidance by ten cents per diluted share,causing a drop in share price.in that new guidance,the defendants pointed in part to soft demand for long guns and excessive inventory.on december,the company again reduced guidance by thirteen cents per diluted share,and on january,the company withdrew their earnings guidance completely.in total,the company lost million in market capitalization.
as is often the case in these situations,a number of securities fraud cases were brought against the company.in december and january,three putative class actions were filed in federal district court in springfield against the company and three individuals,alleging violations of federal securities laws.see in re smith wesson holding.sec,d.those actions were consolidated into one case,the securities class action.id.at.the district court eventually granted summary judgment to the defendants on march,finding that there was insufficient evidence of scienter and that the company statements were neither false nor misleading.in re smith wesson holding.sec,d.this court affirmed.in re smith wesson holding.sec,at.
on february,sarnacki filed a shareholder derivative suit in massachusetts state court.that case was consolidated with other similar cases and dismissed in january because the plaintiffs failed to make a proper demand on the board of directors.see sarnacki ex rel.smith wesson holding golden,d,explaining procedural history and previous litigation.
having received two other demand letters,smith wesson formed a special litigation committee on june,to evaluate the viability of claims in the demand letters.see in re smith wesson holding.derivative.the slc consisted of three directors john furman,robert scott,and marie wadecki.two of those directors,furman and wadecki,were also outside directors and members of the audit committee during the relevant times.the slc hired an independent law firm,then known as fierst,pucci kane llp of northampton,massachusetts,and conducted the investigation at issue in this case.
on september,sarnacki sent a demand to smith wesson board,insisting that it commence an independent investigation and recover damages caused by the officers and directors breaches of fiduciary duties.corporate counsel for the board responded to sarnacki,notifying him of the slc and demanding information proving sarnacki ownership of shares during the relevant times.the slc counsel also contacted sarnacki,requesting similar information.
on october,sarnacki filed this diversity action in federal district court in arizona the claims arise under nevada state law for breach of fiduciary duty,waste of corporate assets,unjust enrichment,and entitlement to contribution or indemnification.sarnacki,d at.
the slc issued its report on december,concluding that there is insufficient evidence of any breach of fiduciary duty by the named officers and directors and that it is not in the best interests of the company to pursue a derivative suit.on january,this case was transferred to the district of massachusetts with the consent of both parties.on july,the defendants filed a motion to dismiss,based on the slc final report.the district court denied the motion without prejudice on march,and ordered limited discovery on the adequacy of the slc investigation.sarnacki golden,cv map,wl,at.
after discovery,the defendants moved for summary dismissal on june,again on the basis of the slc conclusions.under delaware law,a motion to terminate a derivative suit because an slc has recommended against filing any claims is handled by summary dismissal,a hybrid summary judgment motion for dismissal.zapata maldonado.the district court granted that motion on march.sarnacki,d at.this appeal followed.
the parties agree that delaware law,by operation of nevada law,applies to this case.sarnacki,d at sarnacki,wl,at see moradi adelson,cv mmd rjj,wl,at,in re amerco derivative.under delaware law,if the corporation moves for summary dismissal of a shareholder suit on the basis of the slc judgment,a court conducts a inquiry.first,the corporation must prove the slc independence,and good faith and reasonable bases for its conclusions zapata,at.on these questions,the burden is on the corporation to show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to dismiss as a matter of law.id.at.second,in the court discretion,the court may apply its own independent business judgment to thwart instances where corporate actions meet the criteria of step one,but the result does not appear to satisfy its spirit.id.at.the district court here decided the case at the first step,and sarnacki does not argue that it should have conducted the inquiry.
this court has never addressed the standard of review for a summary dismissal at zapata step one.we now hold that the applicable standard of review is de novo,because a summary dismissal under delaware law is a hybrid of a motion to dismiss and a motion for summary judgment,both of which we review de novo.see booth family trust jeffries,cir.although the standard of review is a matter of federal law,see booth,at c onsistent with the erie doctrine,federal law governs the standard of review of a summary judgment motion in a diversity case,our holding is consistent with delaware state law,see kahn kolberg kravis roberts,zapata first prong is subject to a summary judgment standard,our review of which is de novo.
accordingly,we consider de novo whether the district court erred in finding as a matter of law that a the slc was independent,and b the slc investigation was reasonable and conducted in good faith.
independence 
the independence inquiry is highly fact specific and centers on whether any member of the slc,for any substantial reason,is incapable of making a decision with only the best interests of the corporation in mind.in re oracle.derivative,citation and quotation marks omitted.
sarnacki main challenge to the slc independence is that two of the three slc members,wadecki and furman,could not be independent for two reasons.the first is that they are defendants in this case.the second reason is that,as members of the audit committee,they reviewed and approved many of the allegedly misleading statements.in particular,sarnacki complaint alleged that the audit committtee approved financial statements,press releases,and financial information and earnings guidance provided to analysts and rating agencies,though the record does not show that they approved scripts for earnings conference calls.
there are no per se rules holding that an slc independence is destroyed by either naming a member as a defendant or a members past approval of a disputed statement.see kaplan wyatt,even a director approval of the transaction in question does not establish a lack of independence.kindt lund,no.civ.nc,wl,at.may,the fact that senator garn was on the board and approved the transactions does not negate his independence.nor does his being named as a defendant cause senator garn to lack independence.footnotes omitted.rather,the inquiry is more closely based on the facts.sarnacki must show more to suggest that an slc member position as a member of the board of directors influenced his decisions as a member of the slc.kaplan,at.
there are good reasons to reject such per se rules.if an slc member status as a defendant in the litigation categorically subverted the independence of the committee,a shareholder would be able to manipulate the process he or she would be able to name slc members as defendants after the committee formation,thereby undercutting the legitimacy of its conclusions.see lewis graves,cir calling,in the context of the demand requirement,such a move a transparent litigation tactic.the realities of corporate governance,in which some corporations have small boards,suggest that an slc will frequently include at least one director who also approved the relevant transaction.id.at by virtue of their offices,directors ordinarily participate in the decision making involved in such transactions.
these realities of corporate governance play a role here.the slc was formed on june.at that time,smith wesson had an board including a audit committee.though the three slc members were named as alleged wrongdoers along with the rest of the board,neither the securities class action nor the other demand letters specified any wrongdoing by the audit committee.in creating a slc,then,the board could reasonably have selected members of the audit committee without any attempt to undermine the slc independence,screening only for expertise and ensuring that the slc had at least two outside directors.it was only months after the slc formation that sarnacki sent his demand,on september,to the board specifying misconduct by the audit committee.by that point,the slc had met,hired counsel,and begun communicating with plaintiffs in other derivative actions.it was not unreasonable for the board to decline to abandon the slc,which had already started its work,and to reconstitute a new one.
to say there is no per se rule does not mean that there is no cause for concern.those who are asked to evaluate conduct which they have approved may have a tendency not to find fault.but the delaware supreme court has held that a director is independent when he is in a position to base his decision on the merits of the issue rather than being governed by extraneous considerations or influences.kaplan,at see also,sutherland sutherland,no.vcl,wl,at.may.sarnacki offers no evidence of actual bias affecting any decisionmaker or of extraneous considerations having motivated either the process or the ultimate recommendation.moreover,the committee did not use counsel,a disapproved practice,but chose independent counsel.
sarnacki overstates the record when he argues there were admissions of.he argues that the slc members admitted prejudging the merits of the claims they were charged with investigating.but in the statements at issue,the slc members testified merely that they were doubtful of sarnacki derivative claims based on their background knowledge and the board preliminary investigations before the slc was formed.they did not draw any formal conclusions,and that they had some preliminary views is not surprising and does not by itself constitute prejudgment of the issue.in the case cited by sarnacki,in contrast to the record here,the slc members conducted the investigation with the object of putting together a report that demonstrates the suit has no merit.london tyrrell,cc,wl,at.
sarnacki also argues the district court erred by considering each of his bias arguments separately,rather than as a totality.sarnacki complains that had the district court viewed the structural bias,the evidence of prejudgment,and arguments on the good faith and reasonableness prong together,it would have seen a lack of independence by the slc.we do not read the decision that way and on de novo review,considering these all together,conclude there is no merit.
sarnacki finally argues that,even if he has not plausibly challenged the slc independence,that is not his burden.rather,the defendants must prove the slc independence.sarnacki is right on the law.see zapata,at.but the defendants have carried their burden.smith wesson board appointed three experienced directors,two of whom were outside directors on the independent audit committee,to the slc.they were in a position to base their decision on the merits of the issue rather than being governed by extraneous considerations or influences.kaplan at.and sarnacki has offered no plausible argument to the contrary.
we do not rely,as did the district court,on a theory that sarnacki tacitly conceded the independence of the slc by making a demand on the board.sarnacki,d at.as sarnacki correctly observes,the court analysis is incorrect.the cases discussing this tacit concession focus on the effect of the concession implicit in a demand on a plaintiff later attempt to argue that making a demand was excused.see,spiegel buntrock.delaware cases do not say that such a concession limits later arguments about an slc independence.to the contrary,they say that a plaintiff can make a demand and subsequently argue that the board improperly refused the demand,including by challenging the slc independence.see,grimes donald,overruled on other grounds by brehm eisner.
on the undisputed facts,the board has met its burden as to the independence of the slc.
good faith and reasonableness 
the good faith and reasonableness inquiry focuses on the process used by the slc,rather than the substantive outcome of the process.see spiegel,at the ultimate conclusion of the special litigation committee is not subject to judicial review.alterations in original quoting zapata,at internal quotation marks omitted.courts look to indicia of the slc investigatory thoroughness,such as what documents were reviewed and which witnesses interviewed.see sarnacki,d at.
there is no question that the slc relied on experienced independent counsel,reviewed relevant discovery materials,and released a lengthy final report,all indicia of a reasonable process and good faith.
sarnacki first argues that the slc abdicated its responsibilities,placing the entire investigation in its counsel hands.this is in some tension with his suggestion that the slc members could have been out to protect themselves.second,he argues that the slc work was tainted,because slc independent counsel collaborated closely with counsel representing the defendants in the securities class action.
sarnacki again overstates the record.he takes statements from the slc members depositions that they were generally unaware of the scope of discovery to show that they were so uninvolved as to abdicate their roles to independent counsel.for example,slc counsel obtained
