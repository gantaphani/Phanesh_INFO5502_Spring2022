waste management,grew at an average annual rate of from through.when growth fell off,james koenig,its chief financial officer,decided to improve appearances.he devised several accounting strategies that a jury found to be fraudulent.the district judge imposed a civil penalty of about million and ordered koenig to disgorge the bonuses he received in,and,plus more than million in prejudgment interest.bonuses depended on waste management profits.if its profits had been stated correctly,the judge concluded,koenig would not have received these bonuses.the court also enjoined koenig from again serving as a director or top manager of a public company.
the details of koenig strategies do not affect this appeal he does not contend that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict.but we mention two of the strategies to give a sense of what the trial was about.
netting.one generally accepted accounting principle is that the results of unusual transactions must be reported separately from those of recurring events.koenig violated this rule by netting recurring and transactions.for example,in waste management made a profit of million by transactions in shares of a company called servicemaster.instead of reporting this million as a gain,koenig used it to offset some operating expenses.the result was that the stated operating profits of waste management were improved by million in,implying to investors that in the absence of business reverses they could expect the same annual return in future years.similar netting was performed for other transactions.
basketing and bundling.another generally accepted accounting principle is that,when a project subject to depreciation winds up sooner than expected,the remaining cost must be written off.suppose waste management invested million in a landfill with an expected life of years,and charged million in depreciation annually against that asset.if waste management closed the landfill early say,after years,a capital value of million would remain and,under gaap,should be taken as an immediate loss.koenig instead transferred the remaining depreciation to other landfills,a process he called basketing when the loss stemmed from inability to maintain a permit and bundling when some other reason led to early closure.in our example,by transferring the depreciation waste management was able to report a profit million higher than appropriate in the year of the landfill closure.ongoing depreciation would cause waste management to report lower profits in future years,but if other landfills closed in the interim that reduction could be postponed.koenig practice of basketing and bundling thus overstated current profits while burying in the corporate books items that were bound to reduce future profits,to investors surprise.
in october waste management issued a press release declaring that its financial statements were unreliable and that its projections of future earnings were being rescinded.the value of waste management common stock lost billion,far more than any estimate of the accounting errors.this was in part because,as we have emphasized,items of income that investors had expected to continue vanished,so waste management was revealing that future profits as well as current profits would be reduced.and investors likely feared that worse was to come.the latter fear proved unwarranted.when waste management issued a formal restatement of its accounts in february,showing no more bad news,its stock price rose though not to the level before the disclosures of october.in the restatement,waste management took a charge of approximately billion for the years.of this,million was attributable to netting and million to basketing and bundling.koenig argued at trial that his accounting devices,if dodgy,were not fraudulent.he attributed the restatement and stock price slump to new management decision to take an earnings bath to make the results of its predecessors look bad,so that the new team performance would look better by comparison.the jury concluded,however,that the fault lay with koenig rather than with the new management.koenig presents on appeal six principal arguments,some with subparts.we do not discuss them all but shall cover the main themes.
although all of koenig misconduct occurred before january,when he stepped down as waste management cfo,the sec did not file its complaint until march.the statute of limitations is five years,see,and koenig argues that the demand for civil penalties is untimely.but the district court concluded that the sec had not discovered the fraud until october,and that the claim accrued only then.
koenig maintains that claims under federal law accrue when the violations occur,not when agencies learn about them.section gives a federal agency five years from the date when the claim first accrued to seek a fine,forfeiture,or other penalty.in united states kubrick,d,the justices read a statute with the same reference to the claim accrual to start the clock when the plaintiff knows both loss and other words,when the wrong is discovered.kubrick added that a plaintiff need not know that the injury is a legal wrong only the injury and its cause,and not potential for a legal remedy,need be discovered.the district court treated kubrick and similar decisions as establishing a norm that federal statutes of limitations do not begin to run until the claim has been discovered.this is a common view,see rotella wood,d,but the supreme court pointedly remarked in trw,andrews,d,that we have not adopted that position as our own.trw concludes that some periods of limitations start with discovery and others not,with the difference depending on each provision text,context,and history.
according to koenig,is one of those that starts with the wrong rather than with the wrong discovery.and that position has support in other circuits,which have traced the language of back to,long before the discovery rule was invented.see browner,collecting cases.see also trw,at.scalia,concurring discussing the nineteenth century understanding of a claim accrual.
we need not decide when a claim accrues for the purpose of generally,because the nineteenth century recognized a special rule for fraud,a concealed wrong.see,bailey glover,wall.holmberg armbrecht.these days the doctrine is apt to be called equitable tolling,see cada baxter healthcare,cir.whether a court says that a claim for fraud accrues only on its discovery more precisely,when it could have been discovered by a person exercising reasonable diligence or instead says that the claim accrues with the wrong,but that the statute of limitations is tolled until the fraud discovery,is unimportant in practice.either way,a victim of fraud has the full time from the date that the wrong came to light,or would have done had diligence been employed.and the united states is entitled to the benefit of this rule even when it sues to enforce laws that protect the citizenry from fraud,but is not itself a victim.exploration united states.
koenig accounting maneuvers did not come to public attention until october although the press release did not convey their particulars,it put the sec on notice of the need for inquiry.koenig does not contend that a diligent sec should have nosed things out earlier.his maneuvers fooled waste management outside accountant arthur andersen,which knew a great deal more than the sec about the firm finances.arthur andersen had detected some of koenig stratagems and notified waste management that,unless they were discontinued,it could not certify the financial statements.koenig promised to change his ways but reneged,and arthur andersen accounting team did not notice.
the overstated profits fooled professional investors and analysts too that why the stock price fell when the news came out.if a formal announcement whether by press release or restatement of earnings did not cause much movement in the stock price,then there would be room for an argument that the news either must have been out already or could have been found by reasonable inquiry.flamm eberstadt,cir discussing the doctrine asher baxter international,cir same.but information about koenig misleading accounting practices did not come out until october,so the sec clock started no earlier than the press release.the claim for penalties is timely.
several of koenig arguments concern trial management.we discuss three of these.
a.after learning that koenig planned to pitch his defense on the theory that waste management new management had taken an earnings bath to make its own performance look good by comparison,the sec filed a motion in limine asking the district court to exclude all evidence related to this theme.the right question,the sec insisted,was whether koenig intentionally made or caused waste management to make materially misleading statements from through,not why other managers of waste management made other statements in or.according to the sec,the motive of anyone other than koenig was irrelevant.indeed,koenig motive also was irrelevant securities fraud is wrongful even if committed in the belief that lies serve the issuer,or investors,interests.see basic levinson,d.the plaintiff in a suit must show intentional deceit,see ernst ernst hochfelder,d the motive for that deceit is beside the point.
the district court should have granted the sec motion.instead the judge denied the motion,while warning koenig that if motive became an issue he would allow the sec to introduce its own evidence much of which was sure to be hearsay about why people acted as they did.koenig then presented his defense,the sec responded in kind,hearsay became rampant,and the trial dragged on and on,lasting a total of weeks.
a good deal of research shows that days is about the longest trial any jury can comprehend fully the longer the trial goes,the more the jury forgets and the less accurate the decision becomes.see,richard lempert,civil juries and complex cases taking stock after twelve years center for research on social organization working paper series,a handbook of jury research c at walter abbott john batt eds joe cecil et,jury service in lengthy civil trials,tab,tab fed.judicial center patrick longan,the shot clock comes to trial time limits for federal civil trials.no wonder the aba strongly recommends short trials.principle courts should limit the length of jury trials insofar as justice allows,and jurors should be fully informed of the trial schedule established,in american bar association,principles of juries and jury trials.koenig does not complain about the trial length perhaps he was hoping that jurors would lose focus.a trial about accounting sounds like material for jay leno.but he does complain,and loudly,about the hearsay that the sec adduced to meet his phantom defense.
like the district judge,we are inclined to say that error if any was invited.koenig theme was that the managers who issued the press release and restated the firm financial position did so to serve their own interests rather than to provide investors with accurate information.that opened the door to questions about what these persons motivation really was,and the district judge remarked that the sec therefore is entitled to allow the witnesses to explain why they did what they did.koenig concedes that the judge reasoning is analytically sound as far as it goes.but he insists that it does not justify permitting the restaters to testify about what some other person told them about past accounting practices.why not if the reason x issued a press release is that y had told x that koenig had misstated earnings and depreciation,then y statement to x is part of x motive.having put x motive in issue,koenig had to accept the consequence that x account of his would be full of a top manager at a large corporation rarely examines the books on his own.
if you want to know what was in x mind when he acted,you have to consider all the things x was told,as well as the effect the statements had for x job tenure and the value of x stock portfolio.the judge told the jury that these statements were being introduced to show what the managers knew or thought they knew before they acted,not to show whether what the managers had heard was true,so many of the statements were not hearsay.they were not being offered for the truth of the matter stated,as distinct from the fact that they had been made at all.but to the extent genuine hearsay came in,or the jury misunderstood the instructions well,koenig asked for it.and although he insists that the judge should have excluded much of the evidence under.because its prejudicial effect substantially outweighed the probative force,that subject is committed to the district judge discretion,which was not abused given that koenig went into this irrelevant and unnecessary subject with his eyes open.
principle c of the aba american jury project recommends that judges permit jurors to ask questions of witnesses.the final report of the seventh circuit american jury project concurs,with the proviso that jurors should submit their questions to the judge,who will edit them and pose appropriate,queries.district judges throughout the seventh circuit participated in that project.the judges,the lawyers for the winning side,and,tellingly,the lawyers for the losing side,all concluded by substantial margins that when jurors were allowed to ask questions,their attention improved,with benefits for the overall quality of adjudication.keeping the jurors minds on their work is an especially vital objective during a long trial about a technical subject,such as accounting.the district judge in this case permitted jurors to submit questions to him.some were asked others were reformulated and asked some were not asked,when the judge thought them inappropriate or repetitive.
koenig contends that permitting the jurors to participate in this fashion is a reversible error.that ca be because any statute or rule of procedure bans the process.there is no such statute or rule.nor has any court of appeals forbidden the judge to ask questions submitted by the jurors.see united states richardson,cir approving questions and collecting cases from other circuits to the same effect.the aba and seventh circuit jury projects found benefits so have scholars.see,shari seidman diamond,mary rose,beth murphy sven smith,juror questions during trial a window into juror thinking,vand.nicole mott,the current debate on juror questions.
in opposition to these studies,koenig has only occasional judicial skepticism.for example,we said more than a decade ago that questions from jurors are fraught with risks.united states feinberg,cir.similar statements are easy to find,debenedetto goodyear tire rubber,cir united states ajmal,cir.these expressions reflect concern that allowing jurors to ask questions will lead them to take positions too early in the trial,emulating the advocates by choosing sides and becoming argumentative rather than reflective.the jury projects and other studies were designed to find out whether these risks are realized so frequently that they overcome the benefits,such as keeping jurors alert and focused.now that several studies have concluded that the benefits exceed the costs,there is no reason to disfavor the practice.like other issues of trial jurors take notes should written jury instructions and copies of exhibits be sent to the jury room during deliberations whether to allow the jurors to pose questions is a topic committed to the sound discretion of the judge.that discretion was not abused in this case to the contrary,the judge decision,like his supervision of the questioning process,was well considered and sensible.
koenig contends that the judge should have limited the jurors to clarifying questions,but jurors perspectives are so different from those of lawyers that it is difficult to see how such a limit could be enforced or why it would be appropriate.testimony that seems clear to a specialist in accounting or securities law may be confusing to a juror encountering these subjects for the first time,so a juror may see as clarifying a question that the lawyer sees as unnecessary or obtuse.a judge should serve as a filter for questions and eliminate or rephrase those that are irrelevant or disguised argument as the judge at this trial did more than that a court of appeals can not sensib
