penn is a corporation traded on the nasdaq.penn operates numerous gaming and betting facilities in several states.plaintiffs represent a putative class of investors that purchased common shares of penn between march,and june,inclusive.one year prior to the class period end date,on june,penn announced in a press release that it had entered into a leveraged buyout agreement lbo with private equity buyers 
penn national gaming entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by certain funds managed by affiliates of fortress investment group llc and centerbridge partners lp in an transaction valued at approximately billion,including the planned repayment of approximately billion of penn national outstanding debt.
under the terms of the agreement,penn national shareholders will receive in cash for each outstanding penn national share.the purchase consideration represents a premium of approximately over penn national closing share price on june,of per share.penn national gaming has approximately million shares outstanding.
joint appendix ja at.deutsche bank and wachovia securities committed to finance roughly billion of the lbo.the lbo was set to close on or before june,subject to a extension in the event all state regulatory approvals had not been forthcoming.under the terms of the lbo,the purchase price was to increase c for each day the closing was extended beyond june.
on the day of the lbo announcement,penn common stock gained to close at per share,below the agreed buyout price of per share.on november,penn filed with the securities and exchange commission sec a proxy statement which,among other things,detailed the terms of the lbo and the circumstances under which the lbo might be terminated.on december,penn shareholders voted to approve the lbo.at the end of,penn shares were priced at,a or approximately discount off the buyout price.the price levels of penn stock throughout the latter half of reflected the market initial view that the odds of the penn buyout closing were favorable.but given the economic downturn of and,specifically,the turmoil in the credit markets,shareholder confidence that the buyout would close,as reflected in penn stock price,proved unsustainable.by march,the beginning date of plaintiffs class period,penn stock price had dropped to per share,a or nearly discount off the buyout price.
according to a lehman brothers report dated april,just ten days after commencement of the class period,penn stock price following announcement of the lbo had fallen from a high of on june,to a low of on march.recognizing that the terms of both the lbo and the lenders debt commitment letter might lessen the buyers lenders incentives to act aggressively against penn in the event of disagreement or difficulty,lehman brothers nonetheless explained 
much has changed since june,which perhaps represented the peak of the leveraged buyout boom the credit environment has deteriorated from the very favorable conditions experienced during the first half of to extremely difficult many private equity transactions have either been cancelled or face continuing difficulty as targets,private equity firms,and lenders disagree on the original terms of the mergers 
we can not predict whether the penn transaction will close,especially given recent headlines regarding other distressed or cancelled leveraged buyout transactions.
ja at emphasis added citing increased competition and earnings pressure in the gaming industry,lehman brothers observed that since penn announcement of the lbo in june,the prices of comparables,such as boyd gaming and pinnacle entertainment,had dropped an average of.lehman brothers opined that t he high price paid for penn at the peak of the lbo boom and the significant decline in comps are negative factors for penn in the sense that they could create incentives for both to look for outs and for lenders to act aggressively against the sponsors.ja at.
lehman brothers noted that over the first quarter of,penn stock price had fallen sharply despite the lack of negative news regarding the actual transaction.ja at.lehman further noted that on march,fortress publicly reaffirmed its commitment to complete and fund the acquisition by summer.ja at.consistent therewith,the tac alleges 
from march,through the middle of june,through official press releases,penn issued frequent updates and announcements related to the planned of them relating to securing transaction approval by various state regulatory gaming agencies of the proposed agreement,calculated to influence the investing public and shareholders that the transaction,as contained in the original sec filings and the proxy statement was still in effect.
ja at.specifically,penn issued seven press releases between march and june,notifying the public of state regulatory approvals then,on june,penn issued an eighth press release announcing the extension of the closing date by days,from june to october,pursuant to the terms of the lbo.the release stated the extension was necessary to secure the approval of five remaining states,illinois,indiana,louisiana,maine,and missouri.penn stock price closed that day at per share.
the problem,according to the tac,was that while penn continued to behave publicly throughout the class period as if the lbo would close,penn was involved in private discussions with the buyers and financing institutions related to the renegotiation of the buyout price or the termination of the lbo.based upon a host of inferences we need not detail here,the tac alleges that by at least march,penn knew or had reason to believe that the proposed cash transaction would not take place under the terms of the june,agreement.ja at.plaintiffs cite a confidentiality agreement between penn and the buyers dated may,as illustrative of penn knowledge.therein,the signatories agreed that discussions aimed at resolving disputes over the rights and obligations of the parties to the lbo would remain confidential and protected by the settlement privilege.the signatories further agreed that neither party would commence litigation related to the lbo while the confidentiality agreement remained in effect.the may agreement expired on may,but was extended by a series of additional agreements through june.
the closing of the class period on june,is based on the tac allegation that from june,through july,the day before penn issued a press release announcing termination of the lbo,the truth surrounding penn ongoing material omission leaked out to the market through a variety of leaks.ja at capitalization omitted.those leaks,which plaintiffs claim individually constituted partially corrective disclosures of penn fraudulent press releases are identified in the tac as follows 
on june,the market learned the maine harness racing commission cancelled a meeting scheduled to address the lbo 
on june,the market learned the louisiana gaming control board held a meeting without taking action on the lbo 
on june,the market learned penn failed to issue a press release announcing the illinois gaming board had approved the lbo 
on june,the market learned susquehanna financial group suspended coverage of penn stock due to market uncertainty over whether the lbo would close 
on june,the market learned oppenheimer analysts expressed doubts about the lbo closing 
on june,the market learned the missouri gaming commission held a meeting without approving the lbo.
see ja at.on june,the day these purported leaks allegedly began to disclose penn fraud on the market,the price of penn stock opened at per share.when the leaks concluded on june,the price of penn stock closed at per share,down or from its june opening.according to the tac 
after penn national failed to issue a press release announcing the illinois approval by the close of business friday,june,the cat was out of the bag the market knew that the penn national deal would not close.accordingly,penn national stock declined from on monday june,to on wednesday june sic,a fall of or.this removes most but not all,of the price inflation due to penn fraud from penn national stock.
on july,before the market opened,penn announced the termination of the lbo in a press release.peter carlino,penn chief executive officer,commented that penn decision to enter into a settlement agreement followed a thorough evaluation of a wide range of alternatives for consummating the transaction.ja at.the release stated that as part of the settlement agreement,penn would receive billion,consisting of a million cash termination fee and the purchase of billion of penn preferred stock due by affiliates of,deutsche bank,and wachovia securities.penn also announced it would repurchase up to million of its own common stock over the following months.penn stock price closed that day at per share,up cents over its opening.after the market closed on july,penn filed its sec form detailing the terms and conditions of the settlement agreement.over the next two days,penn stock fell from its close on july of per share to its close on july of per share.according to the tac,on july,for the first time,all of the artificial price inflation resulting from penn national fraud was finally removed from penn national stock price.ja at.as a postscript,the wall street journal,in an article dated july,noted that in a record number of lbo involving domestic targets had been terminated short of closing in many of the situations where deals fell apart,banks and companies accused the firms of buyers remorse,while the buyout firms have accused the banks of lenders remorse.the truth is somewhere in between.ja at.
in contrast to the tac allegation that the market became aware of penn fraud through a series of partially corrective disclosures prior to july,plaintiffs sac alleged the market became aware of such fraud upon penn july press release announcing the lbo termination.according to the sac,penn ongoing material omission over the course of the class period proximately caused plaintiffs economic harm when the artificially inflated price of penn shares fell after the truth about the lbo became known on july.the district court,however,granted penn motion to dismiss the sac based upon its failure to adequately plead loss causation.the court observed that penn stock price closed up cents on july.that,said the court,proved fatal to the sac theory of loss causation and to plaintiffs securities fraud claim a point on which we express no opinion.plaintiffs did not challenge the district court rationale for dismissal,only its decision to dismiss the sac with prejudice.to that end,plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration in which they sought leave to file their tac.the court denied plaintiffs motion in a memorandum to counsel because allowing plaintiffs to replead would be futile.ja at.the court reasoned 
under the supreme court decision in dura,broudo,in order to plead loss causation with particularity,plaintiffs must allege that penn share price fell significantly after the truth became known.they remain unable to meet this standard because none of the events plaintiffs now raise constitutes a corrective disclosure under the supreme court decision in dura and its progeny furthermore,none of the events plaintiffs cite can be said to have caused any significant fall in penn stock price.
ja at.plaintiffs timely appealed.
plaintiffs assert the district court erred in denying what,in effect,was a postjudgment motion for leave to file their tac.in laber harvey,cir en banc,we explained that a district court may not grant a motion to amend the complaint unless the court first vacates its judgment pursuant to.e or b to determine whether vacatur is warranted,however,the court need not concern itself with either of those rules legal standards.the court need only ask whether the amendment should be granted,just as it would on a prejudgment motion to amend pursuant to.a.in other words,a court should evaluate a postjudgment motion to amend the complaint under the same legal standard as a similar motion filed before judgment was prejudice,bad faith,or futility.laber,at accord matrix capital mgmt.fund,lp bearingpoint,cir.futility is apparent if the proposed amended complaint fails to state a claim under the applicable rules and accompanying standards a district court may deny leave if amending the complaint would be is,if the proposed amended complaint fails to satisfy the requirements of the federal rules.united states ex rel.wilson kellogg brown root,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
we review allegations of loss causation for sufficient specificity,a standard largely consonant with.b requirement that averments of fraud be pled with particularity in re mutual funds inv,cir.the degree of specificity demanded is that which will enable the court to evaluate whether the necessary causal link exists.teacher ret,at.because loss causation is,the specificity sufficient to plead loss causation will vary depending on the facts and circumstances of each case.for instance 
w hen the plaintiff loss coincides with a market wide phenomenon causing comparable losses to other investors,the prospect that the plaintiff loss was caused by the fraud decreases,and a plaintiff claim fails when it has not adequately pled facts which,if proven,would show that its loss was caused by the alleged misstatements or omissions as opposed to intervening events.
lentell merrill lynch,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
to be sure,the facts alleged in the complaint need not conclusively show that the securities decline in value is attributable solely to the alleged fraud rather than to other intervening factors.in re mutual funds inv,at see also lentell,at we do not suggest that plaintiffs were required to allege the precise loss attributable to merrill fraud.what we do require the alleged facts to show is that the misrepresentation or omission was one substantial cause of the investment decline in value.in re mutual funds inv,at.only then may we conclude that the complaint alleges the necessary causal link between the defendant alleged fraud and the plaintiff economic harm,or,in terms,that the defendant misrepresentation or other fraudulent conduct proximately caused the plaintiff economic loss.dura,broudo.stated otherwise,the complaint must allege a sufficiently direct relationship between the plaintiff economic loss and the defendant fraudulent conduct.see miller asensio,cir.i f the connection is attenuated a fraud claim will not lie.that is because the loss causation with the foreseeability limitation in intended to fix a legal limit on a person responsibility,even for wrongful acts.lentell,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
in dura,the supreme court held a complaint asserting a violation of b based upon a fraud on the market theory does not sufficiently allege loss causation simply by stating that the security price was artificially inflated at the time of purchase,because an inflated purchase price will not itself constitute or proximately cause the relevant economic loss.dura,at.the court explained that if the purchaser sells before the relevant truth begins to leak out,the misrepresentation will not have led to any loss.but i f the purchaser sells later after the truth makes its way into the marketplace,an initially inflated purchase price might mean a later loss.id.
because the supreme court acknowledged the relevant truth may leak out,subsequent decisions have recognized that neither a single complete disclosure nor a disclosure of the relevant truth to the market is a necessary prerequisite to establishing loss causation although either may be sufficient.see alaska pension fund flowserve,cir per curiam recognizing a series of partially corrective disclosures may suffice to establish loss causation.rather,loss causation may be pleaded on the theory that the truth gradually emerged through a series of partial disclosures and that an entire series of partial disclosures prompted the stock price deflation.lormand unwired,inc,cir see also in re williams sec,cir any reliable theory of loss causation that uses corrective disclosures will have to show both that corrective information was revealed and that this revelation prompted the resulting decline in price.the district court in this case properly recognized that because plaintiffs proposed tac relies upon the cumulative effect of an alleged series of partially corrective disclosures to plead loss causation,the tac must state facts that show those disclosures gradually revealed to the market the undisclosed truth about penn fraudulent press releases,and such disclosures resulted in the decline of penn share price.
here,exposure of the fact that penn fraudulently omitted from its prior press releases the truth about the status of the lbo is the first requisite to adequately pleading loss causation.in other words,to sufficiently plead loss causation under a fraud on the market theory,the tac must provide a basis on which to conclude the six alleged corrective disclosures issued between june and june,inclusive,revealed new facts suggesting penn had perpetrated a fraud on the market by omitting in its eight prior press releases related to state regulatory approvals any mention that the lbo would not close as written.teachers ret,at.corrective disclosures must present facts to the market that are new,that is,publicly revealed for the first time,because,if investors already know the truth,false statements wo affect the price.schleicher wendt,cir.such disclosures need not precisely identify the misrepresentation or omission nor need the disclosure emanate from any particular source.see lormand,at.but they must reveal to the market in some sense the fraudulent nature of the practices about which a plaintiff complains.see metzler inv.gmbh corinthian colleges,cir.the disclosure must at least relate back to the misrepresentation and not to some other negative information about the company.in re williams sec,at emphasis added.
let us first consider the tac allegations that on june the market learned the maine harness racing commission cancelled a meeting scheduled to address the lbo,on june the market learned the louisiana gaming control board held a meeting without taking action on the lbo,and on june the market learned the missouri gaming commission held a meeting without approving the lbo.recall that on june,penn and the buyers announced,consistent with the terms of the lbo,that they had extended the deal closing until no later than october.prior to june,the state regulatory approval process had been proceeding at a measured pace since march,with the latest approval occurring on june.considered in context,what these alleged disclosures revealed is that three state regulatory boards or commissions,less than three weeks following a four month extension of the lbo closing deadline,failed to address the lbo as previously planned.on their face,these disclosures do not suggest penn,since march,or anytime thereafter during the class period,had been perpetrating a fraud on the market by failing to disclose in numerous press releases its knowledge about the status of the lbo.the three disclosures themselves did nothing to discount the possibility that state regulators would approve the lbo before the extended closing deadline or that the lbo would ultimately be consummated.
plaintiffs argue these disclosures revealed much more than delays in the state regulatory approval process.the tac concluded a ll these hearings were canceled because penn national failed to provide current financial information related to the buyout,which,according to plaintiffs,meant penn had stopped cooperating with state regulators,which in turn showed the buyout would not close.ja at emphasis omitted.the only fact that the tac alleges in support of its sweeping conclusion,however,relates to the missouri review and is based on a selective account of a june,report from the internet publication the missouri review,which arbs consider the most rigorous of the approval process,is at a standstill.missouri is still waiting for updated pro forma financial data requested in april because the market has changed considerably since the parties filed for the license review last august,a source said.ja at.that the most discerning state in the process,missouri,was waiting to receive revised financial data from penn,data requested as a result of increasingly difficult market conditions,is,standing alone,hardly an endorsement of the proposition that penn had abandoned the state regulatory process and was refusing to cooperate with regulators from states yet to approve the lbo.
but the news from missouri did not appear in isolation.the website also reported the illinois gaming board had tabled review of penn lbo at its may,meeting and requested additional financial information on the transaction.ja at.the board placed the deal back on the agenda for a closed meeting to be held june and.according to a board spokesperson quoted in the report the license review would not be up for final consideration unless the information the board sought had been provided ja at emphasis added.the illinois gaming board approved the penn buyout on june.the june report from,considered in its entirety,simply belies plaintiffs conclusory allegation that penn had ceased cooperating with state regulators at the time delays in the state regulatory approval process were announced on june,and.what the report reveals is that missouri regulators,in light of changed market conditions and consequent doubts about the penn buyout,were proceeding cautiously in seeking to ascertain the true status of the lbo.
undoubtedly,news of regulatory delays from missouri,as well as from maine and louisiana,did not bolster the market already shaken confidence in the likelihood of the penn buyout closing.given the downturn in the gaming market,the credit crisis,the broader market downward trend,and the consequent fact that many lbos involving domestic targets were in trouble,the postponements did nothing to reassure the market that penn lbo would close.but to conclude these disclosures revealed facts that were related in any manner to the fraudulent nature of penn prior press releases proves too much.the disclosures did not relate back to penn earlier omissions of the alleged truth because they did not even inferentially suggest that penn prior press releases were fraudulent and that the lob would not close.in re williams sec,at.upon the facts pled,the tac the disclosures of june,and,informing the market of delays in the regulatory approval process revealed something about the fraudulent nature of penn prior press releases and the undisclosed knowledge behind unsustainable.
the term unsustainable similarly characterizes the tac conclusion that the information contained in the june,analyst reports from susquehanna and oppenheimer constituted corrective disclosures of penn alleged fraud.the tac simply alleges oppenheimer analysts issued a research report stating the markets have become increasingly convinced that the company acquisition will not be completed.ja at.that statement certainly does not imply that penn had issued fraudulent press releases during the class period by failing to disclose what it supposedly knew about the lbo.and if that were not enough,news that the market had become convinced the lbo would not close as written was hardly novel.with the initial closing date having passed and the revised date looming,that penn stock was trading well below the buyout price of per share said quite enough about the investment risk moreover,the market had been questioning the viability of the lbo since at least the start of february,when the price of penn shares began to steadily decline,reaching a low prior to commencement of the class period of on march,a discount off the buyout price.penn stock had been trading in a similar range just prior to issuance of oppenheimer report.
meanwhile,the susquehanna report,like the lehman brothers report three month prior,declined to predict the lbo outcome given the continuing absence of facts directly related to the deal prospects 
we are suspending our investment rating on.shares have been highly volatile in recent months on unsubstantiated speculation as to whether or not the pending buyout deal will go through.fundamentals are clearly playing no role in the trading of the stock,and handicapping of the deal prospects has become the primary mover of the stock.at this point,there is significant uncertainty as to whether the company will be acquired by the fortress investment group llc and centerbridge partners,for per share w e do not expect more public announcements from the company any time soon.thus,we are suspending our rating until we have more clarity on the prospects of the deal closing.
ja at emphasis added.notably,susquehanna considered numerous possible reasons for the most recent downturn in penn stock price,none of which even remotely hinted at fraud the stock has continued to trade down since last week when news of the hexicon deal to buy huntsman being on the brink of collapsing was announced.there have been no updates from either penn or the buyers,and any opinion about whether or not the deal will close or not close is pure speculation,in our view.ja at emphasis added.susquehanna observed that in addition to the shock waves from the troubled hexicon deal,the current state of the economy had obviously impacted penn stock price.ja at.susquehanna also reported the unfavorable effect that recent smoking bans might have on penn illinois and colorado properties,and the effect that a maryland proposal to legalize slot machines might have on penn west virginia properties.conspicuously absent from susquehanna report is any suggestion that penn,at any point during the previous three months,had issued misleading press releases as a consequence of its refusal to disclose the true facts about the lbo prospects.see lentell,at analyst downgrades did not constitute corrective disclosures because they did not reveal that analysts prior representations were false.what the report revealed was risk as evidenced by its conclusion there is a risk that the deal falls apart and the stock returns to levels.ja at.the unsubstantiated speculation and significant uncertainty surrounding the lbo prospects did not in any sense reveal to the market the alleged fraudulent nature of penn practices over the course of the class period.see metzler inv.gmbh,at.
lastly,the tac alleges penn failure to issue a press release announcing the illinois gaming board approval of the lbo on june,disclosed to the market that penn had misled the market into believing the lbo would close.this,according to the tac,is because penn issued press releases announcing all prior state regulatory approvals of the lbo.plaintiffs essentially ask us to conclude that penn of positive approval of the a corrective disclosure.plaintiffs have not pointed us to any decision that suggests a defendant silence may constitute a corrective disclosure in re williams sec,at i t would be difficult to characterize an announcement that contained no negative information as revelatory of the truth.moreover,we are uncertain how penn failure to issue a press release on june suggests the falsity of press releases issued prior to and including june.we acknowledge penn silence likely further fueled speculation that the lbo death knell would soon sound.but we are at a quandary to understand how speculation about the lbo prospects based on penn failure to issue a press release on june announcing the illinois gaming board approval of the buyout translates into knowledge of the relevant truth,namely that from march,through june,penn issued a series of fraudulent press releases because penn knew then the deal was off.
plaintiffs argue that to sufficiently plead the first component of loss causation,exposure of the relevant truth,the six partially corrective disclosures identified in the tac,considered holistically,need only to alert investors to the fact the merger was off the table.reply brief at emphasis omitted.to that our response is.first,while we suppose such a factual disclosure about the lbo may reveal a part of the relevant truth because the falsity of the eight press releases necessarily depends on the fact penn knew the deal was off,the disclosures identified in the tac,as we have just seen,did not disclose to the market any such fact.of course,one might posit that following the disclosures dissemination the market must have known the deal was off.in re williams sec,at.such sentiment seems particularly apropos in hindsight given the downward trend in penn stock price over the course of the disclosures and penn public announcement of the lbo termination very shortly thereafter.but 
so long as there is a drop in a stock price,a plaintiff will always be able to contend that the market understood a statement precipitating a loss as a coded message revealing fraud.enabling a plaintiff to proceed on such a theory would effectively resurrect what dura loss causation is established through an allegation that a stock was purchased at an inflated price.loss causation requires more.
metzler inv.gmbh,at internal citation omitted.sentiment simply is not enough to sufficiently plead loss causation.speculation and conjecture,even a guess,in the context of market prognostication does not suffice to establish a fact.id.at the tac allegation that the market understood the disclosures as a revelation of systematic manipulation is not a fact.
to be sure,the six purported corrective disclosures identified in the tac alerted investors to the risk that the deal was unlikely to close.but this case is not about materialization of a concealed risk.plaintiffs do not argue that negative investor inferences drawn from the disclosures were a foreseeable materialization of the risk concealed by penn fraudulent press releases in re omnicom group.sec,cir.the market well understood the risk.the alleged disclosures told the market nothing factually about the deal prospects that it had not already heard,repeatedly.we have already discussed the price trend of penn shares over the course of and the lehman brothers report from april,in which lehman declined to predict whether the lbo would close.based upon activity in the options market,lehman brothers at that time estimated at best a probability the deal would close as written.see ja at.two weeks later,on april,reported the penn deal was trading so badly around per share that it could become a foregone conclusion that the buyers seek a price cut or want out of the buyout.ja at.the report noted the fact t hat deutsche bank and wachovia are leading the penn financing does not boost confidence as the buyout comes closer to its funding dates.ja at.similar to susquehanna june report,april report attributed the downward drift in penn stock price in to the state of economic affairs.
second,even assuming the six disclosures revealed that penn knew the lbo would not close,the fact of such knowledge alone would still not suffice.to sufficiently plead loss causation,the tac must have alleged facts suggesting something more.specifically,the tac must have alleged facts to show the disclosures revealed to the market something about the fraudulent nature of the press releases on which plaintiffs purportedly relied to their detriment because only then could the press releases have caused plaintiffs economic loss.see metzler inv.gmbh,at.the fact that penn knew sometime prior to june,that the deal would not close says nothing about its knowledge on or prior to june,when it issued the last of its eight press releases related to the state regulatory process.none of the tac six alleged corrective disclosures even purport to reveal some fact with regard to the specific misrepresentations alleged in the complaint.in re omnicom group.sec,at.the tac fails to adequately plead loss causation because it does not allege facts that suggest penn fraudulent omissions over the course of eight press releases ever became generally known.tricontinental,pricewaterhousecoopers,llp,cir rejecting the argument that the precise fraud that resulted in the underlying transaction need not be the subject of a later corrective disclosure in order to satisfy loss causation.
because the series of six partially corrective disclosures alleged in the tac did not,gradually or otherwise,reveal to the market any undisclosed truth about penn undisclosed knowledge and resulting fraudulent omissions,any subsequent decline in penn share price can not be attributed to those omissions.accordingly,the judgment of the district court is 
i concur in the majority judgment but write separately because i read plaintiffs complaint more broadly than the majority.while it is true that plaintiffs make a securities fraud allegation based,at least in part,on press releases that penn issued between march and june,i believe that plaintiffs claim more generally that penn wrongly failed to disclose that the leveraged buyout would likely not close.
nonetheless,even under my broader reading of the complaint,i agree with the majority judgment that plaintiffs third amended complaint founders.that is because the alleged corrective disclosures tell nothing of the alleged fraud,and,even assuming for the sake of argument that the alleged disclosures did reveal that the leveraged buyout would likely not close,the market had already come to that conclusion.
as the majority notes,the third amended complaint alleges that penn issued seven press releases between march and june,notifying the public of state regulatory approvals.further,on june,penn issued an eighth press release announcing the extension of the leveraged buyout closing date by days,from june to october.the june press release stated that the extension was necessary to secure regulatory approvals from illinois,indiana,louisiana,maine,and missouri.plaintiffs allege that while penn behaved publicly,through these releases,as if the leveraged buyout would close,penn was involved in private discussions with the buyers and financing institutions about the renegotiation or termination of the buyout.
the third amended complaint also alleges more broadly that penn failed to disclose that the buyout might not close.for example,in paragraph plaintiffs contend that d uring the period from march,through june,inclusive,defendants never informed or apprised the investing public of such material developments ongoing termination renegotiation discussions.after explaining that the decision to terminate the buyout had likely occurred by may,plaintiffs allege,in paragraph,that defendants did not previously disclose the potential merger termination to the investing public or,in any way,indicate to the investing public that the purchaser banks were seeking to materially renegotiate the buyout price terminate the previously announced,published and cash agreement.
additionally,in paragraph,plaintiffs allege that after months of undisclosed negotiations between the defendants,purchaser,the financing banks,as well as with each party respective advisors and counsel,the parties waited until july,to finalize the termination and settlement agreement plaintiffs contend in paragraph that defendants deliberately elected not to disclose or apprise the investing public that the original agreement was ever in jeopardy or that termination or modification negotiations were taking place in order to keep penn share prices artificially inflated.per paragraph,penn affirmative misrepresentations,along with the concealments of the ongoing negotiations and discussions influenced plaintiffs and the class to retain purchase additional penn shares.accordingly,per paragraph,b y concealing material information concerning the termination negotiations,defendants were artificially manipulating the open market price and obstructing the operation of the market as indices of the stock true value 
because of these and other allegations in the third amended complaint,i believe that plaintiffs claim more generally that penn wrongly failed to disclose that the leveraged buyout would likely not close.i therefore diverge from the majority suggestion that the alleged securities fraud is tied exclusively to the press releases that penn issued between march and june.
i agree with the majority that affirmative mis statements or can serve as the basis for liability.but so can is,the failure to disclose material facts that the plaintiffs ha ve the right to know.see,affiliated ute citizens of utah united states,it is no answer to urge that,as to some of the petitioners,these defendants may have made no positive representation or recommendation.the defendants may not stand mute when in possession of material information that those buying and selling securities have a right to know.cox collins,cir noting that plaintiffs alleged securities fraud by positive misrepresentation and by nondisclosure of material information and affirming denial of judgment as a matter of law in the face of conflicting evidence regarding the materiality of the alleged omissions and defendant alleged knowledge and intent to deceive.
nevertheless,even read more broadly to encompass penn general failure to disclose that the buyout would likely be terminated,the third amended complaint still fails to successfully plead loss causation.to state a claim for securities fraud under section b of the securities exchange act of and securities and exchange commission rule,a plaintiff must plead a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant scienter a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission economic loss and loss causation that is,the economic lo
