between february and april,ceridian corporation ceridian,then a publicly held company,announced that various accounting errors necessitated multiple amendments and restatements of its published financial statements.the securities and exchange commission began investigating ceridian accounting practices in early.later that year,numerous class action complaints were filed against ceridian and three former corporate officers.the complaints accused defendants of securities fraud that injured investors by artificially inflating ceridian reported earnings and stock price,violating sections b and a of the securities exchange act of,b and a,and sec rule.after the actions were consolidated and lead plaintiffs counsel selected,the district court dismissed the amended consolidated complaint for failure to state a claim because plaintiffs failed to state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant s acted with the required state of mind,as required by the private securities litigation reform act pslra,codified at b.in re ceridian.sec,d.two weeks later,the supreme court clarified this pleading requirement in tellabs,makor issues rights,d.plaintiffs timely appealed without asking the district court to reconsider its ruling in light of tellabs.after careful review of the lengthy complaint,we conclude that the district court thorough and opinion was consistent with both tellabs and controlling eighth circuit decisions.therefore,we affirm.
the pslra did not prescribe a standard of fault for private damage actions under b and rule.rather,congress imposed a heightened requirement for pleading the required state of mind.b.in tellabs,the supreme court confirmed that the substantive standard continues to be scienter,the defendant intention to deceive,manipulate,or defraud.at,quoting ernst ernst hochfelder,d see stoneridge inv.partners,llc,d.in this circuit and others,a plaintiff may satisfy the scienter element with proof of severe recklessness,that is,highly unreasonable omissions or misrepresentations that present a danger of misleading buyers or sellers which is either known to the defendant,or is so obvious that the defendant must have been aware of it.state bd.of admin.green tree fin,cir quotation omitted.the supreme court again left this recklessness issue unresolved in tellabs.at.accordingly,our prior decisions that scienter includes severe recklessness continue to be controlling.see cornelia crowell gst trust possis,cir.
prior to tellabs,we frequently applied the pslra strong inference pleading requirement without defining the quantum of pleaded facts that gives rise to an inference that is strong.see kushner beverly,cir congress did not codify any particular methods of satisfying this heightened pleading requirement green tree,at noting disagreement among other circuits but declining to adopt a particular formulation in re navarre.sec,cir same.the district court accurately summarized our prior decisions on this issue strong means strong.under the pslra,it is not sufficient for the facts alleged to give rise to a weak or plausible or even reasonable inference of scienter.d at.
in resolving a conflict among other circuits,the supreme court in tellabs both confirmed the district court observation that strong means strong,and added an additional hurdle for eighth circuit plaintiffs to overcome to satisfy this pleading requirement.not only must a plaintiff state with particularity facts giving rise to an inference of scienter that is strong when viewed in isolation,the inference must be more than merely plausible or must be cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference of nonfraudulent intent.at emphasis added.we must of course consider the district court decision in light of this supervening controlling decision.
we review the district court dismissal of a securities fraud complaint under the pslra de novo,considering the complaint in its entirety and accepting its fact allegations as true,but also considering plausible opposing inferences.in re nve.sec,cir.in resolving the tellabs case on remand from the supreme court,judge posner observed,to judges raised on notice pleading,the idea of drawing a strong inference from factual allegations is mysterious.makor issues rights,tellabs,cir.but as the seventh circuit recognized,it is an inquiry that must be made,however awkward or unusual,because it has been mandated by congress to remedy widespread abuses of the rule class action device.
plaintiffs consolidated complaint accuses ceridian,chief executive officer ronald turner,chief financial officer john eickhoff,and controller loren gross of a massive accounting scheme to inflate ceridian financial results and its stock price by exploiting a weak or corrupt system of internal controls to commit numerous violations of generally accepted accounting principles gaap.the complaint alleges that ceridian announced that it was restating its financial statements five times in and and that it calibrated the restatements to leak this information in bits and pieces to walk the stock price down,thereby avoiding the catastrophic impact of a single cumulative disclosure of massive accounting violations.as a result,ceridian initial reported earnings were significantly overstated from the third quarter of through the third quarter of.plaintiffs seek to represent investors who purchased ceridian stock between april,when ceridian announced its results for the first quarter of,and march,when ceridian announced that would be restating its financial statements for the first three quarters of 
the district court described the case as a sprawling jumble of a action based on dozens,if not hundreds,of accounting of many different types committed by many different employees over many different years.d at.the restatements resulted from a variety of unrelated errors and rule changes involving numerous accounting to recognize revenues from the sale and servicing of stored value cards used by retailers when to expense rather than capitalize the cost of software may services revenues be recognized before the contract is accepted by the customer and various costs related to those services have been incurred were special restructuring charges in the and and were other accruals misstated the failure to maintain records required to treat derivatives as hedges under special hedge accounting rules improperly offsetting trade receivables against customer advances and customer deposits against related liabilities misclassifying a vendor account payable as a reduction in liabilities rather than an asset misclassifying receivables as current assets how to account for revenues from transactions involving vendors whether to recognize revenues from sales of equipment not yet delivered and accepted misclassifying operating expenses as selling,general,and administrative or research and development expenses failing to accelerate the amortization of a trademark not being used failure to recognize rent increases on a basis over the term of the lease and improperly accounting for acquisitions made in the uk in and in canada in.the district court opinion summarized these errors and the five restatements in detail.see d at.
the district court first rejected plaintiffs primary contention that the sheer number of violations,and the magnitude of the restatements,give rise to an inference that defendants were at least severely reckless.id.at.section b and rule prohibit fraud,not accounting malpractice,the court correctly observed.if one makes a list of the numerous alleged gaap then,with respect to each violation on the list,looks for specific allegations in the complaint linking one of the individual defendants to the will almost invariably come up empty handed.id.at emphasis in original.this analysis is consistent with our prior decisions applying the pslra.see kushner,at allegations of gaap violations are insufficient to state a securities fraud claim unless coupled with evidence of corresponding fraudulent intent.because gaap is an elaborate hierarchy of sources that accountants consult,rather than a canonical set of rules,in re int l.sec,cir quotation omitted,ple
