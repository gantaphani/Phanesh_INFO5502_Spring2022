mary johnson brought this suit against the united states seeking a refund of payments on a federal withholding tax penalty assessed against her under the government counterclaimed against both johnson and her husband,ford johnson,individually,to reduce to judgment the remaining balance of the trust fund recovery penalties assessed against them.the johnsons now appeal the district court grant of summary judgment to the government against each of them.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
the following facts are either uncontroverted,taken in the light most favorable to the johnsons,or have been admitted by the johnsons in their pleadings in,johnson formed a corporation,koba institute,koba institute to perform various government contracts in conjunction with koba associates,koba associates,a corporation that he owned and managed.when koba associates failed to pay its payroll taxes in the mid,the internal revenue service irs assessed trust fund recovery penalties against johnson pursuant to the outstanding payroll taxes,accompanied by the lien subsequently imposed on johnson for the trust fund recovery penalties,ultimately led johnson to close koba associates the presence of the lien severely limited johnson ability to obtain credit for koba institute.
this fiscal reality led johnson to approach johnson about restructuring koba institute so as to facilitate a continuation of their business.in,koba institute converted to a corporation under maryland law,with johnson as its sole shareholder.because johnson was not encumbered by a lien like johnson,her status as the corporation owner enabled koba institute to enter into leases and other contracts,as well as obtain lines of credit based on johnson endorsement.
as the sole shareholder of koba institute,johnson elected herself as chair of the corporation board of directors in.the corporation bylaws require that the chair of the board be elected president of the institute.according to the johnsons,because they had agreed that johnson would be the primary caregiver of the couple children,johnson delegated and entrusted her authority in the corporation to johnson,and thereafter elected johnson president of koba institute on february,notwithstanding the contrary bylaw requirement.see.johnson,in turn,served as the corporation vice president.
the same day that johnson appointed herself as board chair,february,koba institute board of directors comprised of the johnsons and an unrelated corporate secretary unanimously approved the following resolution 
the present holders of the offices of president,vice president,treasurer and secretary are authorized to sign checks,drafts,instruments,and orders for the payment of money from koba institute accounts,to endorse checks,instruments,evidences of indebtedness and orders payable,owned or held by koba institute,and to sign any application,deposit agreement,signature card or other documentation required by the bank of america,with the following limitation that either ford johnson,president of the or mary fogg johnson vice president of the may act alone or with any other named signatory to said accounts in any transactions with the bank however,any transactions which are not signed by either of them must be signed by at least two of the following people 
emphasis added.koba institute payroll account expressly provided that johnson had the power to sign singularly on that account,see also.
having delegated her authority to johnson,johnson actual involvement at koba institute was limited during the through period.nonetheless,she had an office at koba institute and received a significant annual salary ranging from approximately to,as well as a corporate car and cell phone.in addition,the rent for johnson residence,shared with johnson,was provided by koba institute 
in the to period,johnson only came to work once per month.when she did so,she would approve any board resolutions,such as ratification of johnson acts as president,or perform tasks in the human resources department.thus,while johnson may have given an opinion regarding hiring and firing employees during the relevant time frame,johnson made the ultimate decisions regarding employment.see.indeed,because johnson oversaw the corporation operations,other employees viewed him as the one who decides everything and went to johnson rather than johnson with any questions that arose in the business,including financial matters such as the payment of payroll taxes.
when johnson was out of the office,he left explicit instructions for johnson to follow on koba institute business,including which checks to sign in his absence.because of her limited involvement with the corporation daily operations,however,johnson was unaware of the background or the context for these checks and did not feel comfortable signing any checks that johnson had not authorized.accordingly,from through,she never attempted to write checks that johnson had not already approved.
near the end of,johnson received a notice from the irs that koba institute had not paid its payroll taxes for several quarters from through.prior to that time,johnson was unaware that the payroll taxes were unpaid.upon receipt of the notice,she had a serious talk with johnson and told him that the situation was unacceptable and that koba institute had to take steps to make sure that it did not happen again.johnson then fired the finance director,who had been tasked with making payroll tax payments,and directed johnson to personally handle all future tax payments as of january.she required johnson to provide her with visual proof of all withholding tax payments that koba institute subsequently made.additionally,at least with regard to the payroll account,johnson no longer followed the prior procedure for check authorization that is,she no longer required instruction from johnson before writing checks herself from the payroll account for payment of the taxes.
due to johnson revamped oversight of tax payments,koba institute began remitting its post payroll taxes to the irs in full and,generally,on time.the corporation did not,however,pay the outstanding delinquent payroll taxes for the through delinquent periods although it continued to pay its other business debts,such as employee wages and johnson compensation.subsequently,the irs assessed trust fund recovery penalties the penalty against and johnson individually,pursuant to johnson later paid toward her assessed penalty.
on march,johnson filed suit in the united states district court for the district of maryland seeking a refund of the penalty she had paid,asserting that the assessment against her was erroneous the government filed a counterclaim against both of the johnsons in order to reduce its assessments to judgment,seeking to recover the balance of assessments due,including penalties,interest,and costs.based upon transcripts of account showing the balances due as of august,the government ultimately sought to recover from johnson and from johnson.
the government filed separate motions for summary judgment against and johnson,contending that each was liable under as a responsible person who had willfully failed to pay over the withheld payroll taxes.the government supported the assessments with forms certificates of assessments,payments,and other specified matters,noting that the assessments on the forms were presumptively correct and that the burden fell on the johnsons to demonstrate otherwise.the government also moved to strike the reports and testimony of an expert witness the government anticipated the johnsons would rely upon in opposing summary judgment.
the johnsons jointly opposed the government motion to strike,and separately opposed the government motions for summary judgment.johnson also moved for partial summary judgment against the government as to him.
the district court granted the government motions for summary judgment,denied johnson motion for partial summary judgment,and denied the government motion to strike as moot.with respect to johnson,the district court determined that the assessment against him was valid,rejecting his argument that the assessment was not made within the limitations period established by.the district court then concluded that no material issue of disputed fact remained as to johnson.
with respect to johnson,the district court held that she had also failed to show a genuine dispute of material fact regarding her liability.the court determined that johnson was a responsible person at koba institute during the relevant quarters even though her participation in the corporation affairs was minimal,and that she had acted willfully in failing to see to it that the outstanding tax liabilities were paid.
the district court also concluded that the judgment entered against johnson would not result in a double recovery for the government.the court noted the government policy of retaining only one full satisfaction of an underlying tax liability despite it being able to attempt to collect against any responsible party,and reasoned that any potential issues could be avoided through careful drafting of the final judgment order.
finally,the district court denied as moot the government motion to strike the reports of the johnsons expert and to exclude his testimony at trial,finding that in their opposition to the government motions for summary judgment,the johnsons had neither relied upon the expert reports nor produced any evidence to create an issue of material fact that would prohibit the entry of summary judgment against them.
the district court accordingly entered judgment in favor of the government and against johnson for and against johnson for,plus interest in each instance at the rate specified in from august,until payment.the judgment order provided that the judgment would be reduced to the extent that the united states has collected or will collect on those debts pursuant to the offer in compromise it approved with koba institute.the johnsons filed a joint motion to alter,amend,or relieve the judgment,which the district court denied.
the johnsons timely noted this appeal,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
the internal revenue code or the code requires employers to withhold federal social security and income taxes from the wages of their employees.see a,a erwin united states,cir.because the employer holds these taxes as special fund s in trust for the united states,a emphasis added,the withheld amounts are commonly referred to as trust fund taxes,slodov united states,internal quotation marks omitted.
the code assure s compliance by the employer with its obligation to pay trust fund taxes by imposing personal liability on officers or agents of the employer responsible for the employer decisions regarding withholding and payment of the taxes.id.at interpreting.to that end,a of the code provides that a ny person required to collect,truthfully account for,and pay over any tax.who willfully fails to do so shall be personally liable for a penalty equal to the amount of the tax evaded,or not paid over,the penalty.a.although labeled as a penalty,is not primarily a punitive provision as it brings to the government only the same amount to which it was entitled by way of the tax.turnbull united states,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
personal liability for a corporation unpaid trust fund taxes extends to any person who is responsible for collection and payment of those taxes and willfully fail s to see that the taxes are paid.plett united states,cir united states,cir.once the irs assesses a taxpayer for this liability,the taxpayer has the burden of proof at trial on both elements of liability.see,at.
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment to the government,resolving all disputed facts in favor of the taxpayer.see,at.to defeat summary judgment,however,the taxpayer like any other litigant must identify an error of law or a genuine issue of disputed material fact.see.a anderson liberty lobby,see also bouchat balt.ravens football club,cir.i n the absence of disputed material facts,summary judgment represents a favored mechanism to secure the just,speedy,and inexpensive determination of taxpayer liability under.plett,at emphasis in original quoting.
with the foregoing principles in mind,we turn to the claims of error raised on appeal.johnson contends that the grant of summary judgment was erroneous because the assessment of the penalty as to him was under of the code.johnson argues that the grant of summary judgment against her was erroneous because she was neither a person responsible for the payment of koba institute withholding taxes nor willfully failed to do so.lastly,the johnsons posit that the amounts of their respective tax liabilities under were incorrectly calculated because disputed issues of material fact remained to be determined.we consider each argument in turn.
johnson contends that the assessment of the penalty against him was not made within the limitations period set forth in.br.however,johnson argument on brief as to this issue gives no after questioning at oral argument,we are left with no firm guide as to why johnson contends the assessments are.
johnson has not challenged the basis for the district court decision in any meaningful way.see fed.a a requiring argument section of an appellant opening brief to contain appellant contentions and the reasons for them,with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.here,johnson has failed to comply with the dictates of federal rule of appellate procedure a a,as he offers no argument explaining how the district court erred rather,he simply states the issue he wishes to raise and cites several sections of the code,but without analysis of how these statutes would apply to him.as a result,we consider johnson to have abandoned or waived his challenge to the district court determination that the assessment of the penalty against him under was not timely.see edwards city of goldsboro,cir failure to comply with the specific dictates of federal rule of appellate procedure a a with respect to a particular claim triggers abandonment of that claim on appeal.see also oken corcoran,cir michael,concurring in order to preserve an issue on appeal,however,it is not enough to simply assert the claim a party must provide supporting argument.
accordingly,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment against johnson individually.
we next address the argument that the district court erred in granting summary judgment against johnson.specifically,johnson contends that she was not a person responsible for the payment of koba institute withholding taxes and did not willfully fail to pay over those taxes.we must disagree with johnson because the undisputed record shows that she was properly liable for the penalty.
the code defines a responsible person as one required to collect,truthfully account for,and pay over any tax,a emphasis added.the supreme court has interpreted this statutory language to apply to all persons responsible for collection of taxes and not.only to those persons in a position to perform all three of the enumerated duties.slodov,at.thus,the code deems anyone required to collect or account for or remit taxes a responsible person for purposes of.see plett,at.
in determining whether a person is responsible under,we undertake a pragmatic,inquiry focused on the person status,duty,and authority within the corporation.id.the crucial inquiry is whether the person had the effective power to pay the is,whether he or she had the actual authority or ability,in view of his status within the corporation,to pay the taxes owed.id.quoting barnett irs,cir.
because this analysis focuses on substance rather than form,holding a corporate title alone does not render a taxpayer a responsible person,at.while a determination of that status is necessarily,summary judgment is nonetheless appropriate where,in the absence of genuine disputes of material fact,it is clear as a matter of law that the taxpayer satisfies this test and is a responsible person.barnett,at acknowledging that countless courts have found responsibility for purposes of as a matter of law because extensive caselaw narrowly constrains a factfinder province in cases.our analysis is guided by a list of factors common in the case law,such as whether the taxpayer served as an officer of the corporation or a member of its board of directors,controlled the corporation payroll,determined which creditors to pay and when to pay them,participated in the corporation management,had the ability to hire and fire employees,and possessed authority.erwin,at plett,at.
although a party can not be presumed to be a responsible person merely from titular authority,at,status as an officer or director is nevertheless material to this determination,teets united states,fed.cl.johnson had been the corporation sole shareholder since and consequently had the effective power to change the officers and directors as she chose and thereby direct the business of the corporation.separately as both vice president and chair of the board of directors since early,johnson enjoyed considerable actual authority at koba institute.
the corporation bylaws,board resolutions,and banking documents demonstrate that johnson was a responsible person,as it is clear that she had effective control of the corporation,including its finances.see taylor irs,cir holding corporate director and officer a responsible person as a matter of law because he possessed sufficient control over corporate finances,had authority to borrow funds and write checks and thereby had the effective power to pay those taxes quoting barnett,at.the foregoing corporate documents indicate that johnson,while serving as chair of the board,would also serve as president of the corporation,a role that included authority to manage koba institute daily affairs and to execute checks and other legal documents on its behalf.although johnson delegated and entrusted this authority to johnson prior to,see,remaining only minimally involved in the corporation affairs as board chair and vice president,delegation of such authority does not relieve a taxpayer of responsibility under,purcell united states,cir that a taxpayer function in an enterprise is unconnected to financial decision making or tax matters is irrelevant where that individual has the authority to pay or to order the payment of delinquent taxes.erwin,at.a taxpayer may be a responsible person if she had the authority required to exercise significant control over the corporation financial affairs,regardless of whether s he exercised such control in fact.purcell,at concluding that a president and sole shareholder,who was also an authorized signatory on the corporation checking account,was a responsible person even though he had fully delegated all financial duties to another employee.thus,despite delegating her authority to johnson and permitting him to run the corporation daily affairs,johnson remained a responsible person because she had effective control of the corporation and the effective power to direct the corporation business choices,including the withholding and payment of trust fund taxes.
although johnson maintains that any authority she held was merely technical in nature,the undisputed evidence establishes that she possessed both legal and actual authority over koba institute.see united states landau,cir if taxpayer fails to show a genuine dispute of material fact on nature of authority,the court may reasonably conclude that the documentary evidence of authority reflects the reality.johnson voluntary minimal involvement in daily corporate affairs before,however,and assertions that johnson exercised all daily operating authority fail to create a genuine dispute of material fact regarding limitations on her effective power as to the trust fund taxes.any deferral by johnson in the exercise of her authority never altered the fact that she possessed effective power over koba institute at all times.see barnett,at.indeed,johnson actions immediately after learning of the tax delinquencies in december a period that cast s light on her responsibility from through demonstrate that her actual authority was with the legal authority she possessed.erwin,at.
johnson admits in her pleadings that she fired the finance director,the employee tasked with making payroll tax payments,as soon as she discovered that koba institute had not remitted these taxes as required by law.she also directed johnson to personally handle all future tax payments as of january and required him to provide her with visual proof of all tax payments the corporation made.these admissions indicate that johnson status in the corporation during the quarters at issue enabled her to have substantial input into its financial decisions from through,had s he wished to exert her authority.barnett,at quotation marks omitted.
moreover,the fact that,from through,johnson followed the corporation internal policy and did not write checks without knowing that johnson had previously approved them does not negate responsible person status.see.although she followed corporate procedure without exception during that time,it is undisputed that johnson ceased following this policy almost immediately upon learning of the payroll tax deficiencies and could have done so at any earlier time.following her revamped oversight of tax payments,johnson would write checks from the payroll account without any instruction from johnson.accordingly,the fact that johnson previously chose not to write checks without johnson approval does not show that she was prevented earlier from doing so other than by her own choice.see,thosteson united states,cir holding corporate officer and stockholder a responsible person as a matter of law even though he had limited check writing authority,up to only,without a countersignature lyon united states,app x,cir unpublished per curiam the fact that the taxpayer chose not to exercise his legal authority is not enough to show that he had no actual authority he has not demonstrated that his father actually prevented him,or that he could have prevented him,from paying the taxes if he had attempted to do so.the record also indicates that koba institute opened several operating accounts between and,and that on each of those accounts,johnson was fully authorized to write checks and execute other bank documents.
while she may not have been running the operations of the corporation between and,johnson had a responsibility to monitor koba institute financial affairs.see barnett,at w e believe that not only is it a bad business practice for a company official such as johnson to fail to monitor the corporation finances,it also subjects her to being held a responsible party under.johnson had the effective power to exercise authority when she chose to do so,even though she chose at times to voluntarily limit her involvement in corporate affairs.although johnson often chose not to exercise the authority which she possessed,such a decision is insufficient to permit a taxpayer to avoid responsibility.see kinnie united states,f d,cir stating that a taxpayer need not always exercise his powers to remain responsible for seeing that withholding taxes are paid,and may not escape liability by delegating the task of paying over the taxes to someone else.moreover,after,while the prior periods payroll taxes remained unpaid,johnson actively exercised her authority over the affairs of koba institute while continuing to receive substantial compensation and benefits from the corporation 
we therefore conclude that the government presented undisputed evidence that established as a matter of law that johnson was a responsible person under during the relevant tax periods because she had the effective power to pay the trust fund taxes of koba institute 
having found johnson a responsible person,we turn to the other necessary element of liability,whether she willfully failed to collect,account for,or remit payroll taxes to the united states.a plett,at.this inquiry focuses on whether johnson had knowledge of nonpayment or reckless disregard of whether the payments were being made.plett,at quoting turpin united states,cir.
johnson contends that she did not act willfully in failing to remit koba institute delinquent payroll taxes because she did not learn of the deficiency until the irs notified her in december.this argument,however,overlooks that a taxpayer may act
