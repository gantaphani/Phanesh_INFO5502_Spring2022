this case presents a purely legal question whether c permits the imposition of legal fees on an attorney who erroneously removes a case from state to federal court.the district court held that it does not.we affirm.
this case began in maryland state court in february.several entities with an ownership stake in crescent city estates,llc collectively,appellants brought a derivative suit against defendants crescent city estates,llc and its managers,alleging that the managers had not accounted properly for approximately to million in insurance proceeds.in connection with the litigation,defendants retained as legal counsel the appellees in this case attorneys douglas draper and william murphy.
about six months after the suit commencement,defendants removed the state court action to the united states bankruptcy court for the district court of maryland.as lawyers for the defendants,appellees signed the notice of removal.shortly thereafter,appellants filed a motion to remand the case back to state court.in doing so,appellants sought attorneys fees for improper removal under c,which allows a court to require payment of attorney fees incurred as a result of removal.notably,appellants sought attorneys fees both from defendants and from their attorneys,the appellees.
the attorneys argued that they could not be liable,claiming that c authorized the imposition of attorneys fees only against removing parties and not against removing attorneys.the federal bankruptcy court,however,disagreed.it held that,as a matter of law,c applied both to parties and to attorneys.appellees sought immediate review,and on interlocutory appeal,the united states district court for the district of maryland reversed.crescent city estates,llc mr crescent city,llc in re crescent city,wl.after examining statutory text,legislative history,and relevant case law,the district court concluded that c gave authority to impose liability for costs including legal fees upon parties but not attorneys.id.at.appellants now ask us to reverse the district court decision.
the statute,c,states in relevant part an order remanding an erroneously removed case may require payment of just costs and any actual expenses,including attorney fees,incurred as a result of removal.the statute,however,does not state expressly who may be required to make such payment.appellants contend that both removing parties and their lawyers are liable,while appellees assert that only removing parties are liable.
as of yet,no circuit court has confronted this issue,and the district courts that have addressed it are badly divided.compare creek ventures,llc world parts,llc,wl,at,holding that c does not apply to counsel marketplace illustrated intrex travel,wl,at,same,with peraza mazak,wl,at,holding that c applies to counsel saxon thomas,wl,at,same,aff by wl.june,game time laser tag adventure,llc millsservices,wl,at,same wisconsin missionaries to the preborn,same polanco arden realty,same.
appellants argue that because c does not explicitly prohibit a fee award against counsel,it thereby permits it.appellants,however,have the presumption reversed.the proper presumption is that when a statute does not explicitly permit a fee award against counsel,it prohibits it.in short,silence does not equal consent.because we find that the presumption is not overcome in this case,we accordingly hold that c does not apply to counsel.
the presumption that statutes apply only to parties unless they expressly state otherwise is consistent with the american rule.under the american rule,the prevailing litigant is ordinarily not entitled to collect a reasonable attorneys fee from the loser.alyeska pipeline serv.wilderness soc y,d.in other words,the american rule creates a presumption that parties bear their own legal costs,win or lose.fogerty fantasy,d.the american rule presumption can be further subdivided into two distinct underlying premises first,that parties bear their own legal fees and second,that parties bear legal fees.
congress is,of course,free to alter either or both of these premises through legislation.see id.however,departures from the american rule require explicit statutory authority.see buckhannon bd.care home,west virginia dep t of health human,d.in other words,if congress wishes to overcome either premise underlying the american rule,it must express its intent to do so clearly and directly.this is because the american rule is a longstanding legal principle,see key tronic united states,d,and one deeply rooted in our nation common law tradition,with origins dating back perhaps as early as.alyeska pipeline,at.citing arcambel wiseman,dall.and i n order to abrogate a principle,the statute must speak directly to the question addressed by the common law.united states texas,d.
absent explicit authorization from congress,it is our duty to keep the american rule intact.congress ha s not extended any roving authority to the judiciary to allow counsel fees whenever the courts might deem them warranted.buckhannon,at.citing alyeska pipeline,at.because statutes are in derogation of the common law,courts are obligated to construe them strictly,rowe fid.guar,cir,employing a presumption favoring the retention of and familiar principles,except when a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident,isbrandtsen johnson.this means that unless there is at least some indication that congress intended attorneys to pay under c,we will apply the american rule presumption that parties pay.
in this case,it is undisputed that congress intended c to modify the american rule in part.section c is,after all,a statute.see martin franklin capital,d.thus,the parties agree that c was meant to overcome the first premise underlying the american rule that parties bear their own legal fees,thereby enabling courts to shift fees from the prevailing party here,the party successfully obtaining remand to the losing party here,the party erroneously attempting removal.appellees argue that c stops there,leaving undisturbed the second premise of the american rule that parties bear legal fees.that is,whether prevailing or losing,it is nonetheless bear attorneys fees.appellants,on the other hand,would have us depart from the american rule more radically,by shifting fees not merely from a prevailing litigant to a losing litigant,but from a prevailing litigant to a losing attorney.under this view,c reverses both parts of the american rule presumption,shifting fees and introducing a new payer.
we see no justification for the dramatic deviation from the american rule advocated by appellants.neither c text nor its legislative history is sufficient to overcome the american rule presumption that parties rather than attorneys are liable for attorneys fees.first,the text of c makes no explicit mention of counsel.and because congress legislates against the strong background of the american rule,fogerty fantasy,d,the fact that congress did not explicitly exclude counsel from the reach of c is no indication of congressional intent to include counsel.congress knows that in order to demonstrate an inten t to set aside th e longstanding american r ule,m ere generalized commands will not suffice to authorize fees.key tronic,at.citations and internal quotations omitted.indeed,congress has shown that when it wants to make attorneys liable under statutes,it will do so expressly.for instance,in,congress unambiguously empowered courts to require a ny attorney who so multiples the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously to satisfy personally the excess costs,expenses,and attorneys fees reasonably incurred because of such conduct.the omission of comparable express authorization in c thus strongly suggest s a deliberate decision not to authorize such awards.see key tronic,at.
although the statutory text does not explicitly forbid fee awards against counsel,it does so implicitly.the statute speaks,by implication,only to parties.section c allows a court to impose a fee award in a n order remanding the case,which,as the district court noted,would normally,if not inevitably,be contemplated as one that pertains to parties and not counsel.crescent city,wl,at.the most natural reading of c is that i
