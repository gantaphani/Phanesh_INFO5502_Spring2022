steven amato appeals the denial of his motion to quash two administrative subpoenas duces tecum served on him as custodian of records for two corporations in which he was the sole shareholder,director,officer and employee.we affirm.
amato is a chiropractor in damariscotta,maine.he has conducted his chiropractor business as a sole proprietorship and as a corporation.in october,amato incorporated the business as steven amato,amato in new york and is amato sole shareholder,director,officer and employee.in september,amato incorporated,mainecures in maine.a year later,maine dissolved mainecures for failing to file an annual report.amato was mainecures sole shareholder,director,officer and employee.
in january,law enforcement,acting under the authority of a search warrant,searched amato office for evidence of federal crimes.during the search,law enforcement served two administrative subpoenas duces tecum on amato as the records custodian of amato and mainecures.see.the subpoenas required the records custodian to appear with the records at the united states attorney office or,in lieu of an appearance,to deliver the records with certificates of authenticity to the united states attorney office.
amato moved to quash the subpoenas.amato argued that the doctrine protects production of the records because the testimonial aspects of the production would incriminate him recognizing the doctrine amato nevertheless asserted that the doctrine controls in his case.for support,amato invoked a footnote in braswell united states that left open the question of whether the doctrine would apply if the custodian of corporate records is able to establish,by showing for example that he is the sole employee and officer of the corporation,that the jury would inevitably conclude that he produced the records,d.because amato is his corporations sole shareholder,director,officer and employee,he asserted his personal fifth amendment privilege against producing the corporate records.amato also argued that mainecures records are privileged because mainecures was a dissolved corporation.
in considering the motion to quash,the magistrate judge recognized that the doctrine has not provided fifth amendment protection to custodians of corporate records because custodians act in their representative,rather than their personal,capacities when complying with a subpoena directed at the corporation.the magistrate judge declined to recognize an exception to the doctrine that would fit amato situation he is the target of an investigation,the custodian of records,and the corporation sole shareholder,director,officer and employee.the judge reasoned that the first circuit has rejected such an exception,see united states lawn builders of new,cir in re grand jury proceedings the john doe,cir,and concluded that braswell footnote does not contradict the first circuit holdings.the magistrate judge also rebuffed amato argument that mainecures records are privileged because the records now belong to amato sole proprietorship,mainecures having been dissolved before the subpoena issued.the judge concluded that maine law dictates that a dissolved corporation exists for up to three years after dissolution to wind up its business affairs.thus,the judge held that no fifth amendment privilege guards against the subpoena directed at mainecures custodian of records.
adopting the magistrate judge view of the matter,the district court denied amato motion to quash.after the district court further denied a motion to stay enforcement of the subpoenas pending appeal,amato attorney produced the records and the certificates of authenticity,but stated that amato did not waive his constitutional rights by complying with the subpoenas.
amato appeals,contending that the fifth amendment protects a sole employee corporate entity from compulsory arising from the act of producing materials pursuant to an administrative subpoena.amato also contends that mainecures records should be treated as records of amato sole proprietorship and that as such,they enjoy fifth amendment protection from production.
denials of motions to quash are reviewed for abuse of discretion.in re grand jury subpoena,cir,cert.denied,d.because amato contends that the district court operated under an erroneous view of the law,we review de novo the district court legal analysis.id.
the fifth amendment guarantees that no person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.const.amend the word witness in the constitutional text limits the relevant category of compelled incriminating communications to those that are testimonial in character.united states hubbell,d.a corporation does not enjoy the privilege against guaranteed by the fifth amendment,as the privilege is a personal privilege enjoyed by natural individuals.see braswell,at.acknowledging the rule that such artificial entities as corporations are not protected by the fifth amendment united states white.explaining that the constitutional privilege against is essentially a personal one,applying only to natural individuals.furthermore,the contents of corporate records generally do not enjoy fifth amendment protection.see braswell,at.united states doe,d.the rationale underpinning these principles is that the fifth amendment privilege against is designed to prevent the use of legal process to force from the lips of the accused individual the evidence necessary to convict him or to force him to produce and authenticate any personal documents or effects that might incriminate him.white,at.
in addition,the supreme court has long held that the doctrine precludes a custodian of corporate records from relying on the fifth amendment to block the production of those records.see bellis united states,d explaining that a long line of cases has established that an individual can not rely upon the fifth amendment privilege to avoid producing the records of a collective entity which are in his possession in a representative capacity,even if these records might incriminate him personally.the court in braswell stated that its cases applying the doctrine hold that without regard to whether the subpoena is addressed to the corporation,or to the individual in his capacity as a custodian,a corporate custodian may not resist a subpoena for corporate records on fifth amendment grounds.at.citations omitted.finally,the supreme court has stated that law applying the doctrine holds that custodians of corporate records have no fifth amendment privilege,regardless of how small the corporation may be.bellis,at.
despite the doctrine far reach,cases such as the instant case must confront the doctrine.the doctrine recognizes that although the fifth amendment does not independently proscribe the compelled production of every sort of incriminating evidence,it does apply when the accused is compelled to make a testimonial communication that is incriminating.fisher united states,d.the supreme court has expressed its concerns over the testimonial nature of acts of production 
the act of producing evidence in response to a subpoena has communicative aspects of its own,wholly aside from the contents of the papers produced.compliance with the subpoena tacitly concedes the existence of the papers demanded and their possession or control by the individual producing the records.it also would indicate the individual belief that the papers are those described in the subpoena.the elements of compulsion are clearly present,but the more difficult issues are whether the tacit averments of the individual are both testimonial and incriminating for purposes of applying the fifth amendment.these questions perhaps do not lend themselves to categorical answers their resolution may instead depend on the facts and circumstances of particular cases 
id.at.citation omitted doe,at.stating that a lthough the contents of a document may not be privileged,the act of producing the document may be because the holder of the document is compelled to perform an act that may have testimonial aspects and an incriminating effect concluding that the district court did not err in finding that a sole proprietor act of producing subpoenaed busines
