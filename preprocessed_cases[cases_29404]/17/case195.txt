dennis imwalle became president of reliance medical products,in.he was fired in january of,three months after he filed a charge with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc that alleged both age and discrimination.he was years old at the time his employment ended.imwalle suit in the district court resulted in a jury verdict for compensatory damages based on his claim that he was fired in retaliation for filing his discrimination claims.the court subsequently awarded him approximately more in attorney fees,costs,and prejudgment interest.
reliance and its affiliated companies have appealed,challenging both the district court denial of their motion for judgment as a matter of law and the amount of the award for attorney fees and costs.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
a.the companies 
holding ag hsh ag is a holding company based in bern,switzerland that has subsidiaries located in the united states and throughout europe.the companies are providers of medical instruments and equipment for ophthalmologists,optometrists,and opticians.hsh ag acquired reliance,a company based in mason,ohio,in.ten years later,hsh ag consolidated all of its operations,including reliance,under holding us,hsh us.hsh ag distribution moeller microsurgical,moeller,service,clement clarke,and interzeag,consolidated at that time to form usa,hs usa,a subsidiary of hsh that is also located in mason.reliance was not included in that consolidation.as a result,reliance and hs usa are each a direct subsidiary of hsh us.all of the defendants are hereafter collectively referred to as.
b.the individual parties 
imwalle,a citizen who was born on august,was hired as president of reliance in may of.his employment agreement automatically renewed each year in the absence of any proper notice to the contrary.in july of,imwalle also became president of hsh us,reliance parent company,and,a month later,was named vice president vp and chief operating officer coo of hs usa.prior to,imwalle had no role in any of the companies other than reliance.he continued to serve as president of reliance at all times relevant to this lawsuit.
throughout his employment,imwalle reported to walter inabnit,a swiss national who was chairman of hsh ag,hsh us,hs usa,and reliance,and who also served as president of hs usa.rene ott,also a swiss national,became coo of hsh ag in april of.in that capacity,ott was responsible for the operations of all of hsh ag subsidiaries and was imwalle immediate boss.dominick beck,a swiss national,replaced inabnit as president of hs usa in january of.thereafter,imwalle no longer served as vp of hs usa,but he continued to hold the positions of president of reliance,president of hsh us,and coo of hs usa.
reliance success under imwalle 
imwalle testified that when he became president of reliance in,the company facilities were a dump,production flow was terrible,and the company was nothing and a nobody.following imwalle arrival,the company built a facility and obtained independent certification attesting to the company compliance with international standards.imwalle,ott,independent auditor richard batterberry,and human resources director roy grandstaff all testified that reliance operated on budget,doubled its sales,and saw profits increase while imwalle was president.
batterberry and grandstaff also acknowledged that reliance was always profitable,a very successful part of the business,and very well controlled while imwalle was president.grandstaff testified that last full year with the highest volume sales year in the plus year history of the company.inabnit and ott both said that they were satisfied with imwalle performance as president of reliance.
does not dispute the foregoing,but highlights the fact that reliance saw its sales decline by in the early months of.imwalle attributed the sales slump to a wider economic recession.ott was dissatisfied with that explanation,however,and blamed imwalle for failing to foresee the recession and minimize its effects on the company.but ott acknowledged at trial that there was an official recession in the united states in march of.he also testified that the decline in sales lasted until may of,after which reliance sales and profits rebounded.
moeller problems identified 
argues that inabnit and ott had a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for imwalle termination poor performance by imwalle,citing accounting and inventory problems at moeller.imwalle does not dispute contention that such problems plagued moeller.instead,he argues that this explanation was simply a pretext designed to mask retaliation for his complaints of discrimination.in support of his case,imwalle introduced evidence to show that he was not responsible for moeller problems and that he in fact tried to fix them.
moeller,a company,was originally formed in new jersey in as a distribution company for,a german company.hs usa acquired the company in and made it a division.moeller was in financial distress at the time of the acquisition and was virtually bankrupt within two years.in july of,inabnit and imwalle met with the managing director of a hsh ag subsidiary in germany to discuss a major problem involving moeller.according to hsh ag independent auditor batterberry,moeller had an enormous amount of obsolete inventory onsite that require d write offs of approximately million.this problem was exacerbated by the fact that moeller did not employ an accountant,had not established any inventory controls,and had no system to track inventory.batterberry detailed moeller problems in a letter dated january,just one day after imwalle was terminated as follows 
the magnitude of the poor operating results of this division is staggering for a business of its size.this continuing pattern of substantial losses is something that we very rarely see with our other audit clients.this history was certainly compounded by the magnitude of the adjustments needed in the past several years to adjust for prior years inventory deficiencies while there were a number of issues,the major business problem always seemed to be the low volume of sales which never allowed the moller sic division to break even on a financial basis as your auditors,we found it curious that so many difficult issues plagued the moller microscope division that were not found in other parts of the operation.except for the moller microscope division,we have found that sic internal controls to be generally effective,accounting systems to be functioning in a very acceptable manner,and personnel to be helpful to us as auditors and conscientious in performing their responsibilities.
the letter went on to explain that,in addition to the million,the continuing problems at moeller could be traced to the way in which moeller employees managed sales,purchasing,inventory tracking,and financial controls on a basis.
following the july meeting,inabnit asked imwalle to dig in and review procedures at moeller.batterberry confirmed that imwalle and dave edenfield,the chief financial officer cfo of hs usa,were able to implement procedures and controls at the moller sic division that were in effect at the other divisions the moeller problems persisted,however,and,in the spring of,inabnit told imwalle that he was very disappointed with the continuation of the moeller inventory issues.
inabnit and ott repeatedly told imwalle that he was responsible for the inventory problems at moeller and they expressed frustration that the problems continued to plague the company.although inabnit and ott repeatedly blamed imwalle for the moeller problems,ott later testified that a prior vp of sales was responsible for the inventory mess.batterberry,in his january letter,blamed the vp of sales,ed rae,and moeller personnel generally,for careless management,while emphasizing imwalle and edenfield role in trying to solve the problems.
in june of,imwalle attended management meetings in bern,switzerland and recommended,along with others,that the moeller division be closed.he testified that when he left the meeting,he thought that a consensus had been reached to close operations,only to learn later that inabnit had overruled the decision.thereafter,imwalle says that he was excluded from meetings related to moeller.ott testified that moeller was in fact eventually closed at the recommendation of hs usa president beck,who told ott that moeller did not fit into usa wholesale structure.
introduced evidence that,from about to,inabnit and ott continued to express frustration about the moeller operation to imwalle and blamed him for a variety of other problems,including personnel issues and dissatisfaction with public relations and promotions.they also voiced concerns about the sales ledger being updated and imwalle calculation of his and his team bonuses for.ott and inabnit primary concern,however,remained the problems at moeller.
imwalle asked to resign 
claims that b etween january and may,inabnit and ott decided to terminate imwalle for poor performance.it asserts that the decision was based on an accumulation of concerns,including the moeller inventory problems.on may,ott told imwalle that needed a leadership change at the top and asked imwalle to sign a previously prepared resignation letter.the letter stated that,effective august,imwalle would resign as president of hsh us,as coo of hs usa,and as president of reliance.
according to,imwalle refused to sign the letter,challeng ing ott to fire him on the spot.ott then suggested that imwalle could remain as president of reliance at a greatly reduced salary and asked imwalle to make him an offer.imwalle told ott that he wanted to see an attorney first,but that he would respond before may.the request for his resignation,imwalle testified,took him by surprise 
there were previous incidents,especially the meeting in berne sic,the progressive moving me out of the management of usa,the exclusion from the moeller meetings.i was allowed to go to the annual aao meeting,which was in orlando that year.and those kinds of signs give you notice of an approaching storm but you never know when it is going to hit,and i had no reprimand.i thought the first that would happen would be that.
on may,imwalle attorney sent a letter to ott,claiming that imwalle had been discriminated against on the basis of his age and referencing imwalle employment agreement.ott said he was very surprised by the letter because he had not been aware that had an employment contract with imwalle.acknowledges that inabnit and ott,upon learning of imwalle employment agreement,decided to accept imwalle employment agreement and follow it percent by paying imwalle through the end of the contract,even though they were aware that the agreement allowed for immediate termination.
imwalle contract was scheduled for renewal in june of.ott testified that he did want to fire imwalle in may of.that was not the intention.i wanted to stabilize the company.ott explained that he and inabnit decided to allow imwalle to continue working at reliance for an indeterminate period of time to get some value in return for paying his salary under the employment agreement.as a result,imwalle remained president of reliance and retained his position with hsh us.
imwalle and ott both testified that,after may of,imwalle continued to perform his job at reliance as he had for the past years.but imwalle also testified that an atmosphere of retaliation existed in,following his attorney may letter alleging age discrimination by.he said that,after may of,he was more or less divorced from the activities at moeller microsurgical and usa.imwalle also claimed that he was excluded from meetings and that key decisions were made without his input or knowledge.as an example of his exclusion,imwalle cites decision in july or august of to finally close down the moeller operation.imwalle said that he was not involved in the decision,even though he was still coo of hs usa and president of hsh at that time,and had previously recommended closing moeller.does not dispute imwalle lack of involvement in the decision.
on october,imwalle filed a charge of age and discrimination with the eeoc.imwalle points to several incidents involving inabnit and ott that allegedly reflect their biases against both elderly persons and americans.in support of his claim of age discrimination,imwalle testified,and ott acknowledged,that at the management meeting in bern,switzerland,ott suggested that d ismiss people if possible elderly people as a way of addressing the company financial problems.the elderly people comment appeared in the powerpoint slide presentation that ott gave at the bern meeting.
imwalle testified that he was stunned upon seeing that statement in ott presentation because this dangerous situation applied to usa,and i was the elderly coo of usa and when the gun is pointed at you,you freeze i have never seen anything so disgusting.imwalle was years old at the time.ott said that he and imwalle later discussed imwalle concerns about dismissing elderly people,and that imwalle told him that such action could violate employment laws.ott explained that he never understood why this recommendation to dismiss elderly people suddenly appears to one line,in a huge presentation,suddenly appears as being such a big issue.i still have a problem with this.
switzerland does not have laws,and ott said that he did know about at what age this laws sic protecting against age discrimination would apply and so i did know that this recommendation is illegal concerning imwalle.imwalle also testified that,at the may,meeting where he was asked to resign,ott told imwalle that when i reach your age,i hope to retire and perform community work.
in support of his claim of discrimination,imwalle alleged that inabnit told him during a business trip in that his biggest mistake was hiring an american manager meaning plaintiff.i will never make that mistake again.alternation in original.although disputes this allegation,the district court observed that since the time that inabnit purportedly made the statement,no other manager had been hired by the group.inabnit also testified that he and his family loved the united states,but that sometimes we have surmised the feeling that we are,and sometimes i feel,discriminated against.he also expressed frustration at american laws we have to fill out forms.we have to mark something,we will not kill the president or whatever.and we are questioned.we are searched.i feel discriminated against by america.in a similar vein,ott testified that it is a very strange feeling and very,very hard for him to be accused of retaliation and discrimination by imwalle because he has to defend against something i never committed.
imwalle termination 
on january,three months after imwalle filed his complaint of discrimination with the eeoc,ott presented imwalle with a termination letter stating that,effective immediately,imwalle had been removed as president of reliance and of hsh us.reliance gave notice in the letter of its intent not to renew imwalle employment agreement beyond june,the expiration of the term of the agreement.until that time,the letter stated,imwalle would remain an employee or consultant of reliance with the sole responsibility of meeting once a week with hs usa president dominick beck to consult on matters of beck choice.
according to human resources director roy grandstaff notes,ott began the january,meeting by reading the following written statement,which he had prepared in advance dennis,i know that you know that hs never committed discrimination in the past,at present,and will not in the future.i therefore canot sic understand why you raise such a claim.we are not discriminatory,just not.at the end of the brief meeting,imwalle handed over his office keys and company credit card.he left the office that day and never returned.pursuant to the severance provisions in his employment agreement,imwalle received his salary and benefits through august of.
procedural history 
imwalle filed suit in april of against reliance hsh us,reliance parent company hsh ag,hsh us parent company and hs usa,a subsidiary of hsh and affiliate of reliance.as previously noted,the foregoing companies are collectively referred to in this opinion as.he asserted nine claims relating to his allegations of age and discrimination and of retaliation.after dismissing two claims on summary judgment,the district court submitted the rest to the jury.after a trial on the merits,the jury returned a verdict in favor of imwalle on his retaliation claims and awarded him in compensatory damages.the jury found for on the claims of discrimination.
then filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law on the retaliation claims,which the district court denied.the district court also awarded attorney fees,costs,and prejudgment interest to imwalle that totaled approximately.
appeals the district court denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law and challenges the district court award of attorney fees and costs.it argues that imwalle failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation or prove that proffered reason for terminating imwalle was a pretext to hide retaliation.

retaliation claims under title vii,the adea,and ohio state law 
title vii forbids an employer from discriminat ing against any of his employees because the employee has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by title vii,or because the employee has made a charge,testified,assisted,or participated in any manner in an investigation,proceeding,or hearing under title vii.a.unlawful employment practices under title vii include any actions taken on the basis of race,color,religion,sex,or national origin that discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment.
the age discrimination in employment act the adea similarly prohibits an employer from discriminat ing against any of his employees because such individual has made a charge,testified,assisted,or participated in any manner in an investigation,proceeding,or litigation under this act.d.section i of the ohio revised code likewise makes it unlawful for 
any person to discriminate in any manner against any other person because that person has opposed any unlawful discriminatory practice defined in this section or because that person has made a charge,testified,assisted,or participated in any manner in any investigation,proceeding,or hearing under sections to of the revised code.
a plaintiff in a title vii or adea action may establish retaliation either by introducing direct evidence of retaliation or by proffering circumstantial evidence that would support an inference of retaliation.dicarlo potter,cir.direct evidence is that evidence which,if believed,requires no inferences to conclude that unlawful retaliation was a motivating factor in the employer action.abbott crown motor,cir finding that the plaintiff evidence was circumstantial where it would not require the conclusion that defendant unlawfully retaliated against plaintiff rather,one could draw that conclusion only by making a series of inferences from plaintiff evidence christopher stouder mem l,cir holding that the plaintiff had no need to prove pretext where she presented,and the factfinder believed,that her supervisors informed her and told others that their actions were taken in response to her protected activity.
in the present case,imwalle did not present any direct evidence of retaliation,such as an explicit statement from that it was firing him in response to his discrimination claims.he instead advanced a circumstantial case for retaliation.
when a plaintiff presents only circumstantial evidence,we examine title vii,adea,and ohio retaliation claims under the same mcdonnell evidentiary framework that is used to assess claims of discrimination.wrenn gould,cir applying mcdonnell douglas green,d,and texas department of community affairs burdine,d,to a retaliation claim mitchell toledo,cir the mcdonnell formula is the evidentiary framework applicable not only to claims brought under title vii,but also to claims under adea.minadeo ici paints,cir holding that the adea analysis is applicable to claims brought pursuant to ohio law.
the plaintiff has the initial burden under the mcdonnell framework to establish a prima facie case of retaliation by showing that he engaged in protected activity,this exercise of his protected civil rights was known to the defendant,the defendant thereafter took an employment action adverse to the plaintiff,and there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.see eeoc avery dennison,cir.
the burden then shifts to the employer to produce evidence of a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for its actions once the plaintiff presents sufficient evidence to make out a prima facie case.avery dennison,at citing burdine,at.if the defendant satisfies this burden,the plaintiff must then demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reason offered by the defendant was not its true reason,but instead was a pretext designed to mask retaliation.id.
in order to prevail on a claim of retaliation where the defendant has articulated a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action,the plaintiff must prove not only that the defendant proffered reason was a pretext,but that the real reason for the employer action was intentional retaliation.id.citing mary honor ctr.hicks,d.the supreme court has held,however,that it is permissible for the trier of fact to infer the ultimate fact of discrimination from the falsity of the employer explanation.reeves sanderson plumbing,d.in reeves,the supreme court explained that 
p roof that the defendant explanation is unworthy of credence is simply one form of circumstantial evidence that is probative of intentional discrimination,and it may be quite persuasive.see mary,at.p roving the employer reason false becomes part of and often considerably assists the greater enterprise of proving that the real reason was intentional discrimination thus,a plaintiff prima facie case,combined with sufficient evidence to find that the employer asserted justification is false,may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the employer unlawfully discriminated.
applying the foregoing principles to a retaliation claim,this court has held that a plaintiff prima facie case,combined with disbelief of the defendant proffered reasons for the negative employment action,permits a finding of retaliation by the factfinder.see abbott,at citing mary,at.kline.valley,cir discussing the import of the mary honor ctr.hicks holding in this circuit.the supreme court in reeves held that o nce the employer justification has been eliminated,discrimination may well be the most likely alternative explanation,especially since the employer is in the best position to put forth the actual reason for its decision.reeves,at.
in manzer diamond shamrock chemicals,cir,this court identified three ways in which a plaintiff may rebut a defendant legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason and demonstrate pretext.the plaintiff may show that the employer stated reason for terminating the employee has no basis in fact,the reason offered for terminating the employee was not the actual reason for the termination,or the reason offered was insufficient to explain the employer action.id.regardless of which rebuttal method is employed,the plaintiff retains the ultimate burden of producing sufficient evidence from which the jury could reasonably reject the defendants explanation and infer that the defendants intentionally discriminated against him.johnson kroger,cir alteration in original.the jury may not reject an employer explanation unless there is a sufficient basis in the evidence for doing so.manzer,at holding that the plaintiff must produce sufficient evidence from which the jury may reasonably reject the employer explanation emphasis in original.
argues that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law because imwalle failed to establish a prima facie case.both the supreme court and this court,however,have held that a party framing its argument on appeal in prima facie terms,after a jury trial on the merits,has unnecessarily evaded the ultimate question of discrimination vel non.postal serv.bd.of governors aikens,d italics in original eeoc avery dennison,cir following a trial on the merits,the district court,therefore,can not return to a consideration of whether plaintiff has proven its prima facie case.this is a preliminary matter which can not be revisited at a later time.our duty at this stage of the proceedings is therefore to determine the ultimate question whether imwalle produced sufficient evidence to support the jury finding that terminated his employment in retaliation for his complaints of age and discrimination.see avery dennison,at the proper inquiry following the presentation of all evidence in a title vii case is whether the plaintiff has proven its case by a preponderance under the mcdonnell.mary burden shifting framework.
accordingly,we can not simply hold that imwalle failure to provide evidence of an essential element of his prima facie case is dispositive here.see tisdale fed.express,cir explaining the proper analysis where the defendant challenges the plaintiff prima facie case of retaliation following a jury verdict.in reaching our determination on the ultimate question of retaliation,we may review all of the evidence in the record,including the evidence supporting imwalle prima facie case.see reeves,at.
this is not to say,however,that a plaintiff failure to present evidence sufficient to make out a prima facie case is irrelevant to our review of the ultimate question.gray,at addressing an alleged weakness in the plaintiff prima facie case following a jury trial.although imwalle clearly produced evidence to support a finding that he engaged in protected activity,that the exercise of his civil rights was known to,and that took an adverse employment action against him by removing him as president of reliance and terminating his employment agreement,the fourth prong of his prima facie case establishing a causal connection presents a closer question and is relevant to whether imwalle is ultimately able to prove pretext.
the ultimate question of retaliation 
asserts that inabnit and ott terminated imwalle for poor performance.poor performance is a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for terminating a person employment and,by articulating such a reason,met its initial burden under the mcdonnell framework.the final burden therefore shifted to imwalle to prove that stated reason for his termination was in fact a pretext designed to hide retaliation.see avery dennison,at.
imwalle takes the second manzer approach by arguing that claims of poor performance were simply not credible given the substantial evidence that proved otherwise.see manzer,at.a plaintiff using the second approach must show that the proffered reason did not actually motivate the defendant challenged conduct.johnson,at internal quotation marks omitted.in this type of showing,
the plaintiff attempts to indict the credibility of his employer explanation by showing circumstances which tend to prove that an illegal motivation was more likely than that offered by the defendant.in other words,the plaintiff argues that the sheer weight of the circumstantial evidence of retaliation makes it more likely than not that the employer explanation is a pretext,or coverup.
manzer,at emphasis in original.
imwalle introduced rebuttal evidence challenging proffered reasons in three ways.first,imwalle offered evidence to show that inabnit and ott were satisfied with imwalle performance at reliance and that,under imwalle leadership,reliance was a profitable,business for years.imwalle next presented evidence that he did not create,and was not responsible for,the problems at moeller,and that,notwithstanding the foregoing,he in fact made every attempt to ameliorate the problems.finally,imwalle introduced other circumstantial evidence to show retaliation,including his own testimony that he experienced an atmosphere of retaliation following his first complaint of discrimination and a statement by ott at the time of imwalle termination that reflected ott concern about the discrimination claims.
in evaluating imwalle rebuttal evidence,our analysis reaches the ultimate question of whether,when viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,imwalle produced sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that explanation for terminating imwalle was pretextual,and that he was actually terminated in retaliation for his claims of age and discrimination.this is essentially a showing,requiring a reasonable disbelief of explanation coupled with circumstantial evidence showing that retaliation was more likely than not the motivation for imwalle termination.see kline,at manzer,at.
disbelief of explanation 
argues that inabnit and ott were justified in terminating imwalle for poor performance,and relies almost entirely on evidence of the inventory and accounting problems at moeller.imwalle,however,presented substantial evidence that reliance was a very successful company under his watch and that he was not responsible for the moeller problems.as to reliance,imwalle relied on testimony from inabnit,ott,batterberry,and grandstaff that,during imwalle tenure as president,reliance was always profitable,a very successful part of the business,and very well controlled.the company best year,was not only imwalle last full year at reliance,but was also the year in which asserts that inabnit and ott decided to terminate imwalle for poor performance.
seeks to minimize the evidence of reliance success by pointing to the decrease in sales during part of.imwalle told ott that the decline was due to a general economic recession.ott rejected that explanation at the time and told imwalle that he should have foreseen the recession and did not do enough to protect the companies from its negative effects.even assuming,as asserts,that imwalle response to the recession was inadequate,the sales slump does not materially diminish reliance success during imwalle tenure.sales decreased for only two months in,and profits and sales rose for three consecutive years thereafter,eventually reaching a historic high in.
inabnit and ott both testified that they were satisfied with imwalle performance as president of reliance.ott said that he had not lost trust in imwalle ability to be president of reliance medical products,and that he did not think that imwalle had failed in any way in his responsibilities.even ott assessment of imwalle performance is positive.he stated that imwalle performance was good,but not outrageous or outstanding because good means that it can be excellent,and that he was happy with imwalle performance,but one could do probably even more implying that there is always room for improvement.ott also testified that,at the time of imwalle termination in january of,imwalle was working like he did for years before.inabnit testified that he,too,never disputed that dennis imwalle was okay with reliance.
as to moeller,imwalle presented evidence that the jury could have reasonably relied on to reject attempts to lay at his feet the blame for moeller accounting and inventory problems.according to the evidence in the record,including testimony from the company independent auditor batterberry,imwalle was not responsible for the persistent,and ultimately fatal,problems or for their effect on the rest of business.the problems at moeller already existed when it was acquired by,and integrated into,in,and moeller was virtually bankrupt within two before imwalle was given any position of authority outside of reliance in.
in january of,less than one week before ott removed imwalle as president of both reliance and hsh and relieved him of all operating responsibilities,hsh ag asked batterberry for his opinion about the moeller problems and who was to blame.batterberry,whom ott said he respected,stated that the magnitude of the poor operating results of moeller is staggering for a business of its size.the heart of the problem,according to the auditors,was the way in which moeller poor personnel managed the business.specifically,they did not employ the same degree of care in managing the moeller inventory that employees at reliance or other divisions employed,they followed a set of rules of their own making,and they did not follow acceptable business practices with respect to the company operations.the most fundamental problem,however,was that the moeller division was never able to gain an acceptable level of sales in the and has never had profitabl e financial results.
batterberry singled out ed rae,then the vice president of sales at moeller,as being primarily responsible for the continuing problems.in contrast,he complimented imwalle for his efforts in trying to address the problems at moeller.batterberry wrote that the auditors found it curious that the moeller problems did not exist elsewhere in operations,and repeatedly emphasized the night and day comparison of moeller,which was plagued by problems,to reliance,which operated effectively.curiously,ott later testified that batterberry letter was a reconfirmation of what he already knew the situation to be.
the evidence also shows that imwalle had a limited role in managing the business of moeller,and that he never held any position at moeller itself.prior to,imwalle had no role whatsoever in hs usa or any of its divisions.in,around the time that imwalle was named vp and coo of hs usa,inabnit issued a memorandum stating that imwalle would be responsible for and general strategic recommendations for hs usa and would serve on hs usa administrative and operational steering group with three other individuals.ed rae remained responsible for moeller daily sales and operations and inabnit retained ultimate decisionmaking authority.
despite this,batterberry testified that imwalle and edenfield,the cfo of hs usa,took a lot of steps and made every attempt to implement procedures and controls at moeller that were already in place and were working effectively at reliance and the other companies.but the auditors pointed out that even these efforts were unsuccessful and difficult to implement because moeller personnel were uncooperative and followed their own rules.hsh ag eventually realized that the problems at moeller were insoluble.in,closed moeller action that imwalle and others had recommended in.
the independent auditor testimony and his letter describing the source and nature of the moeller problems seriously undermine the credibility of explanation that imwalle was fired for poor performance in dealing with those problems.based on the foregoing,the jury could have reasonably disbelieved explanation for terminating imwalle.
evidence that retaliation was the real reason for imwalle termination 
to prove retaliation under the second prong of manzer,imwalle had to show that retaliation was a more likely motivation for his termination than poor performance.see manzer,at.his evidence on this key issue is considerably weaker than his evidence supporting a disbelief of why he was purportedly fired.
as an initial matter,we note that imwalle emphasizes the negative attitudes that inabnit and ott expressed toward elderly people and americans.this evidence,to be sure,suggests that inabnit and ott may have harbored biases against imwalle because of his age and national origin,and their own comments might even constitute direct evidence of discrimination.indeed,based on such statements,imwalle would appear to have a stronger case for discrimination than he does for retaliation.but the question of discrimination is not before us because the jury returned a verdict in favor of on that issue.instead,the question is one of retaliation.we therefore confine our review of the evidence to that which is relevant only to imwalle retaliation claim.
imwalle testified at trial that he experienced an atmosphere of retaliation at following his complaints of discrimination.he also stated that,between may of and january of,he was more or less divorced from the activities at moeller microsurgical and usa,and that he was excluded from key decisions,including the decision to finally close the moeller operations in july or august of.
but the jury also heard evidence suggesting that imwalle was excluded from various business decisions before he complained of discrimination in may of.imwalle testified that he was no longer participating in any of the moeller meetings prior to his first discrimination complaint.he also said that ott had kept him out of the loop with regard to moeller and hs usa since early,and that he saw signs of an approaching storm by may of that year.although this latter evidence weakens imwalle case for retaliation,the task of weighing the evidence belongs to the jury,which was entitled to believe imwalle testimony that took retaliatory actions against him between may of and january of.see toth yoder,cir explaining that,in reviewing a motion for judgment as a matter of law,the court may not weigh the evidence,pass on the credibility of witnesses,or substitute its judgment for that of the jury.
in addition to the foregoing evidence of retaliatory conduct,ott began the meeting at which he terminated imwalle by reading to imwalle a prepared statement that said dennis,i know that you know that hs never committed discrimination in the past,at present,and will not in the future.i therefore canot sic understand why you raise such a claim.we are not discriminatory,just not.ott then told imwalle that he was being immediately relieved of all further duties as president of reliance and of hsh us.viewing this evidence in a light most favorable to imwalle,the fact that ott made this statement about imwalle discrimination complaints at such a critical moment raises questions about true motivation for firing imwalle.
on the one hand,the statement can be taken at face value,made solely for the purpose of assuring imwalle that his firing had nothing to do with the alleged discrimination on the part of because such discrimination purportedly did not exist.but another plausible explanation for ott statement is that imwalle discrimination claim had caused both frustration and resentment on the part of,and that ott statement was designed to mislead imwalle and discourage him from suing.
ott obviously felt strongly enough about the accusations of discrimination to prepare a written statement and read it as the first order of business at the meeting he called to let imwalle go.furthermore,the timing of the statement,literally moments before imwalle was notified that he was no longer president of reliance or of hsh and that his employment agreement was being terminated,clearly shows that imwalle complaint of discrimination was at the forefront of ott mind.how to evaluate ott statement was appropriately left for the jury to determine.
the timing of the termination is another factor that weighs in imwalle favor.this court has held that a causal connection for purposes of establishing a prima facie case of retaliation can be shown through knowledge of the complaints coupled with a closeness in time that creates an inference of causation however,temporal proximity alone will not support an inference of retaliatory discrimination when there is no other compelling evidence.nguyen city of cleveland,cir.in this circuit,a period of more than four months was found to be too long to support an inference of causation.cooper city of north olmsted,cir the mere fact that plaintiff was discharged four months after filing a discrimination claim is insufficient to support an inference of retaliation see also parnell west,wl,at.lexis,at cir.may,holding that previous circuit cases that have permitted a prima facie case to be made based on the proximity of time have all been short periods of time,usually less than six months.
imwalle received termination letter on january,not quite three months after he filed his eeoc complaint on october.thus,under our case law,the time between imwalle eeoc complaint of discrimination and his termination supports an inference of a causal connection.
imwalle testimony about the retaliatory atmosphere he experienced following his complaints,ott own statement at the january meeting,and the relatively short time between imwalle eeoc complaint and his removal as together and viewed in imwalle an inference of retaliation and satisfy the second part of the manzer showing.see avery dennison,at a t the prima facie stage the burden is minimal,requiring the plaintiff to put forth some evidence to deduce a causal connection between the retaliatory action and the protected activity kline,at holding that a plaintiff prima facie case,combined with substantial evidence supporting a reasonable disbelief of the employer explanation,supports a jury finding of retaliation manzer,at explaining that,under the second approach to proving retaliation,a plaintiff shows that the sheer weight of the circumstantial evidence of retaliation makes it more likely than not that the employer explanation is a pretext,or coverup.
although we find the question to be a close one,the jury was ultimately entitled to make its own determination about the credibility of the evidence,including extensive trial testimony from both imwalle and ott.we therefore conclude that the totality of the evidence in the record,when viewed in the light most favorable to imwalle,does not lead reasonable minds to but one conclusion in favor of.granting its motion for judgment as a matter of law is accordingly not appropriate and we decline to do so.see gray,at explaining that a motion for judgment as a matter of law may be granted only if in viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion,in favor of the moving party.
attorney fees,costs,and prejudgment interest 
following the jury verdict in favor of imwalle,he sought attorney fees,costs,and prejudgment interest.the district court set forth at length the proper legal standards to be applied in awarding attorney fees and costs and engaged in a detailed analysis of the amounts requested.in calculating the award,the court excluded hours spent in unsuccessful settlement negotiations and several hours expended by attorneys who,the court concluded,were not sufficiently involved in the litigation to warrant the inclusion of their time.
the district court ultimately awarded imwalle in fees,in costs,and in prejudgment interest,for a total of.argues on appeal that the court abused its discretion in making the award because the paralegal fees and expenses to attend the depositions of inabnit and ott in switzerland were unnecessary and unreasonable,the billing descriptions were insufficient,and imwalle had only limited success on his various claims.

the starting point for determining the amount of a reasonable attorney fee is the lodestar amount,which is calculated by multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation by a reasonable hourly rate.hensley,at.where the party seeking the attorney fees has established that the number of hours and the rate claimed are reasonable,the lodestar is presumed to be the reasonable fee to which counsel is entitled.pennsylvania.valley citizens council for clean air,d.an award based on the total number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation might,however,result in an excessive amount if the claimant has achieved only partial success.hensley,at.in such cases,we must address two issues whether the claims on which the plaintiff failed to prevail were or were not related to the claims on which he or she succeeded,and whether the plaintiff achieved a sufficient degree of success to render the hours reasonably expended a satisfactory basis for awarding attorney fees.id.at.

paralegal fees and expenses 
in the present case,the district court determined that it was reasonable for a paralegal to assist with the depositions.challenges that finding on the basis that imwalle lead counsel,randolph freking,is an experienced employment litigator who has taken dozens,if not hundreds,of depositions.but even the most experienced litigators might reasonably require the assistance of a paralegal in a case that involved nine claims and hundreds of exhibits,including numerous company documents going back as many as years.moreover,no matter how experienced freking is,he simply could not have known in advance how long the depositions would take or that only a few exhibits would actually be referred to.neither argument nor any evidence in the record provides a basis to find that the district court judgment regarding the paralegal fees and expenses was clearly erroneous or an abuse of discretion.
insufficient billing descriptions 
the district court also found that imwalle counsel submitted documentation of sufficient detail and probative value to enable the c ourt to determine with a high degree of certainty that the remaining hours were actually and reasonably expended in the prosecution of the action.argues,however,that descriptions contained in the billing statement of imwalle counsel were vague and failed to identify the general subject matter of the activity involved.specifically,points to entries such as conference with,research,review file,review documents.
