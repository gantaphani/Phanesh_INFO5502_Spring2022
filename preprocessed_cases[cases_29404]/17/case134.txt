the proxy statement solicited and obtained shareholder approval for honeywell stock incentive plan the plan,as a replacement for a employee awards plan that was set to expire.thousands of honeywell employees are eligible to receive awards under the plan in the form of stock options,stock appreciation rights,performance awards,restricted units,restricted stock,and other awards.a management development compensation committee the committee,consisting of six members of honeywell board of directors,administers the plan.
under its awards plan,honeywell was permitted to make annual grants of shares of common stock equal to of its issued shares,including reacquired shares and any shares that were available for award in prior years but not granted.the plan marked a significant change in determining the number of shares available for award in recognition of shareowners legitimate interest in not having their relative ownership in honeywell materially impacted by awards granted under the plan.app.at.the proxy statement stated 
the plan provides for a maximum of shares to be issued as awards,which is the number of shares remaining available for future grants under the employees plan as of january,reduced by the number of shares related to awards made under the employees plan from that date to april,the date on which the employees plan terminates,subject to adjustment as provided under the terms of the plan see adjustments and shares available for issuance,below.
under the heading shares available for issuance,the proxy statement again explained that million was the maximum number of shares to be issued,subject to possible adjustment.app.at.the shares available for issuance were stated to include shares from honeywell plans that had expired,or were forfeited,cancelled or settled in cash,on or after january.moreover,
shares issuable under the plan may consist of authorized but unissued shares or shares held in honeywell treasury.in determining the number of shares that remain available under the plan including shares originally authorized under the employees plan,only awards payable in shares will be counted.if an award under the plan or any prior plan is terminated on or after january,by expiration,forfeiture,cancellation or for any other reason without issuance of shares,or is settled in cash in lieu of shares,the shares underlying such award will be available for future awards under the plan.also,if shares are tendered or withheld on or after january,in payment of all or part of the exercise price of a stock option,or in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations,these shares will be available for future awards under the plan.in addition,shares may be reacquired under the plan with cash tendered in payment of the exercise price of a stock option or with moneys attributable to the tax deduction enjoyed by honeywell upon the exercise of disqualifying disposition of stock options.the committee may also grant shares under the plan in connection with the assumption,conversion or substitution of awards as a result of the acquisition of another company by honeywell or a combination of honeywell with another company.
under the heading adjustments,the proxy statement disclosed that the maximum number of shares available for issuance under the plan 
may be adjusted by the committee,in its discretion,if the committee determines that,because of any stock split,reverse stock split,dividend or other distribution whether in the form of cash,shares,other securities or other property,extraordinary cash dividend,recapitalization,merger,consolidation,reorganization,combination,repurchase or exchange of shares or other securities,the exercise of stock purchase rights,issuance of warrants or other rights to purchase shares or other securities,or similar corporate transaction or event,such adjustment is required to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the plan.
the proxy statement added that t he aggregate annual amount of awards to be granted under the plan is not expected by the committee to be materially different than the aggregate annual amount of awards granted under the employees plan.app.at.honeywell attached the complete text of the plan as exhibit a to the proxy statement.as of the date of the proxy statement,the committee had made no awards under the plan.
seinfeld alleged in his amended complaint that the proxy statement was inadequate because it failed to disclose the number of honeywell shares underlying the grants of stock options and other awards under the plan.app.at.although the proxy statement indicated that million shares was the maximum to be issued,seinfeld asserted that the possible adjustments to that number permit a much greater allowance of awards.because a reasonable investor allegedly would not understand that the number of shares awarded could exceed million,seinfeld claimed that the defendants negligently issued the proxy statement.he also claimed that the proxy statement was false and misleading insofar as it failed to disclose the cost of the plan.
the defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to make a demand upon the board of directors before filing suit,failure to satisfy the heightened pleading requirements of the private securities litigation reform act,et.pslra,and failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.the district court granted the motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b.the court explained that it need not decide whether seinfeld claims are subject to the pslra heightened pleading standard because seinfeld failed to state a claim under the federal securities laws even under the notice pleading standard of rule a.

section a seeks to prevent management or others from obtaining authorization for corporate actions by means of deceptive or inadequate disclosures in proxy solicitations.shaev saper,cir citations omitted.the omission of information from a proxy statement will violate a and rule if either the sec regulations specifically require disclosure of the omitted information in a proxy statement,or the omission makes other statements in the proxy statement materially false or misleading.resnik swartz,cir.an omitted fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important in deciding how to vote.tsc,northway,d.
