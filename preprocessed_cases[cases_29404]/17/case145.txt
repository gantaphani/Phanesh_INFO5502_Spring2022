deferred compensation plans generally 
a deferred compensation plan is an agreement by the employer to pay compensation to employees at a future date.the main purpose of the plan is to defer the payment of taxes.david cartano,taxation of compensation benefits,at.the idea is to defer the receipt of compensation until retirement or termination of employment,when the employee is in a lower tax bracket,thus reducing the overall amount of taxes paid.id.at a,at.
certain deferred compensation plans,known as top hat plans,are subject to erisa administrative and enforcement provisions,but exempt from the substantive provisions that regulate plan funding and impose fiduciary duties because the participants claims arise under erisa substantive provisions,see pls.am.compl.at,they depend on a finding that the it group deferred compensation plan is subject to erisa substantive protections,that it is not a top hat plan.
erisa defines a top hat plan as 
a plan which is unfunded and is maintained by an employer primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees.

when a plan is unfunded,
t he employer promises to pay the employee the deferred compensation at a specified time,but does not set aside the funds in an escrow,trust fund,or otherwise.the assets used to pay the deferred compensation are the general assets of the employer and are subject to the claims of the employer creditors.

an employer may set aside deferred compensation amounts in a segregated fund or trust without jeopardizing a plan unfunded status if the fund or trust remains subject to the claims of the employer creditors in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy.id.at d,at.
one mechanism is the rabbi trust,which is 
an irrevocable trust for deferred compensation.funds held by the trust are out of reach of the employer,but are subject to the claims of the employer creditors in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency.
the rabbi trust gives employees some measure of security,while at the same time deferring taxes.the assets set aside in the trust are segregated from the employer other assets and can be used only to pay the deferred compensation.if there is a change in control of the company,the new owners can not take back the assets of the trust.
the employee is not taxed until receipt of benefits as long as the trust funds are subject to the claims of the employer creditors.the employer is treated as the owner of the funds and taxed on all fund earnings until the date of distribution.

b.it corporation deferred compensation plan 
it corporation adopted the plan in january of.participation in the plan was limited to directors and to employees who are part of a select group of management or highly compensated employees.plan.the plan document specifies that it constitutes an unfunded plan,that participants in the plan have no legal or equitable right,interest or claim in any property or assets of the corporation or its affiliates and that the corporation obligation under the plan is merely that of an unfunded and unsecured promise to pay money in the future.plan.the plan is administered by a committee established by the corporation president and chief executive officer.plan.
it corporation agreed to establish a trust in connection with the plan,plan,and to transfer over to the trust such assets,if any,as the committee determines,from time to time and in its sole discretion,are appropriate,plan.at the same time that it adopted the plan,the corporation adopted a master trust agreement for deferred compensation plans.the trust agreement provided that assets contributed to the trust were to be held subject to the claims of the company and the subsidiaries creditors in the event of their insolvency,and that the trust would not affect the status of the plans as unfunded plans maintained for the purpose of providing supplemental compensation for a select group of management,highly compensated employees directors for purposes of title i of erisa.trust.
procedural history 
it group,it corporation and other affiliated subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter on january,in the bankruptcy court for the district of delaware.on september,participants filed the adversary complaint that began this proceeding.they named it group,all of its subsidiaries in bankruptcy,various former executive officers of it group and carlyle partners ii,lp,a major shareholder of it group,as defendants.participants claimed that the plan did not qualify for unfunded,top hat status under erisa,and was thus subject to erisa funding and fiduciary duty requirements.under this theory,participants contend that it corporation had a duty to set aside,in a trust for participants exclusive benefit,beyond the reach of the corporation creditors,assets sufficient to satisfy the corporation obligations under the plan.the executive and shareholder defendants,correspondingly,owed participants fiduciary duties under erisa to ensure that the trust was funded before the bankruptcy petition date 
participants complaint relied principally on the plan and trust documents,but also alleged that a former president and ceo of it corporation orally promised a senior officer and other potential plan participants that the corporation would fund the trust for the exclusive benefit of plan participants and ensure that benefits would be paid in full if the corporation ever faced the prospect of insolvency or bankruptcy d am.compl.at.
the defendants filed,and the bankruptcy court granted,a consolidated motion to dismiss participants claims.the court found that the plan was unfunded and offered only to a select group of management or highly compensated employees,and was,thus,a top hat plan exempt from erisa substantive protections.participants appealed to the district court for the district of delaware the district court affirmed.
the district court had jurisdiction to hear participants appeal from the bankruptcy court final order dismissing their adversary complaint pursuant to a our jurisdiction over the appeal from the district court order arises under d.
on appeal,we stand in the shoes of the district court,applying a clearly erroneous standard to the bankruptcy court findings of fact and a plenary standard to that court legal conclusions.am.flint glass workers union anchor resolution,cir.because the district and bankruptcy courts dismissed participants complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted,a purely legal question,we review their decisions de novo.id.
in reviewing a motion to dismiss,we accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true and view them in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.we may not dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted unless we find that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts that would entitle him to relief.pryor collegiate athletic ass n,cir.we may consider documents that are attached to or submitted with the complaint and any legal arguments presented in the briefs and arguments of counsel.id.at.
the primary issue before us,as in the bankruptcy and district court proceedings,is whether the plan qualifies for the top hat exemption from erisa substantive provisions.because participants do not challenge those courts determinations that the plan was offered only to management and highly compensated employees,the only remaining question is whether the plan was,in fact,unfunded.
erisa does not specify,and we have not previously considered,what requirements a plan must meet in order to be considered unfunded for purposes of exemption from erisa substantive provisions however,the decisions of other courts of appeals provide useful guidance in this regard.
other courts of appeals that have examined this issue have focused primarily on what are essentially two sides of the same coin whether the corporation has set aside funds,separate from its general assets,for payment of plan benefits and whether the beneficiaries have a legal right greater than that of a general,unsecured creditor to the corporation assets.
the eighth circuit court of appeals has examined this issue from both sides.in considering whether a death benefit plan supported by a life insurance policy was subject to erisa substantive requirements,it stated that f unding implies the existence of a res separate from the ordinary assets of the corporation.dependahl falstaff brewing,cir.the plan was funded because the insurance policy provided a res separate from the corporation to which beneficiaries could look for payment of benefits under the plan.id.on the other hand,an excess benefit plan that specified that the rights of the beneficiary under the plan would be solely those of an unsecured creditor was un funded,even though the employer had purchased an insurance policy to help it finance the plan,because the policy in that case simply became a general,unpledged,unrestricted asset of the employer and those assets in turn would be used to fund the plan.belsky first life ins,cir.
similarly,the second circuit court of appeals has observed that a plan under which benefits were to be paid solely from the general assets of the employer is unfunded.demery extebank deferred compensation plan,cir quoting gallione flaherty,cir.more recently,it adopted a standard first articulated in miller heller.
the question a court must ask in determining whether a plan is unfunded is can the beneficiary establish,through the plan documents,a legal right any greater than that of an unsecured creditor to a specific set of funds from which the employer is,under the terms of the plan,obligated to pay the deferred compensation 
demery,at quoting miller.at.applying this test,the court found that a deferred compensation plan that was financed using life insurance contracts,the proceeds of which were kept in a separate account,was unfunded.according to the court,the plan terms did not give plaintiffs a greater legal right to the funds in the deferred compensation liability account than that possessed by an unsecured creditor.id.although the account was separate,it was part of the general assets of the corporation,and the plan was therefore unfunded as a matter of law.id.
the fifth circuit court of appeals employed a similar analysis,but also considered the tax treatment of the plan.in reliable home health care,union central insurance,cir,it surveyed the decisions of the other courts of appeals,and noted that the department of labor had provided the following guidance a ny determination of the unfunded status of an excess benefit or top hat plan of deferred compensation requires an examination of the facts and circumstances,including the status of the plan under law.id.at quoting dep t of labor,pension welfare benefit programs,op.ltr,erisa lexis,at may.more specifically,the court emphasized dol advice that the tax consequences of the plan should be considered in the analysis,id.citing dol op.ltr,erisa lexis,at,and noted a district court holding that a plan is more likely than not to be regarded as unfunded if the beneficiaries under the plan do not incur tax liability during the year that the contributions to the plan are made,id.at quoting miller.at.combining all of this information,the court devised the following test 
in determining whether a plan is funded or unfunded under erisa,a court must first look to the surrounding facts and circumstances,including the status of the plan under law.second,a court should identify whether a plan is funded by a res separate from the general assets of the company.
the reliable court concluded,under this test,that a death benefit plan was unfunded.like the plans at issue in demery and belsky,the plan was financed through the purchase of life insurance contracts on behalf of participating employees.however,those contracts belonged to the company,not the participating employees.plan participants were prohibited from contributing to the plan,and did not treat the company contributions to the plan on their behalf as taxable income.thus,the plan was unfunded and exempt from erisa substantive provisions.id.at.
we agree with our fellow courts of appeals that the keys to the determination of whether a plan is funded or unfunded under erisa are whether beneficiaries of the plan can look to a res separate from the general assets of the corporation to satisfy their claims whether beneficiaries of the plan have a legal right greater than that of general,unsecured creditors to the assets of the corporation or to some specific subset of corporate assets.we may also consider the plan intended and actual tax treatment we will analyze the it corporation plan accordingly.
the it corporation plan is an unfunded top hat plan under erisa.at the outset,we note that the plan and trust documents express,in no uncertain terms,it corporation intent to create an unfunded plan.the purpose section of the plan document provides that the plan constitutes an unfunded plan.and the trust document explicitly states that the trust shall not affect the status of the plans as unfunded plans for purposes of title i of erisa.trust.
beyond the corporation stated intent,an examination of the factors set forth above fully supports our conclusion.first,there is no res separate from it corporation general assets to which participants can look to satisfy their claims.although the plan document provides for,and the trust document establishes,a trust for participants benefit,no funds were ever deposited into the trust.and participants account balances,listed on their annual benefit statements,do not reflect actual deposits held in a particular location the plan specifically states that each balance is a bookkeeping entry only,designed to be utilized solely as a device for the measurement and determination of amounts to be paid to or in respect of a participant pursuant to the plan.plan.
second,even if the trust were funded,participants legal rights to its assets,and to the assets of the corporation as a whole,are no greater than those of the corporation general,unsecured creditors.the deferred compensation plan questions answers,which was circulated to potential participants along with the plan document,explains that the trust is a rabbi trust that does not provide security in the event that it corporation or its subsidiaries become insolvent or file for bankruptcy.moreover,the trust document unequivocally establishes that trust assets are subject to creditors claims in the event of insolvency,and that such claims are on par with those of plan participants.see,trust the participants and their beneficiaries shall have no preferred claim on,or any beneficial ownership interest in,any assets of the trust any assets held by the trust will be subject to the claims of the company and the subsidiaries general creditors under federal and state law in the event of insolvency trust a to the extent that any participant or beneficiary acquires the right to receive payments under any of the plans,such right shall be no greater than
