on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice scalia delivered the opinion of the court.
we consider whether the period to file suit against a corporate insider under b of the securities exchange act of,b,begins to run only upon the insider filing of the disclosure statement required by a of the act,a.
under b of the exchange act,stat,as amended,a corporation or security holder of that corporation may bring suit against the officers,directors,and certain beneficial of the corporation who realize any profits from the purchase and sale,or sale and purchase,of the corporation securities within any period.the statute imposes a form of strict liability and requires insiders to disgorge these profits even if they did not trade on inside information or intend to profit on the basis of such information.gollust mendell.section b provides that suits must be brought within two years after the date such profit was realized.b.
in,respondent vanessa simmonds filed nearly identical actions under b against financial institutions that had underwritten various initial public offerings ipos in the late and,including these petitioners in a representative complaint,she alleged that the underwriters and the issuers insiders employed various mechanisms to inflate the aftermarket price of the stock to a level above the ipo price,allowing them to profit from the aftermarket sale.app.she further alleged that,as a group,the underwriters and the insiders owned in excess of of the outstanding stock during the relevant time period,which subjected them to both disgorgement of profits under b and the reporting requirements of a,at.see d cfr b and a.the latter requires insiders to disclose any changes to their ownership interests on a document known as a form,specified in the securities and exchange commission regulations.a c cfr a.simmonds alleged that the underwriters failed to comply with that requirement,thereby tolling b time period app.
simmonds lawsuits were consolidated for pretrial purposes,and the united states district court for the western district of washington dismissed all of her complaints in re section b litigation,supp.as relevant here,the court granted petitioners motion to dismiss complaints on the ground that b time period had expired long before simmonds filed the suits.the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed in relevant part.citing its decision in whittaker whittaker,the court held that b limitations period is tolled until the insider discloses his transactions in a section a filing,regardless of whether the plaintiff knew or should have known of the conduct at issue.at.judge milan smith,the author of the panel opinion,also specially concurred,expressing his disagreement with the whittaker rule,but noting that the court was compelled to follow circuit precedent,at.we granted certiorari.
petitioners maintain that these suits were properly dismissed because they were filed more than two years the alleged profits were realized.pointing to dictum in lampf,pleva,lipkind,prupis petigrow gilbertson,petitioners argue that b limitations period is a period of repose,which is not to be extended to account for a plaintiff discovery of the facts underlying a claim.brief for petitioners.see lampf,supra,at,section b sets a period of repose we do not reach that contention,because we conclude that,even assuming that the period can be extended,the ninth circuit erred in that it is tolled until the filing of a a statement.
in adopting its rule in whittaker,the ninth circuit its concern that i t would be a simple matter for the unscrupulous to avoid the salutary effect of section b simply by failing to file reports in violation of subdivision a and thereby concealing from prospective plaintiffs the information they would need to bring a b action,at internal quotation marks omitted.assuming that is correct,it does not follow that the limitations period is tolled until the a statement is filed.section itself quite clearly does not extend the period in that manner.the clock starts from the date such profit was realized.b.congress could have very easily provided that no such suit shall be brought more than two years after the filing of a statement under subsection a c.but it did not.the text of simply does not support the whittaker rule.
the whittaker court suggested that the background rule of equitable tolling for fraudulent operates to toll the limitations period until the a statement is filed.see,at,and.even accepting that equitable tolling for fraudulent concealment is triggered by the failure to file a a statement,the whittaker rule is completely divorced from principles.generally,a litigant seeking equitable tolling bears the burden of establishing two elements that he has been pursuing his rights diligently,and that some extraordinary circumstances stood in his way.pace diguglielmo,emphasis added.it is well established,moreover,that
