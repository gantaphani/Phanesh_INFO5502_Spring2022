plaintiffs glynn ley and public employees retirement system of mississippi collectively,plaintiffs appeal a district court grant of defendants visteon corporation,peter pestillo,michael johnston,daniel coulson,james palmer,and pricewaterhousecooper,pwc collectively,defendants motions to dismiss plaintiffs class action securities violation claims.upon review of the record and the applicable law,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
plaintiffs,individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated,brought a complaint against defendants for violations of the federal securities laws each member of the plaintiff class purchased or otherwise acquired visteon securities between june,and january,the class period.defendant visteon is a global supplier of automotive systems,modules,and components to vehicle manufacturers and the automotive aftermarket.defendants pestillo,johnston,coulson,and palmer the individual defendants acted in the capacity of senior executive officers directors of visteon and defendant pwc is a firm of certified public accountants engaged by visteon during the class period.
before its incorporation,visteon operated as the unnamed parts division of ford.visteon was incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary of ford on january.on june of that same year,visteon was spun off the as a separate publicly traded company.in connection with the,ford and visteon jointly filed a prospectus and registration statement with the securities and exchange commission the sec.
on january,visteon reported its preliminary fourth quarter and full year results for,indicating a significant loss for.in particular,visteon reported errors in the company accounting for certain benefits and income taxes.plaintiffs allege that visteon revelations shocked the market and s hares of visteon fell or percent,on january,to close at per share.on march,visteon filed its amended form for the period ending december.in that filing,visteon indicated that its previously issued financial statements contained million in accounting errors which understated net losses by in excess of million.id.at.on may,visteon announced it would delay filing its form for the quarterly period ending march,and reported errors in its accruals for costs principally associated with freight and material surcharges.id.at.visteon stock price reached a low of on may.id.at.plaintiffs allege this represented a decline of from the end of the class period and a staggering drop of from the class period high of on august.id.during this time,visteon shareholders lost billion in market capitalization.id.
in the amended complaint,plaintiffs assert three claims.in count i of the amended complaint against defendants visteon,pestillo,and coulson,plaintiffs assert a claim pursuant to the securities act of the or securities act,on behalf of all persons who acquired visteon common stock in or traceable to the prospectus,alleging that visteon prospectus was inaccurate and misleading,contained untrue statements of material facts,and omitted to state material facts necessary to make the statements made not misleading.id.at.in count ii of the amended complaint against all defendants,plaintiffs assert a b claim pursuant to securities exchange act of the or exchange act,b,and sec rule,alleging that defendants carried out a plan,scheme and course of conduct which was intended to and,throughout the class period,did i deceive the investing public,including plaintiff and other class members,as alleged herein and ii cause plaintiff and other members of the class to purchase visteon securities at artificially inflated prices.id.at.in count iii of the amended complaint against the individual defendants,plaintiffs assert a claim pursuant to a of the exchange act,a,seeking to hold the individual defendants liable as controlling persons.id.at.
visteon and the individual defendants filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs claims.defendant pwc filed a separate motion to dismiss.after a hearing on may,the district court granted both motions on august.see ley visteon,wl,at.plaintiffs timely appeal followed.
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under.b.see pr diamonds,chandler,cir.we must accept as true facts set forth in the complaint.id.we must construe the complaint in a light most favorable to the plaintiffs and determine whether the plaintiffs undoubtedly can prove no set of facts in support of their claims that would entitle them to relief.see id.in addition to the allegations in the complaint,the court may also consider other materials that are integral to the complaint,are public records,or are otherwise appropriate for the taking of judicial notice.mgmt.telxon,cir citation omitted.moreover,we may affirm on any grounds supported by the record,even though they may be different from the grounds relied on by the district court.see lawrence chancery court of,cir.
count i claim 
the district court dismissed count i because plaintiffs stated in their briefing that they did not oppose defendants motion to dismiss the claim based on a statute of limitations defense.likewise,plaintiffs have not argued the claim in their briefs before this court.accordingly,we will not disturb the district court dismissal of plaintiffs claim.
count ii b claim 
in count ii of the amended complaint,plaintiffs assert a claim under b of the exchange act and rule against all defendants.on appeal,plaintiffs challenge the propriety of the district court granting defendants motions to dismiss that claim.
section b of the exchange act makes it unlawful to use or employ,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security registered on a national securities exchange or any security not so registered any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.b.under rule,it is illegal for one t o make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading.
we have explained that 
generally,federal securities law prohibits fraudulent,material misstatements or omissions in connection with the sale or purchase of a security.morse mcwhorter,cir.specifically,in order to state a claim under section b of the securities exchange act of,or under sec rule,a plaintiff must allege a misrepresentation or omission of a material fact that the defendant had a duty to disclose made with scienter justifiably relied on by plaintiffs and proximately causing them injury.helwig vencor,cir en banc citing aschinger columbus showcase,cir see also in re sofamor danek group,cir.a statement is said to be actionable when it satisfies the first two of these requirements,it is a misrepresentation or omission of a material fact that the defendant had a duty to disclose.see,nathenson zonagen,cir castellano young rubicam,cir.
city of monroe employees ret.bridgestone,cir.
we have also articulated that 
adding to the federal rule of civil procedure b requirement that fraud allegations be stated with particularity,the private securities litigation reform act of pslra,stat.requires that the complaint specify each statement alleged to have been misleading,the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading,and,if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief,the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.b.
pr diamonds,at.the supreme court has stated that e xacting pleading requirements are among the control measures congress included in the pslra.the act requires plaintiffs to state with particularity both the facts constituting the alleged violation,and the facts evidencing scienter,the defendant intention to deceive,manipulate,or defraud.tellabs,makor issues rights,d citation omitted.
for purposes of clarity,we will separately address plaintiffs allegations below,discussing first plaintiffs allegations against visteon and the individual defendants,and then against pwc.
visteon and the individual defendants 
plaintiffs fail to allege a misrepresentation or omission of material fact regarding the claims 
to state a claim under b or rule,plaintiffs must allege that defendants made a misrepresentation or omission of material fact that defendant had a duty to disclose.see city of monroe employees ret,at.here,plaintiffs allege that visteon failed to disclose or partially disclosed various information at the time of the to disguise that visteon was destined to fail.
plaintiffs allege that defendants failed to disclose that ford so dominated the day to day business affairs of visteon via the contracts between the two and beholden visteon management,such that visteon was essentially no more than a repository for operations of ford that had built in losses.essentially,plaintiffs argue that defendants failed to adequately disclose that visteon may have difficulty shedding unprofitable business lines.to the contrary,the prospectus and subsequent disclosures were rife with such information.see.
plaintiffs also allege that defendants failed to disclose that visteon cost structure resulting from the requirement to compensate ford uaw employees created a cost disadvantage as compared to the company competitors of at least million to billion.yet,visteon provided extensive information about its labor costs and even suggested such costs could impede its ability to compete.see.
plaintiffs further allege that visteon stated strategy could not be achieved as the company was incapable of financial success as an independent entity due to the burdensome price restrictions exacted by ford.however,visteon disclosed it owed ford certain price reductions.see.
plaintiffs allege that visteon lack of its own information technology department made it impossible for the company to operate successfully as an independent company.yet,visteon explicitly told investors it had to pay ford for these services.see.
plaintiffs allege visteon failed to disclose that visteon management was so beholden to ford that they did not act in the best interests of visteon shareholders in negotiating the terms of the,nor were they prospectively capable of operating visteon business without subjugating the company interests to those of ford.to the contrary,a specific provision of the prospectus disclosed that visteon management may have conflicts of interest when faced with decisions that could have different implications for our company and ford.see see also.
plaintiffs also suggest that visteon failed to disclose its dependence on ford.however,visteon disclosures were replete with information about its dependence on ford.see.
despite all of these disclosures by visteon,plaintiffs insist that visteon had a duty to disclose even more.specifically,plaintiffs argue that they never alleged that visteon did not disclose its labor costs were high rather,plaintiffs complaint is that visteon did not reveal the truth regarding how high those costs were relative to visteon competition.appellants br.at.plaintiffs allege that an anonymous former visteon employee said that there was absolutely no way visteon could be competitive.yet,defendants went so far as to disclose that visteon may incur wage differentials of higher than the average competitor whose employees are not covered by a master uaw contract.that plaintiffs now argue that the differential percentage provided by visteon was not high enough is part of the reason that there is simply no duty to disclose what plaintiffs suggest and we will not advocate a rule that requires companies to draw such comparisons.in this respect,we find persuasive the third circuit reasoning that 
the federal securities laws do not ordain that the issuer of a security compare itself in myriad ways to its competitors,whether favorably or unfavorably,for at least three reasons.first,such a requirement would impose an onerous if not insurmountable obstacle on issuers of securities to ensure they obtain accurate information on all aspects of their competitors which a reasonable investor might find material.second,were we to announce such a requirement,the likely result would be to inundate the investor with what the supreme court disparaged as an avalanche of trivial information.tsc,northway,d.of greatest is precisely and uniquely the function of the prudent investor,not the issuer of securities,to make such comparisons among investments.see in re donald trump casino sec.
in re donald trump casino sec.mahal,cir.
in the same vein,plaintiffs argue that they did not allege that visteon failed to disclose that ford was its main customer and that it would be dependent on ford for business,but rather that visteon held itself out to be an independent entity when in fact it had no ability to operate as a viable independent company.appellants br.at.unfortunately for plaintiffs,a company is not required to use the negative characterizations that plaintiffs suggest.see in re donald trump casino sec.mahal,at stating companies do not need to use pejorative nouns or adjectives citation omitted see also in re sofamor danek group,at whether the premium was so high that the company should have been able to predict that it would prove counterproductive was clearly a matter of information as to which there was no duty of disclosure.
here,defendants provided investors with plenty of information to determine whether visteon could operate as a viable independent company.that plaintiffs would like even more disclosure misses the point that a violation of b and rule requires that the company have a duty to disclose information that is material.defendants had no duty to disclose what plaintiffs suggest and such information would not be considered material in any event.benzon morgan stanley,cir given that all of the information necessary to compare the different class shares was in the prospectuses,the alleged omissions in this case are not material.see also in re donald trump casino sec.mahal,at in other words,an explicit statement in the prospectus that the taj mahal demanded an average daily casino win of million to meet its debtload would have been superfluous.in benzon,we explained that 
materiality depends on the significance the reasonable investor would place on the withheld information.helwig vencor,cir en banc.while statements of the type proposed by plaintiffs might have facilitated an investor task in comparing the share classes,the critical question is whether they would have significantly altered the total mix of information made available.id.at quoting basic levinson,d.given that the disclosures plaintiffs propose are merely interpretations drawn from the facts presented in the prospectuses,and do not actually provide new information,they would not have significantly altered the total mix of the information already presented in the prospectuses.
benzon,at.plaintiffs fail to allege that defendants made any actionable material misstatements or omissions and therefore the district court properly dismissed the plaintiffs claims in so holding,we have not applied the defense,and therefore,we reserve for another day the issue of whether that doctrine may be applied at the motion to dismiss stage of the pleadings.
plaintiffs fail to allege a strong inference of scienter regarding the restatement claims 
plaintiffs must plead facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter to avoid dismissal.while pleading claims for fraud always required a high level of particularity,see.b,the pslra requires an even higher standard for pleading scienter in a case 
in any private action arising under this chapter in which the plaintiff may recover money damages only on proof that the defendant acted with a particular state of mind,the complaint shall,with respect to each act or omission alleged to violate this chapter,state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.
b emphasis added.although the pslra does not define what constitutes the required state of mind,we have explained that knowing and deliberate intent to manipulate,deceive,or defraud,and recklessness may constitute scienter.see in re comshare.sec,cir see also ernst ernst hochfelder,d.
we recognize that the supreme court recently clarified the scienter standard for a claim under the pslra a complaint will survive only if a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.tellabs,makor issues rights,d.this formulation is slightly different than that previously used in the sixth circuit,where a plaintiff could survive a motion to dismiss only if the inference of scienter was the most plausible of competing inferences.helwig vencor,cir en banc.as both justice scalia and justice alito have noted,the difference between requiring the most plausible inference and requiring an equally plausible inference will rarely affect the outcome of a case.see tellabs.at scalia,concurring id.at alito,concurring.
in helwig,we listed factors that,while not exhaustive,are probative of scienter in securities fraud cases 
insider trading at a suspicious time or in an unusual amount

evidence of bribery by a top company official 
existence of an ancillary lawsuit charging fraud by a company and the company quick settlement of that suit 
disregard of the most current factual information before making statements 
disclosure of accounting information in such a way that its negative implications could only be understood by someone with a high degree of sophistication 
the personal interest of certain directors in not informing disinterested directors of an impending sale of stock and 
the motivation of defendants in the form of saving their salaries or jobs.
on appeal,plaintiffs identify six circumstances in their amended complaint that they argue give rise to a strong inference of scienter 
statements by corporate insiders that visteon intentionally engaged in accounting improprieties in order to inflate earnings the statement by individual defendant peter pestillo,of visteon,that the company had a solid year in when he knew that in fact the company was barely liquid the certifications signed by individual defendants michael johnston and james palmer that falsely certified visteon financial statements as free from material misstatement and protected by internal controls,particularly in light of the closeness in time between those certifications in march and the restated earnings in august the nature and magnitude of visteon accounting improprieties,amounting to at least million over a period visteon practice of reporting financial information in such a way that its negative implications could only be understood by someone with a high degree of sophistication and visteon motive and opportunity to improve ford financial performance by shifting ford losses to visteon and perpetuating the falsehood that visteon was a financially viable company.
appellants br.at.
while we consider plaintiffs allegations in total when determining whether plaintiffs sufficiently plead scienter,see pr diamonds,at,we address each argument individually in this opinion for purposes of clarity.
insider statements 
plaintiffs first argue that a strong inference of scienter is apparent because visteon intentionally violated generally accepted accounting principles gaap to artificially inflate revenues.the support for plaintiffs assertions in this respect are limited to the statements of an anonymous source within visteon.plaintiffs explain that,according to a former senior finance director at visteon,one accounting impropriety involved the practice of booking customer rebates obtained from suppliers in the year the supplier contract was entered,even though the rebates had not yet actually been received.appellants br.at.plaintiffs allege that a lthough gaap requires the rebates to be spread over the life of the contract,visteon motive for doing so was to falsely improve the company financial condition by lowering costs through booking future rebates in one period.also according to a former senior finance director at visteon,visteon suppliers would routinely pass along increases in the price of materials for the goods sold to visteon.rather than book these material surcharges in the period in which they occurred as required by gaap,visteon would defer these surcharges and not account for them in its financial statements.id.plaintiffs allege visteon motive was to not report the cash that was actually going out the door.id.
while we agree that anonymous sources are not altogether irrelevant to the scienter analysis,plaintiffs allegations here are too vague and conclusory to be accorded much weight.see higginbotham baxter int l,cir finding allegations of confidential witnesses must be discounted and u sually that discount will be steep.indeed,plaintiffs fail to allege who at visteon knew about these alleged accounting improprieties and what,when,where,and how they knew.without such context,we can not say the statements raise an inference of scienter.
ii.pestillo statement 
plaintiffs allege that defendant pestillo statement in january that visteon had a solid year in while at the same time the company was internally saying it was not doing well,barely had enough money to pay its bills,and was barely liquid is evidence of scienter.we agree with the district court that this statement was corporate optimism,and not probative of scienter.see in re ford motor.sec,cir such statements are either mere corporate puffery or hyperbole that a reasonable investor would not view as significantly changing the general gist of available information,and thus,are not material,even if they were misleading.moreover,the context of the statement involves a press release wherein visteon had just prior to pestillo comment stated earnings were higher than earnings and therefore plaintiffs are wrong to suggest that pestillo was commenting on liquidity when he was commenting about earnings.see in re donald trump casino sec.mahal,at w e must consider an alleged misrepresentation within the context in which the speaker communicated it helwig,at stating one of the factors for scienter analysis is divergence between internal reports and external statements on the same subject emphasis added.for that reason,plaintiffs reliance on virginia bankshares,sandberg,d is also misplaced.
iii.certifications 
plaintiffs contend that pestillo and palmer signatures on the certifications are evidence of scienter.the district court declined to interpret the signed certifications as evidence of scienter,as doing so would be to hold company executives strictly liable for innocent accounting mistakes.ley,wl,at.we agree with the eleventh circuit that a certification is only probative of scienter if the person signing the certification was severely reckless in certifying the accuracy of the financial statements.see garfield ndc health,cir see also cent.laborers pension fund integrated servs,cir.here,plaintiffs fail to allege facts to suggest that pestillo or palmer had reason to know or should have suspected accounting irregularities or other red flags at the time they signed the certifications.indeed,plaintiffs have not explained the link between these statements and the actual accounting issues at visteon.therefore,we agree with the district court that the signatures are not probative of scienter.
iv.nature and magnitude of accounting improprieties 
plaintiffs also argue that the nature and magnitude of visteon accounting improprieties warrant an inference of recklessness.appellants br.at.defendants urge us to reject this argument outright based on our court proclamation that w e decline to follow the cases that hold that the magnitude of the financial fraud contributes to an inference of scienter on the part of the defendant.fidel farley,cir.however,in pr diamonds,at,this court considered the magnitude and nature of the accounting issues,but held that the accounting irregularities plaintiffs allege in this case are significantly less egregious in nature and magnitude and thus do not support a strong inference of scienter.
even if we consider whether the nature and magnitude of the accounting errors support an inference of scienter,we agree with the district court that they do not here.first,we agree with the district court that the accounting errors here were not so simple,basic,or pervasive in nature to have been obvious to the defendants.pr diamonds,at.indeed,the errors involve amendments to retiree health benefit plans,amount and time of certain tax adjustments and changes to deferred taxes,corrections for certain tooling costs and volume related rebates,inventory costing corrections,unrecorded pension expenses related to european operations and postretirement health care expenses in a foreign location,errors related to freight expenses,material surcharges and supplier expenses.likewise,we agree with the district court that said errors were not so great in magnitude to be obvious to defendants.pr diamonds,at.the district court points out that plaintiffs themselves,in briefing before the district court,only alleged that defendants overstated its total revenues by during the class period.see.while we do not necessarily advocate a rigid adherence to percentages,such a low percentage of change to total revenue does not strike us as the type of in your face facts that cry out scienter.pr diamonds,at.
we do not dispute that a restatement,under accounting principles board opinion apb,is a correction of errors in previously issued financial statements.frank dana,d,see also in re goodyear tire rubber.sec,d,by definition a restatement says that the prior financial statement was false.here,however,plaintiffs fail to allege any particularized facts to suggest that the statements were knowingly or recklessly false at the time they were made to the market and therefore plaintiffs seek to hold defendants accountable for nothing more than a restatement of its financials.
reporting practices 
plaintiffs allege that visteon disclosures were often presented in an intentionally confusing manner and therefore raise an inference of scienter.appellants br.at.in this regard,visteon chose to conceal the losses on the ford contracts that were inherent at the time of the by reporting those losses in multiple documents that could only be fully understood when read together.id.plaintiffs also allege that s imilarly,the consolidated financial statements did not simply state the truth,which was that the cash from operations would apparently not be sufficient to cover operating costs and other cash needs and instead t his fact was disclosed piecemeal in two separate notes to the consolidated financial statements that had to be read together.id.at.again,what plaintiffs want is for defendants to couch the financial health of visteon in the negative terms of their choosing,but that is not required under the federal securities laws.plaintiffs do not argue the information they seek was not disclosed,but rather it was disclosed in a misleading way.however,plaintiffs fail to cite any authority for their argument that disclosure in two separate notes to the financials under these circumstances is problematic and we find none.
vi.motive and opportunity 
plaintiffs also argue that defendants motive and opportunity to commit fraud supports a strong inference of scienter.most of plaintiffs motive and opportunity allegations do not raise an inference of scienter,let alone a strong one,and do not warrant further discussion here.see pr diamonds,at all corporate managers share a desire for their companies to appear successful.that desire does not comprise a motive for fraud.in re comshare.sec,at w e hold that plaintiffs may meet pslra pleading requirements by alleging facts that give rise to a strong inference of reckless behavior but not by alleging facts that illustrate nothing more than a defendant motive and opportunity to commit fraud.emphasis added.
however,we briefly will address plaintiffs more specific allegation that defendants motive was a march note offering to raise additional capital and to avoid defaulting on existing notes.in pr diamonds,we addressed a similar allegation in which the plaintiffs alleged that defendants were motivated to engage in fraud in order to forestall intrenet default of its bank loan agreement and to preserve the company ability to borrow pursuant to its credit facility.at.there,we explained that we view the motive allegations concerning the bank loan and credit facility as suggestive of scienter,although standing alone they do not establish a strong inference.see also key equity investors,marketing,cir stating that the complaint sets out nothing more than an ordinary business motive,which is typically insufficient to support a strong inference of fraud wherein plaintiffs alleged that a company falsified its earnings to maintain its credit line.here,plaintiffs fail to allege any particularized facts or details related to the notes offering that support an inference of scienter.as the third circuit explained 
in this case,although key equity alleges that falsified its earnings to maintain its credit line,its complaint is bereft of any facts or details supporting this conclusion.we are therefore left to speculate about what particular information was hidden,what financial figures were manipulated,and when any of the defendants knew of or implemented such fraudulent devices.in re burlington coat factory sec,cir w here plaintiffs allege that defendants distorted certain data disclosed to the public by using unreasonable accounting practices,we have required plaintiffs to state what the unreasonable practices were and how they distorted the disclosed data.inferring scienter in these circumstances would impermissibly provide key equity the benefit of inferences flowing from vague or unspecific allegations.in re rockefeller center.sec,cir.in other words,because of the complaint omissions,it fails to set out the who,what,when,where and how of the events at issue.dileo ernst young,cir.
key equity investors.at.the same is true here.
we find that plaintiffs allegations,taken together and viewed collectively,fail to adequately plead a strong inference of scienter on the part of visteon and the individual defendants.accordingly,the district court properly dismissed the plaintiffs claims.
the district court also concluded that plaintiffs failed to allege a strong inference of scienter on the part of pwc and therefore dismissed plaintiffs b claim with respect to pwc.we agree.
we have explained the pleading standard as applied to an outside auditor 
the same pslra pleading standards apply to the allegations against andersen.however,the meaning of recklessness in securities fraud cases is especially stringent when the claim is brought against an outside auditor.in re smartalk teleservices.secs,d.recklessness on the part of an independent auditor entails a mental state so culpable that it approximate s an actual intent to aid in the fraud being perpetrated by the audited company.decker,cir pegasus fund,laraneta,cir auditor recklessness must come closer to being a lesser form of intent to deceive than merely a greater degree of ordinary negligence internal quotations omitted.scienter requires more than a misapplication of accounting principles.the plaintiff must prove that the accounting practices were so deficient that the audit amounted to no audit at all,or an egregious refusal to see the obvious,or to investigate the doubtful,or that the accounting judgments which were made were such that no reasonable accountant would have made the same decisions if confronted with the same facts.in re worlds of wonder secs,cir quoting sec price waterhouse.
when the standard of recklessness for an auditor is overlaid with the pleading requirements of the pslra,a simple rule emerges to allege that an independent accountant or auditor acted with scienter,the complaint must allege specific facts showing that the deficiencies in the audit were so severe that they strongly suggest that the auditor must have been aware of the corporation fraud.smartalk,d at citing hol
