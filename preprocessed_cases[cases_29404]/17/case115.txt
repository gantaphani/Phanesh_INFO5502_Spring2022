opinion of the court 
introduction 
between and,viacom paid three of its senior executives board chairman sumner redstone,president and ceo philippe dauman,and coo thomas dooley more than million in bonus or incentive compensation.although the compensation exceeding million paid by a corporation to senior executives is not typically a deductible business expense under federal tax law,a corporate taxpayer may deduct an executive otherwise nondeductible compensation over million if an independent committee of the corporation board of directors approves the compensation on the basis of objective performance standards and the compensation is approved by a majority of the vote in a separate shareholder vote before the compensation is paid.in,a majority of viacom voting shareholders approved such a plan with the intent to render the excess compensation paid by viacom tax deductible the plan.one shareholder,appellant robert freedman,now claims that viacom board of directors the board failed to comply with the terms of the plan.freedman contends that,instead of using quantitative performance measures,the board partially based its bonus awards on qualitative,subjective factors,thus destroying the basis for their tax deductibility.freedman alleges that this misconduct caused the board to award its executives more than million of excess compensation.freedman sued viacom and all eleven members of its board derivatively on behalf of viacom for not complying with the plan,and directly for allowing an allegedly invalid shareholder vote reauthorizing the plan in.on defendants motion,the district court dismissed both claims by order entered on july.see freedman redstone,civ.slr,wl.july.freedman has appealed from that order but we will affirm.
at the outset we summarize the issues involved in this case and set forth our conclusions.in a requirement familiar to corporate litigators,before bringing a derivative suit on behalf of a corporation a plaintiff must demand that the corporation board of directors bring the suit itself.if the plaintiff does not make such a demand,the suit may proceed only if the plaintiff shows why a demand would have been futile,either because the board was interested in the challenged transaction or because the board acted outside the protection of the business judgment rule in dealing with the matter in issue.as freedman did not make a demand or present sufficient allegations explaining why a demand would have been futile,the district court correctly dismissed his derivative claim.
freedman on his direct claim contends that,as a condition for allowing certain executive compensation in excess of million to be tax deductible,federal tax law requires that the compensation be awarded pursuant to a plan approved in a vote of all the shareholders,even those otherwise without voting rights,thus preempting to this limited extent delaware law authorizing corporations to issue shares as viacom has done.because we find that federal tax law does not confer voting rights on shareholders not otherwise authorized to vote or affect delaware corporation law which permits corporations to issue shares without voting rights,we conclude that freedman has failed to state a direct claim on which relief may be granted.
ii.background 
viacom is a publicly traded entertainment corporation,incorporated in delaware,with its principal place of business in new york,new york.viacom board of directors has eleven members,all of whom are defendants in this case.during the fiscal year,viacom earned more than billion,and returned a substantial portion of those profits to its stockholders through cash dividends and stock buyback programs.
as we have indicated,freedman allegations center on the award of millions of dollars of incentive compensation to three viacom executives.we reiterate that typically executive compensation exceeding million is not tax deductible,but that m provides an exception to the rule of nondeductibility where the corporation pays the compensation as a reward for performance measured by established,objective criteria and an independent compensation committee of the corporation directors administers the compensation plan.m c i e i.in order for compensation paid pursuant to the exception to qualify for the favorable tax treatment,the taxpayer must disclose to its shareholders its plan to award such compensation and the plan must be approved by a majority of the vote in a separate shareholder vote.m c ii.
on may,viacom shareholders approved this type of plan the senior executive short term incentive plan.the plan capped the awards,limiting each executive eligibility for awards to the lesser of either eight times his salary or million per year.as these bonuses vastly exceeded m s million threshold,to ensure that the awards were tax deductible the plan included provisions tying bonus awards to the achievement of specific,objective goals relating to viacom financial performance.the plan directed the compensation committee of viacom board to establish a performance period,designate which executives would participate,select which performance goals to use from a list included in the plan,and set a performance target within each goal.at the end of the performance period,the committee was to certify whether the performance targets have been achieved in the manner required by section m.if the targets were satisfied,then the executives earned the award,although the committee could,in its sole discretion,reduce the amount of any award to reflect its assessment of a particular executive individual performance or for any other reason.
the committee selected several performance measures from the plan and then set a range of performance goals for each measure.each executive was eligible to receive a bonus of different amounts,depending on where on the range viacom performance ultimately fell.each executive was assigned a target bonus and,depending on viacom actual performance,an executive bonus could be anywhere from to of the target.because the committee selected more than one performance measure,the committee weighted each measure and then combined the weighted percentage with viacom performance to calculate each executive award.
according to freedman,the committee failed to comply with the foregoing procedure.he contends that,in addition to the objective performance measures drawn from the plan,the committee also used subjective,qualitative factors to determine approximately of the bonus awarded to each officer,and wrongfully arrogated to itself the positive discretion to provide additional compensation based on the accomplishments of each executive in a particular year.the committee allegedly used positive discretion to increase the executives bonuses,resulting in an excess award of.
the complaint quantifies the difference between the earned bonus and the actual bonus for each executive in each of the three years at issue,and.for example,in the committee set dauman target bonus at million significantly less than the maximum bonus awards authorized by the plan.the committee selected two performance goals operating income,weighted at,and free cash flow,weighted at.it also assigned weight to qualitative factors.
the committee then used these weighted factors all of which were satisfied to reduce dauman actual bonus to of the target.freedman argues that the of the ultimate award attributable to qualitative factors was improper,and thus dauman received million in excess compensation.freedman characterizes this metric as a violation of both the plan and m,and calculates the total amount of excess compensation awarded to the three executives to be million.
treasury regulations require corporations to obtain stockholder approval of executive compensation plans every five years,e vi,and viacom thus sought stockholder approval of its compensation plan in the plan.viacom certificate of incorporation established two classes of stock class a shares,which have one vote per share,and class b shares,which are not entitled to any votes upon any questions presented to viacom stockholders.certificate of incorporation.because redstone owns of class a shares and obviously favored adoption of the plan,freedman reasonably contends that the passage of the plan was guaranteed no matter what the other stockholders wanted.on march,the class a shareholders voted to approve the plan.
on august,in response to the adoption and implementation of the plan,freedman filed a complaint in the district of delaware against all eleven board members and viacom,asserting both a derivative and a direct claim.the derivative claim alleged that the board wrongfully authorized the payment of excessive compensation.freedman contended that this authorization was an act of disloyalty and waste,and unjustly enriched the recipients of the compensation.therefore,in freedman view,the authorization was not the product of a valid exercise of business judgment.the direct claim asserted that the shareholder vote on the plan violated m because class b shareholders could not participate in the vote.freedman reads m as requiring that all shareholders be eligible to vote on plans to award compensation,thus,to that limited extent,preempting delaware law which permits corporations to issue shares.under this reading,viacom,by excluding class b shareholders from the shareholder vote,did not satisfy federal law insofar as the vote was intended to render the excess compensation tax deductible.freedman sought more than million in damages,injunctive relief preventing enforcement of the plan,and a new vote that would include class b shareholders to approve or reject the plan.
defendants moved to dismiss the complaint under federal rule of civil procedure because freedman had not made a demand on the board,and under rule b because his complaint failed to state a valid claim.on july,the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss.freedman,wl,at.the court concluded that freedman had failed to show that demand on viacom would have been futile,and had not sufficiently alleged facts that created a reasonable doubt that the board took its challenged actions after its valid exercise of business judgment.therefore,the court dismissed the derivative claim.in dismissing freedman direct claim,the court rejected freedman argument that m preempted delaware corporation law with respect to shareholder approval of the compensation plan.freedman has appealed from both aspects of the july,order.
iii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had diversity of citizenship jurisdiction over freedman state law claims under a,and we have jurisdiction under we review a district court ruling on demand futility for abuse of discretion.kanter barella,cir.but to the extent that a party challenges the legal precepts employed by a district court,we apply plenary review.blasband rales,cir.we also apply plenary review to the district court dismissal of freedman complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b.see jones abn amro mortg.grp,cir.we accept all of freedman factual allegations in the complaint as true and construe the complaint in the light most favorable to him.id.in making our determination,we may consider an indisputably authentic document that a defendant attaches as an exhibit to a motion to dismiss if the plaintiff claims are based on the document.steinhard grp,cir quoting pension benefit guar.white consol,cir see also in re burlington coat factory sec,cir explaining that courts may rely on documents extrinsic to the complaint on which the complaint is based.like the district court,we therefore consider the plan,viacom proxy statement,and viacom certificate of incorporation.
iv.discussion 
we reiterate that freedman complaint alleged both a derivative and a direct claim and we agree with the district court order dismissing both claims.first,the derivative claim fails because freedman did not meet the requirements to excuse him from making a demand on the board to bring the action on the theory that it would have been futile to make the demand.in this regard,freedman did not comply with rule,which requires plaintiffs to plead with particularity their efforts to obtain the desired action from the directors or the reasons for not obtaining the action or making the effort to obtain that action.inasmuch as the complaint did not set forth any such facts,the requirement that freedman make a demand was not excused.second,the court properly dismissed the direct claim under rule b because the claim failed to state a cause of action.
freedman derivative claim 
as we have indicated,before bringing a derivative suit,a shareholder must make a demand on the company board of directors to give the board an opportunity to bring the suit on behalf of the corporation.in re merck,derivative erisa,cir see also.b requiring derivative complaints to state with particularity any attempted demand or the reasons for not making the demand,why a demand would have been futile.ch.same.although federal rule of civil procedure provides the procedural vehicle for addressing the adequacy of a derivative plaintiff pleadings,t he substantive requirements of demand are a matter of state law.blasband,at.the decision whether to bring a lawsuit is a decision concerning the management of the corporation and consequently is the responsibility of the directors.id.at citing levine smith.because a derivative suit potentially could intrude into the sphere of managerial control,the demand requirement balances the interest of shareholders in pursuing valid claims against the interests of the board in managing the corporation.id.
but a court may excuse a plaintiff from satisfying the demand requirement if the demand would have been futile because the board could not make an independent decision on the question of whether to bring the suit.in general,directors are entitled to a presumption that they were faithful to their fiduciary duties,and the putative plaintiff bears the burden of overcoming this presumption.beam ex.rel.martha stewart living omnimedia,stewart,emphasis omitted see also levine,at.to meet that burden under delaware law,a complaint must include particularized facts creating reasonable doubt either that the directors are disinterested and independent,or that the challenged transaction was otherwise the product of a valid exercise of business judgment.aronson lewis.i f either prong is satisfied,demand is excused.brehm eisner,a d.
interest and independence of viacom board 
as we set forth at the outset,viacom board of directors has eleven members,and all are defendants and appellees in this case.the parties agree that five of the directors are independent,and that five are not accordingly,to the extent that the case turns on the independence of the viacom board of directors,the critical question is whether the eleventh director,alan greenberg,was independent.viacom classified greenberg as an independent director under its corporate governance guidelines and the nasdaq listing standards.however,the complaint alleges that greenberg is not independent because he is a close personal friend and an adviser to sumner redstone.complaint.freedman supports this allegation by citing in re viacom.shareholder derivative litigation,misc.lexis,at.june,in re viacom,in which a new york judge determined that the plaintiffs complaint contained allegations sufficient to create a reasonable doubt that greenberg was interested in the transaction at issue freedman argues that this new york supreme court case conclusively decided that greenberg is not independent,and that appellees thus are precluded from relitigating his independence under the doctrine of collateral estoppel.
collateral estoppel bars relitigation where the identical issue necessarily was decided in the prior action and is decisive of the present action,and the party to be precluded from relitigating the issue had a full and fair opportunity to contest the prior determination.kaufman eli lilly,the party,in this case freedman,asserting that another party is collaterally estopped on a particular point has the burden of demonstrating that the issue on which he contends that other party is estopped was raised in the prior proceeding and was identical to the issue in the present proceeding howard stature.in demand futility cases,a prior ruling on a director independence does not necessarily apply in a future proceeding addressing the same topic see bansbach zinn,explaining that prior ruling on directors independence in demand futility context did not apply for all time and in all circumstances.a determination of a director independence thus is concerned with a possibly fluid relationship and,accordingly,differs from the determination of a fixed historical fact in the first litigation such as a determination of which automobile went through a red light in an automobile accident case.
we find that freedman has failed to carry his burden to show that the issue here is identical with the issue that the new york supreme court decided in in re viacom.in re viacom was a derivative action that various shareholders brought in against viacom board of directors.the plaintiffs in that case alleged that the board breached its fiduciary duty by approving excessive compensation packages totaling more than million in one year to three viacom executives,including redstone.misc.lexis,at.greenberg was one of the board members approving the compensation.the complaint alleged that greenberg had a close business and personal relationship with redstone,id.at internal quotation marks omitted,and,as redstone personal investment banker,that greenberg directly advised him on two large acquisitions in and and on the unwinding of one acquisition in.id.at.based on these facts that greenberg had advised redstone in his personal affairs in two large acquisitions,provided services and continues to provide services to viacom the court concluded that plaintiffs had advanced a reasonable claim that greenberg was interested in the transaction.id.at.the court explained that the financial benefits greenberg had received or potentially would receive as a result of his relationship with redstone created an impermissible taint of interest.id.at.
but the issues here are not identical with those that the court considered in in re viacom.first,unlike the complaint in in re viacom,freedman complaint does not include any allegations regarding specific transactions in which greenberg participated,and does not claim that greenberg had received or in the future could receive financial benefits from redstone that could taint his independent view of the executive compensation package at issue.second,seven years elapsed between the filing of the in re viacom complaint in and the filing of freedman complaint in this case in.because i ndependence is a inquiry made in the context of a particular case,beam,at,as well as at a particular time,it would be inappropriate to adopt freedman suggestion that we assume that the relationship between redstone and greenberg has remained static for seven years.see restatement second of judgments cmt.c noting that,in some cases,the separation in time and other factors negat e any similarity so that the first judgment may properly be given no effect.
rather,as appellees point out,in re viacom relied on greenberg involvement through a firm with which he was associated,bear stearns,in specific transactions involving viacom and redstone personally in the and early.but by,bear stearns no longer existed,and greenberg had become a officer at jpmorgan chase,the firm that acquired bear stearns.jpmorgan chase business dealings with viacom are limited,and there are no allegations in the complaint that greenberg has been involved in any specific transactions with redstone or viacom,or that he continues to be redstone investment banker.see appellees br.at proxy statement explaining greenberg role at jpmorgan and that transactions with viacom account for less than of jpmorgan revenues.the complaint does not contain any specific allegations suggesting that redstone and greenberg continue to have a relationship conveying what the court in in re viacom called the taint of interest.
indeed,this case is indistinguishable from bansbach zinn,in which the new york court of appeals would not apply collateral estoppel where the party asserting it merely rel ied on the proof they put before the court in an earlier proceeding,but did nothing to substantiate their claims in the current proceeding.at.absent concrete allegations regarding the relationship between redstone and greenberg that suggest some financial benefit or control like those presented in in re viacom freedman has not carried his burden to show the identity of the issues in the two cases,and thus collateral estoppel does not apply.as collateral estoppel with respect to greenberg independence is the only ground on which freedman challenges the board independence,the district court correctly held that demand was not excused on the basis of the application of that doctrine.see freedman,wl,at.we therefore turn to the second prong of the demand futility test.
exercise of valid business judgment 
because freedman failed to prove that the viacom board of directors was not independent,he must carry the heavy burden of showing that the allegations in the complaint create a reasonable doubt that its decisions were the product of a valid exercise of business judgment.white panic,quoting aronson,at.the business judgment rule protects corporate managers from judicial interference with their informed,good faith business decisions.when considering corporate litigation,courts presume that the business judgment rule applies so that unless a plaintiff presents evidence to the contrary,the court assumes that the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis,in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company.levine,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted,overruled on other grounds by brehm.a plaintiff bears a particularly heavy burden to overcome this presumption where,as here,a majority of independent,directors approved the transaction.id see also grobow perot,explaining that plaintiff bears a heavy burden to avoid demand where majority of independent,disinterested directors approved transaction,overruled on other grounds by brehm.the business judgment rule protects an independent board compensation decisions,even those approving large compensation packages.see brehm,at grimes donald,if an independent and informed board,acting in good faith,determines that the services of a particular individual warrant large amounts of money the board has made a business judgment.
freedman argues that the compensation committee actions fall outside the protection of the business judgment rule because its actions violated the terms of the plan.specifically,freedman contends that the committee used subjective factors to calculate the compensation awards,thereby contravening the express terms of the plan and rendering the excess compensation not tax deductible.freedman correctly notes that in certain circumstances transactions that violate plans may not be protected by the business judgment rule and thus the presence of those circumstances may excuse a plaintiff failure to make demand on the board.see,ryan gifford.ch a board knowing and intentional decision to exceed the shareholders grant of express but limited authority raises doubt regarding whether such decision is a valid exercise of business judgment and is sufficient to excuse a failure to make demand.see also weiss swanson.ch explaining that business judgment rule attaches only where board grant of stock options adheres to plan.
key to these cases,however and missing from freedman complaint are particularized allegations regarding violations of a plan.in ryan,for example,the plaintiff provided specific grants,specific language in option plans,specific public disclosures,and supporting empirical analysis to allege knowing and purposeful violations of shareholder plans and intentionally fraudulent public disclosures.at.freedman allegations,by contrast,do not provide sufficient particularity to survive a motion to dismiss.see ryan,a d at.
the plan directed the compensation committee to establish performance targets from a list of objective measures,and,if those targets were met,authorized the committee to award the maximum amount the lesser of million or eight times the executive
