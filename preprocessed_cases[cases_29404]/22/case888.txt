defendant was convicted by jury trial of nine counts of attempted distribution or exhibition of harmful matter to a minor over the internet,subd.b.he admitted that he had suffered six prior serious felony convictions within the meaning of penal code sections,subdivisions b to i and.defendant was committed to state prison to serve a determinate term of three years consecutive to an indeterminate term of years to life.on appeal,he claims that the trial court prejudicially erred in defining the intent or purpose of seducing element of the offenses,defining the harmful matter element of the offenses,failing to instruct on the lesser offense of attempted misdemeanor distribution of harmful matter and giving the version of caljic.he also claims that his sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.we agree with defendant first contention and reverse the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
the child exploitation detail of the sexual assault investigative unit of the san jose police department is composed of several police officers who,among other things,go into internet chat rooms seeking out individuals who desire to sexualize with children.officer mark clough is assigned to this detail,and sergeant david michael hewitt is in charge of the detail.clough had heard from other agencies that child predators could be found in a chat room called,and he had previously arrested someone whom he had met in this chat room.hewitt knew that gay men gathered in this chat room and often engaged in conversations that were sexual in nature.such conversations often involved discussions of penis sizes,sexual acts and threesomes,and the trading of photographs.
clough created an america online aol profile identifying himself as a fictitious boy named scotty living in campbell with a birthdate of may.his screen name was.scotty stated in his profile that his occupation was astronaut.on december,clough entered the chat room using scotty screen name.scotty profile was available to the other occupants of the chat room.clough soon received an instant message from defendant defendant aol profile,which did not include his name,identified him as a committed theatre manager.the profile also said,do let the age fool ya.look alot younger and self pic available after just a few lines of messaging,defendant asked clough if he had a self pic to trade.clough responded,if u send one first.defendant said he had a g and x would you like both.clough responded in the affirmative,and defendant sent clough two photographs by.one of the photos was a photo of defendant,naked with an erect penis.the other was a fully clothed photo of defendant.clough asked defendant if he had ever been with a guy my age.defendant said yeah and asked clough if he had ever been with someone my age.clough said he had messed with a boy his own age.clough asked,the guy u were with like u defendant responded,very much.he told clough he would put him on his buddy list and the conversation ended 
on december,count,clough again entered the same chat room,and defendant initiated another conversation.clough told defendant that he had erased the photos,and defendant again sent those two photos plus one more.the new photo depicted a man being both orally copulated and sodomized simultaneously.the file was called.defendant told clough that he was and asked,is that too old for you.clough replied,is to yung for defendant said no.defendant told clough that he had had a sexual relationship with someone clough age for over a year.he said,younger guys are just alot of fun because they can be taught stuff and they are inexperienced.defendant then questioned clough about his sexual experience,and clough described having touched both a male and a female.defendant asked,do you shoot far when you cum and how often do you jack off.he also asked,how big is your cock and are u hard right now.clough responded affirmatively.after a bit more conversation,the conversation ended.
on january,count,clough logged on to aol but did not enter a chat room.he received an instant message from defendant.defendant asked clough,is your cock hanging out and suggested that clough send him a picture of himself.clough said he lacked the money to do so.defendant suggested that clough g o to the mall and sell your butt for one day you can probably get at least bucks clough responded,thats tore up,dude,and defendant said he was just kidding and would never want you to do that.clough asked defendant if he was ever comin to san jose,and defendant said,p robably not till next spring to go to marriotts.defendant suggested,w e could touch each other on the rides and then come home and fuck till our heart content.defendant promised to teach clough and said it was fun to make a young guy experience new things because you can really get them off.he asked clough if he was hard right now and touching himself.clough replied affirmatively.

on february,count,clough sent an instant message to defendant.he told defendant that his mom was going to be leaving him home alone for a couple of days.defendant asked him if he was going to invite a guy over to fuck all night clough responded affirmatively and extended an invitation to defendant.defendant asked,where do you live again,and clough said campbell.defendant said,i just wish you lived closer to me and it would be cool if we were closer so we can have an afternoon fuck if we wanted.they discussed scotty masturbation history,and defendant asked clough to jack off for me and tell me everything that you are doing while you jack off.at clough request,defendant again resent the same x photo.defendant tried to convince clough to engage in phone sex,but clough expressed reluctance.he said,u relly arent gon na come here and defendant replied,i do know i would like to.defendant told clough that he would like to orally copulate him if you would let me.he asked clough,could you fall in love with me and live with me forever.defendant also asked clough to think of me tonight when you are jacking off ok.the conversation ended shortly thereafter with defendant encouraging clough to consider phone sex the following week.

their final contact was initiated by defendant at a little after on november,count defendant offered clough some new self pics and then sent some fully clothed snapshots of him and of his boyfriend.he again suggested that clough move in with us and we can take care of you.this colloquy then occurred clough when defendant when do you want to clough today defendant we have room come on down clough u ll pick me up in hrs defendant i sure you mom will just love that clough shes cool ok ill see ya in a bit defendant lol i sure she would have us arrested clough want directions defendant you are so funny.defendant made it clear that he did not believe this was a viable plan.

hewitt created an aol profile that identified him as a fictitious boy named ryan who lived in san jose using the screen name.on november,at about count,hewitt entered the chat room.hewitt did not do anything after he entered the chat room but simply waited to be approached.after five minutes,a number of people,including defendant,sent him instant messages.hewitt began to chat with defendant.because hewitt recognized defendant screen name from clough contact with defendant,he contacted clough,and clough sat in hewitt office while hewitt conversed with defendant.defendant e mailed two photographs to hewitt.one was the same x photo of defendant that he had sent to clough.the other was a photo of defendant fully dressed.
hewitt described engaging in sexual activity with an older guy he had met in a chat room.hewitt asked defendant if ryan was young for you,and defendant responded,n o just as long as your not a cop.after defendant told hewitt that he worked at a movie theater,hewitt asked if defendant would take him to the movies one day.defendant said,i would love to but only if you let me play with you in the back of theatre.defendant claimed,i can make you shoot into the popcorn and then we can eat it.he asked hewitt,is your cock hard now.hewitt responded affirmatively.defendant suggested phone sex,but hewitt declined,not on the first date.hewitt asked defendant,would you like to get together someday,and go to the movies.defendant said maybe and insisted that he would not meet hewitt unless they talked by phone first.defendant asked hewitt to put him on his buddy list.he also asked hewitt,are you going to jack off thinking about my pics.hewitt responded,i have and will.
the next day,at about the same time of day,hewitt again logged on to aol as ryan.he did not enter a chat room,but he a lmost immediately received an instant message from defendant.defendant asked hewitt did you get hard today.hewitt said,i get hard every day.defendant also asked hewitt,where is the weirdest place you jacked off.at the close of the conversation,hewitt reminded defendant i got ur pics.defendant said use them.after this conversation,hewitt handed over the investigation to clough.
on november count,defendant initiated another contact with ryan.defendant and clough discussed masturbation.defendant said his name was marty.defendant asked clough,would you meet me,and clough asked where he lived.after defendant explained that he was miles away,defendant said,if we were closer would you let me pick you up and would you let me kiss you.defendant said he had a boyfriend but we have an open relationship.he asked clough to send him a photo,but he did not want clough to send it to his home.i guess i a little nervous with you having my home address.n ever know you might be working for the cops lol.y our dad might be a cop and find out and have me arrested.clough asked,y ou can get arrested if i send my picture and defendant replied probably not but we get sexual on the puter i not sure if that is illegal or not.when clough asked,c an anything happen to me,defendant responded,i do think anything can happen to either of us and certainly not to you 
clough asked,w as it illegal for you to send me those x pictures.defendant said,yeah ru going to call the cops now.clough said no.defendant said,t he laws says someone your age does really know what he wants.t he laws say you should at the age really know what you want and someone like me can take advantage of that because i am older.clough inquired,d o you want to be with me defendant said,i would not hesitate because you sound like a really cool guy.clough said,i know im,but i know what i want he asked if defendant had been with anyone his age,and defendant said,the youngest was and i was about.i t was really fun and he loved me too we messed around for months then he moved.defendant said,you read in the paper all the time about guys getting arrested because they had sex with someone underage.i think it sucks,because its usually the parents that have them arrested.defendant asked clough about having phone sex.clough asked,i s that illegal defendant said,you know i do know.
during this conversation,defendant sent clough a group of photos that included fully clothed photos of defendant and his boyfriend,the x photo of defendant,the photo and one new photo of two males with erect penises sitting side by side.after sending these photos,defendant said do get me arrested.clough asked,c an you get arrested for sending me that the photo defendant said,probably because of your age i think.they talked more about masturbation.defendant told clough that he wanted to start licking his body.
on november,defendant contacted clough again,and they chatted briefly about masturbation.on january,count,defendant contacted clough again.he sent several photos to clough including the x photo of himself.defendant asked clough,so when you gon na come and be our son hehe.clough said he had had phone sex with someone else,and they discussed having phone sex.on february,defendant contacted clough again they had a fairly innocent conversation with no explicit sexual content.
clough obtained an arrest warrant for defendant and a search warrant for defendant sacramento home.on february,clough went to defendant home and arrested him.clough seized defendant computer clough told defendant that a mother was complaining about him.defendant told clough that he had been chatting with people online,and he admitted that he had chatted with ryan and scotty after meeting them in the chat room.defendant believed that both ryan and scotty were or years old.he admitted that he had talked to both of them about what he like to do with them sexually and sent them pornography.defendant said,h e would tell them sexual things to do to themselves and his goal was to get them to masturbate to the point of ejaculation.
defendant told clough that he had many people he thought were minors on his buddy list.defendant said he had not met any of these people.defendant admitted that he was sexually attracted to males between the ages of and,but he said he had not had sexual contact with any minors since.clough asked defendant if he would engage in sexual activity with scotty or ryan if they lived in an apartment adjacent to defendant.defendant said,there was a good possibility that he would,but he certainly would hope he would not.defendant told clough that he never met ryan or scotty because he was afraid of the police and if he was caught,that it would ruin his life and hurt his family.
defendant was charged by information with ten counts of attempted distribution or exhibition of harmful matter to a minor over the internet,subd.b,and one count of possession of child pornography,subd.a.it was further alleged that he had suffered six prior serious felony convictions within the meaning of penal code sections,subdivisions b to i and.the prior conviction allegations were bifurcated at defendant request,and he subsequently admitted those allegations.
the defense objected in limine under evidence code section to the admission of evidence of defendant prior sex offenses under evidence code section.defendant trial counsel argued that caljic was inadequate to protect defendant from the damaging impact of evidence of his prior offenses.the trial court found that evidence of defendant,and offenses would be unduly prejudicial because of the number of victims and also the nature of the sexual activity,but it concluded that evidence of defendant offenses was more probative than prejudicial in the context of an and therefore was admissible 
the victim of defendant offenses,testified at trial in the prosecution.recounted how he had become friends with defendant after meeting defendant at the store where defendant worked next door to home.at the time,was years old.on about ten occasions,defendant touched in a sexual manner.defendant never threatened in any way or told him not to tell anyone,and he never talked to in a sexually suggestive manner.during,mentioned at one point that defendant had been to prison.
defendant presented an expert witness at trial who testified that gay chat rooms and heterosexual chat rooms were not that different and the behavior is remarkably similar i n these chat rooms,people are having electronic sex in minutes likewise,things you would not think of doing in real life,you do in entertainment in chat rooms.this expert opined that people generally went to chatrooms for entertainment purposes only.in gay chat rooms,there is very much sexual,seductive type of talk.lots of talk about very much explicit conversation.y ou often see a lot of talk about masturbation in those chat rooms and there also a lot of talk about type of things,i like to lick you here,touch you there.he also said that there was a lot of talk about penis size.
the prosecutor opened his argument to the jury by calling defendant a child molester and sexual predator.d efendant wants to have sex with boys,has had sex with boys.that his predisposition.the jury deliberated for one full day before returning guilty verdicts on nine of the ten attempted distribution counts.it acquitted defendant of the initial attempted distribution count based on the december,conversation and of the possession of child pornography count.the court struck the prior conviction findings as to eight of the nine counts,imposed a sentence on the remaining count and imposed consecutive mitigated terms for the remaining counts.thus,the court committed defendant to state prison to serve a determinate term of three years and an indeterminate term of years to life.defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.
ii.discussion 
instruction on definition of intent or purpose of seducing 
defendant asserts that the trial court definition of the intent or purpose of seducing element of the charged offenses was prejudicially erroneous because it permitted the jury to base a conviction on defendant intent to persuade scotty and ryan to masturbate alone rather than requiring an intent to persuade them to participate in sexual activity in partnership with defendant.the attorney general concedes that the statute may plausibl y be construed to require more than merely encouraging the minor to engage in in the physical absence of the accused.nevertheless,he insists that the trial court instructions were not erroneous because the jury was not reasonably likely to construe the instruction as defendant asserts.the attorney general alternative argument is that the instruction was harmless error.
background 
the distribution counts charged that defendant had acted with the intent and for the purpose of seducing the minor.the court initially incorrectly instructed the jury on the intent elements of these crimes.it stated that the required intent was a,the intent of arousing,appealing to,or gratifying the lust,passions or sexual desires of that person or of the minor or b,with the intent or for the purpose of seducing the minor.italics added.at the request of the defense,the jury was instructed that the word seduce means persuading one into sexual intercourse or other sexual activity,not mere discourse.the court did not give another defense requested instruction that would have stated definition of seduce persuading into partnership in sexual intercourse.people hsu th d.in instructing on the possession of child pornography count,shortly after giving the instruction on the meaning of seduce,the court told the jury that s exual conduct means any of the following.whether actual or simulated sexual intercourse masturbation sexual lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic or rectal area for the purpose of sexual stimulation of the viewer whether or not any of the above conduct is performed alone or by members of the same or opposite sex.emphasis added.
in his opening argument to the jury,the prosecutor told the jury that the two intent elements of the crime of distribution were disjunctive.at the completion of the prosecutor opening argument,the court realized that it had made a mistake in its instructions on these intent elements,and the prosecutor conceded as much.the prosecutor then briefly argued that both intents had been proven.intent to arouse,justify the lust passion and seduce.and that been everything you heard as well.he talks about the victims,talks about having sex with them,talks about meeting them to have sex,those things,rather than or.and the instruction was incorrect.and that all that.so again,the evidence is well within as it relates to because you will see exactly what he says about what his intent is.
the court then provided the jury with a corrected copy of the instruction and read the corrected instruction to the jury.the corrected instruction described the two intent elements as,with the intent of arousing,appealing to or gratifying the lust or passions or sexual desires of that person or of the minor,and with the intent,or for the purpose of seducing a minor.emphasis added.
defendant trial counsel closing argument was primarily based on his contention that defendant had lacked the intent to seduce.he maintained that defendant conversations with ryan and scotty were for entertainment and nothing else.he argued that defendant was involved in fantasy,entertainment.he asserted that there was no indication whatsoever that he ever intended to meet these boys.defendant trial counsel did not claim that masturbation could not be a goal of a seduction,but he claimed that it had not been achieved.well,folks,there is no way for them to prove that masturbation ever occurred.remember,on the internet,you ca prove activity.all you got is words.words.
the prosecutor argued that it was not necessary that a meeting be intended.it to seduce for other sexual acts.it does say you have to do that,does say there has to be a meeting,does say there has to be physical contact.what is your intent intent to seduce or get this other person to submit to a sexual act,masturbation,oral copulation,anal sex,repeatedly asking about those things.on the chats,it very clear,and he talks about sex all the time in all the chats.italics added.a gain,i do have to prove the contacts or the intent to contact emphasis added.
after several hours of deliberations,the jury submitted the following question regarding special instruction,there seems to be some kind of confusion regarding the word into.our question is simply does there need to be a cause and effect,or can we define into as meaning leading to special instruction was the instruction that stated,the word seduce means persuading one into sexual intercourse or other sexual activity,not mere discourse.the trial judge responded in writing we do not understand your question could you clarify it or ask it in a different way.the jury responded re special instruction can the court give us a working definition for the phrase persuading one into if something is asked to be done,does the mere asking of something to be done satisfy or does the act need to be completed i hope this makes sense.after consulting with counsel,the court responded in writing are you asking whether there needs to be a completed sex act the jury responded yes.do we need to see confirmation in text on scotty or ryan part that they were persuaded into a sex act we mean that scotty or ryan told the defendant they did the act.the court responded no.for intent,you should read instruction number in conjunction with instruction number,page,number.the trial court reference was to the portion of the instruction on the elements of the offense that stated,the exhibition of the harmful matter was done with the intent of arousing,appealing to,or gratifying the lust or passions or sexual desires of that person or of a minor,and with the intent or for the purpose of seducing a minor.the jury reached its verdicts shortly after receiving the trial court response.
in deciding whether an instruction is erroneous,we ascertain at the threshold what the relevant law provides.we next determine what meaning the charge conveys in this regard.here the question is,how would a reasonable juror understand the instruction.in addressing this question,we consider the specific language under challenge and,if necessary,the charge in its entirety.finally,we determine whether the instruction,so understood,states the applicable law correctly.people warren cal d,accord,people kelly cal th,d.
every person who,with knowledge that a person is a minor,knowingly distributes,sends,causes to be sent,exhibits,or offers to distribute or exhibit by electronic mail,the internet or a commercial online service,any harmful matter,as defined in section,to a minor with the intent of arousing,appealing to,or gratifying the lust or passions or sexual desires of that person or of a minor,and with the intent,or for the purpose of seducing a minor,is guilty of a public offense and shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison or in a county jail,subd.b,emphasis added.
the attorney general agrees with defendant that the statutory element of the intent,or for the purpose of seducing a minor requires an intent by the perpetrator to engage in a sexual act with the minor.the only case that has considered the meaning of this element is people hsu th,d.hsu appeal challenged this intent element as unconstitutionally vague on the ground that seducing was not defined.hsu,at,d.the court very briefly rejected his challenge.although seduce,as hsu notes,can mean simply to lead astray,it is also defined as persuading into partnership in sexual intercourse.webster new internat.dict.in the context of section,subdivision b,with its references to gratifying lust,passion,and sexual desire,people of ordinary intelligence citation would readily understand seducing as used here to mean the latter definition.hsu at,d.
we agree with hsu that,as used in penal code section,subdivision b,the word seducing was not intended to have the vague meaning of lead ing astray webster collegiate dict.ed but to have the precise meaning of carry ing out the physical seduction of entic ing to sexual intercourse.webster collegiate dict.ed.and,in this context,sexual intercourse clearly refers to intercourse involving genital contact between individuals rather than heterosexual intercourse involving penetration of the vagina by the penis.webster collegiate dict.ed.thus,the seducing intent element of the offense requires that the perpetrator intend to entice the minor to engage in a sexual act involving physical contact between the perpetrator and the minor.intending to entice a male minor to masturbate himself does not satisfy this seducing intent element of penal code section,subdivision b.
the next question is whether the trial court instructions,taken as a whole,properly informed the jury of the scope of penal code section,subdivision b seducing intent element.the attorney general insists that the instructions were not reasonably likely to lead a reasonable juror to believe that the seducing intent element could be satisfied by evidence that defendant intended to entice scotty and ryan to masturbate.the attorney general position is difficult to reconcile with the instructions as a whole,particularly in light of the prosecutor argument to the jury.the jury was told that the word seduce means persuading one into sexual intercourse or other sexual activity,not mere discourse.emphasis added.while sexual activity was not defined,the jury was given a definition of sexual conduct that explicitly included masturbation that was performed alone.the prosecutor also explicitly argued to the jury,i do have to prove the contacts or the intent to contact.emphasis added.instead,the prosecutor told the jury that the seducing intent could be proven by evidence of defendant intent to get this other person to submit to a sexual act,masturbation,oral copulation,anal sex emphasis added.in addition,the jury inquiries suggested that the jurors did understand the instructions to permit the seducing intent element to be based on an intent to entice scotty and ryan to masturbate alone.the jury question as to whether it needed to see confirmation in text on scotty or ryan part that they were persuaded into a sex act or that scotty or ryan told the defendant they did the act could only have referred to masturbation since that was the only act that scotty or ryan ever mentioned having performed.
the attorney general argues that no reasonable juror would have understood the instructions to permit the seducing intent element to be based on an intent to entice a minor to masturbate because such an intent would be subsumed by the other intent element of the offense.not so.the other intent element of the offense may be satisfied by proof that the perpetrator acted with the intent of arousing,appealing to or gratifying the lust or passions or sexual desires of that person or of the minor.the perpetrator may act with this intent even if the perpetrator does not intend to entice the minor to perform any sexual act,even masturbation.the perpetrator may simply intend to arouse the minor without enticing the minor to perform any act or the perpetrator may be solely concerned with the perpetrator arousal.we do not believe that reasonable jurors would believe that the seducing intent element was subsumed by the arousing intent element if they believed that the seducing intent element could be satisfied by proof that the perpetrator intended to entice the minor to masturbate alone.
our consideration of the trial court instructions as a whole leads us to the conclusion that it is reasonably likely that the jury understood the court instruction on the seducing intent element to permit it to base the seducing intent element on proof that defendant intended to entice scotty and ryan to masturbate alone.since such proof can not properly support the seducing intent element,the instruction on the seducing intent element was erroneous.
the only remaining question is whether the erroneous instruction was prejudicial.we are unconvinced by the attorney general assertion that any error was harmless.the attorney general contends that this error should be reviewed under the standard set forth in people watson cal d,rather than the standard set forth in chapman california,d.we disagree.an instructional error that improperly describes or omits an element of an offense falls within the broad category of trial error subject to chapman review.people flood cal th,d.the trial court instructional error here improperly describe d the seducing intent element of the offense.hence it was subject to chapman review.
the trial court error can not survive chapman review as the record does not demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.people harris cal th,d.defendant admitted that he had intended to entice scotty and ryan to masturbate.however,it was hotly contested at trial whether he ever intended to meet with them and have physical contact.he repeatedly deferred or rejected scotty suggestions that they meet.his entire defense at trial was that his conversations with scotty and ryan were fantasy and entertainment rather than preludes to physical contact.while the prosecution presented a strong case,we are not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the trial court instructional error did not contribute to the jury verdict.consequently,reversal is required.
b.other issues 
although we must reverse defendant convictions due to the prejudicial instructional error on the seducing intent element,we consider defendant other claims of instructional error for the guidance of the trial court on retrial.because we reverse the judgment and remand for a possible retrial,it would be premature for us to address defendant claim that the sentence imposed by the trial court was cruel and unusual.
instruction defining harmful matter 
defendant asserts that the trial court instruction defining harmful matter was erroneous.penal code section,subdivision b prohibits the distribution of any harmful matter,as defined in section,to a minor with the requisite intents,subd.b.penal code section,subdivision a contains a definition of harmful matter.harmful matter means matter,taken as a whole,which to the average person,applying contemporary statewide standards,appeals to the prurient interest,and is matter which,taken as a whole,depicts or describes in a patently offensive way sexual conduct and which,taken as a whole,lacks serious literary,artistic,political,or scientific value for minors.penal code section,subdivision a provides that,w hen it appears from the nature of the matter or the circumstances of its dissemination,distribution or exhibition that it is designed for clearly defined deviant sexual groups,the appeal of the matter shall be judged with reference to its intended recipient group.
the jury was instructed with the general definition of harmful matter in penal code section,subdivision a.the jury was not informed of the special definition in penal code section,subdivision a.defendant claims that the trial court should have instructed the jury with the special definition in penal code section,subdivision a because the nature of the matter or the circumstances of its dissemination,distribution or exhibition in this case demonstrated that the matter was designed for clearly defined deviant sexual groups.
this contention lacks substantial support in the record.defendant sent pornography to and engaged in explicit sexual discussions with persons who he believed were young boys.the circumstances of his distribution of this material did not indicate that these fictitious young boys were part of any clearly defined deviant sexual groups.all defendant knew about the recipients of this material was that they were young gay boys who had made at least one visit to a gay male chat room.defendant urges that his distribution of this material was to a deviant sexual group because it arose from contacts made in a gay male chat room on the internet.this ignores the fact that none of the charged acts were based on communications within a chat room but instead on personal messages sent to recipients who had already identified themselves as young gay boys.since even young gay boys who occasionally visit gay male chat rooms are not part of a clearly defined deviant sexual group,the trial court was not required to give the special definition of harmful matter in this case.
failure to instruct on lesser offense 
defendant contends that the trial court should have instructed on the lesser offense of attempted misdemeanor distribution of harmful matter in violation of penal code section,subdivision a hereafter the misdemeanor.he claims that this lesser offense is a necessarily included offense of attempted distribution of harmful matter in violation of penal code section,subdivision b hereafter the wobbler.the attorney general claims that the misdemeanor is not necessarily included within the wobbler.
a lesser offense is necessarily included in a greater offense if either the statutory elements of the greater offense,or the facts actually alleged in the accusatory pleading,include all the elements of the lesser offense,such that the greater can not be committed without also committing the lesser.people birks cal th,d.t he trial court must instruct on a lesser offense necessarily included in the charged offense if there is substantial evidence the defendant is guilty only of the lesser.birks,at,d.
