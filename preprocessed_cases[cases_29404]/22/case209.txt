this matter is before the court on the defendants appeal of the western district of virginia grant of summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs.at issue is the constitutionality of ann.section michie supp amended,which criminalizes the dissemination of material harmful to minors over the internet.the district court found the statute invalid under both the first amendment and the commerce clause.for the reasons discussed below,the district court ruling granting summary judgment and striking down the statute is affirmed.
background 
plaintiffs represent a spectrum of businesses,membership organizations,and individuals who use the to communicate,display,and to seek access to a broad range of speech.plaintiffs communicate online both within and from outside the commonwealth of virginia,and plaintiffs speech is accessible both within and outside of virginia.plaintiffs all fear that their online speech could be considered harmful to juveniles in some communities under virginia code section,despite the fact that their speech may receive full constitutional protection as to adults.plaintiffs facially challenged the constitutionality of section and were granted a permanent injunction by the united states district court for the western district of virginia enjoining the enforcement of the statute.
since,virginia has prohibited the knowing display in brick and mortar space,of commercial materials that are harmful to juveniles.ann.michie supp amended.in,virginia amended the statute,making it also unlawful to knowingly display these materials in a manner whereby juveniles may examine and peruse them.acts,ch.several plaintiffs brought suit challenging the amendment as facially unconstitutional on the grounds that it was impermissibly vague and violated the first amendment.after a tortuous path through the courts,the statute was eventually upheld by the fourth circuit in light of a narrowing construction accorded to the statute by the supreme court of virginia.american booksellers ass virginia,cir.
the statute was reenacted as amended in to include electronic files or messages,and was again reenacted as amended in.the statute in its present form makes it unlawful to sell,rent or loan to a juvenile or to knowingly display for commercial purposes in a manner whereby juveniles may examine and peruse 
any picture,photography,drawing,sculpture,motion picture film,electronic file or message containing an image,or similar visual representation or image of a person or portion of the human body which depicts sexually explicit nudity,sexual conduct or sadomasochistic abuse and which is harmful to juveniles,or 
any book,pamphlet,magazine,printed matter however reproduced,electronic file or message containing words,or sound recording which contains any matter enumerated in subdivision of this subsection,or explicit and detailed verbal descriptions or narrative accounts of sexual excitement,sexual conduct or sadomasochistic abuse and which,taken as a whole,is harmful to juveniles.
ann.michie supp amended emphasis added.a violation of section is a class i misdemeanor.
the amendment adds the following 
i f a person uses services of an internet service provider or an electronic mail service provider in committing acts prohibited under this subsection,such internet service provider or electronic mail service provider shall not be held responsible for violating this subsection.
ann.michie supp amended.the amendment creates a defense for internet service providers isps and email service providers when a person violating the statute uses an isp or email service provider as the medium through which to disseminate prohibited material.the isp or email service provider,however,would be liable if it disseminated the material itself as opposed to serving as the gateway through which the material passes.
in relation to the statute,virginia code section,defines the term harmful to juveniles as 
that quality of any description or representation,in whatever form,of nudity,sexual conduct,sexual excitement,or sadomasochistic abuse,when it 
a predominately appeals to the prurient,shameful or morbid interest of juveniles,
b is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable material for juveniles,and 
c is,when taken as a whole,lacking in serious literary,artistic,political or scientific value for juveniles.
section defines knowingly as 
having general knowledge of,or reason to know,or a belief or ground for belief which warrants further inspection or inquiry of both a the character and content of any material described herein which is reasonably susceptible of examination by the defendant,and b the age of the juvenile,provided,however,that an honest mistake shall constitute an excuse from liability hereunder if the defendant made a reasonable bona fide attempt to ascertain the true age of such juvenile.
the relevant community whose standards govern what is harmful is undefined,as is commercial purpose.
plaintiffs filed their complaint and motion for preliminary injunction in the united states district court for the western district of virginia in december of.the honorable james michael,united states district court judge,granted plaintiffs motion for preliminary injunction by order and memorandum opinion on august.plaintiffs then filed a motion for summary judgment granting final injunction,which the district court granted on october.the commonwealth appealed the summary judgment decision.
this court accepted the appeal and oral arguments were scheduled on october.on january,this court certified the following questions of law to the supreme court of virginia 
would the use of any of the technological access controls identified by the attorney general of virginia preclude conviction under virginia code as amended in 
does the prohibition against knowingly displaying pornographic materials that are harmful to juveniles apply to displays made only in connection with the sale,rental,or loan of such materials if not,what must the government establish to prove that a defendant has knowingly displayed such material for commercial purpose 
psinet,chapman,cir.on september,the supreme court of virginia advised this court that pursuant to rule it would not furnish answers to the certified questions because the answers would not be outcome determinative.
the commonwealth argues two issues on appeal.first,that american booksellers is binding precedent in this case and therefore,the statute should not be subject to another facial challenge.second,that the district court erred in granting plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and request for final injunction.because we find that a facial challenge to the statute is appropriate given the facts of this case and that plaintiffs were entitled to summary judgment and a final injunction,we affirm the district court ruling.
ii.analysis 
plaintiffs facial challenge 
the commonwealth argues that the act did not enlarge the scope of section and that this court binding precedent in american booksellers,precludes another facial challenge.the version of the statute,which did not explicitly reference electronic materials,contained two provisions.in reference to harmful print materials,explicitly including books,pamphlets,the statute included the provision however reproduced.in reference to harmful representational materials,the statute included the provision or similar visual representation or image.according to the commonwealth,electronic materials,both print and representational,fit comfortably within these two provisions and the amendment merely explicitly included electronic materials that were already implicitly encompassed by the statute.
the commonwealth arguments,however,are misguided.we agree with the district court that a reading of section illustrates that the phrases do not cover internet material.it is disingenuous for the commonwealth to argue that when the version of the statute was adopted the virginia legislature intended to regulate the vast internet material of today.especially given that the legislature felt compelled to amend the act in to include electronic file s or message s containing words and images.ann.michie supp amended.
general principles of statutory construction require a court to construe all parts to have meaning and to reject constructions that render a term redundant.see reiter sonotone,d where the supreme court explained that a court is obliged to give effect,if possible,to every word platt union pacific.if a construction renders a term redundant,that is a reason for rejecting that construction virginia browner,cir a court should not construe a statute in a manner that reduces some of its terms to mere surplusage united states snider,cir all parts of a statute must be construed so that each part has meaning mclean bank nelson,virginia statutory interpretation requires that all words of a statute be given meaning where possible.the virginia legislature decision to amend section to include electronic communications was not a redundant act simply including an area already covered by the act,but was an affirmative step making the act applicable to internet communication.thus the amendment was clearly a purposeful extension of the act to a new area of communication,and plaintiffs may facially challenge the acts constitutionality as reenacted.
furthermore,this court decision in american booksellers does not preclude plaintiffs facial challenge.in american booksellers virginia,cir this court only considered whether adult materials could be displayed and sold to adults in stores so long as sellers did not knowingly afford juveniles an opportunity to peruse harmful materials.id.at.after the supreme court of the united states certified questions to the supreme court of virginia,this court concluded that the act merely required booksellers to segregate a few works onto a shelf located where bookstore personnel would notice inappropriate juvenile interest while carrying out their regular duties.see id.at.
moreover,this court first amendment analysis in american booksellers dealt with traditional bookstores at physical locations and does not apply to the unique and wholly new medium of worldwide human communication that is the internet.reno,at.nor does selling adult books and magazines in a fixed location raise the commerce clause concerns that state regulation of the internet raises.see jack goldsmith alan sykes,the internet and the dormant commerce clause,yale.
one facial challenge of a statute does not preclude another challenge of an amended statute on different grounds.plaintiffs were permitted to bring a facial challenge of virginia code section michie supp as amended and the district court decision enjoining section was proper.
b.the district court grant of summary judgment 
on october,the district court granted plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and entered a final injunction against the enforcement of section.a motion for summary judgment should be granted only if there is no genuine dispute as to an issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c anderson liberty lobby,d.all facts and reasonable inferences must be interpreted in the light most favorable to the party.see miller leathers,cir.however,summary judgment is appropriate where the facts and the law will reasonably support only one conclusion.hawkins pepsico,cir quoting mcdermott int l,wilander,d.this court reviews the grant or denial of summary judgment de novo.hodge jones,cir.in that the undisputed material facts and law reasonably support only one conclusion in the case at hand,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment.
first amendment analysis 
the district court held that in seeking to restrict the access of minors to indecent material on the internet,section imposes an unconstitutional burden on protected adult speech.as a restriction on expression,the statute may only be upheld if it survives strict scrutiny.united states playboy entertainment group,d applying strict scrutiny to a law restricting explicit programming reno i,at.applying strict scrutiny to regulation of internet speech.strict scrutiny requires the law in question to be narrowly tailored to promote a compelling government interest.playboy,at.
the government has the burden of showing that a regulation of speech is necessary to serve a compelling state interest.first bank bellotti,d.it is clear that the government interest in protecting minors from sexually explicit internet materials is compelling.see ginsberg new york,d recognizing new york compelling interest in limiting the availability of sexual material to minors fcc pacifica,d recognizing the government interest in limiting the broadcast of offensive words dealing with sex that was accessible to children.the question then becomes whether the act is narrowly tailored so that it may pass strict scrutiny.
both sides concede that the act is not narrowly tailored if it effects a total ban on the display of all electronic file s or message s,containing harmful words,images or sound recordings,that juveniles may examine and peruse,as the plain language of the statute seems to indicate.see ann.michie supp amended.to save the statute from unconstitutionality the commonwealth proposes certain statutory interpretations.however,even with the commonwealth creative constructions,the statute remains unconstitutionally overbroad or becomes impotent and thus unconstitutional under the first amendment.
the constitution provides significant protection from overbroad laws that chill speech within the first amendment vast and privileged sphere.ashcroft free speech coalition,d.under the doctrine of overbreadth,a statute violates the first amendment if it prohibits a substantial amount of protected expression.id.in that section penalizes a substantial amount of speech that is constitutionally protected,it violates the first amendment.
several courts have struck down general bans and blanket restrictions on internet speech deemed harmful to juveniles as unconstitutionally overbroad.the commonwealth suggests that we interpret section as regulating only internet speech occurring within the commonwealth of virginia.however,other statutes with that same geographic restriction have been struck down as impermissibly chilling to protected speech.see generally,american libraries ass pataki.attempting to localize internet regulation is extremely problematic because the internet by its nature has no local areas.charles nesson david marglin,the day the internet met the first amendment time and the communications decency act,harv.tech.
other courts have explained that 
a n internet user can not foreclose access to her work from certain states or send differing versions of her communication to different jurisdictions.in this sense,the internet user is in a worse position than the truck driver or train engineer who can steer around illinois or arizona,or change the mudguard or train configuration at the state line the internet user has no ability to bypass any particular state.the user must thus comply with the regulation imposed by the state with the most stringent standard or forego internet communication of the message that might or might not subject her to prosecution.
pataki.at.in fact,based on the pleadings of the parties and the findings of other federal courts,the district court found that for most communications over the internet,the speaker has little or no effective control over whether minors or adults are able to gain access to his communications.dist.op.at citing reno,at.the district court found that speakers who publish on the web generally make their materials publicly available to users around the world,regardless of age,and lack any practical or reliable means for preventing minors from gaining access to the information on their sites or for verifying the true age of users of their web sites.id.the district court went further to explain that the internet is 
w holly insensitive to geographic distinctions,and internet protocols were designed to ignore rather than to document geographic location.while computers on the internet do have addresses,they are addresses on the network rather than geographic addresses in real space.most internet addresses contain no geographic information at all.an internet user who posts a web page in one state can not readily prevent residents of other states from viewing that page,or even discern in which state visitors to the site reside.
dist.op.at citing pataki.at.in that internet speakers have no way of preventing virginia juveniles from accessing their internet speech,the severity of criminal sanctions may well cause speakers to remain silent rather than communicate even arguably unlawful words,ideas,and images.reno,at.in an attempt to deny minors access to potentially harmful speech,section will effectively suppress a large amount of speech that adults have a constitutional right to receive and to address to one another.id.at.individuals who wish to communicate images that might fall within the statute proscriptions must thus or risk prosecution.it is this type of regulation,of otherwise protected speech,that other courts have consistently struck down as unconstitutional.
the commonwealth asks the court to read other propositions into section under the guise of narrowing constructions.the commonwealth suggests that section be read as providing a defense when a web site requires an adult pin number for access.
under the commonwealth construction of section,a web site employing a security screen requiring an adult pin will be immune from prosecution.these pins can be obtained through adult pin registration services online,or the web site could distribute pins itself.an adult would obtain a pin by providing a credit card number to the service dist.op.at.
the commonwealth argues that an affirmative defense for pin numbers must be read into section in light of the supreme court of virginia previous narrowing construction in commonwealth american booksellers ass.the supreme court of virginia explained that to prove a violation under section,in the context of a physical bookstore,the commonwealth would have the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant bookseller knowingly afforded juveniles an opportunity to peruse harmful materials,or took no reasonable steps to prevent such perusal when the juvenile opportunity was reasonably apparent to the bookseller.id.emphasis in original.the commonwealth is persuaded and urges upon the court that the language,reasonable steps to prevent such perusal,in the american booksellers decision should be construed as allowing an affirmative pin number defense to the amendment of the act.
the general principle is that every reasonable construction must be resorted to,in order to save a statute from unconstitutionality.edward debartolo florida gulf coast const.trades council,d.however,only if a statute is readily susceptible to a narrowing construction will the court apply such a construction to save an otherwise unconstitutional law.virginia american booksellers ass n,d.the supreme court has explained that narrowing constructions are only appropriate when the text or other source of congressional intent identifies a clear line that a court could draw.reno,at.courts must be careful not to invade upon the legislative domain and a court should never rewrite a law to conform it to constitutional requirements.see reno,at.
the commonwealth pin number defense is not readily susceptible from the text or any other source of congressional intent.such a reading adding an affirmative pin number defense might be possible if not for the virginia legislature decision to explicitly state the defenses applicable to section.in,just one year after it enacted the language making section applicable to internet communication,the virginia legislature went back and amended section to explicitly add the one defense that it intended to include.the amendment limits the liability of isps and email service providers who simply serve as a medium through which an offender disseminates prohibited material,but says nothing regarding the liability of commercial web sites that use pin numbers.ann.michie supp amended.
furthermore,using the supreme court of virginia language in american booksellers,there is no indication that the use of a pin number would be considered a reasonable step to prevent reasonably apparent perusal by juveniles.as the plaintiffs have previously pointed out,the commonwealth would certainly not agree that a liquor or tobacco store that sold to anyone with a valid credit card number,without some additional step to ascertain the age of the customer,was taking reasonable steps to exclude juveniles from the purchase of age prohibitive products.other courts have questioned both the reasonableness and effectiveness of credit card verification,and there is no indication that the virginia legislature intended to adopt pin number verifications as an affirmative defense to section.this court has no authority to include an affirmative defense to section where the virginia legislature has given no indication explicit or implicit that it intended to include said defense.
finally,the commonwealth pin number solution to the statute first amendment problems creates first amendment problems of its own.the district court explained that the stigma associated with the content of these internet sites may deter adults from visiting them if they can not do so without the assurance of anonymity.the court pointed out that many adults may be unwilling to provide their credit card number online,and would therefore not visit the site.such a restriction would also serve as a complete block to adults who wish to access adult material but do not own a credit card.such requirements would unduly burden protected speech in violation of the first amendment 
the district court was correct in its conclusion that requiring adult web sites to utilize pin numbers would unconstitutionally chill free speech.in that the commonwealth proposed construction would still render section unconstitutional under the first amendment,it would make no sense for this court to adopt that construction.
the commonwealth also asks this court to construe section in a manner that would virtually exempt bulletin boards and chat rooms from its regulations.the commonwealth correctly points out that the amendment to section limits the liability of service providers who do nothing more than set up the internet chat room or bulletin board.see ann.michie supp amended.the amendment does not,however,exempt the speakers who post material in chat rooms and on bulletin boards.
the commonwealth admits that individual speakers who post messages in chat rooms or on bulletin boards for commercial purposes will still be subject to regulation under section.the commonwealth seems to suggest that the number of internet users engaged in this type of speech is so small that a ban on this commercial speech in these forums is permissible however,the number of individuals engaged in a particular type of speech is not determinative of whether first amendment protections must be afforded to that type of speech.
as the district court pointed out,participants in online chat rooms and discussion groups have no way to tell when participants from another state join the conversation or whether that participant is a minor.dist.op.at.as such,speakers could never engage in commercial adult speech in these types of forums without subjecting themselves to the possibility of criminal liability.in essence,speech that receives complete protection as to adults could never be engaged in unless the particular chat room or bulletin board completely banned juveniles furthermore,banning juveniles from these particular formats would prevent them from accessing the beneficial materials,explicit materials,they contain.by the commonwealth own admission,section can not be construed in a way that completely exempts chat rooms and bulletin boards.the blanket prohibition of adult commercial speech that the statute imposes violates the first amendment.
even if the court completely construed section in the manner that the commonwealth requests,such a construction would leave the act virtually powerless.when the government defends a regulation of speech as a means to redress past harms or prevent anticipated harms,it must do more than simply posit the existence of the disease sought to be cured.turner broad,d quoting quincy cable tv,fcc.it must demonstrate that the recited harms are real,not merely conjectural,and that the regulation will in fact alleviate these harms in a direct and material way.id.at.see also edenfield fane,d explaining that the burden is on the party seeking to uphold a restriction on commercial speech to demonstrate that the harms it recites are real and that its restriction will in fact alleviate them to a material degree los angeles preferred communications,d explaining that a c ourt may not simply assume that the ordinance will always advance the asserted state interests sufficiently to justify its abridgment of expressive activity.where strict scrutiny applies,a statute that leaves appreciable damage to th e supposedly compelling interest uncorrected is invalid.church of the lukumi babalu aye,city of hialeah,d internal citations omitted.even commercial speech regulation may not be sustained if it provides only ineffective or remote support for the government purpose.central hudson gas electric public service comm of,d.
in order to avoid being too burdensome on protected speech,the statute can not,by the commonwealth own admission,protect virginia juveniles from foreign or internet materials,regulate internet materials,or regulate materials posted on bulletin boards or in chat rooms.given the nature of the internet,such a construction would leave section virtually powerless.in the district court findings,it explained that communications on the internet do not invade an individual home or appear on one computer screen unbidden.rather,the receipt of information requires a series of affirmative steps more deliberate and directed than merely turning a dial.dist.op.at quoting reno,at.as the district court noted at oral argument,there is no benefit to a law which merely reduces the number of pornographic responses to an internet search by a juvenile from responses to responses hypothetically.at.
there is no indication that technology exists to track web sites or web site users in a manner that would give section any bite.there is also no indication that a significant amount of harmful material available to juveniles in virginia originates within the commonwealth or comes from individuals who would be subject to the commonwealth jurisdiction furthermore,section only regulates commercial web sites,leaving a significant number of equally harmful,web sites,that could be screened by current internet filtering technology.see at.
in essence,the commonwealth has failed to demonstrate in any way that section passes constitutional muster.using the plain language of section and banning the display of all electronic file s or message s,containing harmful words,images or sound recordings,that juveniles may examine and peruse,is not a narrowly tailored solution and is unconstitutionally overbroad.on the other hand,using the proposed narrowing constructions renders section powerless and therefore constitutes an impermissible regulation of speech under the first amendment.see church of the lukumi babalu aye,city of hialeah,d.under either approach,section unconstitutionally chills free speech and therefore violates the first amendment.
commerce clause analysis 
not only may the district court decision be upheld based on section violation of the first amendment,the decision may be upheld on the separate ground that the statute violates the commerce clause.the negative implication of the commerce clause the dormant commerce clause,const.art,cl,includes a prohibition on state regulation that discriminates against or unduly burdens interstate commerce and thereby imped es free private trade in the national marketplace.general motors tracy,d quoting reeves,stake,d.several courts have struck down state statutes similar to virginia code section as unduly burdensome on interstate commerce because they,in effect,restrict commercial electronic materials in all states,not just the state in which the statute was enacted.for example,in american libraries ass pataki,the district court found that because there was no effective way to limit access to online materials by geographic location,a web site owner operating legally in california would have to comply with new york law to avoid being subject to liability there.id.at.this may deter the california web site from placing its material on the internet,thereby affecting legitimate commerce outside of new york.at the least,the california web site would have to incur the expense of complying with new york law if it were willing to post the materials at all because materials accessible online in california are equally accessible online in new york.
adopting the rationale of pataki,the district court rejected the commonwealth arguments and analyzed section as a direct regulation of interstate commerce.the commonwealth attacks the conclusion reached by the district court and argues that the statute should be construed narrowly to comply with the dormant commerce clause.the commonwealth argues that it should be presumed that a legislative body did not intend to give its enactments an impermissible operation.statutes.the commonwealth argues that the statute must be read not to have an impermissible effect unless the language of the statute makes such a reading impossible.see planned parenthood camblos.
the commonwealth asserts that through such a narrow construction the statute would not govern the broad array of web sites that have no contact with virginia other than being accessible here.the logical conclusion of this argument is that the statute would only govern web sites based or web sites with some other form of sufficient contacts with virginia more substantial than merely being accessible here.the commonwealth does not specify what those types of contacts might be.
as the district court pointed out,the nature of the internet itself makes the commonwealth proposed construction nearly impossible.the unique nature of the internet highlights the likelihood that a single actor might be subject to haphazard,uncoordinated,and even inconsistent regulation by states that the actor never intended to reach and possibly was unaware were being accessed.pataki.at.given the broad reach of the internet,it is difficult to see how a blanket regulation of internet material,such as section,can be construed to have only a local effect.see reno,at.justice,concurring in part and dissenting in part discussing the difficulty in applying principles of zoning law to the internet.
however,even if the commonwealth limiting construction were applied,the act would nonetheless be an invalid indirect regulation of interstate commerce because the burdens it imposes on interstate commerce are excessive in relation to the local benefits it confers.in pike bruce church,d,the supreme court set forth the balancing test applicable to indirect regulations of interstate commerce.the inquiry first looks at the legitimacy of the state interest and secondly weighs the burden on interstate commerce in light of the local benefit derived from the statute.pike,at.there is no question that virginia has a compelling interest in protecting the physical and psychological of minors.the local benefits of such a statute,however,have not been proven.
by construing the act so that it only reaches intrastate communication,the commonwealth again finds itself in the same conundrum as it did in its first amendment analysis.if the commonwealth is capable of limiting its internet regulation as not to directly offend the commerce clause,then it will have no local benefit given the vast number of other communication options available to a juvenile seeking them.
even if section can be construed in a manner that does not directly violate the commerce clause,the statute still fails under the dormant commerce clause analysis of pike bruce church.the district court was correct in granting plaintiffs motion for summary judgment because section violates the commerce clause.
iii.conclusion 
the content of the internet is analogous to the content of the night sky.one state simply can not block a constellation from the view of its own citizens without blocking or affecting the view of the citizens of other states.unlike sexually explicit materials disseminated in brick and mortar space,electronic materials are not distributed piecemeal.the internet uniformly and simultaneously distributes its content worldwide.as the district court noted,there may some day be sufficient technology to render this statute constitutional.however,in light of current technology,the statute can not be reasonably construed to meet both first amendment and commerce clause challenges.the district court was correct in granting plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and granting a permanent injunction against section.therefore,the district court decision is hereby 
indubitably,as all agree,government has a compelling interest in protecting children from harm.were i participating in this case as the doting grandfather that i am proud to be,i would eagerly embrace the result reached by the dissent.shedding my familial role,however,as i must,for my proper role as judge,i am pleased to join judge spencer opinion.
the commonwealth contention that a facial challenge to the amended statute is foreclosed on the basis of stare decisis is a legal formalism that i find wholly unpersuasive.for the reasons stated in the majority opinion,it simply could not be more clear that the virginia legislature amended the statute exactly because the prior law did not reach electronic media.i do not believe resolution of the compelling overbreadth claims asserted by plaintiffs in this case can or should be avoided in this way.
on the merits,the majority opinion is unwaveringly faithful to extant first amendment and commerce clause principles.perhaps it is true,as justice holmes famously stated,that hard cases sometimes make bad law,and certainly,as we all know,rapid advances in technology sometimes make hard cases,kyllo united states,d holding that use of a thermal imaging device to measure heat escaping from a residence constitutes a search of the residence ashcroft free speech coalition,d finding unconstitutional certain provisions of the child pornography prevention act of,et.but the majority opinion makes no law at all,good or bad.rather,it simply applies settled law to new facts,and it does so in a manner that is consonant with and well within the boundaries of the judicial function.it is no answer to the plaintiffs claims that,to achieve its assuredly compelling interest in protecting children from exposure to online pornography,virginia has done the best that available technological allows.in a related context,the supreme court has cautioned that t he government may not suppress lawful speech as the means to suppress unlawful speech.protected speech does not become unprotected merely because it resembles the latter.id.at.similarly,the online dissemination of protected speech may not be criminalized a surefire form of suppression merely because such speech might be accessible to virginia minors.thus,virginia effort to do for parents and guardians what the constraints imposed by constitutional free and better able to do for themselves,fails.nor may virginia reach beyond her border to suppress online speech everywhere,even if such an attempt had any plausible prospects of success,which of course it does not.
it may be that the supreme court will one day undertake the task of creating a new metric of speech protection for the age of the internet,but it has not done so to date.accordingly,i fully concur in the opinion affirming the judgment of the district court.
acting under its police powers,the commonwealth of virginia enacted virginia code making it unlawful to knowingly display for commercial purpose pornographic materials that are harmful to juveniles in a manner whereby juveniles may examine and peruse them.ann.a.materials were designated to include any visual representation or image,any printed matter however reproduced,and any sound recording.id.
in,the supreme court of virginia construed the scope of this statute narrowly,see commonwealth am.booksellers ass n,and based on this narrow construction,we held the statute to be constitutional against a first amendment challenge,see am.booksellers ass n,virginia,cir concluding that the statute places a minimal burden on booksellers and represents a constitutionally permissive exercise of the state police powers,cert.denied,am.booksellers ass n,virginia,d.
virginia amended in to make it explicit that the specified examples of visual,written,and recording media that were regulated included any electronic file or message.ann.a.
this action was commenced to mount a renewed facial first amendment challenge to this statute,as amended in.on plaintiffs motion for summary judgment,the district court held that the statute violated the first amendment,as well as the dormant commerce clause,of the constitution,and permanently enjoined enforcement of the statute in the electronic medium.on appeal,the majority now affirms.
for the reasons that follow,i disagree and therefore respectfully dissent.first,we rejected a facial first amendment challenge to this statute in american booksellers,and that ruling now binds us in this case,compelling us to uphold the constitutionality of the statute against this second facial challenge.second,even if we conduct the first amendment analysis again,i would find the statute constitutional because virginia has a compelling interest in protecting its juveniles from harmful pornographic materials,the virginia statute employs the least restrictive alternative that will promote virginia interest,especially in view of the virginia supreme court authoritative construction of the statute,and by application of minimally burdensome technology that is now available,no speech among adults is suppressed.i would also conclude that the statute does not violate the dormant commerce clause.accordingly,i would reverse the judgment of the district court and vacate the injunction that the district court entered against enforcement of virginia code.
when first enacted in,virginia code applied only to the sale,rental,or loan of pornographic material deemed harmful to juveniles.virginia modeled its statute on a new york statute upheld against a first amendment challenge by the supreme court in ginsberg new york,d.
in,virginia amended to prohibit not only the sale,rental,or loaning of material deemed harmful to juveniles,but also to the knowing display of such materials for commercial purpose.in amended form,the statute provided 
a it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly to sell,rent or loan to a juvenile,or to knowingly display for commercial purpose in a manner whereby juveniles may examine and peruse 
any picture,photography,drawing,sculpture,motion picture film,or similar visual representation or image of a person or portion of the human body which depicts sexually explicit nudity,sexual conduct or sadomasochistic abuse and which is harmful to juveniles,or 
any book,pamphlet,magazine,printed matter however reproduced,or sound recording which contains any matter enumerated in subdivision of this subsection,or explicit and detailed verbal descriptions or narrative accounts of sexual excitement,sexual conduct or sadomasochistic abuse and which,taken as a whole,is harmful to juveniles.
ann.a emphasis added to identify statutory language inserted by amendment version.
the version of the statute became the subject of a first amendment challenge that produced five opinions by the supreme court,the supreme court of virginia,and our court,but in the end it was held not to violate the first amendment.
when we first reviewed the version of the statute,conducting a review of a facial challenge,we held that the version discourage d the exercise of first amendment rights in a real and substantial fashion,in that it was not readily subject to a narrowing interpretation so as to withstand an overbreadth challenge.am.booksellers ass n,virginia,cir american booksellers i.although virginia stressed that only a small percentage of the inventory in book stores could be classified as harmful to juveniles and therefore that retail outlets could readily modify their display methods to comply with the amendment,we rejected virginia characterizations.id.we ruled that t he display methods suggested by the commonwealth appear ed either insufficient to comply with the amendment or unduly burdensome on the first amendment rights of adults id.we reasoned that p lacing adults only tags on books and magazines or displaying the restricted material behind blinder racks or on adults only shelves freely accessible in the main part of the store would not stop any determined juvenile from examining and perusing the materials.id.further,f orcing a bookseller to create a separate,monitored adults only section,requiring that the materials be sealed,or taking the materials off display and keeping them under the counter unreasonably interfere d with the booksellers right to sell the restricted materials and the adults ability to buy them.id.
on review,the supreme court concluded that the virginia supreme court construction of the statute might better determine the statute constitutionality a n authoritative construction of the virginia statute by the virginia supreme court would substantially aid our review of the constitutional holding,and might well determine the case entirely.virginia am.booksellers ass n,d.the court accordingly certified two questions regarding interpretation of the version to the supreme court of virginia,pursuant to rule of the virginia supreme court.id.at.focusing on the scope of the law coverage,the united states supreme court asked in its first question 
does the phrase harmful to juveniles as used in virginia code and and supp,properly construed,encompass any of the books introduced as plaintiffs exhibits below,and what general standard should be used to determine the statute reach in light of juveniles differing ages and levels of maturity 
id.at.virginia argued that none of the books that were submitted by the plaintiffs as books covered by the statute were in fact covered by the statute.it maintained that the reach of the statute was much narrower.id.at.the supreme court noted that i f that is true,methods of compliance exist that are substantially less burdensome than those discussed by the lower courts.id.at.the court concluded that it is essential that we have the benefit of the law authoritative construction from the virginia supreme court.id.at.
in the second question,the supreme court focused on what compliance measures potential defendants could take to avoid running afoul of the law prohibition.accordingly,the supreme court posed as its second question 
what meaning is to be given to the provision of virginia code a supp making it unlawful to knowingly display for commercial purpose in a manner whereby juveniles may examine or peruse certain materials specifically,is the provision complied with by a plaintiff bookseller who has a policy of not permitting juveniles to examine and peruse materials covered by the statute and who prohibits such conduct when observed,but otherwise takes no action regarding the display of restricted materials if not,would the statute be complied with if the store policy were announced or otherwise manifested to the public 
at.whereas the plaintiffs alleged that compliance with the law would require drastic measures such as reconfiguring the store or completely barring minors from the store,virginia argued that a bookseller will not be subject to criminal prosecution if,as a matter of store policy,the bookseller prevents a juvenile observed reviewing covered works from continuing to do so,even if the restricted materials are not segregated.id.at.the supreme court explained the importance of the second question if this is what the statute means,the burden to the bookseller,and the adult book buying public,is significantly less than that feared and asserted by plaintiffs.id.at.
the supreme court of virginia accepted the certified questions and responded to the first question,applying the test set forth in the statute,ann,defining the term harmful to juveniles.commonwealth am.booksellers ass n.as to the first two prongs of the test,the court recognized that they presented questions of fact for determination by a properly instructed jury.id.at.the third prong,however,was found to involve a mixed question of law and fact that the court could properly decide.id.the court concluded that if a work is found to have a serious literary,artistic,political or scientific value for a legitimate minority of normal,older adolescents,then it can not be said to lack such value for the entire class of juveniles taken as a whole.id.at.the virginia court then concluded that none of the books submitted by the plaintiffs as exhibits lacked serious literary,artistic,political,or scientific value for a legitimate minority of older,normal adolescents,and thus none of the books were harmful to juveniles within the meaning of ann.id.
the supreme court of virginia also provided a narrow construction of the version in responding to the certified question focusing on compliance measures.the court explained that the scienter requirement in the statute was significant 
a violation must consist of proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the bookseller knowingly afforded juveniles an opportunity to peruse harmful materials in his store or,being aware of facts sufficient to put a reasonable person on notice that such opportunity existed,took no reasonable steps to prevent the perusal of such materials by juveniles.
at.again,the court stated,r easonable efforts to prevent perusal of harmful materials by juveniles are all that the statute requires of a bookseller.id.according to the virginia court,t he question whether a bookseller efforts were reasonable,in any given set of circumstances is,of course,an issue of fact to be resolved by a jury,but certain general principles may be discerned.id.the court then provided a clear example of a method a bookseller might easily adopt to avoid violating the statute.id.if a bookseller placed all restricted books on a shelf in the sight of the bookseller and intervened whenever a juvenile attempted to peruse and examine books on that shelf,then the bookseller would be in compliance with the statute.id.finally,with the assumption that the hypothetical bookseller who has a policy of not permitting juveniles to examine and peruse materials covered by the statute does not merely cerebrate upon such a policy,but takes reasonable steps to put it into effect,the court answered the second certified question in the affirmative.id.according to the virginia supreme court,the version imposes a relatively light burden upon the bookseller,in contrast to the state interest in protecting juveniles from materials harmful to them.id.
upon receipt of the supreme court of virginia answers to the two certified questions,the supreme court vacated our decision in american booksellers i and remanded the case to us for reconsideration of the case in light of the virginia supreme court answers construing the statute narrowly.virginia am.booksellers ass n,d.
in view of the virginia supreme court construction of the statute,we reversed our previous conclusion that the version was unconstitutional under the first amendment.am.booksellers ass n,virginia,cir american booksellers ii.we noted that the supreme court of virginia explanation that the amendment was not aimed at mere browsing but at the opportunity a bookseller may afford to juveniles to take off the shelves books which they are unable to buy,and to read them in the store.id.at.most importantly,we stated that we agree with the virginia supreme court that the amendment to the statute places a minimal burden on booksellers and represents a constitutionally permissive exercise of the state police powers.id.at.the version was thus ultimately held constitutional against a facial first amendment challenge.the supreme court denied the petition for a writ of certiorari.am.booksellers ass n,virginia,d.
to clarify the of applied to any visual representation or image,any printed matter however reproduced,and any sound to make explicit that visual,written,or materials include those created or transmitted electronically,virginia amended the statute in to specify that a visual representation or image includes an electronic file or message containing an image and that printed matter however reproduced includes an electronic file or message containing words.acts ch.codified as ann.a the amendment.
the plaintiffs commenced this action as a second facial challenge of in view of the clarifying amendment.contending that the statute is unconstitutional under the first amendment and under the dormant commerce clause of the constitution,they allege that the amendment extended the reach of the version of the statute from physical space into cyberspace and that,because of the nature of the internet,the amendment is not sufficiently precise to withstand strict scrutiny under the first amendment.they also allege that virginia regulation imposes an undue burden on interstate commerce because the effect of the statute is to restrict commercial electronic materials in all states,not just virginia,for which the statute was enacted.because the plaintiffs filed this action before enforcement of as amended in,there are no facts to govern its application in this case.the plaintiffs could and did allege only how they believed they would be affected by enforcement of the statute.the plaintiffs are businesses that provide internet access,psinet,the commercial internet exchange association businesses that provide content transmitted over the internet,charlottesville sexual health wellness clinic,a different light bookstores individuals who provide content transmitted over the internet,susie bright and membership organizations representing individuals whose access to pornographic materials would be limited by the law,people for the american way.
the district court granted the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and permanently enjoined virginia from enforcing virginia code to the extent it prohibits the sale,rental,loan or display of an electronic file or message containing an image or an electronic file or message containing words.psinet,chapman,d.in doing so,the court ruled that the extension of the law to the internet created a violation of the first amendment where there previously had been none.as the district court explained 
the version of section applied only to traditional media in physical spaces,and thus made it possible to restrict minors access to indecent material without substantially burdening adult access t he same can not be said for material on the internet.that is,efforts to comply with the amendment will result in the exclusion of too many adults from accessing material to be constitutionally sound.
id.at.the district court also held that the amendment violated the dormant commerce clause.as the court explained 
s tate laws regulating cyberspace pornography currently impose a much greater burden on businesses providing adult material on the internet than state laws regulating pornography imposed on adult magazine publishers and other pornography providers thus,to avoid prosecution,an adult web site operator must comply with the most restrictive state obscenity regulations if it is to make its content available on the web at all this leads the court to conclude that,due to the current status of geographic filtering technology on the internet,violates the commerce clause.
from the district court permanent injunction entered against virginia on october,prohibiting enforcement of the amendment,virginia appealed.
the commonwealth of virginia contends first that american booksellers ii,which rejected a facial challenge to the statute on vagueness and first amendment grounds,precludes this second facial challenge to the extent that this challenge is also based on the first amendment.it acknowledges that american booksellers ii does not preclude consideration of the dormant commerce clause issue,nor would it preclude a later as applied claim filed by persons who were not party to the american booksellers case.but virginia notes correctly that this case is not an as applied claim,but a second facial challenge.
the district court rejected virginia position,citing three reasons.first,the court observed that common sense tells a reader of the statute that the initial phrases of the statute do not cover internet materials.psinet,chapman,d.the court pointed out that printed matter however reproduced in the statute refers to printed electronic material.id.second,the district court noted that when the version was enacted,internet communication was not envisioned.id.and third,it asserted that by making the change,the virginia legislature must be presumed to act with purpose and therefore it add ed something entirely different to the statute.id.at.
as amended in,makes unlawful a commercial transaction through which pornographic material harmful to juveniles is sold,rented,loaned,or displayed.the media that are included in the statute are any picture,photography,drawing,sculpture,motion picture film,or similar visual representation or image and a ny book,pamphlet,magazine,printed matter however reproduced,or sound recording.ann.a.in reading this statute in a common sense manner,the district court seemed to have been focused on printed matter and did not recognize the breadth of the statute,which not only includes very specific media as examples but which also indicates an intent to cover all media that may be seen,read,or heard.stripped of the examples provided,the statute prohibits the transference of pornographic material harmful to juveniles through any visual representation or image,any printed matter however reproduced,and any sound recording.the obvious focus of the virginia legislature was on all media that reach the eyes or ears of juveniles.thus,when the virginia legislature added as another example of those media,the electronic medium containing an image or containing words,it was not adding substance to the previous intended language of any visual representation or image,any printed matter however reproduced,and any sound recording.surely,the original statutory language would include harmful material displayed on video tape played on a television or created by electronic means,such as a digital camera.i respectfully submit that common than suggesting an interpretation restricted to any medium that does not include the electronic that the virginia legislature always intended to include all media,and when it added the electronic medium to the list of examples included,it was simply clarifying the statute for the increasingly pervasive electronic age.there is no indication that the version was intended to exclude any medium then in place or thereafter possible.rather,the defining criteria were visual material,words,and sound.
the district court observation that the internet could not have been envisioned by the legislature in and therefore it was necessary to add the reference to electronic medium is unfounded for two reasons.first,it is apparent historically that in,the distribution of pornography by tape recordings and computers was already a problem and that at least one state legislature had already addressed it and others were addressing it.see computer pornography and child exploitation act of,cong.computer pornography and child exploitation act hearings on before the subcomm.on juvenile justice of the senate comm.on the judiciary,cong.testimony of kenneth lanning,fbi special agent,describing the use of computer bulletin boards by pedophiles to communicate with one another cal.stat,at amending section of the california penal code by adding computer program to the list of media capable of disseminating harmful matter to children cohn,kiddy porn enters computer age,united press international,describing the increasing use of computers and video recorders by child pornographers police uncover child pornography ring,associated press,reporting arrest of suspect accused of plotting a national and possibly worldwide computerized child pornography scheme.
second,a statute that uses clearly inclusive language is not rendered inoperable for unanticipated circumstances that fall within the scope of the language.for example,the fourteenth amendment prescribes that no state may make any law denying any person equal protection of the laws.yet no one anticipated at the time of its ratification in that all of the privileges accorded to men must also be accorded to women.nonetheless,the unambiguous language of the protection included women,and it is so construed today.this follows the basic canon of statutory interpretation that we give the words in text their natural meaning,and so long as that meaning is not ambiguous,we presume that to be the intent of the legislature,even though such intent might be historically questioned.
finally,the district court reasoned that by making an amendment in,the virginia legislature must have had a purpose.that purpose,however,need not have been to make a substantive change expanding the scope of the statute.an equally valid purpose would have been to provide clarification to a statute that would be increasingly applied to the electronic medium.indeed,because of the preexisting language,it is reasonable to conclude that the amendment was only a clarification and not an expansion of the statute proscription.
yet the majority accepts the reasoning of the district court in rejecting the applicability of american booksellers ii and,indeed,chooses to reverse it.my independent review of this issue does not permit me to join a ruling rejecting the application of binding precedent.
it is readily apparent to me that our decision in american booksellers ii has binding force on the question whether virginia code is constitutional under the first amendment.the arguments that were made in that first facial challenge are the same that are now made in this case,and the reasons on which we relied in american booksellers ii to reject those arguments also now apply here.
in american booksellers i,the challenge to the statute was a facial challenge based on vagueness and on violation of the first amendment.in our first review,we concluded,as did the district court in this case,that was unconstitutional.when virginia argued that retail outlets selling pornography could readily modify their display methods to comply with the statute,we said that the methods suggested were either insufficient or unduly burdensome.american booksellers i,at emphasis added.we agreed with the plaintiffs assertion that the display provision of the version will unreasonably restrict adult access to materials protected under the first amendment,id.at,stating that the version 
discourages the exercise of first amendment rights in a real and substantial fashion,and it is not readily subject to a narrowing interpretation so as to withstand an overbreadth challenge.
id.at.all of these grounds are parroted in this case by the district court,and now by the majority.
on review of american booksellers i,however,the supreme court observed that if the statute could be construed narrowly,then it might survive the constitutional challenge under the first amendment.the court restated the standing constitutional principle applicable to facial challenges that if readily susceptible to a narrowing construction that would make it constitutional,a statute will be upheld.virginia am.booksellers ass n,d citations omitted.the court accordingly certified to the virginia supreme court the question of whether the statute was to be construed narrowly.when the virginia supreme court indicated that the statute should be narrowly construed to save it from invalidity,commonwealth am.booksellers ass n,the supreme court vacated our holding in american booksellers on remand,we reconsidered our rulings in american booksellers i,and in light of virginia authoritative construction of the statute,we upheld it under the first amendment.american booksellers ii,at.we stated that the burden imposed in that no person shall display for commercial purpose in a manner whereby juveniles may examine and peruse pornographic materials harmful to juveniles places a minimal burden on booksellers and represents a constitutionally permissive exercise of the state police powers.id.even though the argument leading to that language was presented to us from a bookseller point of view,the analysis of the provision constitutionality and our holding were stated more broadly,and they now clearly apply.
since this is merely a renewed challenge in which the same first amendment arguments are made as were made in american booksellers ii,albeit now presented to us by a purveyor using the electronic medium,the holding of american booksellers ii is binding.with respect to the book medium that we considered there,we necessarily held that persons could not openly display books containing material harmful to juveniles in an open air market,even though such a market might be organized to sell books.we held that the implicit requirement imposed by the statute on booksellers to conceal harmful books from the public at large and to reveal them only to adults did not place an undue burden on the booksellers right to sell constitutionally protected material.when our holding is considered in its full breadth,it becomes apparent that it reaches any commercial purveyor of harmful materials.thus,under american booksellers ii,a seller of harmful materials over the internet or through any other medium would have to conceal the harmful materials from the public at large and reveal them only to adults.and in light of the technological controls available to such commercial purveyors on the internet and now being used by demonstrated in part iii,burden is not significantly different from that imposed on booksellers.
i therefore agree with virginia that the first amendment issue is settled and that this second first amendment facial challenge is foreclosed.but even on the merits under a analysis,this facial challenge fails as did the first facial challenge.
the standard for our review is well known.a restriction on constitutionally protected speech is constitutional under the first amendment only if it survives strict scrutiny it must be narrowly tailored to promote a compelling government interest.united states playboy entm t group,d.if a less restrictive alternative would serve the government purpose,the legislature must use that alternative.id.
the district court,as well as the parties,agree that virginia has a compelling interest in denying juveniles access to pornographic materials that are harmful to juveniles,as described by the that depict sexually explicit nudity,sexual conduct or sadomasochistic abuse or that contain explicit and detailed narratives of sexual excitement,sexual conduct or sadomasochistic abuse.ann.a.the sole issue on the plaintiffs facial challenge based on first amendment grounds is whether the amendment is narrowly tailored to promote virginia interest in denying juveniles access to pornographic materials harmful to them.
concluding that the statute was unconstitutional,the district court did not identify any less restrictive alternative that would suggest that the statute was not narrowly tailored.indeed,the court appears to have concluded that the statute was narrowly tailored but,even so,that in balancing the burden imposed by the statute against the benefits gained,the burden outweighed the benefits.such a balancing test,however,does not form part of the strict scrutiny analysis.when it is accepted that the state restriction on speech promotes a compelling governmental interest,the test that we must apply is whether the restriction is narrowly tailored to promote the state interest.playboy,at.
not only did the district court fail to identify a less restrictive alternative to promote virginia compelling interest,it concluded that the alternatives available were not unduly burdensome.as virginia had amply demonstrated in the record,the district court recognized that credit card identification systems and pin numbers,as well as age verification services,are available and effective to restrict a zone of the internet to adults.indeed,the district court found that the costs associated with implementing credit card screening devices and adult pin systems are unlikely to drive adult web sites from the of ideas.the fact that thousands of adult web sites currently utilize verification systems suggests that the burden associated with maintaining such a system is outweighed by the continued consumer demand for the content these web sites provide.psinet,chapman,d.the district court acknowledged that because the virginia statute is limited to material displayed for a commercial purpose,the concerns expressed in reno aclu,d recognizing that the new york statute held constitutional in ginsberg new york,d,applied only to commercial transactions,were not present in this case.psinet,d at.the district court thus concluded explicitly that virginia not overly burdensome on commercial web sites.id.
this finding by the district court should have ended the analysis under the first amendment,with the conclusion that the statute did not violate the constitution.but the district court reached an opposite conclusion,relying on a newly fabricated balancing test and on its further observation that the amendment 
does not include an affirmative defense to prosecution for commercial web sites if they in fact incorporate such compliance measures.thus,even the most responsible adult web sites may have legitimate concerns that they will be subjected to criminal liability in the state of virginia.
psinet,d at.the court thus held that the implicit burden created by the threat of criminal prosecution would inappropriately chill the plaintiffs first amendment rights.id.
even as the district court analysis lies outside of the strict scrutiny analysis,the district court also misapprehended the liability imposed by the virginia the absence of an affirmative defense for reasonable compliance therefore the court miscalculated the extent of any chilling effect.the statute includes the substance of such a defense as part of the state proof in establishing a violation.it punishes persons who knowingly display materials harmful to juveniles.and the virginia supreme court has authoritatively interpreted this liability narrowly 
a violation must consist of proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the bookseller knowingly afforded juveniles an opportunity to peruse harmful materials in his store or,being aware of facts sufficient to put a reasonable person on notice that such opportunity existed,took no reasonable steps to prevent the perusal of such materials by juveniles.
commonwealth am.booksellers ass n.thus,to be liable under this statute,the prosecution would have to show that commercial websites knowingly permitted juveniles an opportunity to peruse harmful materials,or took no reasonable steps to prevent such perusal when they were aware of facts putting a reasonable person on notice of the possibility.id.at.this hardly exposes commercial websites to the broad liability feared by the district court.
as virginia demonstrated in the record,just as booksellers could create zones in their bookstores limited to adult materials and could restrict the perusal and sales of those books to adults,websites can create zones on the internet limited in access to adults.no adult would,through this process,be denied access to constitutionally protected speech.see ginsberg,at.rather,minimally burdensome steps would have to be taken to create such adult zones and to limit access to adults.the supreme court has recognized the nexus between the availability of internet filtering technology and the maintenance of adult access to online pornographic materials.see reno aclu,d.in reno,the court credited the district court finding that at the time of trial existing technology did not include any effective method for a sender to prevent minors from obtaining access to its communications on the internet without also denying access to adults,id.at,and the court therefore commended the district court refusal to rely on unproven future technology to save the communications decency act,id.at.
but as justice pointed out,it is possible to construct barriers in cyberspace and use them to screen for identity,making cyberspace more like the physical world and,consequently,more amenable to zoning laws.reno,at,concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.in the context of,however,justice recognized that the necessary technology was available but was too insufficiently dispersed on the internet to be relied upon for purposes of the communications decency act.as she put it,gateway technology is not ubiquitous in cyberspace,and because without it there is no means of age verification,cyberspace still remains largely unzoneable.id.at,concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part quoting aclu reno.
yet,only five years later,when the supreme court reviewed congress next attempt to regulate internet child online protection act copa it recognized that a publisher of pornographic materials on the internet could target certain audiences and need only take the simple step of utilizing a medium that enables it to target the release of its material into those communities.ashcroft aclu,d.indeed,the court recognized that copa did not foreclose an entire medium of expression on the internet because it only requires that such material be placed behind adult identification screens.id.at.thus,within five years time,the that justice had referred to in reno had become widespread and effective.
and now,the district court in this case has concluded that technological mechanisms exist to create adult zones by using credit cards,passwords,pin identification,adult verification services,and website methods.psinet,d at.moreover,virginia points out what the district court accepted and what the supreme court recognized in ashcroft aclu 
in the world of commercial pornography,electronic screens requiring credit card or age verification devices are commonplace.so,too,are teasers,hardcore pornography strategically placed in front of such screens.all commercial pornographers need to do to abide by virginia law is to move these screens so that such screens appear before pornographic teasers are displayed.
accord ashcroft,at.citing adult identification screens as a feasible internet alternative.
to reach its conclusion that virginia statute violates the first amendment,the majority relies on propositions that are unsupported by the record or that are irrelevant to a determination of the scope of the statute.for example,the majority says that internet speakers have no way of preventing virginia juveniles from accessing their internet speech.ante at.yet,as has been pointed out,virginia demonstrated and the district court accepted the fact that commercial websites distributing pornography are using available technology effectively to create adult zones to regulate access to their material.see psinet,d at.
the majority also says that attempt to deny minors access to potentially harmful speech will effectively suppress a large amount of speech that adults have a constitutional right to receive and to address to one another.ante at quoting reno,at.yet,there is no evidence in the record that the virginia statute will operate to suppress any speech among adults.both virginia and the district court recognized that adults functioning under the statute will always have access to commercially purveyed pornographic materials.the only question that arose was whether the mechanisms for restricting access to adults was too burdensome.just as adults who want access to adult magazines and books must enter a bookstore and demonstrate their age to the bookseller,virginia has demonstrated that adults wanting pornography from commercial purveyors on the internet must enter an adult zone through use of credit cards,pins,or other demonstrated technological gateways before gaining access to adult material.notably,the statute does not reach exchanges occurring in or.
to support its view that the statute overreaches in the scope of its enforcement,the majority essentially discards the virginia supreme court holding that the statute is not violated if a website takes reasonable steps to assure that juveniles are not perusing harmful material.the majority says,
t here is no indication that the use of a pin number would be considered a reasonable step to prevent reasonably apparent perusal by juveniles.as the plaintiffs have previously pointed out,the com
