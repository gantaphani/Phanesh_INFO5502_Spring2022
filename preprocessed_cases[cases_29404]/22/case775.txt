mymail,brought this patent infringement action in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas,charging eight internet service providers with infringing patent the patent.the district court granted summary judgment of noninfringement,and mymail appeals from that order.four of the defendant internet service providers from the district court ruling that mymail has standing to assert infringement of the patent.we affirm the district court judgment in all respects.
the claims of the patent relate to a method of providing network customers with access to a network,such as the internet,when they are away from their normal base of operations.the claimed method operates as follows a customer who is temporarily in a remote location uses contact and login information,a telephone number and a preassigned user id and password to access the internet through an internet service provider isp or through a modem bank affiliated with that isp.patent,ll,ll.through that internet connection the user then contacts another entity called an internet service provider access service or asp.the asp provides the user with login information for a new isp that is more suitable to the customer remote location,typically because it is closer to that location.the user then terminates the connection to the internet established through the first isp and reconnects to the internet by using the new isp.to generalize the invention,the claims use the term network service provider or nsp to refer to a party in a generic network performing the function of an isp and providing modem services to network users.patent,ll,ll.the district court construed all the asserted claims to require the presence of an nsp,a conclusion unchallenged here,and it defined nsp as a party that provides a connection to the network and authenticates users for access to the network.the issue on appeal relates to the authentication requirement.
each of the defendants practices are the same in all respects pertinent to this appeal.in each accused architecture,a user dials in to a modem bank associated with the defendant.the modem bank confirms that the user id has a realm string indicating that the user has an account with a domain serviced by the modem bank.thus,for example,if the modem bank services earthlink customers,the modem bank looks for the term earthlink in the customer id,as in the id if the realm string does not match a domain serviced by the modem bank,the modem bank denies the user internet access.if the realm string matches,the modem bank sends the user id and password to the defendant that operates that domain.the defendant checks the id and password combination against a database of valid users.the result of that authentication query is then communicated to the modem bank,where the user is allowed or denied internet access depending on whether the authentication process indicates that the customer is a valid user entitled to service.once connected,the defendant updates the user access information,which may include new or updated user ids and passwords,or telephone numbers for modem providers.the user then reconnects at a later time using the new access information.
under mymail theory,the defendants infringe the asserted claims because the modem banks serve as the nsps referred to in the claims,while the defendants serve as the asps referred to in the claims.mymail argues that the defendants infringe because the modem banks and the defendants connect users to the internet and to nsps by using the methods claimed in the patent.
the district court found that the patent defines authentication as the process of checking whether the user id and password are valid.because the defendants are the ones performing the authentication check and,under mymail theory,the defendants are the asps,the district court determined that the alleged nsps did not perform the required authentication and thus the defendants could not infringe the patent.
on appeal,mymail first argues that authentication is not a function the nsp must perform.second,mymail argues that even if the nsp must perform authentication,conducting a realm string check or forwarding the user information to the asp and allowing or denying access according to the defendants reply would satisfy any authentication requirement.we agree with the district court that authentication is a required function of the nsp and that the functions performed by the nsp in the defendants systems do not constitute authentication.accordingly,we affirm the district court on this issue.
netzero,juno,netbrands,and earthlink,arguing that mymail is not the owner of the patent and thus lacks standing to bring an infringement action.mymail obtained ownership of the patent through an assignment from robert derby.derby had acquired the patent application through a state court foreclosure action on a promissory note secured by the application.the defendants allege that the promissory note was fraudulent and that mymail chain of title is therefore insufficient to establish lawful ownership of the patent.they do not say who the legal owner should be,but they assert that the district court must be able to inquire into that issue and,effectively if not explicitly,should be able to set aside the state court judgment granting ownership rights to derby.we agree with the district court that the state court judgment is not amenable to collateral attack in this proceeding and therefore deny relief on the.
we first address the jurisdictional question that several of the defendants have raised in their.a plaintiff must demonstrate legal title to the patent at the inception of the lawsuit to be entitled to sue for patent infringement.paradise creations,uv sales.state this case texas the question of who has legal title.int l nutrition horphag research,jim arnold hydrotech.here,mymail has shown that it was the legal owner of the patent at the inception of the lawsuit.mymail relies in part on an enforceable state court judgment that transferred title under texas law,a judgment that under texas law is open to challenge only in certain limited circumstances.the defendants must nullify that judgment to establish a break in the title chain.they have not attempted to do so under the applicable provisions of state law.
instead,the defendants argue that,as a matter of federal law,anyone can assert fraud at any time and thereby require a federal court to make an independent review of all facts underlying the purported chain of title.in support of that proposition,the defendants rely on precision instrument manufacturing automotive maintenance machinery,and its progeny,which deal with conduct relating to the procurement of a patent.while it is true that fraud relating to patent procurement can be raised as a defense in federal court,the same is not true of fraud relating to patent ownership.fraud in the procurement bears on the enforceability of the patent and thus implicates the public interest in ensuring that the grant of patent rights is legitimate.mercantile bank howmet,cir citing precision instrument,at.asserting that a third party owns a particular patent,however,is a different matter.in that case,the enforceability of the patent is not challenged the only question is one of ownership.see id.state law,not federal law,addresses such property ownership disputes.accordingly,we affirm with respect to the.
on the merits,mymail first argues that the district court wrongly construed the patent to require the nsp to perform authentication.both parties agree that the term nsp is a coined term,without a meaning apart from the patent.as construed,all the asserted claims involve communicating with the asp through a connection established by the nsp.we therefore look to the specification to determine what the nsp must do when establishing that communication link.see phillips awh,en banc.
an examination of the specification reveals that the invention requires the user to be authenticated before being given access to the internet.when describing the initial steps of the inventive method,the specification states that,t o begin the process of the present invention,the user is provided a
