in this appeal from convictions for receipt and possession of child pornography,we hold today that the district court acted within its discretion in allowing the jury to briefly view a carefully limited number of images that were the subjects of the charged offenses.ganoe offer to stipulate that anyone viewing the images would have known that they met the legal definition of child pornography did not render the evidence impermissible,because he refused to also stipulate that the titles of the computer files alone were enough to import knowledge of what they were.we also affirm the denial of ganoe motion to suppress evidence obtained by a federal agent using software.ganoe installed and used software on his computer he knew or should have known that the folder into which he downloaded files was accessible to others on the network.we hold that ganoe lacked an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in those files.lastly,we find no error or abuse of discretion in the district court calculation of ganoe sentence.
factual and procedural background 
the investigation 
on january,immigration and customs enforcement special agent ken rochford was using limewire to locate people using programs to trade child pornography.limewire is a program that can be downloaded from the internet free of charge it allows users to search for and share with one another various types of files,including movies and pictures,on the computers of other persons with limewire.once a user downloads the program onto his computer,the user can click on an icon that connects his computer to others on the network.users can input search terms and receive a list of responsive files available on other computers connected to the network.
upon observing a file entitled baby j compilation,rochford downloaded and viewed the movie,confirming that it depicted an adult having sexual intercourse with a very young girl.the computer forensics expert testified that babyj is a common term in the world of child pornography,referring to a specific victim of child exploitation depicted in a series of pictures and movies.rochford used limewire browse host feature to view all of the files being shared by a particular host,thereby discovering four additional file titles that suggested similar content.rochford downloaded and viewed these files,observing that they too contained footage of children engaged in sexually explicit conduct.rochford determined that the downloads originated from a computer with a particular ip address,and that the ip address was assigned to tyrone ganoe,located at a specified residence in norwalk,ca.
agents obtained a search warrant for that address,which was executed on march.tyrone ganoe arrived at the residence while the agents were engaged in the search.he spoke with agent margaret condon,who advised him that he was not under arrest but that she would like to ask him a few questions.ganoe agreed,confirming that he lived at the house with his mother josephine and his sister yvette.condon asked ganoe if he knew why the agents were there,and he said that he did he explained that he had been using limewire to download music and had inadvertently downloaded child pornography.he stated that the bad stuff could be found in the z folder on the imac.upon examination,the z folder was found to contain image and movie files suspected to be child pornography.
the day after the search of ganoe residence,agent condon called ganoe on his cell phone to inform him that he could retrieve some of the items taken during the search.ganoe volunteered that he was seeking counseling for his problem.agent condon asked him what he meant,and he stated that he was referring to his habit of viewing child pornography.
the indictment 
the first superseding indictment charged ganoe with three counts of knowingly receiving child pornography and one count of knowingly possessing child pornography,all in violation of.the first count alleged that ganoe had received a digital image entitled babyj cock in.on or about november.the second count alleged that ganoe had received a digital image entitled.mpg on or about december.the third count alleged that ganoe had received a digital image entitled.mpg on or about january.the fourth count listed different image titles and alleged that ganoe had possessed at least one on or about march.
prior to trial,ganoe moved to exclude the images at issue on the grounds that they were inflammatory and unduly prejudicial,offering to stipulate that the images seized on the computer at the ganoe family home are child pornography within the meaning of the statute,and that any reasonable person viewing the images would have known that they were child pornography.the government sought more,asking the defense to stipulate that ganoe himself had knowledge that they were,in fact,illegal.defense counsel refused and the court directed the attorneys to attempt to agree on a stipulation that might make the introduction of such images unnecessary.alternatively,counsel should attempt to agree to a representative selection of still photographs and short portions of video clips to be introduced into evidence after the government presents evidence sufficient for the jury to conclude that defendant saw the images.
at a subsequent hearing on the motion to exclude the images,the district court reviewed the selection of images proposed by the prosecution for viewing by the jury.defense counsel reiterated that the images were highly inflammatory and argued further that the sequence was very repetitive defense counsel again asserted that the proffered stipulation makes the whole issue moot.the district court directed the government to select ten images to show to the jury.the district court also directed the government to investigate whether technology was available to distort the faces of the children depicted in the images.on january,the parties stipulated that the images specified in the indictment were transported in interstate commerce and depicted actual minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct.despite defense counsel earlier proffer,this stipulation did not include the provision that any reasonable person would have known that the images were child pornography.
in its written order the district court elaborated on its reasoning.noting that the government was obligated to prove that ganoe knew the downloaded images were child pornography and that ganoe would not so stipulate,the district court reasoned that the images must be produced so that the jury can determine whether a reasonable person would know of the nature of the images.
the next day,immediately prior to the beginning of trial,defense counsel made another attempt to have the images excluded,offering to stipulate further that a nyone who sees those images for one second knows that they are child pornography.
the following day the government offered to accept a stipulation that anyone who read the file titles would have known they were downloading child pornography.the defense refused,rejecting the proposition that merely selecting a file for download on the basis of a title was sufficient to constitute knowledge in the absence of a showing that the images were actually viewed.the district court ruled that although the images obviously are prejudicial,in the context of this case,they are extremely probative.they have been limited.we have inquired of the jury concerning their ability to view those images.we have an instruction that i will give them that the government proposed,and i am going to allow the images to be shown.
also prior to trial,the defense moved to suppress the evidence obtained from ganoe computer during the execution of the search warrant on the grounds that rochford initial search was illegal.the district court denied the motion,reasoning that ganoe did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in a computer on to which he had loaded the program.rejecting ganoe claim that he was enough to have used the disabling feature,the district court concluded that h e knew or should have known that the software might allow others to access his computer.
ganoe also sought to exclude evidence of the firearms seized at the ganoe family,including evidence that some of the weapons were not legal to possess.the district court ruled that the evidence was not inextricably intertwined with the charged conduct,and that the admissibility of the evidence would depend on the evidence introduced by ganoe the district court instructed that the government was not to introduce the firearm evidence without seeking permission.
the prosecution 
at trial agent rochford testified about his experience in investigating child pornography offenses and explained how he had downloaded files containing child pornography from an ip address later determined to be associated with ganoe computer.agent condon testified about the search that was conducted at the ganoe residence,including ganoe statements acknowledging his possession of child pornography,and her subsequent telephone conversation with ganoe in which he volunteered that he was receiving counseling for his problem.bruce pixley,the government computer forensics expert,explained how programs such as limewire work and testified about his examination of ganoe computer.pixley said that he found pictures and videos depicting child pornography in a subfolder entitled z,located within the itunes folder.ten of these images,each lasting only a few seconds,were shown to the jury one time.in addition,before the images were played,the district court gave a cautionary instruction that the images were being shown only to assist you in determining whether the government has met its burden to prove the defendant guilty of all of the elements of the charges against him.the district court cautioned the jurors not to allow any feelings that you may have regarding these images to affect this determination in any way,and reminded the jurors of their oath to be fair and impartial to both sides.
the defense 
the defense called ganoe sister yvette,her boyfriend joseph dilello,and her friend rhonda poston to testify that a man named ray rodriguez lived at the ganoe family home for several months during the fall of and the winter of,but vanished after yvette told him that federal agents had seized the computer from the music room.dilello testified that he had personally observed rodriguez search for and download child pornography on to the computer,and that he had never seen ganoe on the computer.the defense also called a number of witnesses to provide alibis for ganoe on the dates and times during which the child pornography was downloaded.
prosecution rebuttal case 
in rebuttal the prosecution called coraly serrano,ganoe.serrano testified that ganoe asked her to assist him in the fabrication of an alibi and that the ganoe family had invented the existence of ray rodriguez.at the conclusion of the direct examination,defense counsel asked to defer,stating that serrano testimony was nothing we have ever heard before and that the defense needed an opportunity to look into it further so that we can address the witness appropriately.the court denied the request,and serrano was about her feelings of anger towards ganoe as a result of their.during the of serrano,defense counsel renewed the request for a continuance to allow for additional preparation,which the district court denied.
the government also recalled pixley,who testified that whoever was using the computer at the time the child pornography was downloaded had also accessed ganoe paypal account,used ganoe american express card,logged onto his email account,and sent emails to people associated with ganoe,suggesting that it must have been ganoe himself.
defense surrebuttal 
after the conclusion of the prosecution case in rebuttal,defense counsel sought to present surrebuttal,asking to recall yvette,dilello,and poston to address the accusation of fabrication.the district court agreed to very limited questioning to allow these witnesses to address the allegations that they had fabricated the existence of rodriguez.joseph dilello testified that a list of passwords and user names for various websites was kept next to the computer,suggesting that anyone using the computer could have accessed these sites.dilello was about the password list and other aspects of his testimony,and was then excused by the judge,at which point defense counsel sought to ask one question.the district court refused at sidebar,defense counsel explained that she wanted dilello to identify the paper containing the password list and to have the list introduced into evidence.the district court denied the request on the grounds that counsel had the paper during direct examination.
defense counsel also sought to call coraly serrano back as an adverse witness to probe more extensively serrano biases and motives.the district court viewed this proposed line of questioning as outside the purview of proper surrebuttal,noting that the defense had been well aware of serrano existence prior to her appearance on the prosecution witness list.after an extended colloquy regarding the scope of questioning that would be allowed,serrano took the stand and was asked about her relationship with the ganoe family,her blog postings about ganoe and his arrest,and a number of other topics.defense counsel began to question serrano about her employment history,triggering a relevance objection from the prosecution.at sidebar,defense counsel explained that she was preparing to ask the witness about prior instances of dishonesty,specifically that serrano had undergone breast augmentation surgery and charged it to the credit card of her former employer similarly,that while working for a finance company serrano had purchased shoes using stolen credit card numbers from the company customers.commenting that i t does really have anything to do with this case,the district court ruled that such questioning would not be allowed.
verdict,sentencing,and appeal 
ganoe was convicted on counts one,two,and four,and was acquitted on count three.he was sentenced to months in prison,a fine,and five years of supervised release.he timely appealed and raises the following claims of error.
ii.discussion 
a.the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the jury to view a carefully tailored selection of the child pornography images charged in the indictment.
ganoe contends that the images of child pornography shown to the jury were unfairly prejudicial,lacking in probative value,and should have been excluded under federal rule of evidence.reviewing for abuse of discretion,see united states,cir,we find none.
federal rule of evidence provides that evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.as to the danger of unfair prejudice,ganoe observes that the images at issue here were unusually inflammatory,depicting children as young as four years old being subjected to anal and vaginal intercourse with adult males.ganoe asserts that the probative value of the images was eliminated by his offer to stipulate that the images represented actual children engaged in sexual conduct and that anyone seeing the images even for a moment would know that they were child pornography.we disagree.
to begin,ganoe proffered stipulation was incomplete,because he refused to stipulate that the file titles alone would convey to a reasonable user that the files contained child pornography moreover,some aspects of his defense suggested that one could mistakenly download such files thinking they were adult pornography or otherwise legal.this left the government with the obligation to prove that ganoe was aware of the content of the images.as to this burden ganoe proffered stipulation was silent,whereas the conjunction with the rest of the forensic a great deal.of the child pornography files charged in the the subset shown to the had titles that were excruciatingly suggestive of the content babyj cock in her,while other titles could arguably be said to be ambiguous as to either the depiction of sexual conduct babyj teddy or the age of participants.every single child pornography file found on ganoe computer,descriptively titled or not,was placed in the z folder,and the z folder contained nothing but child pornography.pixley explained
