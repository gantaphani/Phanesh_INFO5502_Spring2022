petitioners,providers of the technology of internet telephone service,challenge an order of the federal communications commission commission or fcc that gave them only days to do what is already required of providers of traditional telephone service transmit calls to a local emergency authority.we deny their consolidated petition for review because we conclude that the commission adequately considered not only the technical and economic feasibility of the deadline,inquiries made necessary by the bar against arbitrary and capricious,but also the public safety objectives the commission is required to achieve.
one of the many dramatic changes the internet has brought to telecommunications has been the development of interconnected voice over internet protocol voip service,which allows a caller using a broadband internet connection to place calls to and receive calls from other callers using either voip or traditional telephone service.requirements for service providers,first report and order and notice of proposed rulemaking,wl order.from a caller perspective,interconnected voip service is,for the most part,similar to traditional telephone service,and its users reasonably expect it to function the same.but two additional capabilities of voip service undermine those expectations when callers try to use emergency services.voip service allows callers to choose what are called area codes.for example,a customer living in the district of columbia can use an area code from anywhere in the country.some interconnected voip providers ivps also offer nomadic service,which allows a voip telephone call to be made and received from wherever the user can establish a broadband connection.by contrast,fixed voip telephone service can only be used from a dedicated,fixed in a home or office.as attractive as these two features may be,each makes it difficult for ivps to provide the local callers the emergency service they expect and upon which they rely.routers designed to direct calls can not recognize area codes,and unlike traditional and wireless telephone service,there are no means yet available to easily determine the location of a caller using interconnected voip service.ivps,which were not required to do otherwise,failed to use dedicated trunks communications paths connecting two switching systems,used to establish an connection set aside for routing calls to a local emergency call center known as a public safety answering point or psap and instead routed calls to administrative lines that had not been designed and were not staffed to handle emergency calls.id.at documenting various instances in which consumers were unable to contact emergency help after dialing using an interconnected voip service.the resulting tragedies gave rise to the order at issue.
the commission,which had previously been reluctant to regulate this nascent industry for fear of hindering its development,see,services,notice of proposed rulemaking,wl notice of proposed rulemaking or nprm noting that services had developed in an environment that is free of many of the regulatory obligations applied to traditional telecommunication services,decided that an immediate solution was required to discharge the commission statutory obligation to promote an effective nationwide emergency access system,order,at the commission thus ordered that 
within days of the effective date of this order an interconnected voip provider must transmit all calls,as well as a call back number and the caller registered location for each call,to the psap,designated statewide default answering point,or appropriate local emergency authority that serves the caller registered location.
id.citations omitted.
in effect,the order requires that all ivps,including those that offer nomadic service using area codes,ensure that their users are able to reach local emergency services when making calls.to do so,ivps must route all calls using the technology known as automatic number identification ani or,if necessary.ani identifies the calling party and may be used as a call back number.a is a number,consisting of the same number of digits as ani,that is not a north american numbering plan telephone directory number and may be used in place of an ani to convey special meaning.id.because local selective routers are not capable of delivering numbers to a local psap,are used to temporarily mask the true number with a local number to facilitate processing by the local selective router for delivery to the psap.see id.the commission was less stringent in requiring the use of automatic location information ali,which provides an emergency dispatcher with the geographic location of the caller,because it is not yet technologically feasible to detect automatically the location of nomadic voip callers.the order only requires,therefore,that ivps ensure that calls are routed to the registered and not the actual location of each caller.see order,at.ivps,however,must provide a way for consumers to update their registered locations in a timely fashion.see id.these interconnected ivp calls must also be routed through the wireline network see id.at.
the commission did not dictate a specific manner for ivps to provide access.instead,the commission noted that ivps could satisfy these requirements by interconnecting directly with the network through incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs,see id.at,by interconnecting indirectly through a third party,see id.at,or by any other solution that results in access,see id.finally,the order requires that interconnected voip providers notify every customer,new and existing,about the circumstances under which service may not be available through the interconnected voip service or may be in some way limited by comparison to traditional service.id.at.
under the administrative procedure act,which governs our review of this challenge,petitioners burden is to show that the order is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law,see a.they rely upon three arguments to meet that burden.first,petitioners assert that the order deadline for ivps to provide service to their users of nomadic,voip service is an unexplained departure from the commission precedent made without adequate regard to economic and technological obstacles.petitioners also fault the order for requiring that ivps connect to the wireline network but failing to impose a corresponding duty on ilecs to permit this connection.finally,petitioners contend that the commission did not give adequate notice of the substance of the order.we consider these arguments in turn and find each wanting.
a.the fcc decision to require all providers of nomadic,voip provide access within days.
petitioners assert that the commission disregarded record evidence that the deadline was not feasible because there was no demonstrated way to overcome the technical and practical obstacles to implement for providers of nomadic,voip service.but this argument fails in the face of substantial contrary record evidence that the nation largest interconnected voip provider had already procured a technical solution to meet the deadline the commission noted that intrado,a competitive local exchange carrier,was already prepared to offer a technological solution that met the order requirements,even for providers of nomadic,service.order,at.at the time the order was promulgated and in advance of the deadline,intrado was already offering a service that enables the delivery of a voip subscribers sic address and call back number to the most geographically relevant psap,thereby accommodating the nomadic capability inherent in their voip service.ex parte letter from boyd,intrado,to dortch,fcc,wc docket,see also ex parte letter from boyd,intrado,to dortch,fcc,wc docket.vonage,the nation largest voip provider,agreed with verizon,the ilec controlling the wireline network in its territory,that it would use intrado service to deliver both caller location and call back number to emergency services personnel for calls placed throughout verizon territory,and would do so by november,before the november,deadline.ex parte letter from wilhelm,vonage,to martin,fcc,wc docket may.
the commission also relied on ivp trials that demonstrated access was possible for providers of nomadic,voip service.for example,qwest and vonage conducted a test of voip access in king county,washington.this test included both an experimental means of pstn access and a messaging component used to deliver the calling party location automatically.petitioners focus on the failed experimental access component ignores the successful messaging component of the trial that demonstrated voip access was in fact possible.in recounting the results of this trial,qwest noted that,rather than using this failed experimental access,an ivp could provide service using a combination of qwest tarriffed access to the wireline network and third party support services ex parte letter from,qwest,to dortch,fcc,wc docket.vonage had also successfully tested access for nomadic voip in newport,rhode island.see ex parte letter from wilhelm,vonage,to dortch,fcc,wc docket may.petitioners seize upon two elements of this newport test to argue that it is an unreliable basis for the order.first,there is only one psap in small rhode island and so this test could not address the critical issue of routing calls to the wrong psap.second,the state and not an ilec owns the selective router and so there is no issue of providing access to the wireline network.petitioners have no doubt identified elements in this test that provide some grounds to distinguish them from what the order demands,but the general success of the rhode island test,combined with the substantial deference we owe the fcc predictive judgments,overcomes the petitioners objections.see,int l ladies garment workers union donovan,predictive judgments about areas that are within the agency field of discretion and expertise are entitled to particularly deferential treatment.see also charter commc ns,fcc,that is a predictive judgment that the fcc is entitled to make and to which we defer.
petitioners argument that the submission of the national emergency number association nena undermines the commission conclusion that the deadline was reasonable also fails to account for the deference we give to an agency predictive judgments.nena opined that the bulk of national access to could be reached within days,but noted that f ull national access could take another months.ex parte letter from hobson,nena,to dortch,fcc,wc docket may,emphasis added.the commission was acting well within its authority to use its expertise to make predictive judgments when it concluded that if the bulk of national access could be achieved within days,it was reasonable to use that time period.
we must also address the petitioners claim that the commission erred by failing to distinguish between the technological obstacles faced by nomadic or voip providers and those faced by fixed,native providers.they allege the commission based the order on the technological capabilities associated with fixed voip service and overlooked the unique challenges posed by nomadic,voip service.but the commission in fact considered the unique technological challenges of nomadic voip,see order,at noting that certain nomadic or portable voip services pose significant implementation challenges,and taking stock of those challenges,did not require that ivps determine the actual location of nomadic voip users because it is not always technologically feasible for providers of interconnected voip service to automatically determine the location of their end users without end users active cooperation,id.at.instead,the commission determined that ivps must provide only the registered location of the nomadic voip user making a call,see,and called for comment on the feasibility of automatically determining the geographic location of nomadic voip users,see id.at.
petitioners argument that the commission overlooked the economic cost of implementing the order deadline highlights that our task under the arbitrary or capricious standard is to determine only whether an agency decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment,motor vehicle mfrs.ass of,state farm mut.auto.ins,d quoting bowman,freight system,d.petitioners overlook a countervailing interest that the commission must consider and we must threat to public safety.when,as is the case with the fcc,congress has given an agency the responsibility to regulate a market such as the telecommunications industry that it has repeatedly deemed important to protecting public safety,the agency judgments about the economic cost of its regulations must take into account its duty to protect the public.the commission is required to consider public safety by both its enabling act,see communications act of,so as to make available,so far as possible a wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges for the purpose of promoting safety of life and property through the use of wire and radio communications emphasis added,and the wireless communication and public safety act of,shall encourage and support efforts by states to deploy comprehensive emergency communications infrastructure and programs,based on coordinated statewide plans,including seamless,ubiquitous,reliable wireless telecommunications networks and enhanced wireless service.the commission here weighed public safety against the economic cost of compliance with the order and found that,w hile days is an aggressively short amount of time in which to comply with these requirements,the threat to public safety if we delay further is too great and demands near immediate action.order,at emphasis added.
because the commission has reasonably determined that nomadic,voip access is technologically feasible,any argument about the time period required for implementation is nothing more than a quarrel over relative costs and benefits.in this case,the commission has weighed the cost of an aggressive implementation the cost in human lives,and found in favor of public safety.see id.at we find that this requirement most appropriately discharges the commission statutory obligation to promote an effective nationwide emergency access system by recognizing the needs of the public safety community to get call back and location information and balancing those needs against existing technological limitations of interconnected voip providers.public citizen auchter,delays that might be altogether reasonable in the sphere of economic regulations are less tolerable when human lives are at stake.we may not disturb its determination where,as here,the commission has considered relevant factors and has articulated a reasoned basis for its conclusion.see state farm,at.when viewed in this light,we can not agree that the deadline is arbitrary or capricious.
petitioners final challenge to the deadline is that it represents an unexplained departure from precedent.the precedent,so the argument goes,was established when the fcc gave more time for wireless and satellite phones and other new technologies to implement capabilities than the aggressive deadline it has imposed on the new voip telephone service market.petitioners are right that an agency departing from precedent must provide a principled explanation for its change of direction.black media coalition fcc,see also airmark faa.but surely different technologies may reasonably bear different regulatory burdens.it is not apparent to us that the regulation of satellite or wireless phones is clear precedent for the regulation of information technology service providers.no doubt each involves telephone communications,but the differences between satellite and wireless phone service on the one hand and voip service on the other are such that the commission has previously refused to classify services as telecommunications carriers.we give deference to agency expertise used to distinguish its prior cases from present controversies.see ppl montana,llc surface transp,t he agency attempt to distinguish its prior cases,while terse,is entitled to deference.quoting inland lakes,nlrb.even if the commission regulatory approach to these other telecommunications services provided a precedent for
