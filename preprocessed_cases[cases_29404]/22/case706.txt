the communications act of act,as amended in,authorizes the commission to award radio licenses through a system of competitive bidding.j.in designing such a system,congress directed the commission to promot e economic opportunity by disseminating licenses among a wide variety of applicants,including small businesses.id.j b.consistent with this goal,congress further directed the commission to consider alternative payment schedules and methods of calculation,including lump sums or guaranteed installment payments.id.j a.pursuant to this mandate,the commission reserved two blocks of licenses,the c and f blocks,for bidding by small businesses,as defined in terms of annual gross revenues and total assets.in re implementation of section j of the communications act,wl.noting that the primary impediment to participation in license auctions by small businesses is lack of access to capital,id.at,the commission adopted an installment payment plan to allow successful bidders in the c and f blocks to pay their winning bid over time.id.at.in announcing these measures,the commission stated that t imely payment of all installments will be a condition of the license grant and failure to make such timely payment will be grounds for revocation of the license.id.at.
in may and january,century was a successful bidder,ultimately obtaining thirteen c block licenses and six f block licenses.each license stated on its face that it was conditioned upon the full and timely payment of all monies due under the commission installment plan and that f ailure to comply with this condition will result in automatic cancellation of this authorization.under the commission installment plan c block licensees were required to pay of their net bid price over ten years,with interest only paid for the first six years and interest and principal paid for the remaining four,b,and f block licensees were required to pay of their net bid price over ten years,with interest only paid for the first two years and interest and principal paid for the remaining eight.b.
after receiving numerous requests for relief from financially troubled licensees,the commission,on march,suspended installment payment obligations for c block licensees,and on april,extended the suspension to f block licensees.in re amendment of the comm s rules regarding installment payment financing for pcs licensees,second report and order and further notice of proposed rule making,wl restructuring order.the suspensions ended on september,when the commission adopted three new payment methods designed to assist c block licensees experiencing financial difficulties.id.at.the commission gave licensees until june,to choose one of the three restructuring schemes,and until july,to resume installment payments.public notice,wireless telecommunications bureau announces june,election date for broadband pcs c block licensees,wl.among the restructuring options,century chose disaggregation,which required it to return half of its mhz of spectrum to the commission in return for forgiveness of the outstanding debt associated with the returned mhz,restructuring order,and the commission sent century a note modification dated july,setting the dates for future installment payments as october,january,april,and july of each year.
several months before licensees were to resume payment,the commission adopted rules regarding untimely payments.f.under the new regulations,licensees have an automatic period after the installment payment due date,during which time payment can be made with a five percent late fee.id.at f i.if the licensee fails to remit the missed installment during this first grace period,the rule provides for a second automatic period in which the licensee can remit payment with an additional late fee of ten percent.id.at f ii.failure to submit an installment by the last day of the second period results in automatic cancellation of the license without further action by the commission.id.at f iii.
century made timely installment payments through april.on july,century received a payment notice from the commission reminding it of the july,payment deadline.century missed this deadline,and in accordance with f i,received a extension.on october,century received a notice from the commission reminding it to make its october payment and its july payment with the requisite late fee.century again failed to make its july payment,and in accordance with f ii,received a second extension,making the final deadline for payment january.when century did not submit its july,payment by january,its licenses were automatically cancelled.
thereafter,beginning on february,century sought an extension of the payment deadline or a waiver of the automatic cancellation rule.in the first of three letters,james labelle,century chief executive officer,explained that century was unable to ensure that wire transfers would be received by the commission by january,but that as of february,such funds were available to be sent upon assurance from the commission that the licenses had not been canceled the letter also stated that some of the payment notices from the commission had not been received or had been received late.see letter from james labelle to magalie roman salas.the second letter did not mention the payment notices,but reiterated that century had the funds to cover the payment if the commission could assure it that its licenses had not been canceled.see letter from james labelle to magalie roman salas.the third letter stated both that the commission had not met its responsibility of sending payment notices to century,and that century had sufficient funds to make payment.see letter from james labelle to magalie roman salas july.on august,the commission auction and industry analysis division division denied century request for an extension of the january,late payment deadline and its request for waiver of the commission automatic cancellation rule,stating that century was aware of the deadline for submission of the installment payment and had ample time to secure financing.division order,referred to by century as division letter ruling.the division referenced notice of the applicable deadlines from the commission rules,the face of the licenses,and the installment payment plan notes century executed.id.
pursuant to f,providing thirty days from the denial of its requests to submit a petition for reconsideration and any supplement,century timely filed,on september,a petition for reconsideration of the division order,arguing that century had not received clear notice from the commission with respect to its payments and that the division did not give the waiver request a hard look.after the period had expired,century filed,on november,a motion for leave to file a supplement to its petition for reconsideration and a supplement to the petition,which argued that the commission automatic cancellation rule violates due process and that century had a statutory right to a precancellation hearing.the commission denied century petition for reconsideration on december,finding that century had ample notice of the payment deadline and that a waiver would not be in the public interest the commission declined to address century hearing arguments because they had not been timely filed.reconsideration order.the commission also denied century second petition for reconsideration on the grounds that century requests for an extension of time or waiver were filed after the payment deadline,that century had failed to raise any new facts as required for reconsideration,and that the commission was not required under f to accept the untimely filed due process claim because century provided no explanation for its absence from the initial petition.second reconsideration order.
before turning to the merits of century challenges to the commission orders,the court must address two threshold issues.the commission contends,first,that century has neither article iii standing to contest the cancellation of its c block licenses nor prudential standing to raise its due process and hearing contentions before the court.second,even if century has standing,the commission contends that century due process and hearing contentions are time barred and thus unreviewable.unlike our dissenting colleague,neither we nor the parties find an exception in steel citizens for a better environment,d,to the requirement that the court must initially determine whether a party has standing to bring each of its contentions before the court.in steel the supreme court rejected the doctrine of hypothetical jurisdiction,id.at.at,and in distinguishing cases of extraordinary procedural postures,id.at.at,the court does not suggest that the exception identified by the dissent applies where party a is challenging agency actions on several grounds,as distinct from circumstances where resolution of the appeal of party b in separate litigation has the effect of resolving a merits question raised by party a with the consequence that the jurisdictional question could have no effect on the outcome.id.at.at.
the irreducible constitutional minimum for article iii standing is that the appellant was injured in fact,that its injury was caused by the challenged conduct,and that the injury would likely be redressed by a favorable decision of the court.lujan defenders of wildlife,d microwave acquisition fcc.the commission contends that century lacks article iii standing with regard to its c block licenses because it no longer seeks reinstatement of those licenses and,therefore,has no redressable injury.century responds that it has article iii standing both because it had standing on the day it filed its notice of appeal,and because it remains subject to fcc debt collection procedures,as well as higher bidding requirements in future auctions,which could be redressed by a decision in its favor.we conclude that the court does not have jurisdiction to review century challenge to the cancellation of its c block licenses.
article iii,section of the constitution limits federal courts to deciding actual,ongoing controversies.honig doe,d.although standing is determined at the time an action commences,friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d advanced mgmt,faa,airwaves,fcc,citing smith sperling,d,the court is not relieved from evaluating mootness through all stages of the litigation in order to ensure there remains a live controversy.lewis cont l bank,d see also laidlaw,at.at.thus,e ven where litigation poses a live controversy when filed,the doctrine of mootness requires a federal court to refrain from deciding it if events have so transpired that the decision will neither presently affect the parties rights nor have a chance of affecting them in the future.clarke united states,citation omitted see also am.family life assurance fcc.
when century filed its appeal to the court,it had suffered a financial from the loss of its c block licenses that injury resulted from the commission automatic cancellation of its licenses and it was seeking reinstatement of its c block licenses.century subsequent decision not to seek reinstatement of its c block licenses,however,rendered moot its claim of financial injury resulting from the loss of those licenses by eliminating any possibility that a decision of the court could redress that injury.further,contrary to century position,its standing can not be based on the fact that it remains subject to the commission debt collection procedures and higher bidding requirements in future auctions.first,regarding debt collection,because century defaulted in making timely payments for its licenses,it is required,under g,to pay the difference between the amount of its outstanding debt and the reauction price of its licenses,as well as a penalty of three percent of the reauction price.see also mountain solutions,fcc.however,century would remain subject to such debt collection even if it prevailed on appeal.by choosing not to seek reinstatement of its c block licenses,century is effectively giving up the licenses,which subjects it to the same penalties under g for defaulting.second,regarding future bidding,the matter is unripe.while the commission rules require previous defaulters to pay times more on future winning auction bids than,see in re amendment of part of the com ns rules,wl,century has provided no evidence that it intends to participate in future auctions.the supreme court has instructed that a claim is not ripe for adjudication if it rests upon contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated,or indeed may not occur at all.texas united states,d internal quotation marks omitted.without any indication from century that its participation in a commission auction is certainly impending,wyoming outdoor council united states forest,citation omitted,its challenge to the cancellation of its c block licenses by reason of future bidding requirements is unripe for review.
accordingly,because congress decision to grant a particular plaintiff the right to challenge an act constitutionality eliminates any prudential standing limitations raines byrd,d,we dismiss the appeal with regard to the challenges to the c block licenses cancellation.
the second threshold question is whether the court can properly consider century contentions that the commission automatic cancellation rule violates due process and that it was entitled to a hearing under c of the act.century points to fcc nextwave pers.communications.ed d,as supporting its claim that the automatic cancellation of its licenses was effectively a revocation requiring a hearing under,but we do not reach the merits of the century argument because its hearing contentions are.section a of the act provides that a petition for reconsideration must be filed within thirty days from the date upon which public notice is given of the order.a.section f of the commission rules further states that n o supplement or addition to a petition for reconsideration,filed after expiration of the day period,will be considered except upon leave granted upon a separate pleading for leave to file,which shall state the grounds therefor.f.although does not prohibit the commission consideration of late filed petitions,and the language of its rule affords discretion to the commission to review claims,second reconsideration order,we find no abuse of discretion by the commission in declining to address century hearing and due process arguments.consequently,these contentions are not properly before the court.
century filed its hearing arguments on november,more than thirty days after the division order of august.it never stated any grounds for its failure to meet the filing deadline.thus,century failed both to meet the filing deadline and to provide an explanation of why the arguments in its supplement to the petition were not part of its initial petition for reconsideration.the commission explained that century failure to raise its hearing arguments in eit
