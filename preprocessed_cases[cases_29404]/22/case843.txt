defendant andreas papaliolios papaliolios appeals from an order denying his special motion to strike a libel claim under code of civil procedure section the statute.the claim arises from a negative review of an apartment building papaliolios posted to yelp,an internet web site.papaliolios asserts his review is mere opinion or,alternatively,substantially true and,therefore.while many internet critiques are nothing more than ranting opinions that can not be taken seriously,internet commentary does not ipso facto get a free pass under defamation law.papaliolios review,in part,is susceptible to being read as containing factual assertions,not just mere opinion,and plaintiffs submitted sufficient evidence to meet their minimal burden under the statute to show a probability of prevailing on at least some aspect of their libel claim.we therefore affirm the order denying papaliolios special motion to strike.
factual and procedural background 
bently nob hill,has owned the apartment building at jones street the jones building since march.christopher bently bently is an owner and managing partner of the limited partnership.amber marie bently is christopher wife.bently and his wife later took up residence in the jones building penthouse,unit.
papaliolios moved into the jones building in.after three years of contentious and litigious relations with his new,papaliolios left in early.
four years later,between late february and early march,papaliolios,employing the user name sal,posted a review of the jones building on yelp,a web site that collects consumer reviews of businesses.the review,which appeared on a yelp page devoted to the jones building,read 
sadly,the building is newly owned and occupied by a sociopathic narcissist who celebrates making the lives of tenants hell.of the tenants who lived in the building when the new owners moved in,the new owners noise,intrusions,and other abhorrent behaviors likely contributed to the death of three tenants pat,mary,john,and the departure of eight more units,in very short order.notice how they all the units,so they could charge higher rents 
they have sought evictions of of those tenants,even though rent was,and those tenants bothered nobody.and what they did to evict the occupants of unit,who put many of tens of thousands of dollars into their unit,was horrific and shameful.
this is my own experience with this building,and its owners.i know this situation well,as i had the misfortune of being in a relationship with one of the building residents at the time,have spent many days and nights over many years in the building,and have personally witnessed the abhorrent behavior of the owners of the building.
there is no rent that is low enough to make residency here worthwhile.
papaliolios posted substantially the same review several times each time,bently complained to yelp and asked yelp to remove the review.each time,yelp complied.one version of the review,however,remained on yelp forum related to complaints about how yelp handles removal of reviews from its web site.
on march,based on the posting quoted above,bently,his wife,and bently nob hill collectively,plaintiffs sued papaliolios for libel 
two months later,on may,papaliolios responded with a special motion to strike under section.papaliolios claimed the libel cause of action was aimed at suppressing his right to speak in an open forum about an issue of public interest,and further claimed plaintiffs would be unable to show a probability of prevailing on their libel claim because the statements in the review were mere opinions and thus not provably false.
plaintiffs opposed the motion,asserting numerous statements in the review were indeed provably false and offering evidence of that.for instance,plaintiffs juxtaposed these statements with evidence they submitted 
in conjunction with his reply memorandum,papaliolios submitted evidence he claimed undermined plaintiffs showing as to how the jones building tenants departed.he contended,based on a copy of a notice to terminate tenancy served in april,that the four former tenants of unit were,in fact,evicted to make room for bently and his wife.he provided a copy of a notice,ultimately filed with the san francisco rent stabilization and arbitration board,from bently nob hill attorney to the two tenants of unit,demanding they remove a rug and chair from the foyer outside their apartment or vacate within three days.he pointed to hearsay statements of another tenant suggesting the tenants in were forced out after bently repeatedly hailed them before the san francisco rent control board,assertedly to reap the benefits of in renovations the tenants had made.he pointed to an admission by bently nob hill,in answering the complaint in another of the parties lawsuits,that in august five months after acquiring the jones building,unit became available for rent,an admission confirmed by the declaration of the current tenant of who took possession in september.finally,as to unit,papaliolios attached a printout from the san francisco rent board showing a landlord petition filed on march,against that unit tenants for unknown reasons,and with an unknown result.
the trial court heard and denied the motion on july.the court concluded that,while the libel claim fell within the ambit of the statute,plaintiffs had provid ed evidence showing the requisite minimal merit of their claim and thus had carried their burden under the statute.
discussion 
resolving the merits of an motion under section is ordinarily a analysis,concentrating initially on whether the challenged cause of action arises from protected activity within the meaning of the statute and,if it does,proceeding secondly to whether the plaintiff can establish a probability of prevailing on the merits,gradient analytics,th,d.in this case,we bypass the initial inquiry because everyone agrees that the first hurdle in obtaining relief has been met,ibid.and,indeed,the libel claim undoubtedly arises from protected activity.we therefore focus solely on the second prong whether plaintiffs carried their burden of showing a probability of prevailing on the merits of their libel claim.ibid.
in this regard,our review is de novo.flatley mauro cal th,d,tutor saliba herrera th,d.we apply a test taus loftus cal th,d,accepting as true the evidence favorable to the plaintiff and evaluating the defendant evidence only to determine whether it defeats the plaintiff evidence as a matter of law wilcox superior court th,d,disapproved on other grounds inequilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,fn.the evidence put forward at this stage must be admissible even allegations in a verified complaint are insufficient.wallace mccubbin th,d.
in addition to considering the substantive merits of the plaintiff claims,the court must also consider all available defenses to the claims no doubt activision publishing,th.when a cause of action states multiple grounds for relief,the plaintiff may satisfy its obligation in the second prong by simply showing a probability of prevailing on any one of those grounds.wallace mccubbin,supra,th at.
defamation consists of,among other things,a false and unprivileged publication,which has a tendency to injure a party in its occupation.citations.citation.the sine qua non of recovery for defamation is the existence of falsehood.citation.summit bank rogers th,d summit bank.papaliolios contends his yelp review of the jones building is,given its context,mere opinion and thus not actionable,or in the alternative,is substantially true.
provably false assertion of fact 
to be libelous,a statement must contain a provable falsehood and,to this end,courts distinguish between statements of fact and statements of opinion for purposes of defamation liability.summit bank,supra,th at.
not all statements that appear to be opinions,however,are immunized.summit bank,supra,th at.in milkovich lorain journal,d.milkovich,the united states supreme court moved away from the notion that defamatory statements categorized as opinion as opposed to fact enjoy wholesale protection under the first amendment.significantly,the court recognized that expressions of opinion may often imply an assertion of objective fact.milkovich,at.the court went on to explain if a speaker says,in my opinion john jones is a liar,he implies a knowledge of facts which lead to the conclusion that jones told an untruth.even if the speaker states the facts upon which he bases his opinion,if those facts are either incorrect or incomplete,or if his assessment of them is erroneous,the statement may still imply a false assertion of fact.simply couching such statements in terms of opinion does not dispel these implications id.at,supra,th at weller american broadcasting,d.weller we reject the notion that merely couching an assertion of a defamatory fact in cautionary language such as apparently or some sources say or even putting it in the form of a question,necessarily defuses the impression that the speaker is communicating an actual fact.
thus a false statement of fact,whether expressly stated or implied from an expression of opinion,is actionable.milkovich,supra,at.the key is not parsing whether a published statement is fact or opinion,but whether a reasonable fact finder could conclude the published statement declares or implies a provably false assertion of fact.franklin dynamic details,th,d,citing milkovich,supra,at,among other authority,supra,th at.for example,an opinion based on implied,undisclosed facts is actionable if the speaker has no factual basis for the opinion but a n opinion is not actionable if it discloses all the statements of fact on which the opinion is based and those statements are true.ruiz harbor view community th,d ruiz.
to decide whether a statement expresses or implies a provably false assertion of fact,courts use a totality of the circumstances test.summit bank,supra,th at.a court must put itself in the place of an average reader and determine the natural and probable effect of the statement computerxpress,jackson th,d.thus,a court considers both the language of the statement and the context in which it is made.summit bank,supra,th at.the contextual analysis requires that courts examine the nature and full content of the particular communication,as well as the knowledge and understanding of the audience targeted by the publication,supra,th at.
the crucial question of whether challenged statements convey the requisite factual imputation is ordinarily a question of law for the court.summit bank,supra,th at.but if a statement is ambiguous and can not be characterized as factual or nonfactual as a matter of law,a jury must determine whether the statement contains an actionable assertion of fact.kahn bower d.see also summit bank,supra,th at carver bonds th,d,quoting weller,supra,d at,fn.ruiz,supra,th at accord,manufactured home communities,county of san diego cir.
the allocation of functions between court and jury with respect to factual content is analogous to the allocation with respect to defamatory meaning in general.on the latter issue,the court must first determine as a question of law whether the statement is reasonably susceptible of a defamatory interpretation if the statement satisfies this requirement,it is for the jury to determine whether a defamatory meaning was in fact conveyed to the listener or reader.citations.similarly,it is a question of law for the court whether a challenged statement is reasonably susceptible of an interpretation which implies a provably false assertion of actual fact.if that question is answered in the affirmative,the jury may be called upon to determine whether such an interpretation was in fact conveyed.kahn bower,supra,d at.
looking at the totality of the circumstances in this case,we conclude papaliolios review was reasonably susceptible of an interpretation which implies a provably false assertion of fact.kahn bower,supra,d at.
first,we look at papaliolios language.although he used some hyperbole and sociopathic narcissist,celebrates making the lives of tenants hell,other abhorrent behaviors the review also included purported facts about the jones building.he asserted plaintiffs sought to evict six tenants,and further stated details about the alleged eviction of tenants from unit after they put tens of thousands of dollars into their unit.he further asserted plaintiffs activities likely contributed to the deaths of three particular tenants,pat,mary,and john,and to the departure of tenants in eight particular units,in very short order.hedging his statements with the word likely does not insulate them from examination.see milkovich,supra,at in my opinion john jones is a liar implies a knowledge of facts which lead to the conclusion that jones told an untruth.weller,supra,d at we reject the notion that merely couching an assertion of a defamatory fact in cautionary language such as apparently or some sources say,necessarily defuses the impression that the speaker is communicating an actual fact.in fact,papaliolios went out of his way to win credibility with his audience as to these factual assertions,stating 
this is my own experience with this building,and its owners.i know this situation well,as i had the misfortune of being in a relationship with one of the building residents at the time,have spent many days and nights over many years in the building,and have personally witnessed the abhorrent behavior of the owners of the building.
such assurances suggest facts are being communicated,not opinions.see david elder,defamation a lawyer guide fact versus opinion,representation that speaker has private,firsthand knowledge relevant to the distinction see also super future equities,wells fargo bank minnesota,d,where defendant claims to verify the accuracy of the information he posts his online statements are not protected opinions.
we next turn to the broader context of his statements posting on an internet site under an assumed user name.papaliolios contends internet fora are notorious as places where readers expect to see strongly worded opinions rather than objective facts,and that anonymous,or pseudonymous,opinions should be discount ed accordingly.summit bank,supra,th at pp.however,the mere fact speech is broadcast across the internet by an anonymous speaker does not ipso facto make it nonactionable opinion and immune from defamation law.
to be sure,anonymous internet fora promote a looser,more relaxed communication style in which users may substitute gossip for accurate reporting and often adopt a provocative,even combative tone.krinsky doe th,d krinsky online discussions may look more like a vehicle for emotional catharsis than a forum for the rapid exchange of information and ideas id.at online pseudonyms tends to heighten this sense that anything goes,and some commentators have likened cyberspace to a frontier society free from the conventions and constraints that limit discourse in the real world summit bank,supra,th at chaker mateo th,d chaker.
thus in krinsky,the defendant,using a concealing screen name on an internet discussion forum,felt free to claim a corporate president was part of a management team of boobs,losers,and crooks and has fat thighs,a fake medical degree,queefs and has poor feminine hygiene.krinsky,supra,th at.the plaintiff served a subpoena on the forum host seeking the defendant identity and defendant,appearing as doe,moved to quash.id.at.the appellate court,viewing the defendant posts in the context of what was a particularly h eated discussion forum in which numerous other posts questioned defendant credibility,and noting the defendant crude,ungrammatical language,satirical tone,and vituperative,juvenile,concluded the defendant railing was nonactionable opinion and ordered the subpoena quashed krinsky,supra,th at.
similarly,in summit bank,the defendant posted under a pseudonym,in a section of the craigslist web site entitled rants and raves,diatribes or rants about a bank that lacked proper spelling or grammar.the court of appeal concluded readers would be predisposed to view the comments with a certain amount of skepticism,and with an understanding that they will likely present viewpoints rather than assertions of provable facts.summit bank,supra,th at,fn.thus,statements that the bank ceo thinks that the bank is her personel sic bank to do with it as she pleases,that the bank was a problem bank,and that the bank left clients high and dry,were nonactionable,and the appellate court reversed the denial of an motion.id.at.
in chaker,the court confronted a series of derogatory statements on the ripoff report internet web site where members of the public may comment on the reliability and honesty of various providers of goods and services and on topix,a social networking site.chaker,supra,th at.the defendant wrote of plaintiff this guy is a criminal and a deadbeat dad.as you can see,i am the child grandma so i know.if you should eve sic come across this person,be very careful.he may be taking steroids so who knows what could happen.i would be very careful dealing with this guy.he uses people,is into illegal activities,etc id.at.the court of appeal concluded alleged embellishments,to the effect the plaintiff picks up streetwalkers and homeless drug addicts and is a deadbeat dad,were too generalized,nonspecific,and vitriolic to be actionable.id.at.the only statement which might arguably fall outside the scope of nonactionable opinion or epithet was the statement mateo is a criminal.however,that statement was true.id.at.accordingly,the court of appeal affirmed the grant of an motion.ibid.
krinsky,summit bank,and chaker illustrate the significant role context plays in distinguishing fact from opinion,but by no means do they categorically immunize anonymous internet speech or even give anonymity special weight.while krinsky recognizes the right to speak anonymously in a lawful manner,it warns,on the internet,the informal ability to sound off often in harsh and unbridled invective,opens the door to libel and other tortious conduct,and w hen vigorous criticism descends into defamation,constitutional protection is no longer available.krinsky,supra,th at further warning criticism on the internet is often so recklessly communicated that the harm to its targets,particularly in the financial arena,may extend far beyond what is covered by rules applicable to oral rhetoric and pamphleteering.while the defendant anonymity in krinsky may have freed him to engage in crude,satirical hypberole,it was the overall nature and context of his comments,not his anonymity,that led the court to conclude the comments nonactionable.id.at.
likewise,in summit bank and chaker,the courts examined a variety of contextual factors.the anonymity of the defendant in summit bank appeared relevant to that court,but so was the name of the forum the defendant used rants and raves as well as the posts diatribe nature,lack of formality,poor grammar and spelling.summit bank,supra,th at pp.in chaker,the court,citing krinsky and summit bank,noted a number of recent cases have relied heavily on the fact that statements were made in internet forums chaker,supra,th at,but went on to analyze other aspects of the defendant speech,such as its angry and generalized character and lack any specificity.id.at.
thus,while krinsky,summit bank,and chaker allow courts to dispense quickly with defamation claims arising from true rants and raves,they do not preclude the courts from taking serious internet speech seriously.internet posts where the tone and content is serious,where the poster represents himself as unbiased and having specialized knowledge,or where the poster claims his posts are research reports or bulletins or alerts,may indeed be reasonably perceived as containing actionable assertions of fact,supra,th at pp.and while generalized comments on the internet that lack any specificity as to the time and place of alleged conduct may be a further signal to the reader there is no factual basis for the accusations,specifics,if given,may signal the opposite and render an internet posting actionable.see chaker,supra,th at making this distinction but finding the comments at issue too generalized to support a defamation claim computerxpress,jackson,supra,th at though generally dismissing internet postings as nonactionable,suggesting that in a few instances in which the postings did contain apparent statements of facts such as the statement that a company owned by the former president had filed for bankruptcy they could have been actionable had there been evidence of falsehood.
this brings us to wong jing th d wong,which dealt with more serious internet speech and rounds out the discussion on the topic.in wong,the court of appeal affirmed the denial of an motion in a defamation action based on a review on yelp,the same forum papaliolios used.the review,of a dentist,read 
star rating let me first say i wish there is sic star in yelp rating.avoid her like a disease my son went there for two years.she treated two cavities plus the usual cleaning.she was fast,i mean really fast.i wo necessarily say that is a bad thing,but my son was light headed for several hours after the filling.so we decided to try another dentist after half a year.i wish i had gone there earlier.first the new dentist discovered seven cavities.all right all of those appeared during the last half a year.second,he would never use the laughing gas on kids,which was the cause for my son dizziness.to apply laughing gas is the easiest to the dentist.there is no waiting,no needles.but it is general anesthetic,not local.and general anesthetic harms a kid nerve system.heck,it harms mine too.third,the filling yvonne wong used is metallic silver color.the new dentist would only use the newer,white color filling.why does the color matter here is the part that made me really,really angry.the color tells the material being used.the metallic filing,called silver amalgams sic,has a small trace of mercury in it.the newer composite filling,while costing the dentist more,does not.in addition,it uses a newer technology to embed fluoride to clean the teeth for you.i regret ever going to her office.just want to add one more thing.dr chui,who shares the same office with yvonne wong is actually decent.wong,supra,th at.
the dentist claimed the review was libelous per se because it falsely implied the following facts wong had failed to tell jing and ma that their son filling contained mercury wong the case and wong used a general anesthetic,something beyond her allowed scope of practice.wong,supra,th at.the appellate court agreed wong had carried her burden under the second prong of the analysis because a jury reasonably could find that the review falsely implied that wong had failed to warn and advise about silver amalgam and arguably better alternatives to its use id.at a reasonable person could probably understand these statements to be criticism of wong for working hastily,failing to find all of the cavities that the boy had,and thereby substantially misdiagnosing or underdiagnosing the condition of the boy teeth id.at and a jury reasonably could find that the implied assertion that to make her job easier and quicker,wong put defendant son under general anesthesia to fill his cavities,exposed the boy nervous system to potential harm and harmed him was false and defamatory id.at.
papaliolios yelp review is every bit as factually specific and earnest as the yelp review in wong.while papaliolios review does contain epithets not meant to be taken as serious assertions of fact,it also contains statements that could reasonably be understood as conveying facts each provable,and each meant to be used by prospective tenants to evaluate the jones building as a future residential choice.
papaliolios asserts wong is distinguishable because it did not involve anonymous speech.the review at issue in wong did not state the name of the person who wrote the review,but it did reveal the person initials wong,supra,th at.papaliolios wrote as sal.we see no meaningful distinction between the identifying information in wong and in this case in both cases,the consuming public had no way of identifying the poster from the reviews.moreover,as we have discussed,anonymity is only one of many contextual factors to be considered.see krinsky,supra,th,targets of anonymous online aspersions may seek redress by filing suit against their unknown detractors.here,given other contextual considerations,papaliolios use of a pseudonym does not render his yelp revie
