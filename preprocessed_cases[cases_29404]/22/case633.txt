background 
on september,james vanlandingham reported to local police that,while in a chat room and while using the screen name,he began chatting with a person with the screen name stevedragonslayer.stevedragonslayer invited vanlandingham to watch a web cam video depicting two nude girls.while waiting for the police to arrive,vanlandingham stayed on the line with stevedragonslayer and continued to chat.vanlandingham asked if stevedragonslayer had any more videos,to which stevedragonslayer replied he did not know what might offend.after vanlandingham informed stevedragonslayer that he liked the young hard stuff,stevedragonslayer played several videos depicting young girls in various explicit sexual acts.
stevedragonslayer stopped sending video clips to prior to the arrival of police officers at vanlandingham house,but vanlandingham was able to preserve a copy of the chat room conversation.one of the pennsylvania law enforcement authorities interviewed vanlandingham and viewed the saved chat room conversation.
based upon vanlandingham account of these events,pennsylvania law enforcement personnel obtained a disclosure order dated october,pursuant to d and.d directing to provide the subscriber information for the screen name stevedragonslayer.records indicated that stevedragonslayer logged on to the website from the ip address on october,october,october,october,november,and november,
further investigation revealed that this ip address was maintained by cox communications.pennsylvania authorities obtained another disclosure order requiring cox to provide the subscriber information for that ip address.cox reported that the logins from this particular ip address at the times reported by were associated with an account belonging to steve perrine,rolling hills court,wichita,kansas.
pennsylvania authorities then contacted kansas authorities,who discovered that steve perrine had a prior state conviction for sexual exploitation of a child,for which he was still on probation.wichita police obtained a search warrant for perrine house,which was executed on december.in addition to seizing perrine computer,the police also found firearms and drug paraphernalia.they accordingly amended the search warrant to authorize seizure of those items as well.a forensic examination of perrine computer revealed thousands of images of child pornography.
on february,perrine was charged in a superceding indictment with one count of distributing child pornography,in violation of a one count of receiving child pornography,in violation of a one count of possessing child pornography,in violation of a b one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm,in violation of g and a and two counts of forfeiture.among other motions,perrine filed a motion to suppress and a motion to dismiss based upon outrageous government conduct.
the district court held a motions hearing,at which perrine testified that he was stevedragonslayer.perrine further testified that he had enabled file sharing on his computer,thereby giving anyone with internet access and certain software the ability to gain entrance to certain files on his computer.after subsequent briefing,the district court denied perrine motions.
the case proceeded to a jury trial.a wichita police department computer forensics detective,detective stone,testified that he found in excess of images of child pornography on perrine computer.detective stone also found kazaa,a file sharing program,installed on perrine computer.stone further testified that kazaa is a program which allows individual users like perrine to identify folders that are available to share with others,search other computers with kazaa for specific topics,and download files from other computers,while allowing other computers to download files from perrine computer 
additionally,annie cheung,the senior compliance paralegal at,testified that tracks dates,times,and ip addresses for attempts on a account and maintains that information for approximately thirty days.she further testified that records showed that the ip addresses and belonged to stevedragonslayer.
perla rodriguez,the cox communications customer escalations coordinator,testified that residential account ip addresses can change because they are leased for hours at a time.cox communications residential account ip addresses release and renew every hours when an ip address releases,if the same ip address is available,it reattaches within a few seconds.rodriguez further testified that only one ip address is assigned to a user at a time and that it is the customer address on the internet when he or she is online.she stated that the ip address was used by perrine.perrine was convicted on all counts.
perrine thereafter filed a motion for a new trial,a motion for a judgment of acquittal,and a motion for arrest of judgment.after denying the motions,the district court sentenced perrine to months imprisonment,to be followed by supervised release for life.perrine appeals,arguing the district court erred in failing to suppress evidence obtained against him in violation of the fourth amendment d and.d and the district court erred in failing to dismiss the case against perrine due to outrageous government conduct.
discussion 
perrine appeals the denial of his motion to suppress.when reviewing a district court denial of a motion to suppress,we review the district court factual findings for clear error and consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.united states,cir.further,d eterminations relating to the sufficiency of a search warrant and the applicability of the exception are conclusions of law,which this court reviews de novo.united states danhauer,cir.finally,while we review the district court ruling on the sufficiency of a search warrant de novo,we do not review de novo the determination of probable cause by the issuing judge or magistrate.rather,a state judge decision to issue a warrant is entitled to great deference,and we need only ask whether,under the totality of the circumstances presented in the affidavit,the state judge had a substantial basis for determining that probable cause existed.united states artez,cir further quotations and citations omitted.
we first consider perrine argument that evidence was seized in violation of the ecpa and its state law equivalent,as well as the fourth amendment.
law and fourth amendment 
perrine argues that compliance with d and.d is akin to a terry stop within the scope of the fourth amendment and suppression is available to remedy violations.appellant br.at.section is the core provision of the ecpa,and it authorizes the government to require disclosure of stored communications and transaction records by service providers.under c,a provider of electronic communication service or remote computing service shall disclose to a governmental entity the name address telephone or instrument number or other subscriber number or identity,including any temporarily assigned network address of a subscriber to or customer of such service c.section d specifies that a court order for disclosure under subsection c shall issue only if the governmental entity offers specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the records or other information sought are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.d 
perrine argues that suppression,an appropriate remedy for an impermissible terry stop is an available remedy for a violation of the ecpa.however,section of the ecpa specifically states that t he remedies and sanctions described in this chapter are the only judicial remedies and sanctions for nonconstitutional violations of this chapter.section,in turn,describes remedies for violations of the act as including civil actions for violators other than the united states and administrative discipline against federal employees in certain circumstances.thus,violations of the ecpa do not warrant exclusion of evidence.see united states steiger,cir united states smith,cir bansal russ,d,united states sherr,d,united states kennedy,d,
perrine next argues that,in any event,the government violated the ecpa and the pennsylvania law by failing to present specific and articulable facts in support of its applications for court orders requiring and cox to reveal perrine ip address and name,and that the government therefore used illegally obtained information in support of its search warrants.we disagree.as perrine notes,the specific and articulable facts standard derives from the supreme court decision in terry.thus,we are familiar with the standard imposed.
perrine argues the government affidavit in support of its application for an order failed to provide specific and articulable facts because it did not attach a copy of the chat between stevedragonslayer and vanlandingham it did not contain anything specifically indicating that vanlandingham was a truthful and reliable person and it failed to show that stevedragonslayer was logged on to on the date of the crime,september,at.the affidavit attached to the october,application for a disclosure order for stated as follows 
officer humbert received information from leetsdale police officer wayne drish indicating that a resident of his jurisdiction had received what appeared to be child pornography via his computer while in a inc messaging chat room.
officer humbert interviewed the resident,james vanlandingham,and learned that he was logged into yahoo messaging chat on september,at approximately pm edt.he received a message from an individual logged in yahoo messaging chat as stevedragonslayer.this individual invited james vanlandingham to view his web cam.when james vanlandingham viewed the cam he was presented with images of a young female he describes as between and years of age performing oral sex on an adult male,images of a young female he describes as between and years of age having oral sex performed on her by an adult female and images of two young females he describes as between and years of age walking around in a bathroom unclothed.james vanlandingham immediately reported the incident to law enforcement.i did view that chat log of this session between james vanlandingham and stevedragonslayer.
appellant app.at,attach.d.the affidavit attached to the december,application for a disclosure order for cox recited the same information as above,and added at the bottom 
on i received a response from which provided the ip login address of for the screenname stevedragonslayer on,and.
appellant app.at attach.
the statutory standard requires that the governmental entity offers specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the records or other information sought,are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.d.the affidavits above satisfy that standard.there is no reason to doubt vanlandingham account of what happened indeed,he immediately contacted the police,which suggests he was simply a concerned citizen.further,the officer stated that he had personally read the chat log between vanlandingham and stevedragonslayer.the details provided are specific and certainly would lead to a reasonable suspicion that stevedragonslayer was involved in child pornography.
perrine also alleges that the application for the order was deficient because it failed to show that stevedragonslayer was on line with vanlandingham on september,at pm.the district court dismissed this as of no moment because logs simply did not go back that far.as indicated above,employee annie cheung testified that tracks dates,times,and ip addresses for login attempts on a account and maintains that information for approximately thirty days.both cheung testimony and the actual document turned over by to law enforcement pursuant to the court order revealed that stevedragonslayer had ip addresses of both and.appellant app.at.records also revealed that stevedragonslayer with ip address had logged on to a number of times in october and november.
we agree with the district court that the absence of a specific record of stevedragonslayer with ip address or being logged on at pm on september,does not undermine the adequacy of the affidavit.the reason for that absence is simply that fails to maintain records for more than thirty days.perrine admitted he was stevedragonslayer and gives no explanation for who else could have been logged on to on september,with the name stevedragonslayer,when every other login for stevedragonslayer matches the ip address of perrine computer in sum,we conclude that the affidavits submitted in the application for an order under the ecpa and the pennsylvania statute contained specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the information sought is relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.d.d.
perrine also appears to make a broader fourth amendment challenge to the government acquisition of his subscriber information from and cox.the district court held 
the identifying information at issue name,address,information that he voluntarily transmitted to the internet providers,cox and.indeed,defendant also admitted at the hearing that he had enabled file sharing on his computer,thereby giving anyone with internet access the ability to gain entrance to his computer.under such a scenario,a defendant holds no reasonable expectation of privacy that the fourth amendment will protect.
mem.and order at,appellant app.at.we agree with the district court.
every federal court to address this issue has held that subscriber information provided to an internet provider is not protected by the fourth amendment privacy expectation.see,guest leis,cir holding,in a context,that computer users do not have a legitimate expectation of privacy in their subscriber information because they have conveyed it to another system operator united states hambrick,cir unpublished,affirming united states hambrick,d,holding that there was no legitimate expectation of privacy in noncontent customer information provided to an internet service provider by one of its customers united states,d,the smith line of cases has led federal courts to uniformly conclude that internet users have no reasonable expectation of privacy in their subscriber information,the length of their stored files,and other noncontent data to which service providers must have access.freedman america online,d,in the cases in which the issue has been considered,courts have universally found that,for purposes of the fourth amendment,a subscriber does not maintain a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to his subscriber information.united states sherr,d,the courts that have already addressed this issue uniformly have found that individuals have no fourth amendment privacy interest in subscriber information given to an isp.united states cox,d,same united states kennedy,d,defendant constitutional rights were not violated when internet provider divulged his subscriber information to the government.defendant has not demonstrated an objectively reasonable legitimate expectation of privacy in his subscriber information.united states forrester,cir and internet users have no expectation of privacy in the addresses of their messages or the ip addresses of the websites they visit because they should know that this information is provided to and used by internet service providers for the specific purpose of directing the routing of information.united states lifshitz,cir individuals generally possess a reasonable expectation of privacy in their home computers they may not,however,enjoy such an expectation of privacy in transmissions over the internet or that have already arrived at the recipient.
furthermore,as perrine conceded,he had software on his computer,which permitted anyone else on the internet to access at least certain folders in his computer.to
