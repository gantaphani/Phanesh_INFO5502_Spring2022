peter kirchhof appeals the district court sentence of months following his guilty plea to one count of transporting child pornography over the internet in violation of a and one count of receiving child pornography over the internet in violation of a.kirchhof challenges his sentence on the ground that his sentence is substantively unreasonable.for the following reasons,we affirm the sentence of the district court.
on february,an undercover agent with the federal bureau of investigation in buffalo,new york,entered an internet chat line titled.as summarized by a probation officer and as admitted by the defendant himself 
advertised in the chat line was an file server offered by the mirc nickname everland using the trigger everland.the advertisement carried the following statement enjoy leech if your sic young and chat with me on webcam.leech is a common term used on mirc which means that if a user complies with the operator requirements,the user is granted unlimited downloading privileges.
after sending corrupted files to the and reciprocally downloading files from everland that contained pictures of a minor engaged in conduct,the fbi agent ascertained the location of the louisville,kentucky,residence associated with the computer internet protocol address.federal and state law enforcement officials executed a search warrant for that residence,the apartment of kirchhof and his wife.during the search,officers seized kirchhof computer,which contained child pornography images and child pornography videos.at that time,the defendant also admitted both to operating the to distribute the images and also to possession of the images that were found on his computer.
kirchhof pled guilty to one count of transporting child pornography over the internet in violation of a and one count of receiving child pornography over the internet in violation of a.at his sentencing hearing,kirchhof introduced evidence that he was a german national who was an at the university of louisville and who had then been married for approximately a to an american citizen.kirchhof had no prior criminal record and,while a student,was employed as a teller at fifth third bank.he lost that job,however,upon his arrest for the child pornography charges but was still earning money at the time of the hearing by serving as a teaching assistant at the university of louisville.
the defendant further introduced evidence that he suffered from a disorder ocd,a condition for which he was receiving treatment,and one that played a role in his computer compulsions.other testimony at the sentencing hearing confirmed that kirchhof was also then participating in a treatment program,that he did not meet the psychological profile of a pedophile or a sexual predator,that the risk of his committing another similar crime was very low,and that federal prison guidelines would delay kirchhof participation in any bureau of prisons treatment programs until the last months of his sentence.
at the conclusion of the evidentiary hearing,the district judge determined that the appropriate sentencing guideline range for the offenses was months in prison,which is not challenged on appeal.the district court sentenced the defendant to concurrent sentences,explaining 
this is a case which i believe is not about pornography this is more a case about child abuse it not about the public display of personal acts.it really about the public display of criminal acts.
as in all criminal acts,different steps certainly have different degrees of criminality,and that does make necessarily,though,the lesser are less significant,but they can be equally important,and in this case there a strong reason to believe that the existence of internet trading of child pornography does create in essence a virtual community of traders and users,and i do think it an exaggeration to say that the existence of this community on the internet validates and normalizes the behavior of an entire group that the rest of us if we looked at it would find completely abhorrent to the essential values of our society.that not just me talking,of course.that what congress also determined in enacting the statute that they did.
moreover,i think it is true that the continued availability of this material desensitizes everyone to the consequences of it in a very real way 
i not saying that something that the defendant here thought about or wanted to do,but the fact is that his conduct enabled all that to happen.the defendant has said that he was unaware that collecting and trading the material was illegal,or maybe he was even sure it was bad.that was meant to be a statement suggesting his guilt was not as bad as it might otherwise be,but on reflection i think it actually a statement that highlights the problem,and that is that people are unaware of how bad this is and how their involvement in what they believe not to be a criminal aspect of the activity enhances,enables and perpetuates the industry,if you will.
i think particularly important in this know,there are lots of ways to stop activity that we abhor.we can catch all the people that do it,but one of the big things is deterrence.when you are deterring,it is a sad fact that the interests of justice as we might perceive them to an individual clash with the interests society has for looking at justice in a larger way.i think that is probably true in this particular instance because one could say,well,the defendant will never do this again 
but i think we have to look at it at various different times and places,and we are at this time and this place,at a huge,huge problem,and unless we make it clear to all those out there that are doing it secretly on the internet and who are not caught and may think that because they are on the internet in their home that they are doing something that is innocent,that this is something we do condone,we do excuse,and in fact that we condemn,and the best way we know to deter that future activity is to say so out loud with a long sentence 
it may be true that the defendant is a productive member of society,and hopefully he will be a productive member of society in the future.my experience in these cases is that many of the people who do these things are outwardly productive members of society,and they fool themselves into thinking that they are and that what they are doing is somehow permitted or consented to or otherwise 
although the district court sentenced him to a term below the of the guidelines range,kirchhof now appeals to this court,arguing that the sentence is unreasonable and that the district judge attempted to send a message to the entire child pornography industry rather than tailoring the sentence to the individual defendant appearing before him.
both district courts imposing sentences and appellate courts reviewing sentences are to be guided by the factors set forth in a.united states jackson,cir,the discretion of a district court in handing down a sentence has been enhanced,and a sentence will be upheld on appeal if that sentence is reasonable.id.this reasonableness inquiry has both a procedural and a substantive component.see united states webb,cir.
the goal of the procedural reasonableness requirement is to ensure that a sentencing court explains its reasoning to a sufficient degree to allow for reasonable appellate review.united states dexta,cir.if the record demonstrates that the sentencing court addressed the relevant factors in reaching its conclusion,the court need not explicitly consider each of the a factors or engage in a rote listing or some other ritualistic incantation of the factors.id.at.at oral argument kirchhof conceded that he only challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence.indeed,a review of the record shows that the district court explicitly addressed nearly all of the a factors and provided a detailed explanation of its reasoning.for this reason,kirchhof sentence is procedurally reasonable.
a sentence is substantively unreasonable if the district court selects the sentence arbitrarily,bases the sentence on impermissible factors,fails to consider pertinent a factors or gives an unreasonable amount of weight to any pertinent factor.
