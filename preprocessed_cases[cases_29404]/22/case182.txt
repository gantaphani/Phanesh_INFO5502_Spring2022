the federal trade commission sued kristy ross in district court for the district of maryland for engaging in deceptive internet advertising practices.after a bench trial,the district court entered judgment enjoining ross from participating in the deceptive practices and holding her jointly and severally liable for equitable monetary consumer redress in the amount of.ross,d.on appeal,ross challenges the district court judgment on several bases the court authority to award consumer redress the legal standard the court applied in finding individual liability under the federal trade commission act the court prejudicial evidentiary rulings and finally,the soundness of the district court factual findings.for the reasons set forth within,we affirm.
the commission sued innovative marketing,imi,and several of its executives and founders,including ross,for running a deceptive internet scareware scheme in violation of the prohibition on deceptive advertising in section a of the federal trade commission act,a.the core of the commission case was that the defendants operated a massive,scheme that trick ed consumers into purchasing computer security software,referred to as scareware.the advertisements would advise consumers that a scan of their computers had been performed that had detected a variety of dangerous files,like viruses,spyware,and illegal pornography in reality,no scans were ever conducted.
ross,a vice president at imi,hired counsel and defended against the suit the remaining defendants either settled or had default judgment entered against them.
the district court entered summary judgment in favor of the commission on the issue of whether the advertising was deceptive,but it set for trial the issue of whether ross could be held individually liable under the federal trade commission act,whether ross was a control person at the company,and to what extent she had authority for,and knowledge of the deceptive acts committed by the company.
after a bench trial,the district court found in favor of the commission.specifically,it found that ross 
broad responsibilities at imi coupled with the fact that she personally financed corporate expenses,oversaw a large amount of employees and had a hand in the creation and dissemination of the deceptive ads prove d by a preponderance of the evidence that she had authority to control and directly participated in the deceptive acts within the meaning of section of the federal trade commission act.
ross,d at.the district court further concluded that ross had actual knowledge of the deceptive marketing scheme,or was at the very least recklessly indifferent or intentionally avoided the truth about the scheme.id.at.it entered judgment against ross in the amount of,and it enjoined her from engaging in similar deceptive marketing practices.id.at.ross timely appealed.
the federal trade commission act authorizes the commission to sue in federal district court so that in proper cases the commission may seek,and after proper proof,the court may issue,a permanent injunction.b.ross contends that the district court did not have the authority to award consumer redress a money judgment under this provision of the statute.
ross first takes the position,correctly,that the statute text does not expressly authorize the award of consumer redress,but precedent dictates otherwise the supreme court has long held that congress invocation of the federal district court equitable jurisdiction brings with it the full power to decide all relevant matters in dispute and to award complete relief even though the decree includes that which might be conferred by a court of law.porter warner holding.once invoked by congress in one of its duly enacted statutes,the district court inherent equitable powers can not be denied or limited in the absence of a clear and valid legislative command.id.porter and its progeny thus articulate an interpretive principle that inserts a presumption into what would otherwise be the standard exercise of statutory construction we presume that congress,in statutorily authorizing the exercise of the district court injunctive power,acted cognizant of the historic power of equity to provide complete relief in light of statutory purposes.mitchell robert demario jewelry.
applying this principle to the present case illuminates the legislative branch real intent.that is,by authorizing the district court to issue a permanent injunction in the federal trade commission act,b,congress presumably authorized the district court to exercise the full measure of its equitable jurisdiction.accordingly,absent some countervailing indication sufficient to rebut the presumption,the court had sufficient statutory power to award complete relief,including monetary consumer redress,which is a form of equitable relief.porter,at.
ross insists that the text of the federal trade commission act is unlike that of the statutes at issue in porter and mitchell,and therefore argues that the interpretive principle of those cases is inapplicable in her case.in porter,a case involving the emergency price control act of,the statute authorized district courts to grant a permanent or temporary injunction,restraining order,or other order.at internal quotations and citation omitted.ross contends that the other order language,absent from the instant provision of the federal trade commission act,cabins porter applicability.see also united states phillip morris usa.in other words,her argument is that porter was a magic words case if congress uses the magic words other order,then congress has invoked the full injunctive powers of the district court.
ross magic words argument fails because it ignores how the supreme court subsequently untethered its reasoning from the other order language of the emergency price control act and significantly expanded porter holding.the language of the statute at issue in mitchell,the fair labor standards act,was different from the language of the statute in porter,providing only that the district court had jurisdiction to restrain violations of section.mitchell,at internal quotation and citation omitted.notwithstanding the silence of the fair labor standards act as to the district court express power to award reimbursement of lost wages and the absence of the other order language,the court held that ordering reimbursement was nevertheless permissible under the holding of porter.at.in comparing the language of the fair labor standards act with the emergency price control act,the mitchell court reasoned that the other order provision was merely an affirmative confirmation icing on the cake over and above the district court inherent equitable powers.see id.at.
the point is that mitchell broadened porter applicability,rendering the textual statutory differences irrelevant to the ultimate conclusion because there is no affirmative and clear legislative restriction on the equitable powers of the district court,ordering monetary consumer redress is an appropriate equitable adjunct to the district court injunctive power.porter,at.
ross makes a series of arguments about how the structure,history,and purpose of the federal trade commission act weigh against the conclusion that district courts have the authority to award consumer redress her arguments are not entirely unpersuasive,but they have ultimately been rejected by every other federal appellate court that has considered this issue.bronson partners llc,cir amy travel service,cir security rare coin buillion,cir pantron i,cir gem merchandising,cir.we adopt the reasoning of those courts and reject ross attempt to obliterate a significant part of the commission remedial arsenal.a ruling in favor of ross would forsake almost thirty years of federal appellate decisions and create a circuit split,a result that we will not countenance in the face of powerful supreme court authority pointing in the other direction.
the federal trade commission act makes it unlawful for any person,partnership,or corporation to disseminate,or cause to be disseminated,any false advertisement in commerce,a,and it authorizes the commission to bring suit in federal district court when it finds that any such person,p
