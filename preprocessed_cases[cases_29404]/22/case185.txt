two police officers challenge disciplinary actions for violations of their department social networking policy.the district court denied relief on most of their claims.while we are sensitive to the department need for discipline throughout the chain of command,the policy here and the disciplinary actions taken pursuant to it would,if upheld,lead to an utter lack of transparency in law enforcement operations that the first amendment can not countenance.for the reasons that follow,we affirm in part,reverse in part and remand for further proceedings.
the pertinent facts in this case are not in dispute.plaintiffs herbert liverman and vance richards were veteran police officers in the city of petersburg police department.both served as field officers under chief john dixon,who led the department.dixon in turn served under the general direction of the city manager.
in april,chief dixon issued a general order revising the department social networking policy.that policy governs officers use of social media platforms.the preface to the revised policy prohibits in sweeping terms the dissemination of any information that would tend to discredit or reflect unfavorably upon the department or any other city of petersburg department or its employees.the central provision of the policy,which we will refer to as the negative comments provision,states 
negative comments on the internal operations of the bureau,or specific conduct of supervisors or peers that impacts the public perception of the department is not protected by the first amendment free speech clause,in accordance with established case law.
another provision,which we label the public concern provision,specifies 
officers may comment on issues of general or public concern as opposed to personal grievances so long as the comments do not disrupt the workforce,interfere with important working relationships or efficient work flow,or undermine public confidence in the officer.the instances must be judged on a basis.
id.the policy nonetheless strongly discourages employees from posting information regarding activities and provides that violations will be forwarded to the chief of police for appropriate disciplinary action.
this case concerns the department application of the social networking policy to the following conversation between liverman and richards.while on june,liverman posted a message to his facebook page 
sitting here reading posts referencing rookie cops becoming instructors.give me a freaking break,over years of data collected by the fbi in reference to assaults on officers and officer deaths shows that on average it takes at least years for an officer to acquire the necessary skill set to know the job and perhaps even longer to acquire the knowledge to teach other officers.but in todays world of instant gratification and political correctness we have rookies in specialty units,working as field training officer and even as instructors.becoming a master of your trade is essential,not only does your life depend on it but more importantly the lives of others.leadership is first learning,knowing and then doing.
more than thirty people liked or commented on this post.richards,also at the time,commented as follows 
well said bro,i agree not to mention you are seeing more and more younger officers being promoted in a supervisor or roll.it disgusting and makes me sick to my stomach daily.leo supervisors should be promoted by experience and what comes with experience are experiences that they can pass around to the rookies and younger less experienced officers.perfect example,and you know who i talking about.how can anyone look up,or give respect to a sgt in patrol with only yrs experience in the street or less as a matter of fact.it a law suit waiting to happen.and you know who will be responsible for that law suit a police vet,who knew tried telling and warn the admin for promoting the young rookie who was too inexperienced for that roll to begin with.im with ya bro smh 
later that day,liverman responded to richards with a comment of his own 
there used to be a time when you had to earn a promotion or a spot in a specialty unit but now it seems as though anything goes and beyond officer safety and questions of liability,these positions have been devalued and when something has no value,well it is worthless.
id.richards then replied 
your right.the next ca get here fast enough from what i been seeing i do think i can last though.you know the old but true saying is your agency is only as good as it leader s it hard to lead by example when there is one smh 
among those who liked or commented on the facebook postings,most were current or former department officers.two sergeants,liverman and richards supervisors,learned of the exchange and notified chief dixon of the issue.dixon determined that the statements violated the department social networking policy and instructed the sergeants to discipline the officers.in the disciplinary action forms,the department stated that liverman comment and both of richards comments violated the negative comments provision.they each received an oral reprimand and six months probation,but were advised that such discipline would not affect their eligibility for promotion.both the city manager and human resources director signed the personnel action forms indicating their probationary status.
several weeks later,however,chief dixon altered the qualifications for promotion.the new protocol expressly excluded any officers on probation from participating in the promotion process.accordingly,when liverman and richards applied for open sergeant positions,the department notified them that they were ineligible to sit for the promotional exam.
on october,the two officers sent a letter informing the city that they intended to challenge the disciplinary actions.shortly thereafter,liverman and richards were the subject of several complaints and investigations within the department.based on the findings,chief dixon decided to fire liverman,but liverman resigned before receiving notice of his termination.
on march,liverman and richards filed a complaint in federal district court under,seeking damages and other relief against chief dixon and the city for various violations of the first amendment.the two officers claimed that the social networking policy infringed their free speech rights in counts one liverman and two richards.liverman and richards also challenged the adverse disciplinary actions taken pursuant to the policy in counts three and four,respectively.finally,they alleged in counts five and six that the department instituted subsequent investigations against them in retaliation for proceeding with the instant suit.
the district court granted liverman summary judgment on his claim that the social networking policy infringed his right to free speech,but nonetheless found that chief dixon was entitled to qualified immunity because the policy fell within a gray zone.on liverman challenge to the disciplinary action,the court found that qualified immunity again shielded dixon decision because the contours of protected speech in this area were not clearly established.the district court next denied relief on richards challenges to the policy and the discipline,holding that richards speech was purely personal and thus not protected by the first amendment.for both of their retaliation claims,the court concluded that the subsequent internal investigations were not retaliatory.this appeal followed.
the legal framework governing public employee speech claims is well known.public employees may not be compelled to relinquish the first amendment rights they would otherwise enjoy as citizens to comment on matters of public interest.pickering bd.of.underlying this principle is the recognition that public employees are often the members of the community who are likely to have informed opinions as to the operations of their public employers.city of san diego roe,per curiam.nonetheless,a citizen who accepts public employment must accept certain limitations on his or her freedom.garcetti ceballos.government employers enjoy considerable discretion to manage their operations,and the first amendment does not require a public office to be run as a roundtable for employee complaints over internal office affairs.connick myers.
courts begin the first amendment inquiry by assessing whether the speech at issue relates to a matter of public concern.see pickering,at.if speech is purely personal,it is not protected and the inquiry is at an end.if,however,the speech is of public concern,courts must balance the interests of the employee,as a citizen,in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the state,as an employer,in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.see also connick,at.
against this backdrop,we turn to the officers first amendment challenges to the department social networking policy and the subsequent disciplinary actions taken against them.
the district court granted summary judgment to liverman on his challenge to the social networking policy,but denied richards parallel claim on the grounds that his speech was not protected by the first amendment.we hold that the department social networking policy is unconstitutionally overbroad and,for the following reasons,award judgment to richards on his claim as well.
although regulations on social media use may appear to present novel issues,we agree with the district court that such questions are amenable to the traditional analysis set forth in connick and pickering.indeed,the particular attributes of social media fit comfortably within the existing balancing inquiry a social media platform amplifies the distribution of the speaker message which favors the employee free speech interests but also increases the potential,in some cases exponentially,for departmental disruption,thereby favoring the employer interest in efficiency.what matters to the first amendment analysis is not only the medium of the speech,but the scope and content of the restriction.
here we deal with a broad social networking policy setting forth the parameters of public employee speech.in united states treasury employees union nteu,the supreme court addressed how courts should apply pickering when a generally applicable statute or regulation as opposed to a disciplinary action operates as a prior restraint on speech.nteu involved a statute that prohibited federal employees from accepting any compensation for giving speeches or writing articles,even when the topic was unrelated to the employee official duties.see id.at.emphasizing that the honoraria ban impeded a broad category of expression and chills potential speech before it happens,the court held that the government burden is greater with respect to this statutory restriction on expression than with respect to the isolated disciplinary action s in pickering and its progeny.id.at.accordingly,t he government must show that the interests of both potential audiences and a vast group of present and future employees in a broad range of present and future expression are outweighed by that expression necessary impact on the actual operation of the government.id.at quoting pickering,at.further,the government must demonstrate that the recited harms are real,not merely conjectural,and that the regulation will in fact alleviate these harms in a direct and material way.id.at.
the threshold question in this case is whether the department policy regulates officers rights to speak on matters of public concern.there can be no doubt that it does the restraint is a virtual blanket prohibition on all speech critical of the government employer.the explicit terms of the negative comments provision prevent plaintiffs and any other officer from making unfavorable comments on the operations and policies of the department,arguably the paradigmatic matter of public concern.sanjour epa,cir.see also roe,at.
weighing the competing interests on either side of the balance,we begin by noting the astonishing breadth of the social networking policy language.the policy seeks to prohibit the dissemination of any information on social media that would tend to discredit or reflect unfavorably upon the department.in particular,the negative comments provision proscribes n egative comments on the internal operations of the bureau which could be just about anything or on the specific conduct of supervisors or peers which,again,could be just about anything.
the interests of present and future employees and their potential audiences in such speech is manifestly significant.see nteu,at.we do not,of course,discount the capacity of social media to amplify expressions of rancor and vitriol,with all its potential disruption of workplace relationships that connick condemned.but social networking sites like facebook have also emerged as a hub for sharing information and opinions with one larger community.and the speech prohibited by the policy might affect the public interest in any number of ways,including whether the department is enforcing the law in an effective and diligent manner,or whether it is doing so in a way that is just and evenhanded to all concerned.the department law enforcement policies could well become a matter of constructive public debate and dialogue between law enforcement officers and those whose safety they are sworn to protect.after all,g overnment employees are often in the best position to know what ails the agencies for which they work.waters churchill,plurality opinion.but this policy will cut short all of that.to repeat,it squashes speech on matters of public import at the very outset.
because the department social networking policy unmistakably imposes a significant burden on expressive activity,we next consider whether the department has adequately established real,not merely conjectural harms to its operations.see nteu,at.chief dixon primary contention is that divisive social media use undermines the department interests in maintaining camaraderie among patrol officers and building community trust.these are,to be sure,legitimate interests.when close working relationships are essential to fulfilling public responsibilities,a wide degree of deference to the employer judgment is appropriate.connick,at.and such deference applies with special force to police departments because they are paramilitary discipline is demanded,and freedom must be correspondingly denied.maciariello sumner,cir.
here,however,the department fails to satisfy its burden of demonstrating actual disruption to its mission.apart from generalized allegations of budding divisiveness and claims that some patrol officers sought shift transfers,chief dixon presented no evidence of any material disruption arising from plaintiffs or any other officer comments on social media.we do not deny that officers social media use might present some potential for division within the ranks,particularly given the broad audience on facebook.but the speculative ills targeted by the social networking policy are not sufficient to justify such sweeping restrictions on officers freedom to debate matters of public concern.see connick,at mcvey stacy,cir.murnaghan,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment a stronger showing of public interest in the speech requires a concomitantly stronger showing of interest to overcome it.
defendants fallback argument is that,even if the negative comments provision itself is overbroad,the public concern provision significantly narrows the reach of the social networking policy.this second provision,which permits comments on issues of general or public concern so long as the comments do not disrupt the workforce,is ostensibly more aligned with the analysis of connick and pickering.but the milder language in a single provision does not salvage the unacceptable overbreadth of the social networking policy taken as a whole.indeed,the public concern provision does not purport to nullify or otherwise supersede the blanket censorship endorsed by the negative comments provision.if the department wishes to pursue a narrower social media policy,then it can craft a regulation that does not have the chilling effects on speech that the supreme court deplored.we can not,however,allow the current policy to survive as a management and disciplinary
