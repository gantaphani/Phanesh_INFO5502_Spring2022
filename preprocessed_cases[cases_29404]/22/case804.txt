northrop grumman corporation northrop is the owner of patent the patent,entitled bus interface unit.the patent issued in.in late,shortly before the patent expired,northrop filed suit in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas against several defendants,including appellees corporation and the lynksys group,collectively.northrop complaint alleged that the defendants had infringed several claims of the patent.
the district court appointed a special master to make a report and recommendations to the court regarding claim construction.after reviewing the patent and evidence submitted by the parties,the special master construed several critical limitations of the claims in suit.northrop objected to the special master claim construction in several respects,but stipulated that if the district court adopted the special master recommendation with regard to three of the claim construction issues,northrop would not be able to prove infringement.
the district court adopted the special master claim construction in large part,including the aspects of the special master claim construction relating to the three issues referred to in northrop stipulation.accordingly,the district court ruled in the defendants favor on the issue of infringement.the court subsequently entered a final judgment under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.northrop took the present appeal from that judgment.initially filed a,but now advises us that the is moot in light of the district court entry of judgment under rule b.
on appeal,northrop argues that the district court construed claims and of the patent unduly restrictively.we agree,and we therefore reverse and remand for further proceedings.
a computer network consists of a set of computers that are interconnected for the purpose of data exchange.computers within a network typically exchange data over a network serial bus,a wire over which data is transmitted through a network one bit at a time.in order for the data exchange process to function smoothly,it must be monitored and controlled in accordance with a particular data exchange protocol,which is a set of standard signals that can be interpreted by each device that is connected to the network serial bus.
in the early,when the patent was issued,communications between a host computer and a serial bus were usually handled by the host computer itself.under that system,however,valuable host computer processing power was devoted to monitoring and controlling communications over the network serial bus.ultimately,network designers discovered that they could free up the processing resources of the host computers by incorporating separate devices,known as bus interface units,between each host computer and the network serial bus.
bus interface units supervise the exchange of data between a host computer and a network serial bus.the bus interface unit performs two basic tasks it prepares data internal to a host computer for communication on the network serial bus,and it also receives data from the network serial bus and prepares the received data for processing by an individual host computer.in order for the network to operate efficiently,all the bus interface units on the network must operate in accordance with a particular communications protocol,which governs the method by which the various computers on the network gain access to the network and transfer data over the network serial bus.
at the time the patent was issued,a leading network communications protocol was military standard.the bus protocol specified by uses a technique called time division multiplexing to share the serial bus.a system employing a protocol designates one terminal on the network as the bus controller and the other terminals on the network as remote terminals.the bus controller manages communications on the serial bus by initiating commands and controlling access to the bus,while the remote terminals respond in a predetermined manner to commands from the bus controller.the remote terminals use the bus only in response to commands from the bus controller.
one object of the patent was to transfer the tasks of monitoring and controlling data transfer over the network serial bus to the bus interface unit,thereby freeing the associated processing unit from the need to perform those tasks.another object of the invention was to enable the bus interface unit to handle a wide variety of flexible bus communication message formats and data algorithms.a third object was to provide a bus interface unit capable of being operated in either a bus controller or remote terminal mode,and thus allow the same bus interface unit to be used as either a bus controller or a remote terminal,depending on the needs of the network at the time.
the accused devices in this case do not use a protocol such as.contends that the patent does not cover its devices because the patent scope is limited to devices used in protocol systems,systems featuring a bus controller and remote terminals.northrop,on the other hand,argues that its patent is not limited to protocols but is applicable to a wide range of protocols using bus interface units.
the dispute between the parties focuses on two claims of the patent,claims and.those claims provide 
in a multiplex data bus interface unit having a manchester providing an interface for transmit and receive shift registers to a biphase serial bus,buffer registers providing an interface for the shift registers with an internal parallel bus communicating with a parallel direct memory access data port through a bidirectional buffer,and at least one additional register responsive to the internal bus,the inmprovement sic comprising 
means for defining a functional state of the bus interface unit 
means for monitoring a plurality of logical signals characterizing the operational status of the bus interface unit,the monitoring means generating a plurality of control signals regulating a data transfer process between the biphase serial bus and the parallel direct memory access data port.

for present purposes,the most important limitations in claims and are the means for monitoring limitation and the means for defining limitation,which are found,in essentially identical form,in each of the two claims.northrop argues that the special master,and thus the district court,erroneously construed those two limitations,as well as the term bus interface unit,by interpreting each of them as limited to devices employing a protocol.because the district court adopted the special master report and recommendations as to all of the limitations pertinent to this appeal,we refer to the special master analysis and conclusions as the district court.
the means for monitoring limitation is written in form,as permitted by,paragraph.section,paragraph,allows a patentee to express a claim limitation by reciting a function to be performed rather than by reciting structure or materials for performing that function.such a limitation is construed to cover the corresponding structure,materials,or acts described in the specification and equivalents thereof,para.chiuminatta concrete concepts,cardinal.
in construing a limitation,a court must identify both the claimed function and the corresponding structure in the written description for performing that function.micro,great plains chem.determining the claimed function and the corresponding structure for a claim limitation written in format is a matter of claim construction as to which we exercise de novo review.wms gaming int l game,chiuminatta,at,at.
from the language of the claims,the district court correctly determined that the means for monitoring recited in claims and performs two functions monitoring a plurality of logical signals characterizing the operational status of the bus interface unit and generating a plurality of control signals regulating a data transfer process.the court then undertook to determine what structure disclosed in the written description is necessary to carry out those two recited functions.in so doing,the court focused on a passage from the written description that,in the court view,most clearly described the structure that performs the monitoring and generating functions.that passage reads as follows 
with reference to,the control signals required for loading,enabling and clearing the various registers,setting error bits and flag bits,and informing peripheral equipment of the current operating condition of the bus interface unit are supplied by a sequence logic unit.because these control signals in effect regulate the entire data transfer process between the serial bus and the direct memory access port,sequence logic must receive a set of logical signals which,when continuously monitored,completely characterize the operational status of bus interface unit.that is,by appropriately considering the past history and present condition of such a set of logical signals,one may determine when each register should be loaded or enabled,when the various error and flag bits should be set or cleared.in a preferred embodiment,nineteen signals are received by sequence logic at logic inputs through.
sequence logic,which is featured in the passage quoted above,consists of two arrays of logic gates and array and or array,a state register through,an asynchronous input buffer,an inverter array,and associated internal wiring.figure of the patent,which depicts sequence logic,is set out below 
the district court identified the signals received by sequence logic at logic inputs through as the plurality of logical signals characterizing the operational status of the bus interface unit referred to in the passage quoted above.those signals include signal,which is associated with pin and logic input,and which the specification identifies as dictating whether the bus interface unit functions as a bus controller or a remote terminal in a system.the court identified signals through as the control signals regulating a data transfer process between the biphase serial bus and the parallel direct memory access data port that are generated by the means for monitoring.
the district court correctly identified the structural components of sequence logic as the structure that corresponds to the monitoring and generating functions of the means for monitoring in claims and.the written description makes clear that sequence logic performs the monitoring and generating functions,and that the structures within sequence logic that perform those tasks include,at a minimum,the and array,the or array,and the through.the court,however,also included other elements as part of the corresponding structure,identifying those elements as directly tied to the claimed functions.the additional elements identified by the court were the operating mode signal from pin and logical input signals and control signals necessary to define the bus interface unit as functioning in either a bus controller or a remote terminal mode,and any equivalents thereof.by including those additional elements,the court erred.
under section,paragraph,structure disclosed in the specification is corresponding structure only if the specification or the prosecution history clearly links or associates that structure to the function recited in the claim.braun,abbott.a court may not import into the claim features that are unnecessary to perform the claimed function.acromed sofamor danek group.features that do not perform the recited function do not constitute corresponding structure and thus do not serve as claim limitations.see cardiac pacemakers,jude,asyst,empak,wenger,coating mach.
those principles dictate that signal and other input signals and control signals can not be part of the structure corresponding to the functions of the means for monitoring limitation,because they are not part of the means for monitoring or generating signals.the specification makes clear that the signals associated with logical inputs through,including signal which corresponds to logical input,are the signals that are monitored by the circuitry that constitutes the means for monitoring.the signals that are monitored by the means for monitoring can not be part of the structure that does the monitoring.see tekmar,the passage through which a slug travels is not the means that causes the passing.for the same reason,control signals through,which are generated by the means for monitoring,can not be part of the structure that performs the recited function of generating control signals.
the district court determined that operating mode signal,which enables the bus interface unit to operate in either a bus controller or remote terminal mode,plays a critical role in characterizing the operational status of the bus interface unit.nothing in the written description of the patent,however,requires the term operational status to include the operating mode of the bus interface unit as either a bus controller or a remote terminal.in fact,other than the similarity of the terms operating and operational,there is nothing in the written description that suggests that the operating mode is a necessary element of the operational status of the bus interface unit,as that term is used in the claims of the patent.
the term operational status appears in the written description of the patent only once,in the statement that sequence logic must receive a set of logical signals which,when continuously monitored,completely characterize the operational status of bus interface unit.patent,ll.the very next sentence emphasizes the breadth of the term operational status that is,by appropriately considering the past history and present condition of such a set of logical signals,one may determine when each register should be loaded or enabled,when the various error and flag bits should be set or cleared,ll.considering the past state and the present state of the device is the function normally performed by a finite state machine.following that broad characterization of the term operational status,the written description goes on to describe particular embodiments,including a state machine that can be used in a bus terminal environment.the treatment of the term operational status in the written description reinforces our conclusion that the portion of the patent that describes the structure corresponding to the functions recited in the means for monitoring limitation is quite general in nature and is not limited to a structure that monitors a signal such as signal.nor must the means for monitoring structure necessarily include elements that define the bus interface unit as functioning in either a bus controller or remote terminal mode,as the district court concluded.we therefore disagree with the district court contrary construction of the means for monitoring limitation.under the construction we adopt,the structure corresponding to the means for monitoring includes only the structural features of sequence logic unit.
the second of the two limitations at issue in this case is the means for defining a functional state of the bus interface unit.the district court explained that the function of the means for defining limitation is to define the functional state of the bus interface unit,and that defining the functional state of the bus interface unit requires,at a minimum,determining whether the bus interface unit is functioning in the bus controller or remote terminal mode.because the court determined that the functional st
