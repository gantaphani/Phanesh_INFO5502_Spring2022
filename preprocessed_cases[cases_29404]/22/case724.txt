soverain software llc brought this patent infringement suit against newegg for infringement of specified claims of united states patent the patent,its continuation patent the patent,and patent the patent.the patents relate to electronic commerce,wherein a merchant products are offered and purchased online,through computers interconnected by a network.the patents arise from a software system called transact that was developed in by a company named open market.the abstract of the and patents describes the subject matter as follows 
a sales system includes at least one buyer computer for operation by a user desiring to buy a product,at least one merchant computer,and at least one payment computer.the buyer computer,the merchant computer,and the payment computer are interconnected by a computer network.the buyer computer is programmed to receive a user request for purchasing a product,and to cause a payment message to be sent to the payment computer that comprises a product identifier identifying the product.the payment computer is programmed to receive the payment message,to cause an access message to be created that comprises the product identifier and an access message authenticator based on a cryptographic key,and to cause the access message to be sent to the merchant computer.the merchant computer is programmed to receive the access message,to verify the access message authenticator to ensure that the access message authenticator was created using the cryptographic key,and to cause the product to be sent to the user desiring to buy the product.
figure in the and patents is 
in open market was sold,with the transact software and patents,to a company named divine.former divine employee and current soverain president katharine wolanyk testified that the transact software was a very complex product that required constant support services and engineering development,that divine was unable to provide the necessary support and development,and that divine declared bankruptcy after fifteen months.soverain acquired the transact software and patents.soverain then sued seven online retailers,including newegg,for patent infringement.the record states that all of the defendants except newegg took licenses to the patents.trial tr.ll,ecf.
newegg declined to pay for a license,stating that its system is materially different from that described and claimed in the patents,and that the patents are invalid if given the scope asserted by soverain.newegg pointed out that similar electronic commerce systems were known before the patented system,that the transact software was generally abandoned,and that newegg system,which is based on the different principle of using cookies on the buyer computer to collect shopping data,is outside of the claims.
suit against newegg proceeded in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas the jury found newegg liable for infringement of the and patents,and awarded soverain damages of million.the jury found that newegg did not infringe the patent,but the district court granted soverain motion for jmol of infringement of the patent,and ordered a new trial to assess damages for the patent,to be tried after the completion of appeals.the district court awarded soverain damages and an ongoing royalty.
after the close of evidence the district court removed the question of obviousness from the jury,the court stating i do think there sufficient testimony to present an obviousness case to the jury.i think it would be very confusing to them.trial tr.ll,ecf.the district court then held that the claims are not invalid on the ground of obviousness.op.at.newegg motions for jmol or a new trial were denied.
obviousness 
obviousness is a question of law based on underlying facts,as set forth in graham john deere,d.the graham factors are the scope and content of the prior art,the difference between the prior art and the claimed invention,the level of ordinary skill in the field of the invention,and any relevant objective considerations.the graham court explained that the ultimate question of patent validity is one of law.id.at.thus on appellate review,the question of obviousness is decided de novo.see vulcan eng g fata aluminium,district court application of the law of obviousness to the found facts is reviewed for correctness bard,the ultimate determination of obviousness vel non is a legal conclusion.
newegg argues that it was wrongfully deprived of a jury determination of the question of obviousness,pointing to the extensive testimony on this issue at trial.however,federal rule of civil procedure allows the trial court to remove cases or issues from the jury consideration when the facts are sufficiently clear that the law requires a particular result,weisgram marley,d quoting wright miller,federal practice and procedure ed.the court has explained that the purpose of rule is to speed litigation and avoid unnecessary retrials.neeley martin eby const,d.
although here both sides had presented witnesses and evidence on the question of obviousness,the district court removal of the legal question from the jury did not violate the right to jury trial.see markman westview instruments,d a ny credibility determinations will be subsumed within the necessarily sophisticated analysis of the whole document.in ksr international,teleflex,d,the court applied similar principles in its determination of the question of obviousness,stating that where,as here,the content of the prior art,the scope of the patent claim,and the level of ordinary skill in the art are not in material dispute,and the obviousness of the claim is apparent in light of these factors,summary judgment is appropriate and remand unnecessary.
however,questions of law must be correctly decided,and the district court determination of the question of obviousness as a matter of law receives de novo determination on appeal.see western union moneygram payment,reversing judgment of nonobviousness when t he parties disputes revolve around whether the prior art taught three specific elements of the claimed inventions,whether there was a motivation to combine these elements with the prior art system,and whether secondary considerations support a finding of nonobviousness.muniauction,thomson,reversing judgment of nonobviousness when defendant clearly and convincingly established a prima facie case that the claims were obvious as a matter of law.inventio ag otis elevator,wl,at,reversing judgment of nonobviousness when patent was a clear example of a combination of familiar elements according to known methods yielding no more than predictable results.citations omitted.
on these premises,we determine the question of obviousness.newegg relied primarily on a prior electronic commerce system called compuserve mall.the district court,sustaining validity of all claims in suit,did not discuss the claims or the prior art the court stated that newegg expert had not presented a prima facie case of obviousness,and criticized newegg for not presenting some articulated reasoning with some rational underpinning to support the legal conclusion of obviousness.op.at.
the parties divided the claims in suit into three groups,and presented evidence and argument,including expert and other witness testimony,for the claims as grouped.we retain the parties groupings,as follows 
the and patents the shopping cart claims 
soverain asserted claims and of the patent and claim of the patent as a group called the shopping cart claims.these claims are directed to the overall system wherein products are offered online by a merchant,a buyer designates products for purchase,and payment for the designated products is initiated upon the buyer request for checkout,all operating through a computer network.the parties agreed that claim of the patent is representative of this group.claim follows with bracketed numbers added 
a sales system,comprising 
at least one buyer computer for operation by a user desiring to buy products 
at least one shopping cart computer and 
a shopping cart database connected to said shopping cart computer 
said buyer computer and said shopping cart computer being interconnected by a computer network 
said buyer computer being programmed to receive a plurality of requests from a user to add a plurality of respective products to a shopping cart in said shopping cart database,and,in response to said requests to add said products,to send a plurality of respective shopping cart messages to said shopping cart computer each of which comprises a product identifier identifying one of said plurality of products 
said shopping cart computer being programmed to receive said plurality of shopping cart messages,to modify said shopping cart in said shopping cart database to reflect said plurality of requests to add said plurality of products to said shopping cart,and to cause a payment message associated with said shopping cart to be created and 
said buyer computer being programmed to receive a request from said user to purchase said plurality of products added to said shopping cart and to cause said payment message to be activated to initiate a payment transaction for said plurality of products added to said shopping cart 
said shopping cart database being a database of stored representations of collections of products,and said shopping cart computer being a computer that modifies said stored representations of collections of products in said database.
at the trial the compuserve mall system was the primary reference against the shopping cart claims,including two books describing the system bowen peyton,how to get the most out of compuserve ed and ellsworth ellsworth,using compuserve.newegg presented testimony of compuserve former chief technology officer alexander trevor,newegg expert witness edward tittel,and newegg chief technology officer james wu,who designed the newegg system.
tittel compared claim with the prior art system,element by element.trial tr,ecf.tittel testified that the compuserve mall was a sales system claim preamble in which the buyer computer clause interacted with a compuserve server computer clause that stored buyers product selections in shopping carts called personal holding files clause,all via a computer network clause.id.tittel explained that products were added to the personal holding files when the buyer computer sent an order command o to the compuserve server,at which time the server would update the personal holding file for each such selection clauses,and.id.when the buyer was ready for checkout,the buyer typed checkout and was presented with a screen to review the designated items,and with a request to initiate payment clause.id.tittel concluded that all of the elements and limitations of soverain shopping cart claims were shown or apparent in the prior art compuserve mall.id.
trevor testified as to the compuserve mall system,for which he had been the chief technology officer.according to trevor,the compuserve mall provided the buyer with access to over a hundred online stores.trial tr.ll,ecf.within each store,products were presented in menus.when a buyer found a product of interest,the buyer selected the product from the store menu and a detailed description would be displayed,in some cases with a photograph.id.ll.if the buyer wanted to purchase the product,the buyer would type the order command o and compuserve would store the product in the buyer personal holding file on the server.id.ll.the buyer could designate up to forty items for placement in the personal holding file.id.ll.by typing checkout,the buyer could review selections and modify or delete items in the personal holding file,or proceed to purchase.id.ll.
soverain expert witness michael shamos stated that the newegg witnesses description of the compuserve mall was consistent with my understanding,but presented the argument that the compuserve mall lacked two elements of the shopping cart claims first,that the compuserve system lacked the shopping cart message that comprises a product identifier of claim clause and second,that compuserve lacked the shopping cart database of clause.trial tr,ecf.shamos did not dispute that the other elements of claim were embodied in the compuserve mall.we have given particular attention to the two aspects on which the witnesses stated divergent views.
the product identifier message,clause 
shamos did not disagree with tittel that the compuserve mall order command was a shopping cart message as in clause,and agreed that when a compuserve mall buyer entered the order command,the compuserve server computer would identify the product and place it in a personal holding file for that buyer.trial tr.ll,ecf id.ll.however,shamos argued that the compuserve mall was different because the product identifier in the compuserve mall was not in the message.id.ll.shamos stated that the compuserve mall system of product identification was based not on the order command itself,but on what the server knew based on previously sent messages.id.it was just an indication that the order key had been had been hit at that time.id.ll.thus shamos argued that the compuserve order command was not a message which comprises a product identifier as required by claim clause.id.ll.
the distinction proposed by shamos and advanced by soverain is not embodied in the claims and not reflected in the claim construction.it was not disputed that the compuserve mall order command designated a specific product for placement in the buyer personal holding file,or shopping cart,as recited in claim clause.see trial tr,ecf trial tr.ll,ecf.nor was it disputed that,regardless of how the order command was structured,it conveyed the requisite information to the compuserve server computer.id.the message set forth in the claims is not distinguished from the message in the compuserve mall.the term product identifier was not given a special meaning in the specification or through claim construction,and contains no designated format requirements.no principle of law authorize s read ing into a claim an element which is not present,for the purpose of making out a case of novelty dupont de nemours phillips petroleum,quoting mccarty lehigh valley.
soverain also argues that its system is superior to the compuserve order command because the system of the patents in suit is adapted to the internet,whereas the compuserve mall operated on a network.trial tr,ecf.in muniauction this court held that conducting previously known methods through an internet web browser was obvious because it amounted to no more than applying the use of the internet to existing electronic processes at a time when doing so was commonplace.at.precedent agrees with newegg that a person of ordinary could have adapted the compuserve order command to known browser capabilities when these capabilities became commonplace,and that it was obvious to do so.the product identifier message term does not distinguish the shopping cart claims from the prior art compuserve mall.
the shopping cart database,clause 
shamos also stated his opinion that the compuserve mall did not have a shopping cart database as in the claims in suit.shamos agreed with newegg expert tittel that the compuserve mall system included personal holding files,and shamos agreed that a shopping cart database might have been a reasonable design choice,but he opined that such database was required by the compuserve mall and that the prior art did not necessarily disclose a database.trial tr.ll,ecf.
the agreed claim construction for shopping cart database was a database of stored representations of collections of products,where database means a collection of logically related data stored together by one or more computerized files.claim construction order,ecf.the use of personal holding files in the compuserve mall is easily within this definition.tittel testified that the personal holding file in compuserve mall was a shopping cart in a shopping cart database.trial tr.ll,ecf.he explained that t he personal holding file itself is a shopping cart.and because compuserve supported multiple individuals shopping in the same store at the same time,a collection of such files would be maintained,and that would meet the court requirements for a shopping cart database.id.ll.in addition,trevor testified that the personal holding files in the compuserve mall system stored products specific to each customer and constituted an database.trial tr.ll,ecf.
the ellsworth ellsworth book describes the storage of customer product selections in the compuserve personal holding files.using compuserve,ecf when you find a product that you want to buy,press o for order.your order will be stored in a personal holding file until you leave that merchant store.the book further describes that items placed in the personal holding file are not yet purchased,and are held until the buyer types the checkout command.id.when you are finished shopping in that store,type checkout.an electronic order form appears.
when shamos was asked how a person of skill in the art would have implemented the compuserve online shopping system other than through a database,he suggested that compuserve could have used a fulfillment house,which would fill your order and send it to you without ever recording it in a database.trial tr.ll,ecf.whether that alternative was feasible,it is not stated to be what compuserve did.the ellsworth ellsworth book states that the buyer product selections are stored not sent without ever recording it in a database.the fulfillment house alternative proposed by shamos does not relate to a personal holding file,and appears to have no relation to either the prior art or the patents.shamos conceded that a database would have been a reasonable design choice for the personal holding files,and his statements that the prior art did not necessarily disclose a database are not evidence of nonobviousness.because the patentee is required to define precisely what his invention is it is unjust to the public,as well as an evasion of the law,to construe it in a manner different from the plain import of its terms.phillips awh,en banc citations omitted.
the district court conclusion that a prima facie case of obviousness was not met is not explained by the court or by soverain,and does not accord with the record.shamos did not provide evidence to rebut newegg prima facie case that every claim element was embodied in the prior art.
although the district court criticized tittel expert report on the question of obviousness,the trial record contains extensive testimony of the experts for both sides,discussing every claimed element of the patented subject matter and the prior art system.their testimony was subjected to examination and,before decision of the question of obviousness was removed from the jury.also,precedent does not require expert opinions on matters of law.in nutrition united states,this court observed that a n expert opinion on the ultimate legal conclusion is neither required nor indeed evidence at all.avia group int l gear,an expert opinion on the legal conclusion of obviousness is neither necessary nor controlling.
we conclude that the prior art compuserve mall system,by clear and convincing evidence,rendered obvious the shopping cart claims claims and of the patent and claim of the patent.these claims are invalid the district court contrary ruling is reversed.
the patent the hypertext statement claims 
the patent is a division of the patent,with the same specification and drawings.soverain asserted infringement of claims and of the patent,called the hypertext statement claims.these claims are directed to the aspect of the online shopping system set forth in the patents,in which the client computer receives transaction statements from the server computer,in response to a request from the client computer.the district court included these claims in its ruling of nonobviousness,although the specific subject matter and claims were not mentioned by the court.we thus determine this question of law de novo.
claim is shown below,with claim from which it depends,and bracketed numbers added to each claim clause 
a hypertext statement system,comprising 
a client computer for operation by a client user and 
one or more server computers for operation by a server user 
the client computer and the server computers being interconnected by a public packet switched computer network 
at least one of the server computers being programmed to record information pertaining to purchase transaction records in a database,and to transmit a statement document comprising the purchase transaction records to the client computer over the network 
the client computer being programmed to display the statement document to receive a request from the client user to display transaction details corresponding to a portion of the statement document displayed by the client computer,and to cause a transaction detail hypertext link corresponding to the portion of the statement document to be activated 
at least one of the server computers being programmed to respond to activation of the transaction detail hypertext link by transmitting the transaction details to the client computer over the network as a transaction detail document.
a hypertext statement system in accordance with claim,wherein 
the statement document is sent by at least one of the server computer to the client computer in response to a statement url sent by the client computer to at least one of the server computers.
newegg argued that claim is rendered obvious by the compuserve mall system,for the commonplace sending of a statement of a transaction or receipt,in response to a url inquiry by the purchaser claim clause,does not contribute nonobviousness to known systems of over the network,clause.tittel testimony included an element by element comparison of these claims with the compuserve mall statement system.trial tr,ecf.tittel testified that in the compuserve mall,the client user operated a client computer clause,and a server user operated a server computer clause,and the computers were interconnected by a public network clause.id.the compuserve server recorded and transmitted purchase information,and provided a confirmation number from which buyers could get all the information about that transaction that you might ever need,clause.id.ll.the client user could request transaction information using the confirmation number clause,and receive access to such information from the compuserve system clause,though not using urls or hypertext clause.id.ll.tittel explained that the compuserve mall did not employ hypertext or urls because it the internet and did not use the tools of the world wide web,but a nyone who could get access to the text in a transaction record would understand how to use html to present that information at a variety of levels of details.id.ll.
at the trial,both sides presented testimony concerning the statement url clause.shamos argued that the statement url rendered these claims nonobvious because there was no way of obtaining transaction details online in the compuserve mall system.trial tr.ll,ecf soverain br.tittel testified that hypertext and urls are basic functionalities of the world wide web,and that a nyone who wanted to move shopping on the web would know they had to use urls to tie things together to deliver information.trial tr.ll,ecf.
also in suit was claim of the patent,shown with claims and from which claim depends 
a hypertext statement system in accordance with claim,wherein the information on transactions by the user includes at least one of the following types of information a date of transaction,an identification of the product,a payment amount,and a merchant identifier.
the method of claim,wherein at least one service request comprises a purchase request,the purchase request including an associated user identifier,the method further comprising 
accessing,upon receipt of the purchase request at the server system,user information associated with the user identifier sufficient to charge to an account associated with the user,the purchase price of the product identified by the purchase request 
charging the user for the product identified by the purchase request according to the user information and 
fulfilling the purchase request based on the user information.
a method of processing service requests from a client to a server system through a network,said method comprising the steps of 
forwarding a service request from the client to the server system,wherein comm
