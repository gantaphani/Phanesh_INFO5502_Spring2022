in,several agencies petitioned the federal communications commission fcc or the commission to clarify the scope of the communications assistance for law enforcement act,calea or the act,with respect to certain broadband internet services.in response,the commission ruled that providers of broadband internet access and voice over internet protocol voip services are regulable as telecommunications carriers under the act.as telecommunications carriers,broadband and voip providers must ensure that officers are able to intercept communications transmitted over the providers networks.the american council on education and various other interested parties collectively ace petition for review,arguing that the commission interpretation of calea was unlawful.because we disagree,we deny the petition.
before the dawn of the digital era,there were few technological obstacles to the government wiretapping capabilities eavesdropping on a phone call was as easy as finding the copper wires that ran into every caller home.with the advent of the digital age,however,the architecture of the world communications networks changed drastically.in the place of physical copper wires that connected individual,new communications technologies such as digital subscriber line dsl,cable modems,and voip substituted ethereal and encrypted digital signals that were much harder to intercept and decode using techniques.
responding to these changing technologies,in congress passed calea,which requires telecommunications carriers to ensure that their networks are technologically capable of being accessed by authorized law enforcement officials a.while calea substantive provisions apply to telecommunications carrier s,they do not apply to information services.see id.a,b.determining which communications services fall where is the crux of this case.
calea applies only to telecommunications carriers.see id.a.the act defines a telecommunications carrier as an entity engaged in the transmission or switching of wire or electronic communications as a common carrier for hire.id.a.however,in addition to providers of transmission or switching,calea definition of a telecommunications carrier also includes 
a person or entity engaged in providing wire or electronic communication switching or transmission service to the extent that the commission finds that such service is a replacement for a substantial portion of the local telephone exchange service and that it is in the public interest to deem such a person or entity to be a telecommunications carrier for purposes of this subchapter 
id.b ii emphasis added.section b ii which is commonly referenced as calea substantial replacement provision or srp allows the commission to expand the definition of a telecommunications carrier to include new technologies that substantially replace the functions of an telephone network.
calea does not apply to persons or entities insofar as they are engaged in providing information services.id.c i the exclusion.the act defines an information service as the offering of a capability for generating,acquiring,storing,transforming,processing,retrieving,utilizing,or making available information via telecommunications.id.a.because providers are not subject to calea,they need not make their networks accessible to agencies.see id.b a.
in,the united states department of justice,the federal bureau of investigation,and the united states drug enforcement administration collectively,the doj filed a joint petition for expedited rulemaking before the fcc.the doj explained that t he ability of federal,state,and local law enforcement to carry out critical electronic surveillance is being compromised today by providers who have failed to implement intercept capabilities.in response,the commission issued a notice of proposed rulemaking and invited comments on whether certain communications broadband and voip comply with calea.see communications assistance for law enforcement act and broadband access and services,notice of proposed rulemaking and declaratory ruling,wl.
after receiving thousands of pages of comments from more than interested parties,the commission ruled that broadband and voip providers are covered at least in part by calea definition of telecommunications carriers.see communications assistance for law enforcement and broadband access and services,order.to avoid an irreconcilable tension between calea srp and the exclusion,the commission concluded that the act creates three categories of communications services pure telecommunications which plainly fall within calea,pure information which plainly fall outside calea,and hybrid services which are only partially governed by calea.id.
the fcc then concluded that broadband and voip are hybrid services that contain both telecommunications and information components id.at.the commission explained that calea applies to providers of those hybrid services only to the extent they qualify as telecommunications carriers under the three prongs of the srp.first,providers of both technologies must perform switching and transport functions.see id.id.second,providers of both technologies serve as replacements for a substantial functionality of local telephone exchange service broadband replaces the transmission function previously used to reach internet service providers isps,and voip replaces traditional telephone service voice capabilities.see id.id.third,the public interest requires application of calea to the telecommunications component of both technologies the application of calea across technologies will not impede competition or innovation id.id,and t he overwhelming importance of calea assistance capability requirements to law enforcement efforts to safeguard homeland security and combat crime weighs heavily in favor of applying calea broadly.id.see also id.
notwithstanding calea breadth,the commission clarified that the act does not apply to private networks.see id.citing b b.the fcc noted that some broadband companies provide access to private education,library and research networks.id.the commission explained that these companies may or may not qualify for calea exclusion 
to the extent the petitioners are engaged in the provision of private broadband networks or intranets that enable members to communicate with one another retrieve information from shared data libraries not available to the general public,these networks appear to be private networks for purposes of calea we therefore make clear that providers of these networks are not included as telecommunications carriers under the srp with respect to these networks.to the extent,however,that these private networks are interconnected with a public network,either the public voice network or the internet,providers of the facilities that support the connection of the private network to a public network are subject to calea under the srp.
id.thus,private broadband and excluded from calea insofar as they meet one of the statute exclusions.see b a excluding information services,b excluding private networks.however,to the extent a service provider qualifies as a telecommunications carrier,it is subject to calea substantive requirements.see id.
the commission recognized that it had separately adopted a different interpretation of a similar term telecommunications service under a different statute.interpreting the telecommunications act of,stat,the telecom act or the act,the fcc previously concluded that broadband internet service is not a telecommunications service,and it therefore falls outside the ambit of the act.see in re inquiry concerning access to the internet over cable and other facilities,wl broadband declaratory ruling.to reconcile the order promulgated under calea with the broadband declaratory ruling promulgated under the act,the commission emphasized that both calea and the telecom act are silent regarding how or whether the fcc should regulate mixed services that have both telecommunications and information components.order.thus,the fcc concluded that both statutes vest it with discretion to interpret congress ambiguous treatment of hybrid services.
in the context of the act,the commission concluded that hybrid services fall entirely outside the statute scope.because the act defines both telecommunications service and information service in terms of an offering to consumers,see broadband declaratory ruling,at,and because consumers perceive broadband internet access to be a single offer for an integrated information service,id.at,the fcc concluded that service is exclusively an information service,which is unregulable under the act,id.at.the commission further emphasized that its interpretation of the telecom act is consistent with congress deregulatory goals.see id.at,id.at,see also verizon commc ns fcc,d emphasizing the deregulatory and competitive purposes of the act cellco fcc,emphasizing the act deregulatory purpose.the supreme court upheld the fcc broadband declaratory ruling as a reasonable interpretation of the act.see cable telecomms.ass brand x internet,d citing chevron,natural res.def.council,d see also id.at upholding the commission conclusion that the purpose of the act is to foster a minimal regulatory environment that promotes investment and innovation in a competitive market internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
however,the telecom act differs significantly from calea.unlike calea,the act does not contain an analogue to calea srp while an entity is covered by calea if it provides transmission,switching,or the functional equivalent thereof,an entity is covered by the telecom act only if it provides transmission.see.also unlike calea,the telecom act does not contain an analogue to calea insofar as clause while an entity is excluded from calea only insofar as it provides information services,the act categorically excludes information services en toto.see id.finally,unlike calea,the telecom act refers to two service offerings while calea refers only to an offering of information services,the telecom act refers to offerings of both telecommunications services and information services.id,see also broadband declaratory ruling,at,emphasizing the fact that the separate definitions for telecommunications and telecommunications service.
drawing on the statutes different texts,structures,legislative histories,and purposes,the fcc decided to resolve the ambiguities in calea and the act differently.in light of congress deliberate extension of calea substantive requirements to providers satisfying the srp,the fcc concluded that a telecommunications carrier should not escape the act reach altogether simply because the carrier service offering has an informational component.order.thus,the fcc concluded that calea definitional sections are not mutually exclusive w hen a single service comprises an information service component and a telecommunications component,congress intended calea to apply to the telecommunications component.id.at.the commission further emphasized that its interpretation of calea is consistent with the act goals.verizon,at.
ace raises three arguments in its petition for review.first,ace argues that broadband internet access is an integrated information service under calea,and as such,it is uniformly excluded from the act substantive requirements.second,ace argues that voip similarly qualifies for calea exclusion.third,ace argues that the commission unlawfully applied the act to private networks.
our review is governed by the classic approach set out in chevron,natural res.def.council,d.see telecom ass fcc.under chevron,i f the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.chevron,at.however,if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific question at issue,we ask whether the agency interpretation is permissible,that is,reasonable.id.at.see also northpoint,fcc,a reasonable explanation of how an agency interpretation serves the statute objectives is the stuff of which a permissible construction is made an explanation that is arbitrary capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute,however,is not.citations omitted.
ace first argues that broadband internet access is an information service,which falls completely beyond calea reach.the supreme court has upheld the fcc classification of broadband as an integrated information service under the telecom act.see brand x.at.calea definition of information service is virtually identical to the one included in the act.compare calea,with id.telecom act.therefore,ace concludes broadband providers must fall within the ambit of calea identical information services exclusion.notwithstanding the superficial attractiveness of ace argument,we disagree.
ace syllogism falls apart because calea and the telecom act are different statutes,and brand x was a different case.although ace would have us read brand x was controlling this controversy,that case did not hold that broadband internet access is exclusively an information service,devoid of any telecommunications component.rather,it upheld the fcc reasonable interpretation to that effect under a different statute.see.at citing chevron,at.step two.emphasizing that the telecom act is ambiguous about whether cable companies offer telecommunications with cable modem service,id.at,the court concluded that the commission construction was a reasonable policy choice for the commission to make at chevron second step,id.at internal quotation marks,citation,and alteration omitted.
so here.calea expressly provides that the commission may extend the definition of a telecommunications carrier to the extent that the commission finds that a service is a replacement for a substantial portion of the local telephone service and that it is in the public interest to deem such a person or entity to be a telecommunications carrier b ii emphasis added.where,as here,congress has explicitly left a gap for the agency to fill,there is an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation.such legislative regulations are given controlling weight,so long as they reflect reasonable policy choice s.chevron,at.see also united states mead,d.
the commission interpretation of calea represents a reasonable policy choice.the a statute.see a requiring telecommunications carriers to enable the government to conduct electronic surveillance id.defining government as any public entity authorized by law to conduct electronic surveillance.the communications act of which the telecom act is part,by contrast,was enacted f or the purpose of regulating interstate and foreign commerce in communication by wire and radio id.see also verizon,at.emphasizing the deregulatory and competitive purposes of the act.the statutes respective texts reflect their disparate objectives while the act is framed in terms of offerings made by service providers to consumers,calea srp empowers the fcc to expand its definition of a telecommunication carrier to meet the evolving needs of law enforcement officials.the commission interpretation of calea reasonably differs from its interpretation of the act,given the differences between the two statutes 
specifically,calea differs from the act in two important ways.first,calea definition of telecommunications carrier is broader than the definition used in the act.to highlight the difference,we present the statutory texts synoptically.
while the telecom act limits its definition of telecommunications services to transmission,calea text is more inclusive calea defines a telecommunications carrier as a provider of transmission or switching plus any provider that substantially replaces traditional transmission or switching.see id.b ii srp 
the second major difference between the two statutes is that calea text and structure suggest that its definitions for telecommunications carrier and information services are not mutually exclusive terms.unlike the act,calea does not refer to a telecommunications service,nor does its definition of telecommunications carrier include a reference to a service offering.moreover,calea definition of a telecommunications carrier unlike the act definition of that entities only insofar as they are engaged in providing information services.id.c i emphasis added.these distinctions suggest that calea does not define two mutually exclusive services that are independently offered to consumers.that is,under calea,a carrier might offer one service that contains both telecommunications and information components.
ace argument to the contrary relies on the fact that information services,by statutory definition,are delivered via telecommunications under both calea and the telecom act.see calea a defining information services as the offering of a capability for generating,acquiring,storing,transforming,processing,retrieving,utilizing,or making available information via telecommunications telecom act same.in ace view,the via telecommunications clause makes the telecommunications and information components of an informational service offering inseparable under both statutes.that is,once the telecommunications dimension of an information service is removed,the definition of the latter term becomes a nullity.as a result,ace argues,we should interpret calea to create two mutually exclusive categories of telecommunications and information services,which can never overlap.
ace analysis is inconsistent with our standard of review.we can not set aside the commission reasonable interpretation of the act in favor of an alternatively plausible or an even better one.see,brand x.at if a statute is ambiguous,and if the implementing agency construction is reasonable,chevron requires a federal court to accept the agency construction of the statute,even if the agency reading differs from what the court believes is the best statutory interpretation.citizens coal council norton,even assuming the correctness of an alternative interpretation,the ambiguity of the statute in combination with the chevron doctrine eclipses the ability of the courts to substitute their preferred interpretation for an agency reasonable interpretation when that agency is the entity authorized to administer the statute in question.mining ass babbitt,if we were interpreting the statute de novo,we might well agree that appellant has the better argument.but we are not.and although the government reading is a bit of a stretch,we think it passes the chevron test.the fcc offered a reasonable interpretation of calea,and chevron second step requires nothing more.
we hasten to emphasize the continued vitality of calea exclusion.as the commission explained 
a broadband internet access service provider continues to have no calea obligations with respect to,for example,the storage functions of its service,its and domain name system,or dns lookup functions or any other internet service provider,or isp functionality of its internet access service.it is only the switching and transmission component of its service that is subject to calea under our finding today.
order,emphasis in original and footnote omitted.because calea definitions for telecommunications and information service are not mutually exclusive,the commission reasonably concluded that mixed as broadband internet partially covered by and partially excluded from the statute the switching and transmission portion of a broadband service replaces the switching or transmission portion of a internet covered,while any capability for generating,acquiring,storing,transforming,processing,retrieving,utilizing,or making available information via telecommunications,a,is not.
the commission has long distinguished between information services and the underlying telecommunications that transport them.see,amendment of section of the commission rules regulations second computer inquiry,universal service report,wl calea second report order,wl services bundling order,wl section remand order,wl wireline broadband order,the fcc reasonably applied that distinction to give meaning to both the srp and the exclusion in the context of broadband providers.accordingly,we deny the petition for review.
ace next argues that the commission arbitrarily and capriciously refused to classify voip as either a telecommunications service or an information service.pet.br.at.at oral argument,ace counsel clarified that it is not challenging the merits of voip classification in one category or the other ace argues only that the commission must classify it.see tr.of oral arg.at.we need not tarry long over this claim.
as we explained above,calea says nothing about telecommunications service s.to the extent ace and its fellow petitioners confusedly petitioned the commission to mis classify voip in relation to a nonexistent statutory term,the fcc did not err by declining the invitation.moreover,ace ignores the fact that the commission did classify voip providers as telecommunications carriers,see order,while specifically excluding the portions of voip from the definition of information services,see id.regardless of the merits of that ace does not one can deny that the commission made it.
ace third and final argument focuses on a single word in a single sentence in a single footnote from the order.the commission noted to the extent that private networks are interconnected with a public network,either the public voice network or the internet,providers of the facilities that support the connection of the private network to a public network are subject to calea under the srp.order,emphasis added.relying on language from the proposed rule,ace insists that the inclusion of the word support in the fcc final rule provides no real comfort for its fears that the commission will extend its regulatory authority throughout an entire private network.pet.br.at.
although ace argument suggests the point is not necessarily,it should go without saying that a proposed rule is not a final rule.it should be equally obvious that a challenge to the commission possible future applications or extensions of calea does not ripen by virtue of a petitioner unfounded fears.see,fed.express mineta,holding if and when the petitioner fear does come to pass,judicial review of the issue is likely to stand on a much surer footing in the context of a specific application of this regulation than could be the case in the framework of the generalized challenge made here.quoting toilet goods ass n,gardner,d atl.states legal found.epa,holding a speculative fear about possible future agency action does not present a case or controversy ripe for review.the order on excludes private networks from its reach.see order,b b.if and when the commission expands its interpretation,an aggrieved party can bring a petition for review at that time.
for the reasons set forth above,the petition for review is 
regardless of how serious the problem an administrative agency seeks to address it may not exercise its authority in a manner that is inconsistent with the administrative structure that congress enacted into law.

the communications assistance for law enforcement act calea sets forth assistance capability requirements,compelling telecommunications carriers to build and sustain their equipment in a manner that allows law enforcement agents to execute surveillance orders.importantly,for purposes of this case,the statute 
explicitly states that telecommunications carrier s do not include persons or entities insofar as they are engaged in providing information services,c i,
defines information services as the offering of a capability for generating,acquiring,storing,transforming,processing,retrieving,utilizing,or making available information via telecommunications,id.a,and 
expressly states that the assistance capability requirements do not apply to information services,id.b a.
in determining that broadband internet providers are subject to calea as telecommunications carriers,and not excluded pursuant to the information services exemption,the commission apparently forgot to read the words of the statute.calea does not give the fcc unlimited authority to regulate every telecommunications service that might conceivably be used to assist law enforcement.quite the contrary.section is precise and limited in its scope.it expressly states that the statute assistance capability requirements do not apply to information services.id.broadband internet is an information service inde
