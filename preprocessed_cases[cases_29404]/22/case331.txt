in,congress altered the longstanding ban on propensity evidence in criminal trials so that,in trials for sexual assault,similar conduct is admissible for its bearing on any matter to which it is relevant.this appeal asks how this modification affects a district court analysis under,the provision excluding evidence that is relevant under rule but unduly prejudicial.
the government wants to use rule evidence against stephen rogers in his trial for attempting to entice a minor to engage in sexual activity and for using the internet to attempt to transfer obscene material to a minor.the prosecutors therefore offered for admission two instances of similar conduct a illinois conviction for solicitation of a minor,and sexually explicit internet conversations rogers had with a girl in.the district court excluded the evidence under rule and the government appeals.because the record causes us to doubt whether the district court fully appreciated the legal relation between rules and,we reverse its exclusion of the evidence and remand for a new determination.
rogers has an unfortunate habit of chatting with minor girls on the internet.in,he used the internet to initiate chats with a girl in wisconsin.in addition to frequently raising the topic of sex,rogers encouraged the girl to send him pictures of herself,which she did.these pictures included a closely cropped picture of the genitalia and a picture of her naked breasts.in addition,rogers repeatedly urged the girl to meet him for a sexual encounter.as a result of this conduct,the government charged rogers with knowingly receiving child pornography,in violation of a a,and persuading a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing child porn,in violation of a.
in,rogers again used the internet to strike up a conversation with someone whom he believed was a minor girl this time,however,he was chatting with a police officer pretending to be a girl named emily.over the course of two months,rogers used email and instant messenger to persuade emily to meet him for sex.rogers arranged dates,times,and places to meet,but he never showed up at any of the arranged meetings.he continued,however,to have sexually explicit communications with emily.he also emailed emily a cell phone picture of a hand holding an erect penis.for this conduct,the government charged rogers with attempting to entice a minor to engage in sexual activity,b,and using the internet to attempt to transfer obscene material to a minor.
rogers has one prior conviction for using the internet to persuade someone whom he believed was a minor to have sex.in,rogers initiated a conversation with loren,a police officer pretending to be a girl.rogers arranged to meet loren at her house for sex,and the police arrested rogers as he walked toward the address supplied by the officer.rogers pleaded guilty in state court to indecent solicitation of a child in violation of ilcs.
in the to rogers trial for his and conduct,the government filed a motion to admit evidence of the conviction.during a hearing on january,the district court orally denied the motion.the judge found that,while the conviction falls within rule,the danger of unfair prejudice to rogers from inferences based on his propensity to commit this sort of crime substantially outweighs the minimal probative value of the conviction.the court commented that the conviction creates exactly the kind of concern that propensity evidence is always worried about,and then ruled that it would exclude the conviction under rule.
after this decision,the government filed a superseding indictment that charged the four counts discussed above.the latest indictment added the count based on new information provided by the wisconsin minor.in response,rogers asked the court to bifurcate the trial he wanted one proceeding for his interactions with the girl and one for his interactions with emily.the district court granted his request.the government then filed its second rule motion,asking the court to admit evidence of both his conviction and the conduct relating to rogers interactions with the wisconsin girl.in that motion,it took the position that the conduct fell within the definition of an offense of sexual assault provided by rule d and,insofar as it went beyond the mere sending of pictures and included concrete attempts to meet the minor for purposes of sexual intercourse.the conduct,it argued,thus involved attempted sexual contact with a minor and qualified as conduct proscribed by chapter of title,united states code.see doe smith,cir.the government made a similar argument with respect to the conduct underlying the conviction.
during a hearing on february,the district court denied this second rule motion.this time,the district court found that the conduct failed to qualify as an offense of sexual assault under rule because the wisconsin minor willingly participated in the conversations.alternatively,the district court found that the danger from propensity inferences substantially outweighed the minimal probative value and excluded the evidence under rule.invoking this court jurisdiction over an interlocutory appeal by the united states from a decision to exclude evidence,see,the government appeals the exclusion of both the conviction and the conduct with the minor.
the government challenges the court decisions on two grounds first,with respect to the conduct,it argues that the district court erred by interpreting offense of sexual assault to exclude attempted,sexual contact with a minor and second,with respect to both of its proffers,it argues that the district court abused its discretion by excluding the evidence under rule because it failed to recognize that rule reversed the presumption that prior crimes pose a danger of unfair prejudice from propensity inferences.we review a district court interpretation of the rules of evidence de novo and we review its decision to admit or exclude evidence for abuse of discretion.united states leshore,cir.
rule a reads as follows 
in a criminal case in which the defendant is accused of an offense of sexual assault,evidence of the defendant commission of another offense or offenses of sexual assault is admissible,and may be considered for its bearing on any matter to which it is relevant.
two criteria must be satisfied for this rule to apply first,the defendant must be accused of an offense of sexual assault,and second,the prior act must be an offense of sexual assault.rule d defines an offense of sexual assault to include both any conduct proscribed by chapter of title.d,and an attempt to engage in either contact,without consent,between any part of the defendant body or an object and the genitals or anus of another person or contact,without consent,between the genitals or anus of the defendant and any part of another person body.d.nobody disputes that the first criterion is met the government charged rogers with an attempt to entice a minor to engage in sexual activity.and nobody disputes that the second criterion is satisfied for the conviction,as rogers pleaded guilty to knowingly soliciting a person he believed to be a minor to perform an act of sexual penetration.see ilcs.
the first question we must address is whether the district court correctly found that the conduct does not qualify as an offense of sexual assault because there was no contact,without consent.the court did not rely directly on rule d,which may have obviated the need for the focus on consent.as we noted in doe smith,supra,b y,chapter of title forbids both sexual acts and sexual contact with a minor,as well as attempts to do either of these things.at.consent does not play a role in the statutory definition of either of sexual acts or sexual contact.see and.neither party has made anything of this point,however,and so we proceed to consider the appeal as it has been presented to us.
to reach this conclusion,the district court interpreted consent to mean literal consent rather than legal consent.under this interpretation,an attempt to have sex with a minor could be consensual for the purpose of rule if the minor willingly participated.looking at rogers conversations with the gi
