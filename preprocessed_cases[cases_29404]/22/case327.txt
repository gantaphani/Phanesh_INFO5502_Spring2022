david,mary,and lisa blockowicz received an injunction ordering joseph david williams and michelle ramey to remove defamatory comments they posted about the blockowiczs on ror,among other websites.williams and ramey never responded to the injunction,prompting the blockowiczs to contact the websites on which the statements were posted to secure compliance with the injunction.every website complied,except for ror.the blockowiczs asked the district court that issued the injunction to enforce it against xcentric ventures,llc,xcentric the host of ror,and ed magedson,the website manager,pursuant to rule d c.the district court declined,and the blockowiczs appeal the district court decision.they argue that xcentric and magedson fit within rule d c,and thus should be bound by the injunction,because they had actual notice of the injunction,and they were in active concert or participation with the defendants in violating the injunction by failing to remove the defamatory statements.we affirm xcentric and magedson were not in active concert or participation with the defendants pursuant to rule d c.
background 
the blockowiczs filed a civil suit against williams and ramey the defendants on june,alleging defamation per se based on statements regarding one or more of the blockowiczs that the defendants allegedly posted on ror and other websites.two of the statements at issue were posted in the third was posted in.after the defendants failed to respond,the district court entered a default judgment and issued a permanent injunction that required the defendants to remove the defamatory statements from ror,among other websites.the blockowiczs sent notice of the injunction via email to an email address believed to belong to the defendants.the record does not confirm who owns the email account,but the blockowiczs assert that the defendants implicitly acknowledged receipt by posting comments on the internet related to the lawsuit.the defendants never responded to or complied with the injunction.so the blockowiczs contacted the operators of the websites on which the defendants posted the defamatory statements and requested that they remove the statements from their respective websites.every website complied,except for ror.

the blockowiczs eventually filed a motion for third party enforcement of injunction,asking the district court to compel xcentric to remove the defamatory postings by enforcing the injunction against xcentric and magedson pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure d c,in spite of the fact that xcentric and magedson were not parties to the suit that resulted in the injunction.rule d c authorizes courts to enforce injunctions against third parties who have actual notice of the injunction,and who are in active concert or participation with the parties who are bound by the injunction.xcentric contested the blockowiczs motion.the district court held that rule d c did not authorize it to enforce the injunction against xcentric and magedson.the blockowiczs timely appeal.
ii.analysis 
personal jurisdiction defense is waived 
xcentric and magedson argue that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over them.but even when a valid personal jurisdiction defense exists,the defense is waived if the objecting party fails to timely raise it.h ins.of,compagnie des bauxites de guinee,or if the objecting party proceeds to litigate the case on its merits,see cont l bank,meyer,cir.
in its initial response to the blockowiczs motion to enforce the injunction against xcentric and magedson,xcentric wrote that it contests that the district court has personal jurisdiction over it and does not waive any arguments it has pursuant to.b.even if this footnote adequately raised their defense,xcentric and magedson waived it by participating in the district court proceedings,which included both briefing and oral arguments addressing the merits of the blockowiczs claim.see meyer,at the defendants did raise the defense in their answer,and therefore the waiver provided for by rule h did not occur.however,the privileged defenses referred to in rule h may be waived by formal submission in a cause,or by submission through conduct.internal quotation marks and citations omitted echo,whitson,cir the parties consented to personal jurisdiction simply by participating in the proceedings before the district court without protest.other than their one footnote,we find no indication in the record that xcentric or magedson ever pursued their personal jurisdiction defense before this appeal.their defense is waived.
xcentric and magedson are not bound by the injunction pursuant to rule d 
as a preliminary issue,we note that the blockowiczs motion asked the district court to enforce the injunction against third parties xcentric and magedson.at the core of their case below and on appeal,the blockowiczs argue that xcentric and magedson assisted the defendants in violating the injunction.accordingly,we view this case as one for contempt,the usual context for enforcing injunctions against third parties who assist enjoined parties in violating an injunction.see regal knitwear,successors and assigns may,however,be instrumentalities through which defendant seeks to evade an order or may come within the description of persons in active concert or participation with them in the violation of an injunction.if they are,by that fact they are brought within scope of contempt proceedings by the rules of civil procedure.illinois dep t of health human,cir rule d is a codification of the rule allowing a to be held in contempt for violating the terms of an injunction when a is legally identified with the defendant or when the aids or abets a violation of an injunction.whether we consider this a suit for contempt or simply a motion to enforce an injunction against third parties,however,our analysis under rule d c is the same
