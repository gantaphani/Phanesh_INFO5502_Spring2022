appellant explorica,explorica and several of its employees challenge a preliminary injunction issued against them for alleged violations of the computer fraud and abuse act cfaa,we affirm the district court conclusion that appellees will likely succeed on the merits of their cfaa claim,but rest on a narrower basis than the court below.
background 
explorica was formed in to compete in the field of global tours for high school students.several of explorica employees formerly were employed by appellee ef,which has been in business for more than years.ef and its partners and subsidiaries make up the world largest private student travel organization.
shortly after the individual defendants left ef in the beginning of,explorica began competing in the teenage tour market.the company vice president and former vice president of information strategy at ef,philip gormley,envisioned that explorica could gain a substantial advantage over all other student tour companies,and especially ef,by undercutting ef already competitive prices on student tours.gormley considered several ways to obtain and utilize ef prices by manually keying in the information from ef brochures and other printed materials by using a scanner to record that same information or,by manually searching for each tour offered through ef website.ultimately,however,gormley engaged zefer,explorica internet consultant,to design a computer program called a scraper to glean all of the necessary information from ef website.zefer designed the program in three days.
the scraper has been likened to a robot,a tool that is extensively used on the internet.robots are used to gather information for countless purposes,ranging from compiling results for search engines such as to filtering for inappropriate content.the widespread deployment of robots enables global internet users to find comprehensive information quickly and almost effortlessly.
like a robot,the scraper sought information through the internet.unlike other robots,however,the scraper focused solely on ef website,using information that other robots would not have.specifically,zefer utilized tour codes whose significance was not readily understandable to the public.with the tour codes,the scraper accessed ef website repeatedly and easily obtained pricing information for those specific tours.the scraper sent more than inquiries to ef website and recorded the pricing information into a spreadsheet 
zefer ran the scraper program twice,first to retrieve the tour prices and then the prices.all told,the scraper downloaded lines of data,the equivalent of eight telephone directories of information once zefer scraped all of the prices,it sent a spreadsheet containing ef pricing information to explorica,which then systematically undercut ef prices explorica thereafter printed its own brochures and began competing in ef tour market.
the development and use of the scraper came to light about a year and a half later during litigation regarding appellant olsson departure from appellee efice.ef then filed this action,alleging violations of the cfaa the copyright act of,the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act,and various related state laws.it sought a preliminary injunction barring explorica and zefer from using the scraper program and demanded the return of all materials generated through use of the scraper.
on may,the district court granted a preliminary injunction against explorica based on the cfaa,which criminally and civilly prohibits certain access to computers.see a.the court found that ef would likely prove that explorica violated the cfaa when it used ef website in a manner outside the reasonable expectations of both ef and its ordinary users.the court also concluded that ef could show that it suffered a loss,as required by the statute,consisting of reduced business,harm to its goodwill,and the cost of diagnostic measures it incurred to evaluate possible harm to ef systems,although it could not show that explorica actions physically damaged its computers.in a supplemental opinion the district court further articulated its reasonable expectations standard and explained that copyright,contractual and technical restraints sufficiently notified explorica that its use of a scraper would be unauthorized and thus would violate the cfaa.
the district court first relied on ef use of a copyright symbol on one of the pages of its website and a link directing users with questions to contact the company finding that such a clear statement should have dispelled any notion a reasonable person may have had that the presumption of open access applied to information on ef website.the court next found that the manner by which explorica accessed ef website likely violated a confidentiality agreement between appellant gormley and ef,because gormley provided to zefer technical instructions concerning the creation of the scraper.finally,the district court noted without elaboration that the scraper bypassed technical restrictions embedded in the website to acquire the information.the court therefore let stand its earlier decision granting the preliminary injunction.appellants contend that the district court erred in taking too narrow a view of what is authorized under the cfaa and similarly mistook the reach of the confidentiality agreement.appellants also argue that the district court erred in finding that appellees suffered a loss,as defined by the cfaa,and that the preliminary injunction violates the first amendment.
ii.standard of review 
a district court may issue a preliminary injunction only upon considering the likelihood of success on the merits the potential for irreparable harm if the injunction is denied the balance of relevant impositions and the effect if any of the court ruling on the public interest.ross simons of warwick,baccarat,cir.appellants challenge only the district court finding that appellees are likely to succeed on the merits,and we thus confine our review to that factor.as in any other appeal,we review the merits of a preliminary injunction depending on the issue under consideration.generally speaking,pure issues of law,the construction of a statute are reviewed de novo,findings of fact for clear error,and judgment calls with considerable deference langlois abington hous,cir.each of these is applicable here,where the district court judgment relied on both its analysis of the cfaa and its assessment of the voluminous documentary evidence.
iii.the computer fraud and abuse act 
although appellees alleged violations of three provisions of the cfaa,the district court found that they were likely to succeed only under section a that section provides 
whoever knowingly and with intent to defraud,accesses a protected computer without authorization,or exceeds authorized access,and by means of such conduct furthers the intended fraud and obtains anything of value shall be punished.
appellees allege that the appellants knowingly and with intent to defraud accessed the server hosting ef website more than times to obtain proprietary pricing and tour information,and confidential information about appellees technical abilities.at the heart of the parties dispute is whether appellants actions either were without authorization or exceed ed authorized access as defined by the cfaa we conclude that because of the broad confidentiality agreement appellants actions exceed ed authorized access,and so we do not reach the more general arguments made about statutory meaning,including whether use of a scraper alone renders access unauthorized 
exceeds authorized access 
congress defined exceeds authorized access,as accessing a computer with authorization and using such access to obtain or alter information in the computer that the accesser is not entitled so to obtain or alter.e.ef is likely to prove such excessive access based on the confidentiality agreement between gormley and ef.pertinently,that agreement provides 
employee agrees to maintain in strict confidence and not to disclose to any third party,either orally or in writing,any confidential or proprietary information and never to at any time i directly or indirectly publish,disseminate or oth
