plaintiff gina holmes appeals from the judgment entered in favor of defendants petrovich development company,llc and paul petrovich in her lawsuit for sexual harassment,retaliation,wrongful termination,violation of the right to privacy,and intentional infliction of emotional distress she contends that the trial court erred in granting defendants motion for summary adjudication with respect to the causes of action for discrimination,retaliation,and wrongful termination,and that the jury verdict as to the remaining causes of action must be reversed due to evidentiary and instructional errors.we disagree and shall affirm the judgment.
among other things,we conclude that sent by holmes to her attorney regarding possible legal action against defendants did not constitute confidential communication between client and lawyer within the meaning of evidence code section.this is so because holmes used a computer of defendant company to send the even though she had been told of the company policy that its computers were to be used only for company business and that employees were prohibited from using them to send or receive personal,she had been warned that the company would monitor its computers for compliance with this company policy and thus might inspect all files and messages at any time,and she had been explicitly advised that employees using company computers to create or maintain personal information or messages have no right of privacy with respect to that information or message.
as we will explain,an communication does not lose its privileged character for the sole reason that it is communicated by electronic means or because persons involved in the delivery,facilitation,or storage of electronic communication may have access to the content of the communication,subd.b.however,the sent via company computer under the circumstances of this case were akin to consulting her lawyer in her employer conference room,in a loud voice,with the door open,so that any reasonable person would expect that their discussion of her complaints about her employer would be overheard by him.by using the company computer to communicate with her lawyer,knowing the communications violated company computer policy and could be discovered by her employer due to company monitoring of usage,holmes did not communicate in confidence by means which,so far as the client is aware,discloses the information to no third persons other than those who are present to further the interest of the client in the consultation or those to whom disclosure is reasonably necessary for the transmission of the information or the accomplishment of the purpose for which the lawyer is consulted.consequently,the communications were not privileged.
holmes began working for petrovich as his executive assistant in early june.
the employee handbook,which holmes admitted reading and signing,contained provisions clearly spelling out the policy concerning use of the company technology resources,such as computers and accounts.the handbook directs employees that the company technology resources should be used only for company business and that employees are prohibited from sending or receiving personal.moreover,the handbook warns that e mployees who use the company technology resources to create or maintain personal information or messages have no right of privacy with respect to that information or message.the internet and intranet usage policy in the handbook specifically states,is not private communication,because others may be able to read or access the message.may best be regarded as a postcard rather than as a sealed letter the handbook spells out further that the company may inspect all files or messages at any time for any reason at its discretion and that it would periodically monitor its technology resources for compliance with the company policy.
the handbook also set forth the company policy regarding harassment and discrimination.it directs an employee who thinks that he or she has been subjected to harassment or discrimination to immediately report it to petrovich or cheryl petrovich,who was the company secretary and handled some human resources functions.if the complaining party is not comfortable reporting the conduct to them,the report should be made to the company controller.the policy promises that the complaint will be taken seriously,it will be investigated thoroughly,and there will be no retaliation.the policy also urges the employee,when possible,to confront the person who is engaging in the unwanted conduct and ask the person to stop it.
the next month,july of,holmes told petrovich that she was pregnant and that her due date was december.petrovich recalled that holmes told him she planned to work up until her due date and then would be out on maternity leave for six weeks.
holmes did not like it when coworkers asked her questions about maternity leave she thought such comments were inappropriate.she asked t hat little group of hens to stop,and they complied.holmes recalled having about six conversations with petrovich about her pregnancy,during which they discussed her belly getting big and baby names.she thought comments were inappropriate,but never told petrovich that he was being offensive.
on friday morning,august,petrovich sent holmes an discussing various topics,including that they needed to determine how they were going to handle getting a qualified person to help in the office who would be up to speed while holmes was on maternity leave.he explained that,given his schedule and pace,this would not be a simple task.thus,they needed to coordinate the transition so neither he nor holmes would be stressed about it before or after holmes left on maternity leave.petrovich stated my recollection from the email you sent me when you told me you were pregnant and in our subsequent conversations,you are due around december and will be out six weeks.we are usually swamped between now and the third week of december.the good news is between the third week of december to the second week of january,it slows down a little.
holmes petrovich a few hours later and advised him that she estimated starting her maternity leave around november,and that the time estimate of six weeks might not be accurate as she could be out for the maximum time allowed by the employee handbook and california law,which is four months.she did not expect to be gone for the full four months but thought she should mention it as a possibility.holmes believed that leslie was capable of picking up most of the slack while holmes was gone,and that the company could hire a temp just to cover some of the receptionist duties so that leslie could be more available 
a short time later,petrovich responded,i need some honesty.how pregnant were you when you interviewed with me and what happened to six weeks leslie is not and can not cover your position,nor can a temp.that is an extreme hardship on me,my business and everybody else in the company.you have rights for sure and i am not going to do anything to violate any laws,but i feel taken advantage of and deceived for sure.
holmes replied that she thought the subject was better handled in person,but here it goes anyway.i find it offensive that you feel i was dishonest or deceitful.i wrote a very detailed email explaining my pregnancy as soon as the tests from my amniocentesis came back that everything was normal with the baby.an amnio can not be performed until you are nearly months pregnant,hence the delay in knowing the results.i am years old,and therefore,there was a chance that there could be something wrong or abnormal with the baby.if there had been,i had decided not to carry the baby to term.that is a very personal choice,and not something that i wanted to have to share with people at work so in order to avoid that,i waited until i knew that everything was before telling anyone i was pregnant.i also had miscarriages at months into my pregnancy,and could not bear having to share that with again,as i have in the past.these are very important and personal decisions that i made.i feel that i have the right to make these decisions,and there is no deceipt sic or dishonesty involved with this.on a more professional level there is no requirement in a job interview or application to divulge if you are pregnant or not in fact,i believe it considered unethical to even inquire as to such.at this point,i feel that your words have put us in a bad position where our working relationship is concerned,and i do know if we can get past it.as long as we being straightforward with each other,please just tell me if what you are wanting at this time,is for me to not be here anymore,because that is how it feels.i need to go home and gather my thoughts.
because he was concerned that holmes might be quitting,petrovich forwarded their exchange to cheryl petrovich lisa montagnino,who handled some human resources functions counsel bruce stewart and jennifer myers,who handled payroll and maintained employee files.
petrovich also holmes as follows all i ever want is for people to be honest with me.the decision is all yours as to whether you stay here.i am not asking for your resignation.i do have the right to express my feelings,so i ca help it if you feel offended if the dates and amount of time you told me you would be out on maternity leave no longer apply.i also never asked you about you being pregnant in our interview,so you mentioning unethical behavior is out of place.i think you are missing the whole point here.i am trying to keep my business organized and i was working off information you told me.when you disclosed,only upon me asking,that what you told me is incorrect and that you had already decided on a maternity leave date without ever informing me,i have the right to question the information and not be subject to being quoted california law or my own handbook.you obviously are well versed on all of this which speaks volumes.no,you are not fired.yes,you are required to be straight with your employer.if you do not wish to remain employed here,i need to know immediately.
on monday morning,august,holmes sent an to petrovich,who was vacationing in montana.she explained that she had thought about things a lot over the weekend and felt that what occurred on friday could have been avoided if they had communicated in person.she enjoyed her employment and took it as a compliment that petrovich was worried about filling her shoes in her absence.holmes stated,i may only be gone weeks,but i do want to commit to that,because unforeseen circumstances can happen making my absence continue slightly longer.the max is months,and that is only if there are disability issues which i do anticipate in my case,but i wanted to give you the outside number,so you would be left with any surprises.i am happy about my pregnancy and happy about my job i like to feel good about continuing to work here,in a positive and supportive environment up until my maternity leave in november,and i would like to return shortly thereafter.if we are on the same page,please let me know.i will do whatever i can to accommodate you while i gone i can work from home,or come in a few hours a day i am very flexible and hope that we will be able to work out the bumps along the way.
petrovich replied that he agreed with holmes and saw things the way that she did.he stated,i agree we do need to communicate.i need to admit i was in shock when you told me you were pregnant so soon after you started work.right or wrong,i felt entrapped.it a no win for an employer.yes,i am happy for you,but it was building in me and i decide d to approach it by asking if your plans were still as represented.when everything got moved up,i felt even worse.i know i have no right to feel this way by law or as an employer,but i am human in a tough business where people are constantly trying to take advantage of me.remember what i said about loyalty in our interview the person closest to me in the office has been the person in your position.when this happened,it greatly upset me since i was hoping for the very best foundation for us since i have been pleased with your efforts and because it had been a while since i have found someone committed to do what is a tough job.it will take some time for me to get over it but i will and i want you to stay.it will work.
early the next morning,august,holmes replied,thank you paul.i understand your feelings,you understand mine let move forward in a positive direction,and remember,this too shall pass.she then discussed some business matters,said that everyone was thinking of petrovich and his family,and stated that norman and oliver say meow and woof 
at some point after she petrovich,holmes learned that petrovich had forwarded their regarding her pregnancy to cheryl petrovich,bruce stewart,lisa montagnino,and jennifer myers.although she never asked petrovich not to forward the to others,and she conceded the did not contain any language communicating that the information was to be kept private,holmes was very upset because she thought that it went without saying the should not be disseminated to others.
on august,holmes saw her doctor for routine obstetric care and complained about being harassed at work regarding her upcoming pregnancy disability.according to the doctor,holmes was moderately upset and somewhat tearful.he advised her that the best course of action would be to discuss the matter directly with her boss about how she feels and remedy the situation.if the harassment continued,then she might benefit from the assistance of a lawyer.
at on the same day that holmes saw her doctor and had petrovich that they could move forward in a positive direction,holmes used the company computer to an attorney,joanna mendoza.holmes asked for a referral to an attorney specializing in labor law,specifically relating to pregnancy discrimination.when mendoza asked what was going on,holmes replied that her boss was making it unbearable for her.he said things that were upsetting and hurtful,and had forwarded personal about her pregnancy to others in the office.holmes stated,i know that there are laws that protect pregnant women from being treated differently due to their pregnancy,and now that i am officially working in a hostile environment,i feel i need to find out what rights,if any,and what options i have.i do want to quit my job but how do i make the situation better.holmes explained that her boss had accused her of being dishonest because she underestimated her maternity leave,that he had forwarded a personal and made it common reading material for employees,and that he had made her feel like an outcast.holmes forwarded to mendoza a few of petrovich.
at on the same day,mendoza holmes that she should delete their communications from her work computer because her employer might claim a right to access it.mendoza suggested they needed to talk and,while they could talk on the phone,she would love an excuse to see holmes and catch up on everything.mendoza stated they could meet for lunch the next day.holmes agreed and said she would come to mendoza law office,at which time mendoza could see her big belly.
on the evening of august,after her lunch with mendoza,holmes petrovich saying that holmes had been upset since his first on friday.she had been in tears,her stomach was in knots,and she realized that they would be unable to put this issue behind us.she stated,i think you will understand that your feelings about my pregnancy which you have made more than clear,leave me no alternative but to end my employment here.holmes advised petrovich that she had cleared her things from her desk and would not be returning to work.holmes also jennifer myers stating that she was quitting and advising her where to send the final paycheck.
in september of,holmes filed a lawsuit against defendants,asserting causes of action for sexual harassment,retaliation,wrongful termination in violation of public policy,violation of the right to privacy,and intentional infliction of emotional distress.she alleged that the negative comments in petrovich and his dissemination of her,which contained highly personal information,invaded her privacy,were intended to cause her great emotional distress,and caused her to quit her job to avoid the abusive and hostile work environment created by her employer.according to holmes,petrovich disseminated the to retaliate against her for inconveniencing him with her pregnancy and to cause her to quit.holmes claimed she was constructively terminated in that continuing her employment with petrovich became untenable,as it would have been for any reasonable pregnant woman.
on november,defendants filed a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication on the ground that,as a matter of law,holmes could not establish any of her causes of action.defendants argued holmes could not establish that there was an objectively or subjectively hostile work environment that she suffered an adverse employment action in retaliation for her pregnancy that she suffered an adverse employment action that would cause a reasonable person to quit that holmes had a reasonable expectation of privacy in her or that petrovich conduct was extreme and outrageous.
the trial court granted the motion for summary adjudication as to three of the causes of action.the court ruled that,although there was evidence that holmes subjectively perceived her workplace as hostile or abusive,there must also be evidence that the work environment was objectively offensive.the undisputed brief,isolated,exchanges between her and petrovich,and others in the office,could not be objectively found to have been severe enough or sufficiently pervasive to alter the conditions of her employment and create a hostile or abusive work environment based upon her pregnancy.as for holmes claims for retaliation and constructive discharge,there was no evidence she experienced an adverse employment action,and no evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could find that petrovich intentionally created or knowingly permitted working conditions that were so intolerable or aggravated at the time of holmes resignation that a reasonable employer would realize that a reasonable person in her position would be compelled to resign.
the trial court denied the motion for summary adjudication as to the causes of action for invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress.the court ruled that,despite holmes use of to communicate private information to petrovich,and despite the company policy regarding the nonprivate nature of electronic communications,triable issues of fact remained regarding whether petrovich dissemination of the information to other people in the office breached holmes right to privacy or whether the disclosure was privileged and that issues of fact remained concerning whether the disclosure was egregious and outrageous.
the trial of those two causes of action resulted in a defense verdict.
discussion 
holmes contends the trial court erred in granting defendants motion for summary adjudication on her causes of action for sexual harassment,retaliation,and constructive discharge.
a motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.legal questions are considered de novo on appeal.unisys california life health ins.guarantee th.however,we must presume the judgment is correct,and the appellant bears the burden of demonstrating error.howard thrifty drug discount stores cal th.
viewing holmes specific contentions within the context of the appropriate legal framework,we find no error.
first,holmes contends the trial court erred in granting summary adjudication with respect to her cause of action for sexual harassment.
the fair employment and housing act feha makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer,because of sex,to harass an employee,subd.j.under feha,harassment because of sex includes sexual harassment,gender harassment,and harassment based on pregnancy,childbirth,or related medical conditions,subd.j c.
there are two theories upon which sexual harassment may be alleged quid pro quo harassment,where a term of employment is conditioned upon submission to unwelcome sexual advances and hostile work environment,where the harassment is sufficiently pervasive so as to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive work environment.mogilefsky superior court th.holmes pursued the latter.
to prevail on a claim of hostile work environment sexual harassment,an employee must demonstrate that he or she was subjected to sexual advances,conduct,or comments that were unwelcome,because of sex,and sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of his or her employment and create an abusive work environment.lyle warner brothers television productions cal th,hereafter lyle.
w hether an environment is hostile or abusive can be determined only by looking at all the circumstances including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct its severity whether it is physically threatening or humiliating,or a mere offensive utterance and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee work performance.citation.citation.therefore,to establish liability in a feha hostile work environment sexual harassment case,a plaintiff employee must show she was subjected to sexual advances,conduct,or comments that were severe enough or sufficiently pervasive to alter the conditions of her employment and create a hostile or abusive work environment.lyle,supra,cal th at original italics.with respect to the pervasiveness of harassment,courts have held an employee generally can not recover for harassment that is occasional,isolated,sporadic,or trivial rather,the employee must show a concerted pattern of harassment of a repeated,routine,or a generalized nature.ibid.
to be actionable,a sexually objectionable environment must be both objectively and subjectively offensive,one that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive,and one that the victim in fact did perceive to be so.citations.that means a plaintiff who subjectively perceives the workplace as hostile or abusive will not prevail under the feha,if a reasonable person in the plaintiff position,considering all the circumstances,would not share the same perception.likewise,a plaintiff who does not perceive the workplace as hostile or abusive will not prevail,even if it objectively is so.lyle,supra,cal th at italics added.
relying on lyle,the trial court found that,although holmes subjectively perceived her workplace as hostile,it was not an abusive environment from an objective standpoint as a matter of law.holmes claims the trial court erred in relying on lyle because the facts in that case are distinguishable.but the trial court did not grant petrovich motion based on a factual comparison to lyle it simply used the standard of review established therein as it was required to do,and as are we,under principles of stare decisis.auto equity sales,superior court of santa clara cal d.
holmes contends the proper standard in sexual harassment cases is whether a reasonable woman would consider the work environment a hostile one and,hence,the standard in pregnancy discrimination cases should be whether a reasonable pregnant woman would consider her work environment hostile.thus,holmes asserts,unless there was undisputed evidence that she was an unreasonable pregnant woman,it is oxymoronic that the lower court found the conduct at issue subjectively offensive but not objectively offensive to a reasonable pregnant woman in her position quite frankly,the issue of objectively offensive conduct should have been left to the trier of fact and not been a question of law for the judge to have decided,especially if it was clear that there was subjective offense and highly questionable conduct at issue.original italics.
holmes argument is not persuasive.an evaluation of all the circumstances surrounding holmes employment discloses an absence of evidence from which a reasonable jury could objectively find that petrovich created a hostile work environment for a reasonable pregnant woman.during the two months holmes worked for petrovich,there was no severe misconduct or pervasive pattern of harassment.holmes claims that her coworkers treated her differently based upon her pregnancy by asking about her maternity leave,but she admits that,when she asked them to stop,they complied.
holmes points to the she exchanged with petrovich on august and,in which he implied she had deceived him about her pregnancy,stated he was offended that she had changed the period of time she would be absent for maternity leave,and asserted that her pregnancy was an extreme hardship on his business.she also complains that petrovich unnecessarily forwarded to others her containing personal information about her age,prior miscarriages,and the possibility she would have terminated her pregnancy if the amniocentesis results had revealed problems with the fetus.holmes asserts that petrovich did this to humiliate her.petrovich said he sent the to counsel and employees involved in human relations because he thought that holmes was about to quit.
when viewed in context,the set forth at length,ante show nothing more than that petrovich made some critical comments due to the stress of being a small business owner who must accommodate a pregnant woman right to maternity leave.he recognized holmes legal rights,stated he would honor them,said he was not asking for her resignation,noted he had been pleased with her work,and simply expressed his feelings as a human in a tough business where people are constantly trying to take advantage of me.he assured holmes that it will work.rather than giving him a chance to honor his promise,holmes quit.
it appears holmes expects feha to be a civility code.it is not.lyle,supra,cal th at.as we stated above,there is no recovery for harassment that is occasional,isolated,sporadic,or trivial.id.at.rather,a plaintiff must show a concerted pattern of harassment that is repeated,routine,or generalized in nature.mokler county of orange th.holmes failed to do so.the isolated incidents to which she points are objectively insufficient.
holmes relies on three cases for the proposition that harassment need not be pervasive and may be established by only a few instances of conduct over a short period of time.she fails to recognize that harassment need not be pervasive if it is sufficiently severe enough to alter the conditions of employment.lyle,supra,cal th at the plaintiff must be subjected to conduct or comments severe enough or sufficiently pervasive to alter the conditions of her employment and create a hostile work environment.the cases upon which holmes relies are not remotely similar to her situation in that they all involve egregious and severe conduct that unquestionably was abusive.in hostetler quality dining,cir,the plaintiff harasser engaged in three incidents over a period of time he forced his tongue into her mouth,he attempted to kiss her again and to remove her bra,and he told her that he could perform oral sex so effectively he could make her do cartwheels.id.at.in erdmann tranquility d,a homosexual employee boss insisted that the employee become heterosexual,convert to the employer mormon faith,and lead the company prayer service.id.at.and in mayfield trevors store,inc,no.mhp wl,the employer not only made comments that made the plaintiff feel stigmatized due to her pregnancy,the employer also wrote negative performance evaluations,assigned the plaintiff large amounts of extra work,and denied her a sick day.
petrovich did not engage in any similarly egregious conduct,and he provided a nondiscriminatory explanation for his conduct.because holmes produced no evidence from which a reasonable jury could infer the existence of a hostile work environment,the trial court correctly granted the motion for summary adjudication on this cause of action.
next,holmes contends the court erred in granting the motion for summary adjudication on her cause of action for constructive discharge.according to holmes,she found the extreme stress associated with being out of work to be preferable to the treatment she was receiving at petrovich.this claim fares no better than her last.
constructive discharge occurs only when the employer coerces the employee resignation,either by creating working conditions that are intolerable under an objective standard,or by failing to remedy objectively intolerable working conditions that actually are known to the employer.mullins rockwell internat.cal th.the conditions prompting resignation must be sufficiently extraordinary and egregious to overcome the normal motivation of a competent,diligent,and reasonable employee to remain on the job.turner,cal th,hereafter turner,disapproved on other grounds by romano rockwell,cal th.the resignation must be coerced,not merely a rational option chosen by the employee.id.at.
from an objective standpoint,the trial court correctly granted summary adjudication.where a plaintiff fails to demonstrate the severe or pervasive harassment necessary to support a hostile work environment claim,it will be impossible for her to meet the higher standard of constructive discharge conditions so intolerable that a reasonable person would leave the job.brooks city of san mateo cir.as discussed above,holmes failed to present sufficient evidence of a hostile work environment.thus,her wrongful termination claim necessarily fails.jones department of corrections rehabilitation th,hereafter jones.
the trial court also granted summary adjudication on holmes cause of action for retaliation,ruling there was no evidence of an adverse employment action by petrovich.we agree.
holmes argues that she was subjected to negative comments and accusations about her pregnancy,followed by petrovich retaliatory conduct when she told him she planned to exercise her leave rights he retaliated by forwarding her sensitive personal information to others in the office,who had no reason to know about her prior miscarriages,amniocentesis,and potential termination of her pregnancy.
this is insufficient to establish an adverse employment action by petrovich.
an adverse employment action,which is a critical component of a retaliation claim jones,supra,th at,requires a substantial adverse change in the terms and conditions of the plaintiff employment.akers county of san diego th.a mere offensive utterance or a pattern of social slights by either the employer or coemployees can not properly be viewed as materially affecting the terms,conditions,or privileges of employment for purposes of the feha yanowitz usa,cal th,hereafter yanowitz.however,a series of alleged discriminatory acts must be considered collectively rather than individually in determining whether the overall employment action is adverse citations and,in the end,the determination of whether there was an adverse employment action is made on a basis,in light of the objective evidence.jones,supra,th at.
here,petrovich did not reduce holmes salary,benefits or work hours,and did not terminate her.he assured holmes that she still had a job and that they would work things out.holmes chose to quit because petrovich expressed his concerns about the changes in her pregnancy leave dates and the need to replace her while she was on leave,and because he forwarded an that she wished to keep private.but she failed to demonstrate there was a triable issue of fact concerning whether he did these things to retaliate against her she simply concluded that this was his motivation by taking out of context certain comments that he made.holmes overlooks her own evidence,submitted in opposition to defendants motion,which demonstrated that petrovich forwarded the only to people he believed needed to know that holmes had changed the anticipated date of her pregnancy leave and that she might be quitting.the fact that he forwarded her entire,rather than editing it or drafting a new one,does not demonstrate any animus toward her,given there was no clear directive in her that she did not wish others to see it.
more importantly,m inor or relatively trivial adverse actions or conduct by employers or fellow employees that,from an objective perspective,are reasonably likely to do no more than anger or upset an employee can not properly be viewed as materially affecting the terms,conditions,or privileges of employment and are not actionable yanowitz,supra,cal th at.that is what occurred here.a reasonable person would have talked to petrovich,expressed dismay at his actions,given him an opportunity to explain or apologize,and waited to see if conditions changed after the air had cleared.instead,holmes chose to quit despite petrovich assurances that he wanted her to stay and that things would work out.
for the reasons stated above,the trial court correctly granted defendants motion for summary adjudication 
holmes remaining claims of error all arise from an alleged violation of her privilege.
she contends the trial court abused its discretion in denying her motion demanding the return of privileged documents,permitting the introduction of the documents at trial,and giving a limiting instruction that undermined her cause of action for invasion of privacy.she argues that the cumulative prejudicial effect of these errors requires reversal of the judgment.
her arguments are premised on various statutes governing the privilege as follows 
evidence code section states in relevant part subject to section and except as otherwise provided in this article,the client,whether or not a party,has a privilege to refuse to disclose,and to prevent another from disclosing,a confidential communication between client and lawyer further section references are to the evidence code unless otherwise specified.
section provides that a confidential communication between client and lawyer is information transmitted between a client and his or her lawyer in the course of that relationship and in confidence by a means which,so far as the client is aware,discloses the information to no third persons other than those who are present to further the interest of the client in the consultation or those to whom disclosure is reasonably necessary for the transmission of the information or the accomplishment of the purpose for which the lawyer is consulted.
section states in relevant part a if a privilege is claimed on the ground that the matter sought to be disclosed is a communication made in confidence in the course of the relationship,the communication is presumed to have been made in confidence and the opponent of the claim of privilege has the burden of proof to establish that the communication was not confidential.b a communication does not lose its privileged character for the sole reason that it is communicated by electronic means or because persons involved in the delivery,facilitation,or storage of electronic communication may have access to the content of the communication 
section,subdivision a provides that the right of any person to claim a privilege is waived with respect to a communication protected by the privilege if any holder of the privilege,without coercion,has disclosed a significant part of the communication or has consented to disclosure made by anyone.consent to disclosure is manifested by any statement or other conduct of the holder of the privilege indicating consent to the disclosure,including failure to claim the privilege in any proceeding in which the holder has the legal standing and opportunity to claim the privilege.
with this statutory framework in mind,we turn to holmes specific contentions.
holmes argues the trial court erred in denying her motion for discovery sanctions,seeking return of the that she sent her attorney,joanna mendoza,using the company computer.we disagree.
during a deposition,defense counsel questioned holmes about her correspondence with her attorney.mendoza objected on the ground of privilege.
mendoza then wrote to defense counsel,kevin iams,demanded the return of the,and said she would seek a protective order if he refused.iams replied that holmes made a knowing waiver of the privilege when she communicated with counsel on the company system after being advised that her were not private.nevertheless,iams wrote,i recognize that this is not an area in which the law is settled what i propose as a resolution is a stipulated protective order whereby i and my clients will agree that we will not use the emails or facsimile copies in any deposition or court proceeding,unless we provide you written notice days in advance.this will allow us further time to meet and confer,obtain a further protective order,or if necessary,to seek the court intervention.
mendoza initially refused the proposed resolution,but then agreed.on may,iams wrote a confirmation letter stating that mendoza agreed to delay filing for a protective order pending a review of the proposed protective order that iams would draft,wherein he would agree not to use the documents in any deposition or court proceeding without first giving mendoza days written notice.the letter noted,however,that by entering into the protective order,neither side is waiving any arguments it may have regarding the appropriate use of the.stating that his schedule that week was hectic,iams said he would strive to have a draft of the protective order to mendoza by the end of the week for her review.
before iams drafted the stipulated protective order,attorney robin perkins substituted in as defendants counsel.thereafter,perkins used the in support of defendants motion for summary judgment.
holmes demanded that defendants withdraw the evidence,in accord with their agreement not to use it without prior notice.she submitted a declaration objecting to use of the,claiming they were privileged.
responding that the parties had never agreed not to utilize the,and that no protective order had ever been executed,defendants objected to holmes declaration that the were privileged.in defendants view,the declaration was improper lay opinion,and holmes had waived the privilege.they pointed out that holmes counsel specifically permitted defendants counsel to ask questions concerning the,stating if the only extent of your questions are going to be about this exchange,and you not going to go into a meeting that was had or any other communications with her attorney,and it not going to be considered a waiver of any of those communications,then i have no problem with it.italics added.
the trial court sustained defendants objections and did not exclude the evidence.
thereafter,holmes sought discovery sanctions for defendants failure to return the and for violating the agreement not to use them without affording holmes prior notice.
defendants opposed the motion on the grounds that the parties never reached a written stipulation holmes never filed a motion to compel,which meant the court had never ordered petrovich to return the documents and the court had already found that the use of the did not violate the privilege.
the court denied the motion for discovery sanctions,finding defendants had not engaged in any discovery abuse.it explained with respect to the that were submitted by defendants with the motion for summary,the court found plaintiff had waived privilege 
holmes contests this ruling,asserting no specific finding of waiver was made in connection with the motion for summary judgment because defendants objections to the claim of privilege were made on multiple grounds,and the court merely sustained the objection without specifying the basis for its ruling.thus,she argues,the court erred in relying on a nonexistent finding of waiver to deny the discovery sanctions motion.
holmes overlooks that judge shelleyanne chang presided over both the motion for summary judgment adjudication and the motion for discovery sanctions.we presume that judge chang knew the basis for her own ruling sustaining defendants objections in the first proceeding.hence,judge chang did not err in relying on her prior determination that holmes waived the privilege.furthermore,as we shall explain in the next section of the opinion,the were not privileged.
holmes asserts the court erred in overruling her motion in limine to prevent defendants from introducing the aforementioned at trial to show holmes did not suffer severe emotional distress,was only frustrated and annoyed,and filed the action at the urging of her attorney.
the court ruled that holmes using defendants company computer were not protected by the privilege because they were not private.
holmes argues that the court did not understand the proper application of section,and thus erred in allowing introduction of the evidence.according to holmes,the california legislature has already deemed the fact that a communication was made electronically to be irrelevant in determining whether a communication is confidential and therefore privileged.however,it is holmes,not the trial court,who misunderstands the proper application of section.
although a communication between persons in an relationship does not lose its privileged character for the sole reason that it is communicated by electronic means or because persons involved in the delivery,facilitation,or storage of electronic communication may have access to the content of the communication,subd.b,this does not mean that an electronic communication is privileged when the electronic means used belongs to the defendant the defendant has advised the plaintiff that communications using electronic means are not private,may be monitored,and may be used only for business purposes and the plaintiff is aware of and agrees to these conditions.a communication under these circumstances is not a confidential communication between client and lawyer within the meaning of section because it is not transmitted by a means which,so far as the client is aware,discloses the information to no third persons other than those who are present to further the interest of the client in the consultation ibid.
when holmes her attorney,she did not use her home computer to which some unknown persons involved in the delivery,facilitation,or storage may have access.had she done so,that would have been a privileged communication unless holmes allowed others to have access to her and disclosed their content.instead,she used defendants computer,after being expressly advised this was a means that was not private and was accessible by petrovich,the very person about whom holmes contacted her lawyer and whom holmes sued.this is akin to consulting her attorney in one of defendants conference rooms,in a loud voice,with the door open,yet unreasonably expecting that the conversation overheard by petrovich would be privileged.
holmes disagrees,but the decisions upon which she relies are of no assistance to her because they involve inapposite factual circumstances,such as fourth amendment searches and seizures by public or government employers quon arch wireless operating co,cir hereafter quon,reversed by city of ontario quon d,leventhal knapek cir convertino of justice d,or the use of a personal account accessed from an employer computer where the use of such an account was not clearly covered by the company policy and the contained a standard hallmark warning that the communications were personal,confidential,communications.stengart loving care agency.
the present case does not involve similar scenarios.holmes used her employer company account after being warned that it was to be used only for company business,that were not private,and that the company would randomly and periodically monitor its technology resources to ensure compliance with the policy.scott beth israel med.center,despite a statute similar to section,an privilege did not exist when a company computer was used to send,and the company policy prohibited the personal use of,warned that they were not private,and stated that they could be monitored.
holmes emphasizes that she believed her personal would be private because she utilized a private password to use the company computer and she deleted the after they were sent.however,her belief was unreasonable because she was warned that the company would monitor to ensure employees were complying with office policy not to use company computers for personal matters,and she was told that she had no expectation of privacy in any messages she sent via the company computer.likewise,simply because she held onto a copy of the fax,she had no expectation of privacy in documents she sent to her attorney using the company facsimile machine,a technology resource that,she was told,would be monitored for compliance with company policy not to use it for personal matters.
according to holmes,even though the company unequivocally informed her that employees who use the company computers to send personal have no right of privacy in the information sent because the company would periodically inspect all to ensure compliance with its policy against personal use of company computers,she nonetheless had a reasonable expectation that her personal to her attorney would be private because the operational reality was that there was no access or auditing of employee computers.citing quon,supra,reversed by city of ontario quon,supra,at d at.
in support of this contention,holmes claims she knew that her computer was password protected and that no one had asked for or knew her password,and the only person who had the ability to inspect the computers did not ever perform that task.this misrepresents the record in two respects.it is inaccurate to say only one person had the ability to monitor sent and received on company computers.the company controller,who had an administrative password giving her access to all sent by employees with private passwords,testified that the company it person as well as company owner cheryl petrovich also had such access to sent and received by company computers.and at no time during her testimony did holmes claim she knew for a fact that,contrary to its stated policy,the company never actually monitored computer.she simply said that,to her knowledge,no one did so.
in any event,holmes reliance on quon is misplaced.there,a police sergeant,jeff quon,sued his employer,the ontario police department,claiming it violated his fourth amendment right to be free of unlawful government searches and seizures when it reviewed text messages that he sent on an text pager.quon,supra,at.in holding that quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his text messages due to the operational realities of the workplace,the ninth circuit relied in large part on the plurality opinion in ortega d hereafter.quon,supra,at.
held that the fact an employee works for the government does not negate the employee fourth amendment right to be free of unreasonable governmental searches and seizures at work,supra,at,d at.but t he operational realities of the workplace may make some employees expectations of privacy unreasonable.id.at d at.for example,the existence of specific office policies,practices,and procedures may have an effect on public employees expectations of privacy in their workplace.ibid.given the great variety of work environments in the public sector,the question whether an employee has a reasonable expectation of privacy must be addressed on a basis.id.at d at.
relying on,the ninth circuit upheld the district court determination that quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his text messages because,despite a departmental policy that users of pagers had no right to privacy,the operational reality was that quon was given an expressly conflicting message to the contrary by his supervisor.quon,supra,at.in addition to finding quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy,the ninth circuit found the search was unreasonable in violation of the fourth amendment.id.at.
the united states supreme court reversed this decision on the ground the search was not unreasonable.city of ontario quon,supra,at d at.before turning to that issue,it noted that the parties disputed whether quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to his pager messages.id.at d at.opting not to resolve this issue or whether the operational reality test was applicable,the court observed that it must proceed with care when considering the whole concept of privacy expectations in communications made on electronic equipment owned by a government employer.the judiciary risks error by elaborating too fully on the fourth amendment implications of emerging technology before its role in society has become clear.id.at d at.even if the court were certain that the plurality approach were the right one,the court would have difficulty predicting how employees privacy expectations will be shaped by those changes or the degree to which society will be prepared to recognize those expectations as reasonable and
