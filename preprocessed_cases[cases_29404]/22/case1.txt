respondent new york city taxes the possession of cigarettes.petitioner hemi group,based in new mexico,sells cigarettes online to residents of the city.neither state nor city law requires sellers such as hemi to charge,collect,or remit the city tax instead,the city must recover its tax on sales directly from the purchasers.but the jenkins act,requires sellers to submit customer information to the states into which they ship cigarettes,and new york state has agreed to forward that information to the city.that information helps the city track down cigarette purchasers who do not pay their taxes.against that backdrop,the city filed this lawsuit under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,alleging that hemi failure to file the jenkins act reports with the state constituted mail and wire fraud,which are defined as racketeering activit ies,subject to enforcement under civil rico,c.the district court dismissed the claims,but the second circuit vacated the judgment and remanded.among other things,the court of appeals held that the city asserted injury lost tax revenue came about by reason of the predicate mail and wire frauds.it accordingly determined that the city had stated a valid rico claim.

chief justice roberts delivered the opinion of the court in part,concluding that because the city can not show that it lost tax revenue by reason of the alleged rico violation,it can not state a rico claim.
a to establish that an injury came about by reason of a rico violation,a plaintiff must show that a predicate offense not only was a but for cause of his injury,but was the proximate cause as well.holmes securities investor protection corporation.proximate cause for rico purposes should be evaluated in light of its foundations it thus requires some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.ibid.a link that is too remote,purely contingent,or indirec t is insufficient,at.
the city causal theory can not satisfy rico direct relationship requirement.indeed,the causal link here is far more attenuated than the one the court rejected as purely contingent and too remote in holmes,at.according to the city,hemi committed fraud by selling cigarettes to city residents and failing to submit the required customer information to the state.without the reports from hemi,the state could not pass on the information to the city,even if it had been so inclined.some of the customers legally obligated to pay the cigarette tax to the city failed to do so.because the city did not receive the customer information,it could not determine which customers had failed to pay the tax.the city thus could not pursue those customers for payment.the city thereby was injured in the amount of the portion of back taxes that were never collected.as the court reiterated in holmes,t he general tendency of the law,in regard to damages at least,is not to go beyond the first step,at,and that general tendency applies with full force to proximate cause inquiries under rico,ibid.because the city causation theory requires the court to move well beyond the first step,that theory can not satisfy rico direct relationship requirement.
the city claim suffers from the same defect as the rico claim rejected in anza ideal steel supply,where the conduct directly causing the harm was distinct from the conduct giving rise to the fraud,see,at.indeed,the disconnect between the asserted injury and the alleged fraud in this case is even sharper.in anza,the same party had both engaged in the harmful conduct and committed the fraudulent act.here,the city theory of liability rests not just on separate actions,but separate actions carried out by separate parties.the city theory thus requires that the court extend rico liability to situations where the defendant fraud on the third party the state has made it easier for a fourth party the taxpayer to cause harm to the plaintiff the city.indeed,the taxpayers here only caused harm to the city in the first place if they decided not to pay taxes they were legally obligated to pay.put simply,hemi obligation was to file jenkins act reports with the state,not the city,and the city harm was directly caused by the customers,not hemi.the court has never before stretched the causal chain of a rico violation so far,and declines to do so today.see,at.
b the city attempts to avoid this conclusion by characterizing the violation not merely as hemi failure to file jenkins act reports with the state,but as a more general systematic scheme to defraud the city of tax revenue.but if the city could escape the requirement merely by alleging that the fraudulent scheme embraced all those indirectly harmed by the alleged conduct,the court rico proximate cause precedent would become a mere pleading rule.that precedent makes clear that the compensable injury flowing from a rico violation necessarily is the harm caused by the predicate acts.anza,supra,at.because the only fraudulent conduct alleged here is a violation of the jenkins act,the city must,but can not,show that hemi failure to file the jenkins act reports led directly to its injuries.
the city also errs in relying on bridge phoenix bond indemnity.there,the plaintiffs causation theory was straightforward the causal link in bridge involved a direct and easily identifiable connection between the fraud at issue and the plaintiffs injury,at the plaintiffs there were the only parties injured by petitioners misrepresentations,at and there were no independent factors that account ed for the injury,at.the city theory in this case is anything but straightforward multiple steps separate the alleged fraud from the asserted injury.and in contrast to bridge,where there were no independent factors that account ed for the plaintiffs injury,at,here there certainly were the city theory of liability rests on the independent actions of third and even fourth parties.

hemi group,llc and kai gachupin,petitioners city of new york,new york 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit 
chief justice roberts delivered the opinion of the court in part.
the city of new york taxes the possession of cigarettes.hemi group,based in new mexico,sells cigarettes online to residents of the city.neither state nor city law requires hemi to charge,collect,or remit the tax,and the purchasers seldom pay it on their own.federal law,however,requires vendors such as hemi to submit customer information to the states into which they ship the cigarettes.
against that backdrop,the city filed this lawsuit under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,alleging that hemi failed to file the required customer information with the state.that failure,the city argues,constitutes mail and wire fraud,which caused it to lose tens of millions of dollars in unrecovered cigarette taxes.because the city can not show that it lost the tax revenue by reason of the alleged rico violation,c,we hold that the city can not state a claim under rico.we therefore reverse the court of appeals decision to the contrary.
this case arises from a motion to dismiss,and so we accept as true the factual allegations in the city second amended complaint.see leatherman tarrant county narcotics intelligence and coordination unit.
new york state authorizes the city of new york to impose its own taxes on cigarettes.unconsol.law ann.west supp.under that authority,the city has levied a per pack tax on each standard pack of cigarettes possessed within the city for sale or use.admin.code a see also record.when purchasers buy cigarettes from vendors,the seller is responsible for charging,collecting,and remitting the tax.tax law ann.west supp.vendors,however,are not.see city of new york.com.instead,the city is responsible for recovering,directly from the customers,use taxes on cigarettes sold outside new york.that can be difficult,as those customers are often reluctant to pay and tough to track down.one way the city can gather information that would assist it in collecting the back taxes is through the jenkins act,stat,as amended by stat.that act requires cigarette sellers to register and to file a report with state tobacco tax administrators listing the name,address,and quantity of cigarettes purchased by state residents.
new york state and the city have executed an agreement under which both parties undertake to cooperate fully with each other and keep each other fully and promptly informed with reference to any person or transaction subject to both state and city cigarette taxes including i nformation obtained which may result in additional cigarette tax revenue to the state or city provided that the disclosure of that information is permissible under existing laws and agreements.record.the city asserts that under that agreement,the state forwards jenkins act information to the city,at second amended compl.that information helps the city track down purchasers who do not pay their taxes.
hemi group is a new mexico company that sells cigarettes online.hemi,however,does not file jenkins act information with the state.the city alleges that this failure has cost it tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars a year in cigarette excise tax revenue.record.based on hemi failure to file the information with the state,the city filed this federal rico claim.
rico provides a private cause of action for a ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section of this chapter.c.section,in turn,contains rico criminal provisions.specifically,c,which the city invokes here,makes it unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in,or the activities of which affect,interstate commerce,to conduct or participate,directly or indirectly,in the conduct of such enterprise affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.r acketeering activity is defined to include a number of predicate acts,including the two at issue in this case mail and wire fraud.see.
the city alleges that hemi interstate sale of cigarettes and the failure to file jenkins act reports identifying those sales constitute the rico predicate offenses of mail and wire fraud in violation of c,for which c provides a private cause of action.record.invoking that private cause of action,the city asserts that it has suffered injury in the form of lost tax revenue its business or property in rico terms by reason of hemi fraud.
hemi does not contest the city characterization of the jenkins act violations as predicate offenses actionable under c.we therefore assume,without deciding,that failure to file jenkins act material can serve as a rico predicate offense.instead,hemi argues that the city asserted injury lost tax revenue is not business or property under rico,and that the city can not show that it suffered any injury by reason of the failure to file jenkins act reports.
the district court dismissed the city rico claims,determining that hemi owner and officer kai gachupin did not have an individual duty to file jenkins act reports,and thus could not have committed the alleged predicate acts.city of new york nexicon,cv dab,wl,sdny.the district court therefore held that the city could not establish that hemi and gachupin formed an enterprise as required to establish rico liability,at.because it dismissed on that ground,the district court did not address whether the city loss of tax revenue constitutes an injury to its business or property under,or whether that injury was caused by reason of hemi failure to file the jenkins act reports.
the second circuit vacated the district court judgment and remanded for further proceedings.the court of appeals held that the city had established that gachupin and hemi operated as an enterprise and that the enterprise committed the predicate rico acts of mail and wire fraud,based on the failure to file the jenkins act material with the state,at.the court also determined that the city asserted injury,lost tax revenue,was business or property under rico,at.and that injury,the court concluded,came about by reason of the predicate mail and wire frauds,at.the city thus had stated a viable rico claim.judge winter dissented on the ground that the alleged rico violation was not the proximate cause of the city injury,at.
hemi filed a petition for certiorari,asking this court to determine whether the city had been directly injured in its business or property by reason of the alleged mail and wire frauds.pet.for cert.i.we granted that petition.
though framed as a single question,hemi petition for certiorari raises two distinct issues first,whether a loss in tax revenue is business or property under c and second,whether the city asserted injury came about by reason of the allegedly fraudulent conduct,as required by c.we determine that the city can not satisfy the causation requirement that any injury the city suffered must be by reason of the alleged frauds and therefore do not decide whether the city allegations of lost tax revenue constitute an injury to its business or property.
in holmes securities investor protection corporation,we set forth the standard of causation that applies to civil rico claims.in that case,we addressed a rico claim brought by securities investor protection corporation sipc against defendants whom sipc alleged had manipulated stock prices,at.sipc had a duty to reimburse customers of certain registered in the event the were unable to meet their financial obligations,at.when the conspiracy by the stock manipulators was detected,stock prices collapsed,and two were unable to meet their obligations to their customers.sipc,as insurer against that loss,ultimately was on the hook for nearly million to cover the customers claims.the court held that sipc could not recover against the conspirators because it could not establish that it was injured by reason of the alleged fraud,as that phrase is used in rico.
we explained that,to state a claim under civil rico,the plaintiff is required to show that a rico predicate offense not only was a but for cause of his injury,but was the proximate cause as well.at.proximate cause for rico purposes,we made clear,should be evaluated in light of its foundations proximate cause thus requires some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.ibid.a link that is too remote,purely contingent,or indirec t is insufficient,at.
applying that standard,we rejected sipc rico claim.the alleged conspiracy,we held,directly harmed only the sipc injury,on the other hand,was purely contingent on that harm,at.the connection between the alleged conspiracy and sipc injury was therefore too remote to satisfy rico direct relationship requirement.ibid.
the city causal theory is far more attenuated than the one we rejected in holmes.according to the city,hemi committed fraud by selling cigarettes to city residents and failing to submit the required customer information to the state.without the reports from hemi,the state could not pass on the information to the city,even if it had been so inclined.some of the customers legally obligated to pay the cigarette tax to the city failed to do so.because the city did not receive the customer information,the city could not determine which customers had failed to pay the tax.the city thus could not pursue those customers for payment.the city thereby was injured in the amount of the portion of back taxes that were never collected.see record.
but as we reiterated in holmes,t he general tendency of the law,in regard to damages at least,is not to go beyond the first step.at quoting associated contractors of,carpenters,in turn quoting southern pacific lumber,internal quotation marks omitted.our cases confirm that the general tendency applies with full force to proximate cause inquiries under rico.holmes,supra,at see also bridge phoenix bond indemnity,slip,at anza ideal steel supply.because the city theory of causation requires us to move well beyond the first step,that theory can not meet rico direct relationship requirement.
our decision in anza,supra,confirms that the city theory of causation is far too indirect.there we considered a rico claim brought by ideal steel supply against its competitor,national steel supply.ideal alleged that national had defrauded new york state by failing to charge and remit sales taxes,and that national was thus able to undercut ideal prices.the lower prices offered by national,ideal contended,allowed national to attract customers at ideal expense,at.
finding the link between the fraud alleged and injury suffered to be attenuated,we rejected ideal claim,at.the direct victim of this conduct,we held,was the state of new york,not ideal.at.it was the state that was being defrauded and the state that lost tax revenue as a result.ibid.we recognized that ideal had asserted its own harms when national failed to charge customers for the applicable sales tax.ibid.but the cause of ideal harm was a set of actions offering lower prices entirely distinct from the alleged rico violation defrauding the state.ibid.the alleged violation therefore had not led directly to the plaintiff injuries,and ideal accordingly had failed to meet rico requirement of a direct causal connection between the predicate offense and the alleged harm,at.
the city claim suffers from the same defect as the claim in anza.here,the conduct directly responsible for the city harm was the customers failure to pay their taxes.and the conduct constituting the alleged fraud was hemi failure to file jenkins act reports.thus,as in anza,the conduct directly causing the harm was distinct from the conduct giving rise to the fraud.see,at.
indeed,the disconnect between the asserted injury and the alleged fraud in this case is even sharper than in anza.there,we viewed the point as important because the same party national steel had both engaged in the harmful conduct and committed the fraudulent act.we nevertheless found the distinction between the relevant acts sufficient to defeat ideal rico claim.here,the city theory of liability rests not just on separate actions,but separate actions carried out by separate parties.
the city theory thus requires that we extend rico liability to situations where the defendant fraud on the third party the state has made it easier for a fourth party the taxpayer to cause harm to the plaintiff the city.indeed,the taxpayers here only caused harm to the city in the first place if they decided not to pay taxes they were legally obligated to pay.put simply,hemi obligation was to file the jenkins act reports with the state,not the city,and the city harm was directly caused by the customers,not hemi.we have never before stretched the causal chain of a rico violation so far,and we decline to do so today.see,at associated contractors,supra,at,finding no proximate cause in the antitrust context where the plaintiff harm stems most directly from the conduct of persons who are not victims of the conspiracy 
one consideration we have highlighted as relevant to the rico direct relationship requirement is whether better situated plaintiffs would have an incentive to sue.see holmes,supra,at.the state certainly is better situated than the city to seek recovery from hemi.and the state has an incentive to sue the state imposes its own per pack tax on cigarettes possessed within the state,nearly double what the city charges.tax law ann.west supp.we do not opine on whether the state could bring a rico action for any lost tax revenue.suffice it to say that the state would have concrete incentives to try.see anza,supra,at ideal accuses the anzas of defrauding the state of new york out of a substantial amount of money.if the allegations are true,the state can be expected to pursue appropriate remedies 
the dissent would have rico proximate cause requirement turn on foreseeability,rather than on the existence of a sufficiently direct relationship between the fraud and the harm.it would find that the city has satisfied that requirement because the harm is foreseeable it is a consequence that hemi intended,indeed desired and it falls well within the set of risks that congress sought to prevent.post,at opinion of breyer.if this line of reasoning sounds familiar,it should.it is precisely the argument lodged against the majority opinion in anza.there,the dissent criticized the majority view for permit ting a defendant to evade liability for harms that are not only foreseeable,but the intended consequences of the defendant unlawful behavior.at thomas,concurring in part and dissenting in part.but the dissent there did not carry the day,and no one has asked us to revisit anza.
the concepts of direct relationship and foreseeability are of course two of the many shapes proximate cause took at common law,holmes,supra,at.our precedents make clear that in the rico context,the focus is on the directness of the relationship between the conduct and the harm.indeed,anza and holmes never even mention the concept of foreseeability.
the city offers a number of responses.it first challenges our characterization of the violation at issue.in the city view,the violation is not merely hemi failure to file jenkins act information with the state,but a more general systematic scheme to defraud the city of tax revenue.brief for respondent.having broadly defined the violation,the city contends that it has been directly harmed by reason of that systematic scheme.ibid.
but the city can not escape the proximate cause requirement merely by alleging that the fraudulent scheme embraced all those indirectly harmed by the alleged conduct.otherwise our rico proximate cause precedent would become a mere pleading rule.in anza,for example,ideal alleged that national scheme was to give national a competitive advantage over ideal.at.but that allegation did not prevent the court from concluding that national fraud directly harmed only the state,not ideal.as the court explained,ideal could not circumvent the requirement simply by claiming that the defendant aim was to increase market share at a competitor expense.at 
our precedent makes clear,moreover,that the compensable injury flowing from a rico violation necessarily is the harm caused by the predicate acts.at quoting sedima,imrex.in its rico statement,the city alleged that hemi failure to file jenkins act reports constituted the predicate act of mail and wire fraud.record.the city went on to allege that this predicate act directly caused its harm,at,but that assertion is a legal conclusion about proximate cause indeed,the very legal conclusion before us.the only fraudulent conduct alleged here is a violation of the jenkins act.see,at winter,dissenting.thus,the city must show that hemi failure to file the jenkins act reports with the state led directly to its injuries.this it can not do.
the city also relies on bridge.bridge reaffirmed the requirement that there must be a sufficiently direct relationship between the defendant wrongful conduct and the plaintiff injury.at slip,at.the case involved competing bidders at a county auction.because the liens were profitable even at the lowest possible bid,multiple bidders offered that low bid.the bidding took the form of the percentage tax penalty the bidder would require the property owner to pay,so the lowest possible bid was.to decide which bidder would be awarded the lien,the county devised a plan to allocate the liens on a rotational basis.at slip,at internal quotation marks omitted.but as we noted in that case,this created a perverse incentive bidders who,in addition to bidding themselves,sen t agents to bid on their behalf would obtain a disproportionate share of liens.ibid.the county therefore prohibited bidders from using such agents.ibid.
a losing bidder alleged that a competitor had defrauded the county by employing shadow bidders to secure a greater proportion of liens than it was due.we held that the had met rico causation requirement.distinguishing that claim from the one at issue in anza,we noted that the plaintiff theory of causation in bridge was straightforward because of the nature of the auction,and because the county awarded bids on a rotational basis,each time a bid was awarded,a particular legitimate bidder was necessarily passed over,at slip,at.the losing bidders,moreover,were the only parties injured by petitioners misrepresentations.ibid.the county was not it received the same revenue regardless of which bidder prevailed.
the city theory in this case is anything but straightforward multiple steps,as we have detailed,separate the alleged fraud from the asserted injury.and in contrast to bridge,where there were no independent factors that account ed for the plaintiff injury,here there certainly were the city theory of liability rests on the independent actions of third and even fourth parties.
the city at various points during the proceedings below described its injury as the lost opportunity to tax rather than lost tax revenue.it is not clear that there is a substantive distinction between the two descriptions.in any event,before this court,the city argument turned on lost revenue,not a lost opportunity to collect it.see,brief for respondent i presented does the city of new york have standing under rico because lost tax revenue constitutes a direct injury to the city business or property in accord with the statute,c,and this court authority at t he city alleges that it has been injured the loss of tax revenues by defendants rico violations indeed,in its entire brief on the merits,the city never uses the word opportunity or anything similar to describe its injury.
perhaps the city articulated its argument in terms of the lost revenue itself to meet hemi contention that an injury to the mere opportunity to collect taxes fell short of rico injury to property requirement.brief for petitioners the opportunity to collect taxes from those who did owe them falls within a class of expectation interests that do not qualify as injury to business or property and therefore do not confer civil rico standing internal quotation marks omitted see cleveland united states,it does not suffice that the object of the fraud may become property in the recipient hands for purposes of the mail fraud statute,the thing obtained must be property in the hands of the victim 
that is not to say,however,that the city would fare any better on the causation question had it framed its argument in terms of a lost opportunity.hemi filing obligation would still be to the state,and any harm to the city would still be caused directly by the customers failure to pay their taxes.see,at winter,dissenting.whatever the city reasons for framing its merits arguments as it has,we will not reformulate them for it now 
in a final effort to save its claim,the city has shifted course before this court.in its second amended complaint and rico statement,the city relied solely on hemi failure to file jenkins act reports with the state to form the basis of the predicate act mail and wire frauds.see second amended compl,record.before this court,however,the city contends that hemi made affirmative misrepresentations to city residents,which,the city now argues,comprise part of the rico predicate mail and wire frauds.see brief for respondent.the city counsel pressed the point at oral argument,asserting that the city injury was caused by the seller misrepresentation,which encourages the purchasers not to pay taxes.tr.of oral arg.
the city,however,affirmatively disavowed below any reliance on misrepresentations to form the predicate rico violation.the alleged false statements,the city there stated,are evidence of the scheme to defraud,but are not part of the fraud itself.t he scheme to defraud would exist even absent the statements.record.the city reiterated the point the scheme consists of the interstate sale of cigarettes and the failure to file jenkins act reports indentifying those sales.ibid.related to the fraud,but not a circumstance constituting the fraud,the defendants inform customers that their purchases will be concealed,and also seek to convince their customers that no taxes are owed by claiming,falsely,that the sales are.at.not only did the city disclaim any reliance upon misrepresentations to the customers to form the predicate acts under rico,but the city made clear in its second amended complaint that its two rico claims rested solely on the jenkins act violations as the predicate acts.see second amended compl.because the city defined the predicate act before the district court as hemi failure to file the jenkins act reports,and expressly disavowed reliance on the alleged misrepresentations themselves as predicate acts,we decline to consider hemi alleged misstatements as predicate acts at this late stage.
it bears remembering what this case is about.it is about the rico liability of a company for lost taxes it had no obligation to collect,remit,or pay,which harmed a party to whom it owed no duty.it is about imposing such liability to substitute for or complement a governing body uncertain ability or desire to collect taxes directly from those who owe them.and it is about the fact that the liability comes with treble damages and attorney fees attached.this court has interpreted rico broadly,consistent with its terms,but we have also held that its reach is limited by the requirement of a direct causal connection between the predicate wrong and the harm.anza,at.the city injuries here were not caused directly by the alleged fraud,and thus were not caused by reason of it.the city,therefore,has no rico claim.
the judgment of the court of appeals for the second circuit is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

justice ginsburg,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
as the court points out,this is a case about the rico liability of a company for lost taxes it had no obligation to collect,remit,or pay.ante,at.new york city or city can not,consistent with the commerce clause,compel hemi group,an seller,to collect a city sales or use tax.see quill north dakota,national bellas hess,department of revenue of.unable to impose its tax on hemi group,or to require hemi group to collect its tax,new york city is attempting to use the racketeer influenced and corrupt act rico,c,in combination with the jenkins act,to overcome that disability.
hemi group committed fraud only insofar as it violated the jenkins act by failing to report the names and addresses of new york purchasers to new york state.there is no other grounding for the city charge that it was defrauded by hemi group.absent the jenkins act,hemi group would have owed no duty to disclose its sales to anyone,and its failure to disclose could not conceivably be deemed fraud of any kind.city of new york.com,winter,dissenting in part and concurring in part.
because the alleged fraud is based on violations of the jenkins act,the nature and consequences of the fraud are properly determined solely by the scope of that act.at.but conspicuously absent from the city pleadings is any claim brought pursuant to the jenkins act itself,rather than rico,seeking enforcement of the jenkins act.at.the city thus effectively admits that its claim is outside the scope of the very statute on which it builds its rico suit.
i resist reading rico to allow the city to its lack of authority to collect tobacco taxes from hemi group or to reshape the quite limited remedies congress has provided for violations of the jenkins act,see ante,at.without subscribing to the broader range of the court proximate cause analysis,i join the court opinion to the extent it is consistent with the view,and i concur in the court judgment.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit 
justice breyer,with whom justice stevens and justice kennedy join,dissenting.
in my view,the hemi group failure to provide new york state with the names and addresses of its new york city cigarette customers proximately caused new york city to lose tobacco tax revenue.i dissent from the court contrary holding.
although the ultimate legal issue is a simple one,the statutory framework within which it arises is complex.as the majority points out,ante,at,the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,provides a private cause of action and treble damages to a ny person injured in that person business or property by reason of conduct that involves a pattern of racketeering activity.c emphasis added.rico defines racketeering activity to include violations of various predicate criminal statutes including mail and wire fraud.the pattern of racketeering at issue here consists of repeated instances of mail fraud,which in turn consist largely of violations of the federal jenkins act.that act seeks to help states collect tobacco taxes by requiring cigarette sellers,such as hemi,to file reports with state tobacco tax administrators identifying the names and addresses of customers and the amounts they purchased.the violations consist of hemi intentional failure to do so.
as the majority points out,we must assume for present purposes that an intentional failure to file jenkins act reports counts as mail fraud at least where the failure is part of a scheme that includes use of the mails.ante,at.lower courts have sometimes so held.see united states melvin,united states brewer.the court of appeals here so held.city of new york.com.and no one has challenged that holding.
we must also assume that hemi intentiona l conceal ment of the information,second am.compl,is the legal equivalent of an affirmative representation that hemi had no new york city customers.see restatement second of torts,a person who fails to disclose a fact may be subject to liability as if he had represented the nonexistence of the matter that he has failed to disclose stewart wyoming cattle ranche,concealment or suppression of material fact equivalent to a false representation.on these assumptions,the question before us is whether new york city loss of tax revenues constitutes an injury to its business or property by reason of hemi jenkins act misrepresentations.
the case arises as a result of the district court dismissal of new york city rico complaint.fed.rule civ.proc.b.hence we must answer the question in light of the facts alleged,taking as true the facts pleaded in the complaint along with the rico statement submitted pursuant to the district court rule.bridge phoenix bond indemnity,slip,at.those facts as i interpret them include the following 
new york state or state and new york city or city both impose tobacco taxes on new york cigarette buyers.second am.compl.
both city and state normally collect the taxes from cigarette sellers,who,in turn,charge retail customers.
hemi,an company,sells cigarettes over the internet to buyers at prices that are lower than cigarette prices.the difference in price is almost entirely attributable to the fact that hemi prices do not include any charge for new york taxes.hemi advertises its cigarettes as tax free and often adds that it does not report any sales activity to any state taxing authority.internal quotation marks omitted emphasis deleted.
new york state normally receives jenkins act reports from sellers.it is contractually obliged to pass the information on to new york city and i assume it normally does so.
when it receives information,new york city writes letters to resident customers asking them to pay the tobacco tax they owe.as a result,new york city collects about of the tax due.by doing so,in the city obtained out of million owed.
hemi has consistently and intentionally failed to file jenkins act reports in order to prevent both state and city from collecting the tobacco taxes that hemi customers owe and which otherwise many of those customers would pay.
the majority asks whether new york city stated a valid cause of action in alleging that it lost tobacco tax revenue by reason of hemi unlawful misrepresentations.the facts just set forth make clear that we must answer that question affirmatively.for one thing,no one denies that hemi misrepresentation was a condition of new york city loss.in the absence of the misrepresentation,had hemi told new york state the truth about its new york city customers,new york city would have written letters to the purchasers and obtained a significant share of the tobacco taxes buyers owed.
for another thing,new york city losses are reasonably foreseeable results of the misrepresentation.it is foreseeable that,without the information,new york city would not be able to write successful dunning letters,and it is foreseeable that,with that information,it would be able to write successful dunning letters.indeed,that is a natural inference from,among other things,the complaint assertion that hemi advertised that it did not report sales information to state taxing authorit ies.see,smith bolles,for causation purposes,those results are proximate which the from his position must have contemplated as the probable consequence of his fraud or breach of contract quoting crater binninger.errors and appeals see also keeton,dobbs,keeton,owen,prosser and keeton on law of torts,ed.hereinafter prosser and keeton speiser,krause,gans,the american law of torts,by far the most treated and most discussed aspect of the law of proximate or legal cause is the doctrine of foreseeability but ante,at the dissent would have rico proximate cause requirement turn on foreseeability 
further,hemi misrepresented the relevant facts in order to bring about new york city relevant loss.it knew the loss would occur it intended the loss to occur one might even say it desired the loss to occur.it is difficult to find cases denying liability for a wrongdoer intended consequences,particularly where those consequences are also foreseeable.bridge,supra,at slip,at s uppose an enterprise that wants to get rid of rival businesses mails representations about them to their customers and suppliers,but not to the rivals themselves.if the rival businesses lose money as a result of the misrepresentations,it would certainly seem that they were injured in their business by reason of a pattern of mail fraud ex rel.caleb daniel,ut,i f an unskilled marksman were to shoot a single bullet at a distant individual with the intent of killing her,that individual injury or death may not be the natural and probable consequence of the shooter act,but the harm would not be an accident because the shooter intended the harm,even though the likelihood of success was improbable harper james,the law of torts,explaining that,ordinarily,all intended consequences of an intentional act are proximate 
in addition,new york city revenue loss falls squarely within the bounds of the kinds of harms that the jenkins act essentially the predicate statute seeks to prevent.the statute is entitled an act to assist states in collecting sales and use taxes on cigarettes.stat.i have no reason to believe the act intends any different result with respect to collection of a city tobacco tax assessed under the authority of state law.see unconsol.law ann.west supp.authorizing cities with over one million inhabitants to impose their own cigarette taxes.the restatement second of torts explains that where
