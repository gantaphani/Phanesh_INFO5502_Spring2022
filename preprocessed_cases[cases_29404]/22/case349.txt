a jury convicted the defendant of having violated two federal statutes,which prohibits knowingly transferring or attempting to transfer obscene material to a person under,and b,which,so far as bears on this case,forbids knowingly attempting to persuade,induce,entice,or coerce a person under to engage either in prostitution or in any sexual activity for which one could be charged with a criminal offense.section imposes a maximum sentence of years in prison section b imposes a minimum sentence of years and a maximum of life.the judge sentenced the defendant to years for the violation of section and years,rather than the advisory guideline sentence of years,for the violation of section b,the sentences to run concurrently.he went above the guidelines range because otherwise the punishment for the defendant violation of section would be effectively zero,given the minimum sentence for the section b violation and the fact that years is the maximum sentence for violating section.the defendant challenges only his conviction for violating section b.
the defendant,a man,was caught in a sting operation in which a government agent impersonated a girl in an internet chat room called indiana regional romance.the defendant visited the chat room and solicited abagail as the agent called herself to have sex with him.the defendant lived in southern indiana abagail purported to live in the northern part of the state.she agreed to have sex with the defendant and in a subsequent chat he discussed the possibility of traveling to meet her in a couple of weeks,but no arrangements were made.he was then arrested.
the defendant of course did not succeed in getting abagail to have sex with him,and if he had,he would not have been guilty of a completed violation of section b because the agent who called herself abagail was not a minor.the question the only one we need answer to resolve the appeal is whether the defendant is guilty of having attempted to get an underage girl to have sex with him.to be guilty of an attempt you must intend the completed crime and take a substantial step toward its completion.braxton united states,d united states coté,cir.but the term substantial step can not be applied to a concrete case without an understanding of the purpose of punishing unsuccessful attempts to commit crimes.
in tort law,unsuccessful attempts do not give rise to liability.if you plan to shoot a person but at the last minute change your mind and you had not threatened him,which might be actionable,you have not committed a tort.the criminal law,because it aims at taking dangerous people out of circulation before they do harm,takes a different approach.a person who demonstrates by his conduct that he has the intention and capability of committing a crime is punishable even if his plan was thwarted.the substantial step toward completion is the demonstration of dangerousness,and has been usefully described as some overt act adapted to,approximating,and which in the ordinary and likely course of things will result in,the commission of the particular crime.united states manley,cir see,united states vigil,cir.you are not punished just for saying that you want or even intend to kill someone,because most such talk does lead to action.you have to do something that makes it reasonably clear that had you not been interrupted or made a example,the person you thought you were shooting was actually a clothier would have completed the crime.that something marks you as genuinely doer and not just one of the hollow men of eliot poem,incapacitated from action because

in the usual prosecution based on a sting operation for attempting to have sex with an underage girl,the defendant after obtaining the pretend girl consent goes to meet her and is arrested upon arrival,as in united states gagliardi,cir united states coté,supra,at united states spurlock,cir,and united states tykarsky,cir.it is always possible that had the intended victim been a real girl the defendant would have gotten cold feet at the last minute and not completed the crime even though he was in position to do so.but there is a sufficient likelihood that he would have completed it to allow a jury to deem the visit to meet the pretend girl a substantial step toward completion,and so the visit is conduct enough to make him guilty of an attempt and not merely an intent.
travel is not a sine qua non of finding a substantial step in a section b case.doe smith,cir.the substantial step can be making arrangements for meeting the girl,as by agreeing on a time and place for the meeting.united states yost,cir united states thomas,cir united states bailey,cir united states ramirez,cir.it can be taking other preparatory steps,such as making a hotel reservation,purchasing a gift,or buying a bus or train ticket,especially one that is nonrefundable.t he defendant initiation of sexual conversation,writing insistent messages,and attempting to make arrangements to meet were described as a substantial step in united states goetzke,cir.child sexual abuse is often effectuated following a period of grooming and the sexualization of the relationship.sana loue,legal and epidemiological aspects of child maltreatment,legal med,see united states brand,cir.we wo try to give an exhaustive list of the possibilities.
but we disagree with the government suggestion that the line runs between harmless banter and a conversation in which the defendant unmistakably proposes sex.in all the cases cited to us by the government or found by our independent research there was more than the explicit sex talk that the government quotes from the defendant chats with abagail.the goetzke decision,from which we quoted,goes the furthest in the direction of the government position,but is distinguishable.the court noted at,footnote omitted that 
goetzke made advances of a sexual w that he was a cute young man,suggesting an exchange of pictures,describing how he liked giving w a backrub and wanted to rub his nice butt,advising w how to stimulate himself,and expressing the desire to see w naked and to put your peter in my mouth.redolent of the fun they had together riding horses,fishing,and being massaged,the letters were crafted to appeal to w,flatter him,impress him,and encourage him to come back to montana maybe this summer when school was out,by promising the same kind of fun and a motorcycle of w own.the letters essentially began to groom w for a sexual encounter in the event he returned to montana because of the allure of the recreational activities and the prospect of a motorcycle,the letters fit neatly within the common understanding of persuade,induce,or entice goetzke sent w letters replete with compliments,efforts to impress,affectionate emotion,sexual advances,and dazzling incentives to return to montana,and proposed that w return during the upcoming summer.in short,goetzke made his move.indeed,given their prior relationship and what goetzke knew of w and their circumstances,the most substantial steps he realistically could take were to communicate his affections and incentives to w by telephone and mail,which he did.
because goetzke and his intended victim had a prior relationship,his effort to lure the victim back to montana for sex could not be thought idle chatter.but the fact that the defendant in the present case said to a stranger whom he thought a young girl things like ill suck your titties and ill kiss your inner thighs and ill let ya suck me and learn about how to do that,while not harmless banter,did not indicate that he would travel to northern indiana to do these things to her in person nor did he invite her to meet him in southern indiana or elsewhere.his talk and his sending her a video of himself masturbating the basis of his unchallenged conviction for violating are equally consistent with his having intended to obtain sexual satisfaction vicariously.there is no indication that he has ever had sex with an underage girl.indeed,since she furnished no proof of her age,he could not have been sure and may indeed have doubted that she was a girl,or even
