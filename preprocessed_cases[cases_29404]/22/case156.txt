opinion of the court 
michael henry harrison challenges the month sentence imposed by the district court for trafficking in child pornography.the single issue on appeal is whether the sentencing enhancement under united states sentencing guideline b,for when a computer was used for the transmission of the material or a notice or advertisement of the material,was properly applied.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm the application of the enhancement.
harrison was indicted as a result of a sting operation aimed at traders and collectors of child pornography.he responded to the following advertisement from an undercover government agent,posted on a web site geared toward those interested in child pornography 
hi,i am a discreet collector of action vhs vids on the topic of and very young teens and i am looking for others who share my taboo interests especially if you are from pennsylvania.
please me at the below address but you must state that you are not a cop,fbi,or postal or i will not reply.
also,please state that you saw this post in yahoo wild and active so i know your reply is legit.
please no flamers,trolls or fantasy trippers.
at the bottom of this advertisement was the email address used by the undercover agent.harrison responded with the following message 
hi,i am a year old male living in nw.i saw your post in active pre teens and want to write.i am not a cop,fbi or postal angent sic.and do much care for them.i am very interested and turned on by young teen and pre teens.mike.
the undercover agent responded the next day with a message indicating that he possessed sexually explicit videotapes featuring children as young as eight years old.he offered to send a list of these videotapes,and asked harrison if he had anything in the way of.harrison responded 
hi,i am interested in seeing your list and i have a lot of pics on all ages from to mostly hardcore.i am from also.
harrison and the undercover agent exchanged numerous other emails,in which the undercover agent described the explicit contents of the videotapes,and harrison commented,among other things,hope you not a cop lol and suggested that perhaps we could meet someday with some little playmates.eventually,the two men arranged a trade harrison agreed to mail computer disks with at least pornographic pictures to the undercover agent,and in return,the agent agreed to mail harrison three videotapes entitled bath time,doctor appointment,and incest family.the undercover agent received four computer disks from harrison in the mail,each containing explicit pictures of underage boys and girls engaging in sexual conduct.the three videotapes were subsequently conveyed to harrison in a controlled delivery.
government agents executed a search warrant on harrison house moments after this delivery,seizing the videotapes and harrison computer,which contained numerous pornographic pictures and video images of children.while the search was being executed,harrison agreed to speak to the agents.he told them he had been collecting child pornography for about seven months by downloading it onto his computer from various internet sites,but that this was the first time he had traded pornography.he admitted he had downloaded the explicit pictures that he later copied onto disks and mailed to the undercover agent.he said he collected child pornography because he was just curious,and denied ever having sexual involvement with a child.
a grand jury indicted harrison on three counts.count one charged him with transporting child pornography in violation of a,while counts two and three,respectively,charged him with receiving child pornography in violation of a and possessing child pornography in violation of a b.harrison agreed to plead guilty to count one under a plea agreement which dismissed counts two and three.the plea agreement further stipulated that harrison acknowledges his responsibility for the conduct charged in counts two and three of the indictment and that the conduct charged in those counts may be considered by the probation office or by the district court in imposing sentence.
in the plea colloquy,the district court asked harrison if he was admitting to the transportation of child pornography that had been obtained through the use of a computer and shipped by way of the united states mail.harrison indicated that he admitted this charge,and also verbally accepted the portion of the plea agreement under which he acknowledged responsibility for the conduct charged in counts two and three.
the maximum sentence under a is fifteen years,and the base offense level is seventeen.the district court used an offense level of,which included eleven levels of enhancement and a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.together with a criminal history category of ii,this yielded a a guideline range of to months imprisonment.the court sentenced harrison at the bottom of this range months in prison,to be followed by three years of supervision.
the only issue is the district court application of b,which provides for a enhancement if a computer was used for the transmission of the material or a notice or advertisement of the material.before the district court decision to apply the enhancement,both parties presented briefs and oral argument on the issue.
under a and a,this court has jurisdiction to review sentences imposed in violation of the law or as the result of an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines.this court reviews a district court interpretation of the sentencing guidelines de novo,and a district court findings of fact supporting application of the guidelines for clear error.see united states butch,cir.this court also reviews for plain error a district court determination of what constitutes relevant conduct for the purposes of sentencing.see united states perez,cir.
it is important to note at the outset of this analysis that the language of b is phrased in the passive voice.it does not say,as does a similar enhancement under b,that the sentence shall be enhanced because of the defendant use of a computer.emphasis added.instead,b applies if a computer was used for the transmission of the material emphasis added.the enhancement therefore applies whether the defendant uses a computer to transmit the material to someone else,or someone else uses a computer to transmit the material to the defendant.in other words,in the language of b,transmission covers both the sending and the receiving of pornographic material,so if the defendant received child pornography by means of a computer,the enhancement is applicable.this interpretation is consistent with the intent evident throughout the sentencing guidelines for offenses involving child pornography,which apply the same penalties for receiving pornography as for sending example,all of the enhancements under apply equally to defendants guilty of receiving,transporting or shipping child pornography.
the seventh circuit court of appeals took a similar approach to the interpretation of b in united states richardson,cir.in richardson,the defendant pleaded guilty to receiving and possessing child pornography in violation of a and a,admitting that he had downloaded more than pornographic images from the internet.in holding that the enhancement under b should apply,the court examined the structure of the sentencing guidelines in regard to the child pornography statutes,and observed that they seemed intended to impose the same punishment for receiving and sending pornography 
use of the internet enhances the dangers that child pornography poses,because it is a more discreet and efficient method of distribution but if this makes the sender more dangerous,it likewise makes the receiver more dangerous.a market has two sides,supply and demand without both,the market collapses.the senders of child pornography supply it the demanders receive it.the guideline is acknowledged to treat both sides of the market symmetrically when any method of transmission other than the internet is used it would make no sense to treat them differently when the more ominous method is used.

based on this reasoning,the richardson court concluded that computer
