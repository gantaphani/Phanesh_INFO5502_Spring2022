background 
hall fraudulent scheme originates in texas 
in february,hall asked his real estate agent,heidi jenkins,to register two trusts,the kingsley trust and the axiom trust,in texas.jenkins registered the two trusts on the same date,at the same courthouse,and with the same business address.jenkins also opened a bank account for the axiom trust at hall request.hall hired jenkins to serve as the axiom trust trustee,and jenkins had authority to sign for deposits and withdrawals on the bank account.
hall began soliciting investors for the axiom trust,which hall falsely trumpeted as a large repository for real estate assets.hall invited potential investors to purchase units of beneficial interest in the axiom trust.hall reasoned that,if warren buffett was charging per share for his stock,hall could offer shares for that amount.hall told prospective investors the face value of the axiom trust shares was guaranteed and the shares would earn high rates of interest.hall bragged no one had ever lost money investing with him.
in the coming years,hall repeatedly misrepresented himself to potential investors as a wealthy and highly successful real estate investor.hall bragged he knew jack nicklaus and investment bankers at bear stearns hall claimed or implied he built or negotiated to help buy or build golf courses,churches,the new york jets new stadium,the bellagio casino in las vegas,and properties all along the hurricane gulf coast.hall also boasted about his experience as a former cia assassin.
hall convinced,and others to invest in the axiom trust traded hall a square foot chateau for shares.was eager to sell the home because his eldest son had recently died and it was painful for his family to continue to live there.gave hall in exchange for one share.was trying to help find investors to help him build a church,and hall told he would be willing to build the church if helped hall free up funds to send to someone in france.
hall frittered away all of the axiom trust assets.he purchased fancy cars and golf lessons,hired personal attorneys,and lived a grand lifestyle.hall lavished gifts on his wife,son,and girlfriend.
asked hall many times to return his money.hall repeatedly rebuffed efforts over the course of four years.in,hall finally admitted to that the axiom trust had gone away but said hall would be able to transfer investment in some way that would get paid as much as through the kingsley trust.hall referred to the kingsley trust website,which later viewed.
hall moves his scheme to missouri 
in january,hall met joseph cooper,a certified public accountant in the louis,missouri,area.hall touted the kingsley trust to cooper,representing the assets of the kingsley trust would be invested with a reputable firm in chicago and insured by bear stearns for eventual investment in the currency exchange market.with the promise of a annual salary,hall hired cooper to serve as the kingsley trust accountant and later as trustee.
at hall direction,cooper and david jarman,a local financial advisor whom hall had appointed as a trustee of the kingsley trust,opened bank accounts in the louis area for the kingsley trust.cooper and jarman became the accounts signatories,but hall controlled the funds.
hall hired jarman to develop a website for the kingsley trust.hall drafted and controlled the website content,and jarman focused on the website layout.the kingsley trust website promoted,g uaranteed deposits that post annual rates twice the norm and kingsley trust erases the guesswork with principal guarantee.the website contained a form onto which visitors could submit their contact information to learn more about investing in the kingsley trust.
invested in the kingsley trust after hall promised to help build a church.hall represented himself to as a wealthy investor in golf courses and alerted to the kingsley trust website.found the website,entered his contact information,and began to correspond with cooper about investing in the kingsley trust.in reliance upon a series of false and fraudulent misrepresentations cooper made to at hall behest,wired to the kingsley trust in two separate installments in december.
and also invested in the kingsley trust,an unemployed truck driver,invested,a retired schoolteacher and one of jarman clients,invested,a recent widow and a client of one of jarman associates,invested.jarman associate recommended the kingsley trust to after she spoke with hall,viewed the kingsley trust website,and came to believe all investments were guaranteed.
as with the axiom trust,hall misappropriated the kingsley trust assets instead of investing them.cooper directly helped hall perpetuate the fraud,but jarman did not.when jarman discovered hall was not investing the kingsley trust assets,jarman alerted,and jarman associate.
with jarman help,asked hall to return her investment,as permitted under the terms of her share in the kingsley trust.cooper then sent a letter stating he would return her money in days.however,funds were not returned until shortly before trial.
c.the fallout 
jarman contacted the federal bureau of investigation fbi,and an investigation ensued.during an interview with an fbi agent,hall denied any wrongdoing and blamed cooper.
in november,a grand jury returned a indictment against hall count i charged hall with mail fraud,in violation of and,for sending the lulling letter.counts ii and iii charged hall with wire fraud,each in violation of and,for inducing to transfer into the kingsley trust bank accounts.hall pled not guilty.
the fbi agent hall.hall admitted he used false promises and guarantees to solicit investment in the kingsley trust.hall said he spent the kingsley trust assets instead of investing them.hall also admitted similar conduct with respect to the axiom trust,although he suggested some of the axiom trust assets were invested in humate.
in october,after a trial,a jury found hall guilty as charged.at sentencing,the district court calculated hall guidelines range to be to months imprisonment,based in part on a enhancement for mass marketing under.b a.the district court sentenced hall to months imprisonment and ordered him to pay over in restitution to,and others.
ii.discussion 
hall argues the district court erred in admitting evidence regarding the axiom trust at trial and in calculating hall guidelines range,assessing a upward adjustment under b a ii because the offense was committed through.
axiom trust evidence 
the district court permitted the government to introduce evidence of hall involvement in the axiom trust notwithstanding the fact that the charged crimes only concerned the kingsley trust.the district court held hall actions with respect to the two trusts were inextricably intertwined,and thus evidence of the axiom trust was intrinsic to the allegations in the indictment 
hall maintains the axiom and kingsley trusts were not inextricably intertwined.hall emphasizes the axiom and kingsley trusts were separated in time,place,and parties.hall stresses activity in axiom trust ended in early and activity in the kingsley trust beg a n in may the axiom trust was located in texas,and the kingsley trust was located in missouri the axiom and kingsley trusts had different victims and cooper was not involved in the axiom trust.
we have consistently held crimes or acts which are inextricably intertwined with the charged crime are not extrinsic and rule b does not apply.united states clarke,cir quoting united states aldridge,cir.evidence of other crimes or acts is inextricably intertwined if it is an integral part of the immediate context of the crime charged.united states rolett,cir.we review the district court decision to admit the evidence of the axiom trust as intrinsic evidence for an abuse of discretion.see united state
