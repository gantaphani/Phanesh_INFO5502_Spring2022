aaron shaffer challenges his conviction for distribution and possession of child pornography,see a,a b,on four grounds.primary among these,shaffer claims that he did not,as a matter of law or fact,distribute child pornography when he downloaded images and videos from a computer network and stored them in a shared folder on his computer accessible by other users of the network.shaffer also asserts that the district court improperly limited the testimony of one of his expert witnesses,wrongly admitted certain.b evidence,and erroneously instructed the jury.finding none of these arguments persuasive,we affirm.
kazaa is a computer application that allows users to trade computer files through the internet.see generally.at,it is hardly a unique service at any one time today,there are apparently in excess of four to five million people online sharing over million files.id.at.users begin at kazaa website.there,they obtain the software necessary for file trading by clicking an installation wizard that walks them through a setup process.id.at see also generally.at.before installation,the wizard requires users to acknowledge and accede to kazaa licensing agreement.at see also.at.users then identify a destination on their computers where they want the kazaa file sharing software located,and kazaa creates a shortcut icon on the user desktop.at.upon installation,kazaa software walks users through certain steps to create a folder called my shared folder hereinafter,shared folder on their computer hard drive.id.at.here,kazaa users store the files they download from the shared folders of other kazaa users.id.at.at the same time,anything one has in one own kazaa shared folder may be accessed and downloaded by other kazaa users.id.at,the only requisites are that both one whose files are being transferred as well as the one who is receiving the be on the internet and have the kazaa software application open at the same time.id.at.kazaa software also shows the user in real time exactly how many of his or her files are being accessed and copied by other kazaa users.id.at.a user can,however,select an option that precludes other users from downloading materials from his or her computer.id.at 
to download an item from another computer shared folder,a kazaa user simply double clicks on that file,and it is then transferred to the shared folder on the recipient user computer.at.there are only two ways for items to be placed in a user shared folder.first,one must go online,search for an item,and download the material into the shared folder.id.at.second,one may take files already existing on his or her computer and move them into the shared folder.id.at.either way,the placement of items in one shared folder involves a conscious effort.id.a user can of course move items out of the shared folder to other folders on his or her computer,and doing so precludes other kazaa users from accessing and downloading such material.id.at.
this case arose when ken rochford,an special agent from the united states department of homeland security bureau of immigration and customs enforcement ice,noticed that a certain kazaa account user with the screen name had in his shared folder accessible to other kazaa users a large number of files containing images and videos of child pornography.see.at.special agent rochford sought to download some of those images from computer onto his own and had no difficulty doing so.id.at.
authorities later learned that the user associated with was shaffer,then a college student living with his mother and stepfather in topeka,kansas.david zimmer,a ice special agent,obtained and executed a search warrant on shaffer residence and computer.see id.at.ice special agents ultimately found within shaffer kazaa shared folder approximately image files and videos containing child pornography,along with text documents describing stories of adults engaging in sex with children.see id.at,see also.at.
during the course of the search of his home and computer,shaffer consented to an interview with special agent zimmer.see.at.during that interview,according to special agent zimmer testimony at trial,shaffer admitted to being the sole user of the computer in his home employing the screen name and knowingly downloading through kazaa movies and still photos involving child pornography,which he estimated occupied a total of approximately gigabytes.see id.at.shaffer defined child pornography for special agent zimmer as involving prepubescent children as young as six or seven years old.id.at.shaffer further admitted that he stored images of child pornography in his kazaa shared folder.id.at.he explained that he did so because,among other things,kazaa gave him user points and various incentive rewards corresponding to how many images other users downloaded from his computer.at.shaffer indicated he knew that other people had downloaded child pornography from him.id.at.and he stated that it takes up to hours to download certain files using kazaa,so sometimes when he went to work he would leave his computer on in order to make his images and videos available for download by other users.id.
shaffer also testified at trial.he did not dispute that he gave an interview to special agent zimmer or much of special agent zimmer description of that interview.see,id.at.shaffer did testify,however,that he could not recall telling special agent zimmer that he knew other kazaa users had downloaded child pornography from his computer.see.at.after a trial,a jury returned guilty verdicts against shaffer for both possession and distribution of child pornography.id.at.the district court subsequently sentenced him to months of incarceration.id.at.
shaffer contends there was insufficient evidence presented at trial to sustain his conviction for distribution of child pornography under section a,it is unlawful for a person knowingly to distribute child pornography by any means,including by computer shaffer frankly concedes that h e allowed,or caused,distribution by leaving files on his computer that other kazaa users could access.aplt.br.at.he also now concedes that a rational jury could infer that he did so knowingly and even intentionally a reasonable jury could conclude from this evidence that shaffer intended to allow others to take the material from his computer.id.but,shaffer argues,to distribute something,a person must actively transfer possession to another,such as by mail,or handing it to another person.id.and here,shaffer contends,he was only a passive participant in the process there is no evidence that he personally complete d any such transaction.id.
the relevant statute does not itself define the term distribute,so we look to how the term is understood as a matter of plain meaning.black offers this definition.to apportion to divide among several.to arrange by class or order.to deliver.to spread out to disperse.black law dictionary ed.webster adds this understanding to divide among several or many deal out apportion esp.to members of a group or over a period of time allot dispense to give out or deliver.webster third new int l dictionary unabridged.the instruction offered by the district court to the jury captured much the same sentiment to distribute something simply means to deliver or transfer possession of it to someone else.
we have little difficulty in concluding that shaffer distributed child pornography in the sense of having delivered,transferred,dispersed,or dispensed it to others.he may not have actively pushed pornography on kazaa users,but he freely allowed them access to his computerized stash of images and videos and openly invited them to take,or download,those items.it is something akin to the owner of a gas station.the owner may not be present at the station,and there may be no attendant present at all.and neither the owner nor his or her agents may ever pump gas.but the owner has a roadside sign letting all passersby know that,if they choose,they can stop and fill their cars for themselves,paying at the pump by credit card.just because the operation is,or in shaffer parlance,passive,we do not doubt for a moment that the gas station owner is in the business of distributing,de
