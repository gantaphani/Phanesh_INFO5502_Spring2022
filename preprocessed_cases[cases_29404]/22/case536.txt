walter schales schales,who was years old at the time of this incident,approached a girl at a store located in hanford,california,surreptitiously placed a digital camera underneath her miniskirt,and took a photograph.caught by another shopper,schales quickly tried to delete the photographs stored on his camera.despite schales efforts,local law enforcement recovered several pictures of two young girls from his camera and then sought a warrant to search his residence.upon executing the warrant,law enforcement agents discovered an immense quantity of child pornography.schales collection included a number of morphed photographs that he created by taking pictures of local minor girls who were unaware that they were being photographed,cutting their faces from the photographs,and then pasting their faces on sexually explicit images of other girls that he downloaded from the internet.a forensic analysis of schales computer revealed thousands of images of child pornography which had been downloaded from the internet,with many of the victims under the age of six.
after a trial,schales was found guilty of receiving or distributing material involving the sexual exploitation of minors,a possessing material involving the sexual exploitation of minors,a b and receiving or producing a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct that is obscene,a.on appeal,schales launches an array of constitutional and evidentiary challenges to his convictions and sentence.for the reasons set forth below,we reject schales facial and as applied challenges to a his sufficiency of evidence claim his evidentiary challenge to the admission of the incident and his claim that the district court erred by refusing to adjust his sentence for acceptance of responsibility.however,as explained below,we remand the case back to the district court to vacate either his conviction for receiving material involving the sexual exploitation of minors in violation of a or for possessing material involving the sexual exploitation of minors in violation of a b because,on this record,his conviction for both violates the double jeopardy clause.
after schales was arrested at the store,local law enforcement obtained a search warrant for schales residence.upon arriving at schales home to execute the search warrant,an investigator asked schales whether they would find any items related to child pornography in his home,to which he replied yeah.during a search of schales home,law enforcement seized a significant quantity of child pornography and obscene depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct.officers seized a computer,some peripheral devices,several cds,dvds,vhs tapes,tapes,digital cameras,a video camera,morphed photographs,pornographic magazines,and women underwear.
investigators reviewed the seized material and discovered that schales had taken large quantities of digital still and video images of approximately nine minors in his community.these female minors ranged in age from six to seventeen,and schales had produced to obscene images of each of these victims.investigators discovered thousands of images of child pornography from the internet downloaded onto his computer,many portraying children under the age of six.there were images of prepubescent children being anally and vaginally penetrated by adult males,and pictures depicting bestiality with females as young as six years of age.schales also transferred images from his digital camera to his computer,which contained photo editing software.he used this software to manipulate images of himself,including some sexually explicit images,and obscene and sexually explicit images of minors that he had obtained from the internet.schales produced morphed images of female minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct through this process.
the grand jury indicted schales for receiving or distributing material involving the sexual exploitation of minors count,possessing material involving the sexual exploitation of minors count,and receiving or producing a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct that is obscene count.a jury found schales guilty of all three counts.the district court sentenced him to a term of incarceration of months on counts one and three,and months on count two,to run concurrently.the court also imposed a lifetime period of supervised release.
obscenity has no protection under the first amendment.see united states williams,d citing roth united states,d.in miller california,d,the supreme court articulated a test to guide a jury determination whether material is obscene,which considers a whether the average person,applying contemporary community standards would find that the work,taken as a whole,appeals to the prurient interest b whether the work depicts or describes,in a patently offensive way,sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law and c whether the work,taken as a whole,lacks serious literary,artistic,political,or scientific value.id.at.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the miller test is still the operative framework used to evaluate obscenity.see ashcroft free speech,d.
almost a decade after miller,the supreme court first addressed a challenge to a statute prohibiting child pornography in new york ferber,d,and held that the government may constitutionally prohibit the creation or promotion of pornography featuring real children even though it does not meet the miller obscenity standard.in,in response to technological developments,congress passed the child pornography prevention act cppa,which extended the definition of child pornography to cover any visual image that is,or appears to be,of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct or has been promoted in a manner that conveys the impression of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.d repealed.the court in free speech coal.struck down provisions of the cppa as unconstitutionally overbroad because these provisions prohibited speech that did not meet the obscenity requirements under miller and did not incorporate the ferber requirement that actual minors be involved in the production of the child pornography.free speech,at.
in response to this decision,congress enacted the prosecutorial remedies and other tools to end the exploitation of children today act of protect act.the protect act amended the general obscenity statute in to proscribe the transfer of certain obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children.subsection a of section provides in part 
any person who knowingly produces,distributes,receives,or possesses with intent to distribute,a visual depiction of any kind,including a drawing,cartoon,sculpture,or painting,that depicts a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct and is obscene or attempts or conspires to do so,shall be subject to the penalties provided in section b 
a is facially constitutional.
we begin with schales challenge to the facial validity of a on overbreadth and vagueness grounds.a challenge to the constitutionality of a federal statute is a question of law that is reviewed de novo.united states lujan,cir.
the first amendment to the united states constitution provides that congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.const.amend.i.the supreme court recognizes that t he freedom of speech has its limits it does not embrace certain categories of speech,including defamation,incitement,obscenity,and pornography produced with real children.free speech,at.citations omitted.accordingly,the government may ban the transportation and distribution of obscene material under miller,irrespective of whether it involves a minor child,and all child pornography produced with real children under ferber.free speech,at.
a is not unconstitutionally overbroad.
schales contends that the inclusion in a of drawings,cartoons,sculptures,and paintings in its definition of visual depictions means that any attempt at art that can be found to depict a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct or is obscene is prohibited.he argues,therefore,that paper dolls,stick figures,and wooden toys are included within the prohibition of section a.at oral argument,however,schales recognized that the plain language of section a does indeed require that the depiction be obscene,see a visual depiction of any kind,including a drawing,cartoon,sculpture,or painting,that depicts a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct and is obscene emphasis added,but nonetheless maintained that the supreme court decisions in ferber and free speech coalition suggest that section a is unconstitutional because it encompasses material that is not produced with actual minors.he is wrong.
the constitution gives significant protection from overbroad laws that chill speech within the first amendment vast and privileged sphere.under this principle,a statute is unconstitutional on its face if it prohibits a substantial amount of protected expression.free speech,at.citing broadrick oklahoma,d see williams.at.a statute is not invalid simply because some impermissible applications are conceivable.ferber,at.instead,the law application to protected speech must be substantial,not only in an absolute sense,but also relative to the scope of the law plainly legitimate applications.virginia hicks,d.
the fundamental overbreadth problem with the cppa identified in free speech coalition was that it proscribe d a significant universe of speech that was neither obscene under miller nor child pornography under ferber.free speech,at.congress addressed this defect when it drafted section a by regulating only obscene conduct.the supreme court has repeatedly found that statutes that proscribe conduct only with respect to material that is obscene under the miller test are not overbroad.see,hamling united states,d paris adult theatre i slaton,d.thus,section a is not impermissibly overbroad because it too requires that the government satisfy the miller standards.see united states handley,d,holding that a is not overbroad because it incorporates the miller obscenity test united states whorley,d,same.the fact that this statute does not require that an actual minor exist,see c,is immaterial because,unlike the cppa,section a is an obscenity statute and not a child pornography statute.
schales parade of horribles that paper dolls,stick figures,and wooden toys are going to be criminalized by this statute is illusory.for a work to be obscene it must appeal to the prurient interest,be patently offensive in light of community standards,and lack serious literary,artistic,political,or scientific value.miller,at.obscenity can,of course,manifest itself in many different types of mediums.in kaplan california,d,the supreme court stated that when it 
declared that obscenity is not a form of expression protected by the first amendment,no distinction was made as to the medium of the expression.obscenity can,of course,manifest itself in conduct,in the pictorial representation of conduct,or in the written and oral description of conduct.the court has applied similarly conceived first amendment standards to moving pictures,to photographs,and to words in books.
id.at.if a work contains a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct and meets the miller obscenity test,it may be proscribed by section a.see,handley,d japanese anime comic books whorley,d same.the miller obscenity test,however,serves as a firewall to guard against constitutionally protected speech being swept within the ambit of the conduct criminalized by the statute.whorley,id.at.accordingly,we find that a does not prohibit a substantial amount of protected speech and is thus not overbroad.
a is not unconstitutionally vague.
to avoid being unconstitutionally vague,a penal statute must define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.kolender lawson,d citations omitted.t he constitution does not require impossible standards all that is required is that the language conveys sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices.hamling,at.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.p erfect clarity and precise guidance have never been required even of regulations that restrict expressive activity.williams.at citation omitted.
the supreme court has repeatedly rejected vagueness challenges to obscenity statutes.in united states.reels of super.film,d,issued the same day as miller,the court extended the standards articulated in miller for testing the constitutionality of state legislation dealing with obscenity to federal legislation.at.the court held that it was prepared to hold the generic terms obscene,lewd,lascivious,filthy,indecent,or immoral as used in prohibiting the importation or transportation of obscene material to describe regulated be limited to the patently offensive representations or descriptions of that specific hard core sexual conduct given as examples in miller.id.at.rejecting a vagueness challenge to prohibiting the mailing of obscene material the following year,the supreme court commented that its decision in.reels of super mm.film made clear our willingness to construe federal statutes dealing with obscenity to be limited to material such as that described in miller.hamling,at.see smith united states,d concluding that section was not unconstitutionally vague because the type of conduct covered by the statute can be ascertained with sufficient ease to avoid due process problems.in reno aclu,d,the supreme court explained that the miller obscenity test is not vague because it limits the uncertain sweep of the obscenity definition.id.at.accordingly,federal statutes dealing with obscenity are construed to incorporate the miller standards and thus are not unconstitutionally vague.see ashcroft aclu,d stating that while not mentioned in statutory text,the court has held that the miller test defines regulated speech for purposes of federal obscenity statutes.
section a is not unconstitutionally vague because it is limited to the prohibition of obscene material and thus employs the same miller requirements that the supreme court has already deemed valid.we have observed that the definition of obscenity has survived vagueness challenges in a number of supreme court cases.see info.providers coal.for def.of the first amendment fcc,cir citations omitted.there is no reason to treat section a any differently.fanciful hypotheticals can be imagined to create vagueness arguments with respect to most any statute.however,as the supreme court recently explained in williams,t he problem that poses is addressed,not by the doctrine of vagueness,but by the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.at citation omitted.the court further noted,w hat renders a statute vague is not the possibility that it will sometimes be difficult to determine whether the incriminating fact it establishes has been proved but rather the indeterminacy of precisely what that fact is.id.explaining that the court has struck down statutes that tied criminal culpability to wholly subjective judgments without statutory definitions,narrowing context,or settled legal meanings.there is no such indeterminacy here because section a proscribes only obscene material.accordingly,we hold that a is not unconstitutionally vague.
a is constitutional as applied to schales.
schales contends that the morphed images he created fall through the cracks of the statutory prohibitions in because this statute incorporates the definition of child pornography in,which requires that the visual depiction is,or is indistinguishable from,that of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.under his logic,because section encompasses drawings,cartoons,sculptures and paintings,it conflicts with section b requirement that the image be indistinguishable from a minor 
the fallacy of schales logic is his premise that section incorporates the definition of child pornography and requires that actual minors be victimized.in fact,the statute explicitly provides that i t is not a required element of any offense under this section that the minor depicted actually existed.c.a plain reading of this statute makes clear that child pornography is not a requisite element of section a.we decline to read words into a statute that are not there.united states watkins,cir citations omitted.we reiterate that this statute only encompasses obscenity under miller and does not extend to child pornography under ferber.whether the images were of actual minors,morphed minors,or imaginary minors,section requires that the government prove that the visual depiction is obscene.thus,a was constitutionally applied to schales creation of morphed images.
c.there is sufficient evidence in the record to sustain schales conviction under a.
schales challenges the sufficiency of evidence used to convict him of violating a.in order to obtain a conviction under this statute,the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant knowingly produces,distributes,receives or possesses with intent to distribute a visual depiction of any kind,including a drawing,cartoon,sculpture,or painting the visual depiction depicts a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct and the visual depiction is obscene.see a.a challenge to the sufficiency of evidence introduced by the government is reviewed de novo.united states odom,cir.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,this court must consider whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.id.
at trial,the government proceeded under two theories to support a conviction under section a first,that schales received obscene visual depictions of minors,and second,that he produced obscene visual depictions of minors through a morphing process schales does not contest that the morphed images were obscene visual depictions.instead,he maintains that the government did not introduce sufficient evidence to convict him of an offense under a because a morphed image does not resemble a real minor and that the definition of child pornography contained in requires that the visual depiction be indistinguishable from that of a minor.we have already rejected this claim.
in reviewing the sufficiency of evidence against schales,we focus on two pieces of evidence introduced by the government.the government closing argument initially focused on one image,exhibit,and asserted that it supported schales conviction on all three counts.the government explained that exhibit was created by morphing a photograph of a local minor girl with obscene pictures of a north carolina girl with her vaginal area exposed and covered with semen and an adult male penis also appear ing in the image.detective wiens of the fresno county sheriff department conducted a computer forensic examination of discs seized at schales house.detective wiens testified that he produced a computer forensic report,which identified all of the images from the,including exhibit.fbi special agent mcgrath testified that he recognized several of the images on the as part of a series depicting a old victim from raleigh,north carolina special agent mcgrath also testified that one of the images depicted this prepubescent female with what appears to be semen on her.the local minor girl was identified by her father,who testified that the photographs were taken of his youngest daughter,who was approximately ten years old at the time,at a church function his family attended with schales.
at trial,the government also focused on two other images,exhibits and.these images depict an adult male with an erect penis holding a photograph that was recovered from the defendant computer of a minor female exposing her anal and vaginal areas.the government asserts that schales produced these images by using an image of a minor female engaged in sexually explicit conduct downloaded from the internet and combining it with a photograph of a local minor girl.the local minor girl pictured in these exhibits was identified by her mother,who testified that these photographs were taken of her daughter,who was approximately fifteen years old at the time,when the family was renovating a house with schales help.
thus,the government introduced images seized during the search of schales home and computer depicting images that he received over the internet and produced through a morphing process.a rational jury could certainly conclude that these images satisfy each element of section a and the miller standard of obscenity at.
d.the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting evidence of the incident.
in a pretrial order,the district court concluded that the government could introduce three of the dozens of images that were recovered from schales camera seized from him at the store.the district court also held that the government could present testimony that schales was seen at,that he walked behind a female with a camera in hand,that he took pictures of her,that he was seen pushing buttons on his camera after being confronted by a witness,and that images were recovered from his camera.schales does not challenge the district court ruling that this evidence was separately admissible as other act evidence inextricably intertwined with the crime with which he was charged,see united states rrapi,cir rule b evidence to show knowledge,intent,modus operandi,and absence of mistake and rule b evidence of consciousness of guilt with respect to his attempts to delete the images on his camera,see united states meling,cir.instead,he contends that this evidence was cumulative because there was a significant amount of testimony at trial dealing with him using photographs of local minor girls to create morphed images.a district court evidentiary rulings are reviewed for an abuse of discretion,united states alvarez,cir,and will be reversed only if such error more likely than not affected the verdict.united states pang,cir.
schales fails to explain how the court abused its discretion by admitting limited evidence of the incident.although the government introduced testimony that the defendant produced obscene images by morphing images,the incident was part of the res gestae of the charged offenses and provided the jury with an example of how schales would surreptitiously take photographs of minor girls in his community.furthermore,the court limited the government to introducing only three of the dozens of recovered images from his camera,prohibited the introduction of schales false statements to the police,and did not allow admission of the fact that schales had been issued a citation for his actions.even if the admitted evidence should have been excluded,schales fails to establish that this error more likely than not affected the verdict and thus was not harmless error.see pang,at even if we find error,we will only reverse if an erroneous evidentiary ruling more likely than not affected the verdict.citation omitted.
schales did not qualify for a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.
the district court refused to give schales a downward adjustment in his offense level for acceptance of responsibility based on the factors set forth in.schales contends that the district court should have granted a downward adjustment because he accepted responsibility when law enforcement asked him prior to executing the search warrant of his home whether they would find any items related to child pornography and he replied yeah.this court reviews the district court interpretation of the sentencing guidelines de novo,the district court application of the sentencing guidelines to the facts of th e case for abuse of discretion,and the district court factual findings for clear error.united states lambert,cir italics added and citation omitted.
a defendant is entitled to a downward adjustment if he clearly accepts responsibility for all of his relevant conduct.united states wilson,cir citation omitted.it is a rare circumstance for a defendant to be entitled to an adjustment where he asserts his right to a trial and puts the government to its burden by contesting material factual matters.id.citation omitted.this court has consistently held that where a defendant refuses to admit all of his guilt,his cooperation notwithstanding,a district court may properly deny a downward adjustment.id.at
