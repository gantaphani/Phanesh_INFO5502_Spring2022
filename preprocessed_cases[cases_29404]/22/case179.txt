lavabit llc is a limited liability company that provided email service.ladar levison is the company sole and managing member 
in,the united states sought to obtain certain information about a in a criminal investigation.to further that goal,the government obtained court orders under both the statute,and the stored communications act,requiring lavabit to turn over particular information related to the target.when lavabit and levison failed to comply with those orders,the district court held them in contempt and imposed monetary sanctions.lavabit and levison now appeal the sanctions.
for the reasons below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
this case concerns the encryption processes that lavabit used while providing its email service.encryption describes the process through which readable data,often called plaintext,is converted into ciphertext,an unreadable jumble of letters and numbers.decryption describes the reverse process of changing ciphertext back into plaintext.both processes employ mathematical algorithms involving keys,which facilitate the change of plaintext into ciphertext and back again.
lavabit employed two stages of encryption for its paid subscribers storage encryption and transport encryption.storage encryption protects emails and other data that rests on lavabit servers.theoretically,no person other than the email user could access the data once it was so encrypted.by using storage encryption,lavabit held a unique market position in the email industry,as many providers do not encrypt stored data.
although lavabit use of storage encryption was novel,this case primarily concerns lavabit second stage of encryption,transport encryption.this more common form of encryption protects data as it moves in transit between the client and the server,creating a protected transmission channel for internet communications.transport encryption protects not just email contents,but also usernames,passwords,and other sensitive information as it moves.without this type of encryption,internet communications move exposed en route to their destination,allowing outsiders to listen in.transport encryption also is,it helps ensure that email clients and servers are who they say they are,which in turn prevents unauthorized parties from exploiting the data channel.
like many online companies,lavabit used an protocol called ssl short for secure sockets layer to encrypt and decrypt its transmitted data.ssl relies on or asymmetric encryption,in which two separate but related keys are used to encrypt and decrypt the protected data.one key is made public,while the other remains private.in lavabit process,email users would have access to lavabit public keys,but lavabit would retain its protected,private keys.this technology relies on complex algorithms,but the basic idea is akin to a padlock if alice wants to send a secured box to bob,she can lock the box with a padlock the public key and bob will open it with his own key the private key.anyone can lock the padlock,but only the can unlock it 
the security advantage that ssl offers disappears if a third party comes to possess the private key.for example,a third party holding a private key could read the encrypted communications tied to that key as they were transmitted.in some circumstances,a third party might also use the key to decrypt past communications although some available technologies can thwart that ability.and,with the private key in hand,the third party could impersonate the server and launch a attack.
when a private key becomes anything less than private,more than one user may be compromised.like some other email providers,lavabit used a single set of ssl keys for all its various subscribers for technological and financial reasons.lavabit in particular employed only five,one for each of the mail protocols that it supported as a result,exposing one could affect all of lavabit estimated plus email users.
with this technical background in mind,we turn to the case before us.
on june,the government sought and obtained an order the order from a magistrate judge authorizing the placement of a pen register and device on lavabit system.this device is intended to allow the government to collect certain information,on a basis,related to the specific investigatory target lavabit email account in accordance with the statute,the order permitted the government to capture all dialing,routing,addressing,and signaling information sent from or sent to the target account.j.in other words,the order authorized the government to collect relating to the target account,but did not allow the capture of the contents of the target emails.the order further required lavabit to furnish to the government all information,facilities,and technical assistance necessary to accomplish the installation and use of the device unobtrusively and with minimum interference.
on the same day that the order issued,fbi agents met with levison,who indicated that he did not intend to comply with the order.levison informed the agents that he could not provide the requested information because the had enabled lavabit encryption services,presumably referring to lavabit storage encryption.but,at the same time,levison led the government to believe that he had the technical capability to decrypt the target information.nevertheless,levison insisted that he would not exercise that ability because lavabit did not want to defeat its own system.
in view of levison response,the government obtained an additional order that day compelling lavabit to comply with the order.this june order,again issued by a magistrate judge,instructed lavabit to provide the fbi with unencrypted data pursuant to the order and reiterated that lavabit was to provide any information,facilities,or technical assistance under the control of lavabit that was needed to provide the fbi with the unencrypted data.further,the june order put lavabit and levison on notice that any f ailure to comply could result in any penalty within the power of the court,including the possibility of criminal contempt of court.
over the next eleven days,the government attempted to talk with levison about implementing the order.levison,however,ignored the fbi repeated requests to confer and did not give the government the unencrypted data that the june order required.as each day passed,the government lost forever the ability to collect the data for that day.
because lavabit refused to comply with the prior orders,the government obtained an order to show cause from the district court on july.the show cause order directed both lavabit and levison,individually,to appear and show cause why lavabit llc ha d failed to comply with the orders entered june,in this matter and why the court should not hold levison and lavabit llc in contempt for its disobedience and resist a nce to these lawful orders.entry of the show cause order spurred a conference call between levison,his counsel,and representatives from the government on july.during that call,the parties discussed how the government could install the device,what information the device could capture,and how the government could view and preserve that information.in addition,the government asked whether levison would provide the keys necessary to decrypt the target encrypted information.although the government again stressed that it was permitted to collect only data,neither levison nor his counsel indicated whether lavabit would allow the government to install and use the device 
on july,four days after the show cause order issued,levison contacted the government with his own proposal as to how he would comply with the court orders.in particular,levison suggested that lavabit would itself collect the government requested data 
i now believe it would be possible to capture the required data ourselves and provide it to the fbi.specifically the information we collect is the login and subsequent logout date and time,the ip address used to connect to the subject email account and several headers from any future emails sent or received using the subject account note that additional header fields could be captured if provided in advance of my implementation effort.
levison conditioned his proposal with a requirement that the government pay him for his services.more importantly,levison also intended to provide the data only at the conclusion of the day period required by the order or intermittently,as his schedule allow ed.if the government wanted daily updates,levison demanded an additional 
the government rejected levison proposal,explaining that it needed transmission of results.moreover,the government would have no means to verify the accuracy of the information that lavabit proposed to provide a concerning limit given lavabit apparent hostility toward the government.levison responded by insisting that the order did not require access,but did not otherwise attempt to comply with the order or the june order.
on july,three days after the government received levison proposal and the same day as the show cause hearing,the government obtained a seizure warrant from the district court under the stored communications act sca.see.the seizure warrant provided that lavabit was to turn over a ll information necessary to decrypt communications sent to or from the target lavabit email account,including encryption keys and ssl keys.in addition,the warrant covered a ll information necessary to decrypt data stored in or otherwise associated with the target lavabit account.
on july,levison appeared before the district court pro se on behalf of himself and lavabit,for the show cause hearing.when asked whether he planned to comply with the order,levison responded that he had always agreed to the installation of the pen register device.nonetheless,levison objected to turning over his private ssl encryption keys because that would compromise all of the secure communications in and out of his network,including his own administrative traffic.he also maintained that t here was never an explicit demand from the government that he turn over the keys.
the district court and the parties initially discussed whether the order required lavabit to produce its encryption keys.the district court observed that the order technical assistance provision may or may not encompass the keys,but it declined to reach the issue during the show cause hearing because he had issued a search warrant for that.the government agreed that it had sought the seizure warrant to avoid litigating the issue of whether the order reached the encryption keys,but contended that the order and the june order required the encryption keys to be produced j.
after levison assured the district court that he would permit the government to install a device on lavabit system,the district court did not inquire further into whether levison would turn over his encryption keys.the district court concluded that it need not yet resolve the matter because levison had not been served with the seizure warrant and had not been called before the grand jury as was anticipated by the grand jury subpoena.the district court then scheduled another hearing for july to confirm that lavabit had fully complied.
after the show cause hearing,lavabit did permit the government to install a device.but,without the encryption keys,much of the information transmitted to and from lavabit servers remained encrypted,indecipherable,and useless.the device was therefore unable to identify what data within the encrypted data stream was and properly collectable.
shortly before the scheduled hearing on compliance,lavabit and levison,now again represented by counsel,moved to quash the seizure warrant.in relevant part,their motion argued that the warrant amounted to an impermissible general warrant barred by the fourth amendment sought immaterial information and imposed an undue burden on lavabit business.
in response,the government contended that the warrant merely d and clarif ied lavabit obligations under the pen trap act to provide that same information.the government noted that four different legal obligations,including the order and the june order,required lavabit to produce the encryption keys.lavabit motion to quash,however,did not mention either the order or the june order.
on august,over a month after the order first issued,the district court held its second hearing the court remarked that t he difficulty or the ease in obtaining the information did have anything to do with whether or not the government lawfully entitled to that information.for that reason,the district court denied the motion to quash the government very narrow,specific warrant.the court also found it reasonable that the government would not collect all users data,even if the encryption keys would practically enable the government to access all that data.
the district court then entered an order the august order directing lavabit to turn over its encryption keys.the order further instructed lavabit to provide the government any other information,facilities,and technical assistance necessary to accomplish the installation and use of the device as required by the july,seizure warrant and the order.the august order directed lavabit and levison to turn over the encryption keys by pm on august.
despite the unequivocal language of the august order,lavabit dallied and did not comply.just before the pm august deadline,for instance,levison provided the fbi with an page printout containing largely illegible characters in point type,which he represented to be lavabit encryption keys.the government instructed lavabit to provide the keys in an electronic format by the morning of august.lavabit did not respond.
on august,nearly six weeks after the government first obtained the order,the government moved for sanctions against levison and lavabit for their continuing failure to comply with the court order entered august.the government sought penalties of a day until lavabit provided the encryption keys to the government.the district court granted the motion for sanctions that day.
two days later,levison provided the keys to the government.by that time,six weeks of data regarding the target had been lost 
lavabit and levison timely appealed,and we have jurisdiction under.see united states myers,cir a order may be immediately appealed by a non party to the underlying action.see also buffington balt,cir explaining that civil contempt includes a fine that would be payable to the court when the contemnor can avoid paying the fine simply by performing the affirmative act required by the court order.we further note that the appeal presents a live controversy even though lavabit has now complied with the underlying orders,as lavabit and levison still face potential assessments based on their conduct in refusing to comply with the district court orders.see in re grand jury subpoena t,cir.
as a party appealing from a civil contempt order,may ask us to consider whether contempt was proper and may challenge the order alleged to have been violated unless earlier appellate review was available.united states myers,at.in the ordinary case,we review the ultimate decision as to whether the contempt was proper for abuse of discretion,the underlying legal questions de novo,in re grand jury subpoena,at,and any factual findings for clear error,oaks of mid city resident council sebelius,cir united states peoples,cir same as to criminal contempt.lavabit failed,however,to raise most of its present arguments before the district court that failure significantly alters the standard of review.
in the district court,lavabit failed to challenge the statutory authority for the order,or the order itself,in any way.yet on appeal,lavabit suggests that the district court demand for the encryption keys required more assistance from it than the statute requires.lavabit never mentioned or alluded to the statute below,much less the district court authority to act under that statute.in fact,with the possible exception of an undue burden argument directed at the seizure warrant,lavabit never challenged the district court authority to act under either the statute or the sca.
the matter of what questions may be taken up and resolved for the first time on appeal is one left primarily to the discretion of the courts of appeals,to be exercised on the facts of individual cases.singleton wulff.in this circuit,we exercise that discretion sparingly.our settled rule is simple a bsent exceptional circumstances,we do not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal.robinson equifax info,llc,cir see also agra,gill duffus,benson,cir we will not accept on appeal theories that were not raised in the district court except under unusual circumstances.
when a party in a civil case fails to raise an argument in the lower court and instead raises it for the first time before us,we may reverse only if the newly raised argument establishes fundamental error or a denial of fundamental justice.stewart hall,cir.fundamental error is more limited than the plain error standard that we apply in criminal cases.accord shcherbakovskiy da capo al fine,cir to meet this fundamental error standard,a party must demonstrate even more than is necessary to meet the plain error standard in a criminal trial.so,when a party in a civil case fails to meet the standard,we can say with confidence that he has not established fundamental error.see,in re celotex,cir describing the criminal standard as a minimum standard that must be met before undertaking discretionary review of a waived argument in a civil case 
thus,we may use the criminal,standard articulated by united states olano,as something of an intermediate step in a civil case.see,brickwood contractors,datanet eng g,cir applying olano standard in civil case.under that familiar standard,we can not reverse if the party fails to establish there is an error the error is plain the error affects substantial rights and the court determines that the error seriously affects the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.celotex,at.even the lesser showing needed for p lain error review is strictly circumscribed,and meeting all four prongs is difficult,as it should be.united states byers,cir quotation marks and alteration omitted.
we employ these rules not to trap unwary litigants,but to advance several important and obvious purposes.wheatley wicomico,cir.among other things,forfeiture and waiver rules offer respect for the integrity of the lower court,avoid unfair surprise to the other party,and acknowledge the need for finality in litigation and conservation of judicial resources.holly hill farm,at.our sister circuits have suggested other reasons beyond these waiver rules ensure that the parties develop the necessary evidence below,in re diet drugs prod.liab,cir,and prevent parties from getting two bites at the apple by raising two distinct arguments,fleishman cont l cas,cir see also htc ipcom gmbh,kg,collecting cases.the supreme court has likewise warned us not to lightly dismiss the many interests underlying preservation requirements.see,wood milyard,due regard for the trial court processes and time investment is also a consideration appellate courts should not overlook.exxon shipping baker,t he complexity of a case does not eliminate the value of waiver and forfeiture rules,which ensure that parties can determine when an issue is out of the case,and that litigation remains,to the extent possible,an orderly progression.
forfeiture and waiver principles apply with equal force to contempt proceedings.see,in re gates,cir applying standard to unpreserved claim of error in criminal contempt proceedings united states neal,cir same.if anything,t he axiom that an appellate court will not ordinarily consider issues raised for the first time on appeal takes on added significance in the context of contempt.in re bianchi,f d,cir internal citation omitted.after all,d enying the court of which a party stands in contempt the opportunity to consider the objection or remedy is in itself a contempt of that court authority and an obstruction of its processes.id.quotation marks omitted.
lavabit argues that it preserved an appellate challenge to the order when levison objected to turning over the encryption keys at the initial show cause hearing.we disagree.
in making his statement against turning over the encryption keys to the government,levison offered only a remark i have only ever objected to turning over the ssl keys because that would compromise all of the secure communications in and out of my network,including my own administrative traffic.this statement which we recite here verbatim constituted the sum total of the only objection that lavabit ever raised to the turnover of the keys under the order.we can not refashion this vague statement of personal preference into anything remotely close to the argument that lavabit now raises on appeal a challenge to the district court fundamental authority under the statute.levison statement to the district court simply reflected his personal angst over complying with the order,not his present appellate argument that questions whether the district court possessed the authority to act at all.
arguments raised in a trial court must be specific and in line with those raised on appeal.to preserve an issue for appeal,an objection or argument must be timely and state the grounds on which it is based.kollsman,a div.of sequa cohen,cir.it follows then that an objection on one ground does not preserve objections based on different grounds.united states massenburg,cir similarly,a party does not go far enough by raising a objection or claim.i f a party wishes to preserve an argument for appeal,the party must press and not merely intimate the argument during the proceedings before the district court.dallas gas partners,prospect energy,cir see also united states bennett,cir finding defendant waived argument where his argument below was too general to alert the district court to the specific objection.
in arguing that it can still pursue the issue despite its failure to raise any specific argument challenging the order below,lavabit gives far too broad a reading to yee city of escondido.yee explained that,o nce a federal claim is properly presented,a party can make any argument in support of that claim parties are not limited to the precise arguments they made below.at.we,too,have recognized our need to consider any theory plainly encompassed by the submissions in the underlying litigation.volvo constr.equip,clm equip,cir.
yet lavabit neither plainly nor properly identified these issues for the district court,and a comparison between this case and yee illustrates why.in yee,the parties raised before the district court a fifth amendment takings claim premised on physical occupation.at.before the supreme court,however,they argued that the taking occurred by regulation.id.the difference in form there was immaterial because the appealing party asked both courts to evaluate the same fundamental question whether the challenged acts constituted a taking.in other words,the in yee raised two variations of the same basic argument.in contrast,the difference in the case at bar is marked and material lavabit never challenged the statutory validity of the order below or the court authority to act.to the contrary,lavabit only point below alluded to the potential damage that compliance could cause to its chosen business model 
neither the district court nor the government therefore had any signal from lavabit that it contested the district court authority under the statute to enter the order or the june order.in fact,by conceding at the august hearing that the g overnment was entitled to the requested information,it likely led the district court to believe exactly the opposite.accordingly,lavabit failed to preserve any issue for appeal related to the statute or the district court authority to act under it.see nelson adams usa,t he general rule that issues must be raised in lower courts in order to be preserved as potential grounds of decision in higher courts requires that the lower court be fairly put on notice as to the substance of the issue.
lavabit contends that,even if it failed to raise a cognizable objection to the order in the district court,then the government and the district court induced it to forfeit its present challenges.we know of no case recognizing an invited or induced waiver exception to the traditional forfeiture and waiver principles.lavabit has not identified any basis for such an exception,other than its subjective belief that it is now in an unfair position.but that is not an argument that permits us to cast aside the interests underlying our preservation requirements.hawkins united states,cir finality is an institutional value and it is tempting to subordinate such a value to the equities of the individual case.but there are dangers,especially if so vague a term as fairness is to be the touchstone.
in any event,we disagree with lavabit factual premise,as neither the government nor the district court induced or invited lavabit to waive anything.
the government did not lead lavabit to believe that the order was somehow irrelevant.to be sure,the government focused more on the seizure warrant than the order at certain times in the proceedings.at the august hearing,for example,the government concentrated on the seizure warrant and the grand jury subpoena because the motion under consideration lavabit motion to quash only addressed those two objects.the government,however,never stopped contending that the order,in and of itself,also required lavabit to turn over the encryption keys.for example,the government specifically invoked the order in its written response to lavabit motion to quash by noting that four separate legal obligations required lavabit to provide its encryption keys,including the order and the june order.if lavabit truly believed the order to be an invalid request for the encryption keys,then the government continuing reliance on that order should have spurred lavabit to challenge it.
the district court actions also put lavabit on notice that the order implicated lavabit encryption keys.the june order referred to encryption,and the august order compelling lavabit to turn over its keys relied upon two independent sources of authority the july,seizure warrant and the june,order.emphasis added.the august order,with its plain and unequivocal citation to the order,informed lavabit that the order needed to be addressed because it was the cited authority for the turnover of the encryption keys.even if the district court had earlier equivocated about whether the order reached lavabit encryption keys,those doubts were dispelled once the august order issued when the terms of a judgment conflict with either a written or oral opinion or observation,the judgment must govern.murdaugh volkswagen,first bank of,cir see also id.courts must speak by orders and judgments,not by opinions,whether written or oral,or by chance observations or expressed intentions made by courts during,before or after trial,or during argument.at an absolute minimum,if lavabit believed that the turnover of the keys was invalid under the order,then it should have acted once the district court august order issued.it did not.
lavabit tenders other reasons why we should exercise our discretion to hear its statute argument,but we find no merit in those arguments.we doubt that lavabit listed factors could ever justify de novo review of an argument raised for the first time on appeal in a civil case in this circuit.
many years ago,this circuit held that,at a minimum,the requirements of the standard must be satisfied before we may exercise our discretion to correct an error not raised below in a civil case.in re celotex,at emphasis added.it makes no difference then that lavabit statute argument presents a supposedly pure question of law reply br,or that lavabit was unrepresented during some of the proceedings below,or that lavabit believes this case to be one of public concern reply br.
at the outset,we do not agree that the issue is a purely legal one.at the very least,interpreting the statute provision would require us to consider technological questions of fact that have little to do with pure law.but even if the question were legal,that would not alone justify our review.though some circuits will sometimes put aside the framework when a case presents this sort of question,see,villas at parkside partners city of farmers branch,cir,our precedents do not embrace that approach.to the contrary,we have taken a more structured view,recognizing that the forfeiture rule is a salutary rule even where the ground urged for reversal is a pure question of law.legg estate comm r,cir accord richison ernest,cir rejecting a party contention that a forfeited but purely legal issue could be considered outside the framework.
nor does it matter that lavabit and levison were unrepresented by counsel during parts of the proceedings below although pro se complaints and arguments are to be liberally construed,the failure to first present claims to the district court generally forecloses our consideration of these matters on appeal.united states ferguson,cir williams ozmint,cir we long have recognized that,despite our expansive consideration of the pleadings of pro se litigants,appellate courts should not permit fleeting references to preserve questions on appeal.neither this court nor the supreme court has ever suggested that procedural rules in ordinary civil litigation should be interpreted so as to excuse mistakes by those who proceed without counsel.mcneil united states.especially given lavabit relationship with various legal counsel,no reason exists to do so here 
finally,lavabit proposes that we hear its challenge to the order because lavabit views the case as a matter of immense public concern.reply br.yet there exists a perhaps greater public interest in bringing litigation to an end after fair opportunity has been afforded to present all issues of law and fact.united states atkinson.and exhuming forfeited arguments when they involve matters of public concern would present practical difficulties.for one thing,identifying cases of a public concern and concern divorced from any other consideration is a tricky task governed by no objective standards.see,tony weigand,raise or lose appellate discretion and principled decision making,suffolk trial app.advoc,describing vagueness and other problems with a public importance approach barry miller,sua sponte appellate rulings when courts deprive litigants of an opportunity to be heard,san diego,w hat is an important public interest to one court will be unimportant to another.the line will be particularly difficult to draw and will often appear nakedly political.for another thing,if an issue is of public concern,that concern is likely more reason to avoid deciding it from a litigated record.see,e,kingman park civic ass williams.cir the issue presented,however,is of sufficient public importance and complexity to counsel strongly against deciding it in this posture.carducci regan,refusing to excuse procedural waiver where case involved important questions of significance.accordingly,we decline to hear lavabit new arguments merely because lavabit believes them to be important.
in sum,lavabit assorted reasons to exercise any discretionary review authority do not convince us to review its statute arguments de novo.if lavabit is to succeed on its statute claim,it must at least show plain error.
the statute requires law enforcement authorities to obtain court orders to install and use pen registers and devices.the requirements for these orders are less onerous than the requirements that apply to government requests for the content of communications,as devices do not collect content but only information associated with the transfer of that content as to internet communications,devices collect only metadata,such as an email to and from fields,the date and time of transmissions,and user login information.see,forbidding pen registers and devices from collecting the contents of any communication.
the statute also includes provisions requiring third parties to provide technical assistance to the government in connection with those devices.see a,b.under the provision,for instance,lavabit must provide 
all information,facilities,and technical assistance necessary to accomplish the installation of the pen register unobtrusively and with a minimum of interference with the services that the person so ordered by the court accords the party with respect to whom the installation and use is to take place.
