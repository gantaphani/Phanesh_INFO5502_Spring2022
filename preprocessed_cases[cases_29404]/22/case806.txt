storage technology corporation storagetek owns patent and,both relating to data communication networks.storagetek filed a patent infringement action in the united states district court for the western district of wisconsin against cisco systems,and cisco technology,collectively,cisco alleging infringement of both patents.after the case was transferred to the northern district of california,the district court held a markman hearing and entered a claim construction order.subsequently,the district court granted cisco motions for summary judgment of noninfringement of the and patents.we affirm the district court judgment of noninfringement of the patent as well as the decision to transfer the case to the northern district of california.however,because the district court erred in its construction of certain limitations in the patent,we vacate the judgment of noninfringement of the patent and remand for further proceedings.
background 
modern data communication networks consist of network devices,such as switches and routers,interconnected by transmission media,such as fiber optic cables.data flowing through a network is divided into packets for transmission over the network.for example,one message may be broken down into several packets.in addition to user data,each packet includes a header,which contains several pieces of information,including information necessary for routing the packet through the network to its destination.
as each packet passes through a network device,the network device examines the header information to determine where to send the packet next.the network device may also make other decisions regarding the packet based on a set of rules or procedures known as network policies,which are set by system administrators.one such policy may be that packets belonging to certain types of messages get transmission priority over other packets.another such policy may be that packets from a particular source are not to be forwarded through the network.network policy information is typically stored in the main memory of a network device.
the patent,assigned to storagetek,relates to the efficient enforcement of network policies in a packet data network.when a packet referred to in the patent as a protocol data unit,or pdu arrives at a network device,the processor in the network device determines which network policies apply to the packet.to obviate the need for the processor to retrieve all required network policy information from main memory,which may slow down processing of packets,the invention described in the patent provides a cache memory that stores certain network policy information copied from main memory.a cache memory is a small,usually temporary,memory that can be accessed quickly,often used to store a copy of instructions or data obtained from main memory.thus in the system described in the patent,network policy information that is used frequently by the processor is stored in cache memory for easy and fast accessibility.
a processor in a network device implementing the invention of the patent examines the header of an arriving packet to determine whether,based on selection criteria,it is related to other packets that have been received.for example,packets containing data from the same message may be related.if the packet is the first of a group of related packets to be received,the network device determines whether any of the network policies in main memory apply to the packet.if so,policy identification information identifying the instance of network policy to be applied to the packet is copied from main memory into an instance classification cache,also referred to as the identification cache.the patent also describes a second cache,which stores a copy of the instance of network policy itself.when a packet related to the first packet arrives,the identification of a policy to be applied to the new packet is retrieved from the instance classification cache,and that identification information is used to retrieve the actual policy from the second cache.

b cached instance classification means,operatively coupled to the exception processing means,for caching policy identification information identifying the instance of pdu policy which is to be applied to other pdus of the pdus.
the patent,also assigned to storagetek,relates to the forwarding of packets by a network device.when a packet arrives at a network forwarding device,a processor in the device examines and processes the packet to assign it to an outbound network interface for transmission over the next link in the network.the invention of the patent adds a preprocessor to the network forwarding device.based upon information in the packet header,the preprocessor adds next operation information to the header.the packet is then passed to the processor,which forwards the packet based on the next operation information in the header.this approach reduces processing time and increases throughput of the network forwarding device.

storagetek sued cisco in the united states district court for the western district of wisconsin alleging infringement of the and patents by cisco netflow feature acceleration technology and cisco multi protocol label switching mpls technology,respectively.cisco asserted a counterclaim for infringement of its own patent as well as declaratory judgment counterclaims for noninfringement,invalidity,and unenforceability of storagetek patents.cisco later stipulated to the dismissal of its infringement and unenforceability counterclaims.the district court granted cisco motion to transfer venue pursuant to a and transferred the case to the northern district of california.
after a markman hearing,the united states district court for the northern district of california issued a claim construction order.storage tech.cisco,no.si,claim construction order.relevant to this appeal,the district court construed the term network policy in the claims of the patent to mean a filtering or auditing rule which determines if and why a pdu should be forwarded.in claim of the patent,the district court construed the step of caching policy identification information to mean storing information that identifies and is used to retrieve a separately cached instance of network policy.in other words,the court construed claim to require two caches,one for storing information identifying a policy,and a second for storing a copy of the policy itself.regarding apparatus claim,the court construed cached instance classification means under,to mean the structure or equivalent structure described in the specification of the patent for caching policy identification information identifying the instance of pdu policy which is to be applied to other pdus of the pdus.
the district court also construed the term next operation information in the claims of the patent to mean information that specifies the particular type of operation to be performed by the network forwarding device.the information is added to the media header information and must include information to accomplish forwarding of the pdu in the communication network.the court rejected storagetek contention that next operation information relates to operations to be performed downstream of the preprocessor,holding instead that the preprocessor and the forwarding processor,which uses the next operation information added by the preprocessor,must be part of the same forwarding device.
cisco moved for summary judgment of noninfringement of the and patents,which the district court granted on february.storage tech.cisco,no.si,order granting motion for summary judgment of noninfringement.regarding the patent,the district court found that cisco netflow technology has only one cache,and therefore does not literally infringe the asserted claims,which the district court construed to require separate caches for policy identification information and the policy itself.addressing the patent,the district court found that there could be no literal infringement by cisco mpls technology because one network device,a label edge router ler,applies an mpls label alleged to be the claimed next operation information to a packet,and a second network device,a label switch router lsr,forwards the packet based on the mpls label.thus,the court found,mpls does not add next operation information to be performed by the network device that added the label,as required by the asserted claims.the district court further held that arguments made during prosecution of the patent estopped storagetek from asserting a theory of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.
storagetek timely appeals the district court grant of cisco motions for summary judgment of noninfringement with respect to both the and patents.storagetek also appeals the decision by the united states district court for the western district of wisconsin to transfer the case to the northern district of california.
discussion 
before we reach the merits of this case,we first must attend to our jurisdiction.jim arnold hydrotech.at oral argument,this court informed counsel for both parties that it appeared from the record that cisco counterclaims for invalidity of the and patents remained pending in the district court and that the district court had not entered a final judgment or certification pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.although these circumstances raised a question as to whether we had jurisdiction over the appeal,we nevertheless heard oral argument.shortly thereafter,this court by letter requested counsel to inform the court as to the status of any counterclaims on the date notice of appeal was filed and whether the district court had entered a final judgment or rule b certification on or before that date.
in a joint response to that letter,the parties informed us that on the date storagetek filed the notice of appeal in this case,cisco invalidity counterclaims remained pending in the district court.as of that date,a final judgment had not been entered by the district court,nor had an appropriate judgment or certification been entered by the district court pursuant to rule b.the parties also informed us that they had jointly submitted a stipulation and order to the district court requesting the court to enter a rule b certificate nunc pro tunc to february,the date on which the district court granted summary judgment of noninfringement in favor of cisco.the district court complied with the parties request,signing the order and entering judgment under rule b nunc pro tunc to february.storage tech.cisco,no.si,judgment pursuant to rule b.
under federal circuit law,which we apply instead of regional circuit law to issues involving rule b certification and our appellate jurisdiction,the district court december,rule b certification relates back to february,and ripens the premature notice of appeal.see state contracting eng g florida.accordingly,we conclude that we have jurisdiction to decide the appeal in this case.

storagetek challenges the district court construction of two limitations in the claims of the patent caching policy identification information and protocol data unit pdu network policy.we address each in turn.
claim of the patent includes the step of caching policy identification information.storagetek contends that the district court erred when it construed that claim language to require not only caching of policy identification information,but also caching of an instance of network policy.cisco argues,as it did before the district court,that the written description and prosecution history make it clear that the invention involves utilizing the cached policy identification information to retrieve a cached instance of policy,and therefore the claims must be construed to require the instance of policy to be cached.as discussed below,we agree with storagetek that the district court interpretation of claim was overly narrow.
our analytical focus must begin with and remain centered on the language of the claims themselves.digital,telegenix.claim is a method claim with two an instance of network policy to be applied to related pdus based on the contents of one pdu,and caching policy identification information identifying that instance of network policy.the claim does not include any step relating to caching the instance of network policy or any limitation indicating that the instance of network policy is stored in or retrieved from a cache.according to its plain language,the limitation construed by the district court,caching policy identification information,requires only the identification information,not the instance of network policy,to be cached.
the district court based its interpretation in part on the presence of the phrase policy caching method or policy cache in the preamble of every independent claim of the patent.whether to treat a preamble as a claim limitation is determined on the facts of each case in light of the claim as a whole and the invention described in the patent.see catalina mktg.int l.in the case of the patent,the written description consistently uses the terms policy caching method and policy cache to refer to the invention as a whole,not to the specific step of storing an instance of network policy or to the cache that stores the instance of network policy,which the written description refers to as the instance policy cache.similarly,the term policy caching method or policy cache in the preamble of each claim serves as a convenient label for the invention as a whole.see ims,haas automation,holding that preamble phrase control apparatus does not limit claim scope when it merely gives a descriptive name to the claimed invention.in contrast,any claim in the patent that requires the instance of policy to be cached includes an explicit instance policy cache limitation in the body of the claim.see patent,claim includes instance policy cache means.thus,the preamble terms policy caching method or policy cache do not limit claim scope and simply refer to the invention set forth in the body of the claim,which,depending on the limitations provided in a particular claim,may include caching policy identification information or caching an instance of policy or both.claim includes only the step of caching policy identification information,and therefore it was improper for the district court to further limit the scope of claim based on language in the preamble.
the district court also relied on the written description,prosecution history,and a declaration by cisco expert witness regarding the purpose of the invention to define claim to require a cache for the instance of network policy.in so doing,the district court disregarded the rule that while proper claim construction requires an examination of the written description and relevant prosecution history to determine the meaning of claim limitations,additional limitations may not be read into the claims.see,prima tek ii,polypap,comark communications,harris.we have recognized that there is sometimes a fine line between reading a claim in light of the written description and relevant prosecution history,and reading a new limitation into the claim.comark,at,at.however,interpreting what is meant by a word in a claim is not to be confused with adding an extraneous limitation,which is improper.intervet,quoting du pont de nemours phillips petroleum.
cisco relies on the fact that figure of the patent shows two cached instance classification cache and a cached instance policy support its theory that claim requires the instance of network policy to be cached.this argument,however,ignores figure,which is a flowchart showing the steps of the inventive method.figure includes a step for caching policy identification information,but notably does not show a step for caching an instance of network policy.given the lack of explicit language in claim requiring the instance of network policy to be cached and the absence of any such step from figure,the written description is not a basis for construing the claim as requiring the step of caching an instance of network policy.
cisco use of the prosecution history to narrow the meaning of claim is also misplaced.during prosecution,the patent applicants stated that in the invention as recited in claims,and,the instance of network policy and the policy identification information are both cached.while on its face this statement appears to limit claim scope,it can not do so absent some claim language referring to the caching of the instance of network policy.the prosecution history statement describes generally the features of the claimed invention and erroneously suggests that the independent claims include a cache for the instance of network policy.the applicants inaccurate statement can not override the claim language itself,which controls the bounds of the claim.see rambus infineon techs.ag,holding that general statement introducing new limitations does not limit scope of claims not amended to include the new limitations intervet,at,at holding that erroneous statement made during prosecution does not limit claim scope because t he claims themselves control.
finally,the district court improperly relied on extrinsic evidence in the form of a declaration by cisco expert to support its construction of claim.resort to extrinsic evidence is appropriate only when an ambiguity remains after consulting the intrinsic evidence of record.vitronics conceptronic.moreover,the district court did not use the extrinsic evidence to assist in defining a claim limitation,but rather used it to limit claim scope based on the purpose of the invention,which is impermissible.see comark,at,at rejecting defendant attempt to limit claim term to its functional purpose as disclosed in the preferred embodiment.
storagetek also asserted claim against cisco.claim recites a cached instance classification means for caching policy identification information.the district court correctly interpreted this limitation as the structure or equivalent structure described in the specification of the patent for caching policy identification information identifying the instance of pdu policy which is to be applied to other pdus of the pdus.the court also cited to figure of the patent,indicating that the corresponding structure described in the patent was element,the cached instance classification cache.significantly,the district court did not include as part of the corresponding structure the second cache shown in figure cached instance policy cache element.instead,the court held that the cached instance policy cache corresponds to an additional limitation found in dependent claim instance policy cache means.we agree with the district court claim construction.thus,although figure shows two caches,the language of claim requires only one cache and requires only the policy identification information,and not the instance of policy,to be cached.
storagetek also challenges the district court construction of protocol data unit pdu network policy,which appears in both claim and claim.the parties agree that the term refers to a rule or procedure set by a system administrator.the point of contention is whether the term should be limited to filtering and auditing rules or should be more broadly construed to include rules related to routing,bridging,and switching functions.the district court accepted cisco position that the written description and prosecution history limited the meaning to filtering and auditing rules.
we begin with the ordinary meaning of the disputed claim term.inverness med.switz.gmbh princeton biomeditech.storagetek asserts,and cisco does not dispute,that the ordinary meaning of network policy as understood by one skilled in the art is a rule or procedure set by a network system administrator.neither party has proposed a contrary definition from a dictionary or technical treatise.see.digital,at,at.rather,both parties direct our attention to the intrinsic record,the written description and the prosecution history.
the first sentence of the background of the invention section states that routing,bridging,switching,filtering,and auditing functions of pdus are handled by network policies.patent,ll.this information is repeated at column,lines these routing,bridging,switching,filtering,and auditing functions are also governed by policy set forth by rules and procedures set by system administrators and the like.these rules and procedures are generally known as communications network policies.although the summary of the invention section specifies only filtering and auditing rules as network policies,they are presented as examples,examples of such policies are filtering,forward or not forward the pdu auditing,send a copy of the pdu to a third party.when read in context,the statement relied upon by the district court from the next paragraph,that an instance of network policy is performed by filtering or auditing the pdus,refers back to the examples described in the previous paragraph and does not narrow the definition provided in the background section.see,ll.based on our independent review of the patent,we conclude that the definition of the term network policy provided in the written description is a rule or procedure set by a system administrator governing one or more of a routing,bridging,switching,filtering,or auditing function.
the prosecution history does not warrant a narrower claim construction.in response to a rejection over a prior art reference disclosing a device for bridging local area networks,the patent applicants stated unlike a bridge,which analyzes source or destination addresses to determine where data should be forwarded,the pre
