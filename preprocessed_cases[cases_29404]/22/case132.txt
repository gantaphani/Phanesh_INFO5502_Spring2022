opinion of the court 
the township of lyndhurst,new jersey,brought this putative class action in its capacity as a taxing authority on behalf of itself and all other similarly situated new jersey municipalities,townships,and counties it alleges that defendants all companies who operate hotel booking sites online owe the putative class unpaid hotel occupancy taxes the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss on prudential standing grounds,concluding that lyndhurst did not have the right to sue for the alleged taxes owed under the relevant statutory scheme.instead,that enforcement right was given to the state of new jersey director of taxation the director,aided by the state attorney general the attorney general for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
statutory background 
lyndhurst is a political subdivision of the state of new jersey.as a general principle,it is established beyond question that such municipalities,being created by the state,have no powers save those delegated to them by the legislature and the state constitution.dome realty,paterson,this case involves two distinct powers under n.stat.ann.f to the enabling act the power to enact a local hotel occupancy tax and the subsequent power to enforce it.the text of the enabling act speaks to each of these powers,as well as to the substantive reach of any ordinance enacted under this statutory scheme.
a.the enactment power and the hotel occupancy tax substantive reach 
the enabling act grant of power to enact local hotel occupancy taxes varies based on the class of the political subdivision at issue.for general classification purposes,cities of the first class have populations of greater than,while cities of the second class have populations between and.see stat.ann.a,b it is undisputed that lyndhurst is a city of the second class and that its enactment power is governed by stat.ann.f,which permits it to adopt an ordinance imposing a tax on charges of rent for every occupancy of a room or rooms in a hotel.emphasis added lyndhurst exercised this authority by adopting that is,enacting such a tax,as did each member of the putative plaintiff class even as the new jersey legislature provided lyndhurst with the power to enact such a tax ordinance,it the legislature also placed limits on the ordinance substantive reach.in short,the enabling act only permitted lyndhurst to impose a local hotel occupancy tax on transactions that were already subject to the sales and use tax act,which levied a statewide tax on t he rent for every occupancy of a room or rooms in a hotel in new jersey.stat.ann.b d.the tax was to be collected by the person collecting rent from the hotel customer,id.f a,which included every operator of a hotel,id.b w.given this scheme,although the substantive reach of lyndhurst hotel occupancy tax remains a matter of dispute,its power to enact such a tax is not.
b.the enforcement power 
once lyndhurst passed its hotel occupancy tax,the enabling act also provided for a specific enforcement regime.by the terms of the statute,only the director a state of new jersey official is given the explicit right to enforce lyndhurst hotel occupancy tax the director of the division of taxation shall collect and administer any tax imposed pursuant to the provisions of f.id.f emphasis added.interestingly,the enabling act provides a distinct enforcement regime for cities of the first class and those of the second class with an international airport as these municipalities may enforce directly their local hotel occupancy taxes.see id.e outlining the enforcement regime for cities of the first class and cities of the second class with international airports.the same enforcement power is not given to other second class cities like lyndhurst.as noted,this power resides with the director.
in carry ing out his authority to enforce lyndhurst hotel occupancy tax,the director is given all the powers granted in the sales and use tax act.id.f.this includes the power to determine the amount of tax owed by a taxpayer.id.b emphasis added.indeed,the act provides that,i f a return required is not filed,or if a return when filed is incorrect or insufficient,the amount of tax due shall be determined by the d irector from such information as may be available.id.emphasis added.s uch determinations shall finally and irrevocably fix the tax unless the person against whom it is assessed shall apply to the d irector for a hearing,or unless the d irector of his own motion shall redetermine the same.id.the act also includes a specific mechanism for dealing with delinquent taxpayers whenever any person required to collect tax shall fail to collect or pay over any tax,the attorney general shall,upon the request of the d irector,bring or cause to be brought an action to enforce the payment of same on behalf of the state of new jersey id.at b a.in the end,the question remains whether this explicit grant of enforcement power to the director aided by the attorney general precludes lyndhurst from bringing its own enforcement action against private parties in federal court.
ii.facts and procedural history 
this case involves the propriety of the merchant model employed by defendants,whereby they acquire inventories of hotel rooms at negotiated rates and then rent those rooms to consumers at higher rates lyndhurst alleges that defendants calculate the amount owed under lyndhurst hotel occupancy tax based on the negotiated rate paid by a defendant for rooms the wholesale rate,not the higher rate that the consumers are subsequently charged the retail rate.defendants then pay the tax to the hotel,which in turn remits it to the state taxing authority.lyndhurst alleges that this scheme,which understates the amount of taxes it seeks to exact,is a form of tax evasion.
at the same time,there is no evidence in the record that the director has ever sought to collect tax revenue under a hotel occupancy tax based on the retail rate charged to consumers by online travel booking sites.in fact,in a letter opinion the new jersey division of taxation has concluded that online booking agents are not subject to the hotel occupancy tax.this was in response to a ruling request by one defendant 
lyndhurst brought this putative class action in june.it asserted claims for the collection of unpaid taxes,conversion,and unjust enrichment,as well as for the imposition of a constructive trust and a declaratory judgment.in august,defendants moved to dismiss the complaint under.b and.in their motion,defendants argued that lyndhurst lacked standing to bring the action the director who was the proper party to bring suit,with the aid of the attorney general had already determined that defendants were not subject to the hotel occupancy tax even if lyndhurst had standing,it had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies and lyndhurst claims failed as a matter of law.
in march,the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on prudential standing grounds discussed below.it concluded that lyndhurst was attempting to assert a legal right that was reserved to the director aided by the attorney general and not to lyndhurst namely,the legal right to enforce lyndhurst hotel occupancy tax by determining the amount of tax due and then collecting the related revenue.the court did not reach the remainder of defendants arguments.
lyndhurst filed a timely notice of appeal.
iii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction under,and we have jurisdiction under.we exercise plenary review over a dismissal under.b,and determine whether the allegations on the face of the complaint,taken as true,allege facts sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the d istrict c ourt.turicento am.airlines,cir.
iv.analysis 
t he question of standing in the federal courts is to be considered within the framework of article iii of the constitution,which restricts judicial power to cases or controversies.ass of data processing serv,camp,d.however,this question involves both constitutional limitations on jurisdiction and prudential limitations on its exercise.warth seldin,d.article iii standing has three elements the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact an invasion of a legally protected interest which was a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of and it must be likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.lujan defenders of wildlife,d the party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing these elements.id.at.
nevertheless,article iii standing does not answer all questions.even when it exists,courts at times deem it prudent not to confer standing to a plaintiff.though we call it prudential standing,it is actually an additional set of requirements that must be met even when standing otherwise exists.over time,we have developed yet another test for assessing when prudential standing is satisfied a plaintiff must assert his or her own legal interests rather than those of a third party courts should refrain from adjudicating abstract questions of wide public significance amounting to generalized grievances and a plaintiff must demonstrate that his or her interests are arguably within the zone of interests that are intended to be protected by the statute,rule,or constitutional provision on which the claim is based.mariana fisher,cir.like their constitutional counterparts,these judicially limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction are founded in concerns about the proper and properly limited role of the courts in a democratic society.bennett spear,d internal citations and quotation marks omitted.however,unlike their constitutional counterparts,they can be modified or abrogated by congress.id.
the district court dismissed lyndhurst suit on prudential standing grounds.in particular,it concluded that lyndhurst was not the proper party to bring the lawsuit and therefore ran afoul of our first prudential standing requirement.for the reasons that follow,we agree and therefore affirm.
article iii standing 
beginning with article iii standing,there is little question that lyndhurst satisfies the irreducible constitutional minimum of injury in fact,causation,and redressability.lujan,at.we consider each requirement in turn.
first,there is no dispute that the local hotel occupancy tax revenue that the director collects belongs to the municipalities and not to the state.when those taxes are not paid in full,the municipalities suffer an injury in fact in the form of monetary harm.see danvers motor,ford motor,cir monetary harm is a classic form of injury in fact.indeed,it is often assumed without discussion.as such,if lyndhurst is correct and it is owed additional tax revenue under its hotel occupancy tax,this constitutes both actual harm as to taxes that should have been remitted to it in the past and imminent harm with respect to taxes that should be collected for its benefit in the future.
second,there is a causal connection between defendants conduct and lyndhurst alleged harm.in lyndhurst view,defendants were required to pay hotel occupancy taxes on the retail price charged to their customers.instead,they have paid taxes based only on the wholesale rates that they had initially paid for the hotel rooms.as a result,lyndhurst contends that it has not received the full amount of taxes due under its hotel occupancy tax ordinance an injury caused by defendants conduct.
finally,this alleged injury can be redressed by a favorable decision of this court.this could be in the form of either money damages or equitable relief.
in short,lyndhurst has succeeded in making a argument that it was entitled to additional tax revenue under the substantive provisions of its hotel occupancy tax ordinance.this is enough to satisfy the threshold requirements of article iii standing.see,steel citizens for a better env t,d t he d istrict c ourt has jurisdiction if the right of the petitioners to recover under their complaint will be sustained if the laws are given one construction and will be defeated if they are given another,unless such a claim is wholly insubstantial and frivolous.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
prudential standing 
turning to prudential standing,we note at the outset our reluctance to resolve this dispute.although overtly an action between a township and private parties,this dispute involves decidedly local concerns that,in the interests of comity,we are hesitant to adjudicate,including a disagreement between the state and a local government over the meaning of new jersey tax law and the relative enforcement powers delegated to these entities by the state legislature.lyndhurst central complaint is that defendants are not paying the full money owed to it under its hotel occupancy tax.implicit is a further complaint that the director has misapplied the underlying statute or otherwise neglected his duties by not requesting enough money from defendants.in a sense,lyndhurst is the director and,through this federal action,asking us to do the same.though we must be certain not to adjudicate the se disputes unnecessarily,the statutory scheme at issue in the present case is sufficiently clear to justify wad ing into this fray albeit unenthusiastically.amato wilentz,cir.
in dismissing this case on prudential standing grounds,the district court explained that lyndhurst was not asserting its own legal interests as prescribed by the statute,but instead those of the director.at first glance,this may appear an odd proposition.after all,lyndhurst brought the current action to enforce its own properly enacted hotel occupancy tax.as such,one might argue that lyndhurst had a clear legal interest in the tax revenue it intended to collect through this enforcement action indeed,it was its own revenue under its own ordinance.
taken in isolation,this is an appealing argument.however,it fails to consider the statutory scheme as a whole,and thus construes the legal interests involved too narrowly.to understand why,we must return to the specific powers granted to lyndhurst under the enabling act.
a municipality is a creature of the state and thus necessarily subordinate to its creator,and can exercise only such powers as may be granted to it by the legislature.in re grant charter sch.application of englewood on palisades charter.this is especially true in the area of taxation.see,taxi,rutherford.law div the power of taxation,a basic right of government,is vested in the legislature and municipalities have no comparable power.even as the new jersey constitution directs that grants of power to municipalities be construed liberally in favor of the local government,state crawley,where the legislature has adopted a series of statutes which spell out in comprehensive fashion the powers and rights of a municipalit y,those statutes set forth the exclusive means available to a municipality to enforce tax liabilities,dome realty,emphasis added.as such,w hen a municipality enters the field of enforcement of tax collections,its power is limited by the state legislation on the subject.see also murphy hollander,where the l egislature has provided a special method for the collection of taxes,such is ordinarily an exclusive procedure,and remedies based upon general legal rules may not be invoked.great adventure,div.of taxation,tax strict adherence to statutory requirements is mandated in tax matters because they involve exigencies of taxation and the administration of government.
given these principles,lyndhurst enforcement power turns on the relevant powers delegated to it by the state.to repeat,the enabling act itself did not grant lyndhurst any direct enforcement powers certainly none explicitly.the new jersey legislature silence on this point takes on added significance when the provisions of the enabling act governing lyndhurst are contrasted with those governing cities of the first class and those of the second class with an international airport.for those two groups,the principal provision reads as follows 
the governing body of any city of the first class or the governing body of any city of the second class in which there is located a terminal of an international airport may mak
