the circus impresario,barnum,is famously reputed to have said that there a sucker born every minute.that droll commentary on the human condition,whether or not fairly attributed to barnum appears to be as insightful in as in business transactions.this conclusion is borne out by the case at hand,which involves an internet fraud.
in the appeal proper,we are asked to consider allegations of instructional and sentencing error.the overarching themes are those of chicanery and greed.thoroughly assured by a careful canvass of the record,we affirm the judgment below.
background 
beginning in march of,michael deppe commenced a series of transactions in which he offered rolex watches over the internet in exchange for funds directly to his bank account.by december of,he had engaged in such transactions and had snared roughly in payments.but there was a catch not a single customer had received a watch.
an investigation uncovered the following scenario.upon receipt of funds in the stipulated amount,the appellant would ship a package.the customer would receive tracking information for the shipment.in fact,however,the package would deliberately be sent to an incorrect address within the customer zip code.this artifice worked because the tracking information only indicated to the customer that a package had been sent to his zip code it did not reveal the intended destination with any greater specificity.when and if the package caught up with the customer,it invariably proved to contain only crumpled newspaper or worthless baseball cards.
by march of,the rolex scheme had been laid waste,and a state prosecutor had charged the appellant with nineteen counts of larceny.he was not detained,though,on the condition that he no longer conduct business through the instrumentality of a computer.
the fall of saw the appellant contravene the state court bail order.he teamed up with william englehart and entered a new line of business.their fledgling firm,called aceprosports,aspired to sell sports merchandise through internet intermediaries like ebay and paypal.
initially,each sale went off without a hitch,and aceprosports garnered power seller honors from ebay.in early two weeks before the super d√©nouement began.at that juncture,the company started selling nonexistent tickets to the game.the super bowl scheme netted nearly for tickets that the partners never possessed.while englehart made a few refunds,the vast majority of customers lost their deposits.
on february,a federal grand jury indicted the appellant on eight counts of wire fraud,and two counts of mail fraud,id,all related to the rolex swindle.exactly five weeks later,the grand jury handed up a superseding indictment that added four counts of wire fraud and two counts of mail fraud growing out of the super bowl scheme.
the appellant initially maintained his total innocence.then,on march,he pleaded guilty to the ten counts that implicated the rolex fraud.the six super bowl counts remained pending.
a jury trial ensued.the trial evidence featured by the two erstwhile partners.the government theory of the case was that the appellant had falsely assured englehart that he the appellant had found a legitimate source of super bowl tickets and had bilked englehart out of the money paid by prospective purchasers.for his part,the appellant sought to erase this portrait of englehart as the perfect dupe.he asserted that englehart helped with many of the sales himself,controlled the company bank account and cash flow,and forged receipts to make it appear that the appellant had siphoned off the proceeds of the scheme.
the government dropped one of the six remaining counts.as to the rest,the jury apparently accepted the government version of the relevant events on may,it convicted the appellant on each of the five submitted counts.
the conceded counts and the tried counts were grouped for purposes of sentencing.without objection,the district court fixed the appellant adjusted offense level at.the court then declined to grant the appellant a reduction for acceptance of responsibility,see ussg a placed him in criminal history category i arrived at a guideline sentencing range gsr of months and imposed a incarcerative term.the court also fined the appellant,levied a special assessment,ordered restitution in the amount of,and set a period of supervised release.this timely appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
we begin our substantive analysis with the appellant claim of instructional error.we then proceed to consider his twin claims of sentencing error.
jury instructions.
the appellant complaint about the jury instructions has its genesis in an original instruction given to the jury after both sides had rested and counsel had delivered their summations.the court stated 
the defendant contends that another person was responsible for any wrongful acts that may have occurred in this case.the fact that someone else may have had the requisite intent to commit mail or wire fraud does not,by itself,constitute a defense or an excuse for deppe.however,you may consider evidence of the intent and conduct of other parties to the extent that such evidence bears on the issue of whether deppe himself had the requisite intent and committed the crimes charged.
the appellant seasonably objected to this instruction,asserting that whatever the indictment might say,the government had presented its case as one in which englehart had been duped,yet the instruction invited the jurors to convict even if they found that englehart had the fraud.deeming this objection,the district court gave the following supplementary instruction before the start of deliberations 
the indictment charges a scheme to defraud,both in the form of mail fraud and wire fraud,and it charges it in a particular way,and the way it charges it is that deppe is criminally culpable,and no other person is criminally culpable,and that is what you are to decide,whether the government has proved beyond a reasonable doubt the particular scheme charged in the indictment.
thus instructed,the jury retired to deliberate.
shortly thereafter,the jurors requested clarification of the supplementary instruction.the court brought them back into the courtroom,candidly acknowledged that its supplementary instruction might have been a little bit looser than it should have been,and bade the jurors to focus on whether the government had proven the fraudulent scheme substantially as charged in the relevant counts of the indictment.it repeated no fewer than five times words to the effect that the government must prove that there was a scheme to defraud,substantially as charged in the indictment.relatedly,the court reminded the jurors of the burden of proof.
at this point,a juror asked a somewhat garbled question anent the district court earlier instruction 
it sounds to me as though if deppe is completely solely responsible,that there no one else culpable we decide that he guilty.if we decide someone was in on this with him,then he not guilty 
by way of response,the court reiterated that the jury should focus on whether or not the scheme charged in the indictment had been proved.in search of certitude,the court repeated that admonition at least three times after the juror interposed his query.the court refused to editorialize about the scheme or otherwise to elaborate on the jury duty.despite requests by both sides,the court also declined to reduce any of its supplementary instructions to writing.
thus instructed,the jury repaired to the jury room and resumed its deliberations.it returned with a guilty verdict on all five of the pending counts.
the appellant challenge to these instructions is quixotic.his brief makes no claim that any of the instructions were incorrect as a matter of law.rather,he asserts that the instructions must have confused the jury,as evidenced by one juror expression of puzzlement expressed in the question quoted above.
objections to allegedly confusing jury instructions,when preserved for appeal,engender review for abuse of discretion.see united states nascimento,cir.if such objections have not been preserved,review applies.see.d,b see also united states vega molina,cir.in this instance,the record is murky as to whether the claim of instructional error was or was not preserved.
the relevant facts are as follows.when the district court held a sidebar conference to discuss its further instructions,the appellant injected himself into the conversation,bypassing his counsel and explaining how he thought the instructions should be worded.the court then asked defense counsel whether the appellant objection was counsel objection.counsel equivocated he disavowed the objection but then enigmatically observed that,whatever he counsel happened to think,it deppe life.
in the end,we find it unnecessary to resolve whether the claim of institutional error was preserved for appellate review.instead we assume,favorably to the appellant,that it was.on that assumption,we proceed to assay the challenged instructions for abuse of discretion.we discern none.
the most pertinent consideration is that none of the instructions harmed or prejudiced the appellant in any way.in point of fact,the only problematic instruction given to the district court first supplementary the appellant we explain briefly.
the district court at that point instructed the jury that the indictment required proof that the appellant is criminally culpable,and no other person is criminally culpable.but the government burden was not so onerous the indictment itself included charges of aiding and abetting and left ample room for scenarios in which the appellant and one or more collaborators could be held criminally responsible.when the putative error in a criminal jury instruction is such that it tends to narrow the indictment or to elevate the government burden of proof,the defendant can not be heard to complain about prejudice.see united states lizardo,cir.
viewed against this backdrop,the somewhat inarticulate question posed by the inquisitive juror fails to supply any meaningful evidence of prejudicial jury confusion.the appellant asks us to interpret this question as an indication that all the jurors believed that,if they found that no one else was guilty of the fraud,they could convict the appellant on that basis alone.this is too much of a stretch the question was ambiguous and,in all events,reflected only the tentative thought processes of one juror.it would be pure speculation to infer a mistaken view of the law from an ambiguous question posed by a single juror.ayers belmontes,d holding that individual juror questions regarding instructions,susceptible of differing interpretations,did not justify grant of habeas relief.
here,moreover,the query was interposed before the court completed its instructions.even if some modicum of juror confusion persisted at that preliminary assumption that we view as is no reason to think that the district court subsequent clarification did not dispel it.see howard jury,r g sloane,cir explaining that the critical question is whether the confusion in the jurors minds was eliminated before the verdicts were returned,not whether the jurors were confused prior to that time.this clarification,which took the form of several plainly worded repetitions of the correct rule of law,was more than adequate to eliminate any vestige of confusion that previously might have crept into the case.see,united states nishnianidze,cir united states murray,cir see also bollenbach united states.frankfurter,particularly in a criminal trial,the judge last word is apt to be the decisive word.
in sum,we adhere to the sensible principle that a jury instruction can not be read in a vacuum,but,rather,must be taken in light of the charge as a whole.ellis united states,cir.applying that rule,we find little or no evidence of jury confusion here.we are,moreover,confident that any possible risk of confusion was abated by the lower court curative instructions.we therefore detect no abuse of discretion in the instructions as a whole.
acceptance of responsibility.
we turn next to the appellant primary claim of sentencing error his entreaty that the district court improvidently refused to shrink his offense level for acceptance of responsibility.we discern no error.
under the applicable guideline,ussg a,a defendant may receive a downward adjustment if he seasonably accepts responsibility for the crime s of conviction.the burden of proving that he accepted responsibility rests squarely with the defendant.see united states,cir united states royer,cir.
acceptance of responsibility entails more than merely mouthing the vocabulary of contrition.pleading guilty in advance of trial and truthfully disclosing the details of all relevant conduct usually will constitute substantial evidence that a defendant has accepted responsibility.see ussg,cmt.but not every pretrial guilty plea guarantees the defendant the reduction.see,united states mclaughlin,cir royer,at.
when a defendant proceeds to trial and puts the government to its proof,a credit for acceptance of responsibility normally will not be available.see,united states,cir united states,cir.even so,proceeding to trial does no more than create a rebuttable presumption of.a defendant in that position still may receive credit for acceptance of responsibility in rare situations.ussg,cmt.see,united states kowal,wl,at allowing downward adjustment where defendant stipulated to facts and proceeded to trial solely to test applicability of statute to his conduct.
the standard of review for determinations is familiar.recognizing the special difficulty of discerning,on a cold record,whether a defendant expressions of remorse were in earnest,we review a sentencing court judgments about acceptance of responsibility for clear error.see united states dethlefs,cir royer,at see also ussg,cmt.explaining that the determination of the sentencing judge is entitled to great deference on review.we nonetheless maintain plenary review over related legal questions,including the interpretation of the scope that a sentencing guideline affords.see,united states talladino,cir.
in this case,we confront the hybrid situation in which a defendant has admitted guilt in advance of trial as to some of the counts in a indictment,yet proceeded to trial on other counts the appellant argues,in effect,that the district court gave too short shrift to the fact that he had pleaded to several of the charges and erroneously applied what amounted to a conclusive presumption that the reduction should not be awarded.several of our sister circuits have held that acceptance of responsibility is an all or nothing proposition and that a rebuttable presumption of that is,a presumption subject to the rare situation exception applies where a defendant pleads guilty to some but not all of the crimes charged in a indictment.see,united states thomas,cir united states chambers,cir united states ginn,cir united states kleinebreil,cir united states mcdowell,cir.but see united states wattree,cir to the extent the third circuit in mcdowell adopts a per se rule that grouping overrides all other circumstances,this court does not follow the third circuit.this court has not answered the,as we explain below,we have no occasion to do so today.
the fact of the matter is that the district to the appellant not automatically deny an credit on account of his decision to go to trial on some of the charged counts.rather,in its statements at the disposition hearing,the court referred repeatedly to an application note,which provides in pertinent part 
in determining whether a defendant qualifies for an acceptance of responsibility reduction,appropriate considerations include truthfully admitting the conduct comprising the offense s of conviction,and truthfully admitting or not falsely denying any additional relevant conduct.
ussg,cmt.a.the court concluded 
the defendant did not truthfully admit the conduct of the offensive conviction and did not truthfully admit and has falsely denied other relevant conduct 
he has sought to shift blame to others,and otherwise engaged in denials and other conduct suggesting that he had not accepted responsibility 
i do think the reduction is appropriate under the circumstances,so that objection is overruled.
these comments evince a particularized consideration of the appellant ac
