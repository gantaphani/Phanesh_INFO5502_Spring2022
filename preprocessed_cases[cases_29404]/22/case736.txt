this is a patent infringement appeal the resolution of which depends on the interpretation of whether a license exists for the technology at issue.rembrandt data technologies,lp rembrandt appeals the district court decisions regarding contract interpretation,claim construction,and the invalidity of certain claims of united states patent patent and patent collectively.the district court held that because conexant systems,conexant can trace its rights to a license originally issued to the rockwell corporation,conexant is licensed.the district court was correct in this determination.rembrandt right to enforce the against conexant modem chip customers canon,canon business solutions,and canon information technology services,collectively,canon and hewlett packard company hp was,therefore,extinguished by patent exhaustion.see,quanta computer,lg,d.the district court also correctly granted summary judgment on the invalidity of claims of the patent.the district court erred in granting summary judgment on the invalidity of claims and of the patent because genuine issues of material fact remained.thus,we,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
rembrandt is the owner by assignment of united states patent patent and patent.in,rembrandt filed a complaint in the eastern district of virginia alleging that aol,llc cavalier telephone,llc directv,canon and hp infringed the,and patents.on april,rembrandt stipulated to the dismissal with prejudice of the claims regarding the and patents.aol,llc cavalier telephone,llc and directv,have been dismissed from this case and only canon and hp remain as appellees.the two remaining claim certain types of computer modems and methods of identifying modems.
a modem is a communications device that enables a computer to transmit information over a standard telephone line.the patent,entitled fractional rate modem with trellis,issued in and describes a modem utilizing both the fractional rate encoding technique for more rapidly transferring data and the trellis encoding technique for reducing errors in data transmission.patent ll.rembrandt asserted claims and of the patent against canon and hp.the patent,entitled technique for automatic identification of a remote modem,issued in and describes using hidden identification signals to enable an originating modem to efficiently identify and connect to a remote modem.patent ll.the patent has seven claims,each of which was originally asserted against canon and hp.claims are no longer being asserted against hp.
the and patents were initially acquired by subsidiaries of at t corporation.in,at t corporation underwent a trivestiture,creating at t,ncr corporation and lucent technologies,lucent.the were transferred to lucent.in,lucent spun off paradyne corporation paradyne,which became the assignee of the and patents.in,paradyne was acquired by zhone technologies,zhone.in,zhone assigned the to rembrandt ip management,llc,which subsequently assigned the patents to rembrandt communications,lp rembrandt communications.in,less than two weeks before filing suit,rembrandt communications assigned the and patents to the.
the ownership genealogy of the and patents is documented in the chart below.
in,rockwell international corporation executed an agreement for a third party to acquire some of its aerospace and defense businesses and reorganized its corporate structure.for clarity,we refer to the pre reorganization rockwell international corporation as old rockwell and the post reorganization rockwell international corporation as new rockwell.old rockwell conveyed substantially all of its businesses and assets to new rockwell in the agreement and plan of distribution dated as of december.rockwell distribution agreement the rockwell distribution agreement stated that old rockwell contributes,grants,conveys,assigns,transfers and delivers to newco new rockwell all the company old rockwell right,title and interest in and to any and all assets of the company old rockwell,except for its aerospace and defense businesses.assets included agreements,leases,contracts licenses,franchises,permits,authorizations and approvals.
before its reorganization,old rockwell entered into a patent license agreement effective as of october,with at t corporation.license agreement.in the license agreement,at t corporation and old rockwell numerous patents,including the.the license agreement was amended by the parties through a side letter agreement granting rockwell additional rights,including sublicensing rights.
in a letter dated october,lucent,the licensor of the following the at t corporation trivestiture,acknowledged rockwell reorganization and the assignment of old rockwell rights and notification obligations under the license agreement to new rockwell.subsequent to receiving lucent letter,new rockwell made its royalty payments to lucent.in,new rockwell spun off its semiconductor systems unit,including its modem business,to conexant.the licensing of the is described in the chart below.
the telecommunication standardization sector of the international telecommunications union itu coordinates protocols for telecommunication.as part of this process,it periodically promulgates standards known as recommendations.itu recommendations regarding modems facilitate fast,reliable communication between modems from different manufacturers and of different types.manufacturers market their modems as compliant with specific itu recommendations,such as the,and protocols.although recommendations are not numbered in chronological order by date of adoption,they are designed to be backward compatible,so each successive recommendation is able to implement preceding recommendations.
rembrandt argues that the inventions of the and patents are incorporated into the protocol.in its complaint,rembrandt accuses canon and hp of infringement of the because they market office products containing modem chips capable of implementing the protocol.all of the accused products contain modem chipsets manufactured by conexant.
on june,the district court issued multiple orders that are challenged in this appeal.first,it entered an order construing some claims of the and patents.the district court also held claims of the patent invalid as indefinite for improperly mixing method and apparatus elements.the court denied canon motion for summary judgment of of the patent because rembrandt could conceivably carry its burden at trial based on circumstantial evidence.the district court also granted canon motion for summary judgment of exhaustion because conexant,canon and hp supplier of modem chips,was properly sublicensed under the license and side letter agreements,and therefore,rembrandt right to enforce the and patents was extinguished by patent exhaustion.rembrandt motion for reconsideration of some of the orders was denied.
the district court subsequently issued an opinion explaining its prior summary judgment orders.rembrandt data,lp aol,llc,d.in a footnote,the court stated that the question of whether the claims of the patent were invalid as indefinite for failing to disclose algorithms corresponding to functions set forth in the claims was moot in light of its indefiniteness ruling with respect to claims.id.at.although judgment was entered in canon favor on all claims,the court holding in its memorandum order of august,regarding the improper mixing of method and apparatus claims only applied to claims of the patent and did not address claims and of the patent.on september,canon filed a motion pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure e to amend the august,order to address claims and.the district court granted canon motion,replacing the second sentence in footnote of the august,order with the following sentence the court also holds that each of claims in the patent is invalid as indefinite for failing to disclose the necessary algorithms for the reasons set forth in its order of june.rembrandt timely appealed to this court.we have jurisdiction over rembrandt appeal pursuant to a.
discussion 
contract interpretation is a question of law reviewed de novo.lucent,gateway.the district court grant of summary judgment is also reviewed de novo.koninklijke philips elecs.cardiac sci.operating.summary judgment is appropriate when,drawing all justifiable inferences in favor of the party,there exists no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.c anderson liberty lobby,d.this court has stated that i n determining whether there is a genuine issue of material fact,the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion,with doubts resolved in favor of the opponent.ethicon endo surgery,surgical.when a motion for summary judgment is properly supported by documentary and testimonial evidence,however,the nonmoving party may not rest upon mere allegations or denials of his pleadings,but rather,must present significant probative evidence to establish a genuine issue of material fact.celotex catrett,d.
canon and hp contend that conexant was sublicensed by new rockwell.if conexant,canon and hp modem supplier,has a valid license to sell the modem chips,rembrandt rights to sue canon and hp for infringement of the are exhausted by that license.quanta computer,at holding that a licensee sale of component computer parts that substantially embodied method patents held by the patentee was authorized by the patentee and exhausted the patentee patents.rembrandt argues that conexant was not sublicensed for two reasons because new rockwell could not sublicense its rights to conexant and even if it could,the sublicense does not apply to the modem chipsets at issue.because conexant is licensed,rembrandt rights are exhausted and it can not recover from canon and hp.the district court properly held as a matter of law that new rockwell could further sublicense the to conexant.
rembrandt first argues that new rockwell could not sublicense its rights to conexant because it was not properly assigned licensing rights from old rockwell.under the license agreement,old rockwell licensed numerous patents,including the,from their original assignee,at t corporation.rembrandt also contends that the license was not transferable from new rockwell to conexant without at t corporation written consent.
in the side letter agreement,at t corporation recognized that old rockwell may at some time in the future wish to divest all or part of its business,and provided that the licenses and rights granted in the agreement may be sublicensed to any future divested present business of rockwell.in,old rockwell reorganized its operations but retained its semiconductor business,which included its modem manufacturing unit.as part of the restructuring,old rockwell divested most of its businesses and assets,including its agreements and licenses,to new rockwell.this included its rights and obligations under the license and side letter agreements,including its right to sublicense.
rembrandt argues that the license was not properly assigned from old rockwell to new rockwell because old rockwell never obtained at t written consent for that assignment.rembrandt argues that without at t consent,new rockwell could only have acquired,at most,the sublicense rights provided by the side letter agreement.appellant br.however,the side letter agreement stated that the licenses and rights granted in the agreement may be sublicensed to any future divested present business of rockwell.thus,further consent by at t was unnecessary.rembrandt concern about licenses and rights flowing infinitely to subsequent licensees so long as they share the name rockwell is misplaced.the extension of the license and rights from at t or its successors to companies related to rockwell is expressly limited in the side letter agreement to divested present businesses of old rockwell,which in this case,includes both new rockwell and conexant.
in,new rockwell divested its modem business to conexant and granted it a,irrevocable,license under all intellectual property rights,including patents under which the rockwell group had a right to license and which are used in the conduct of the business of conexant at the time of divestiture.canon mem.supp.mot.summ,ex.c,section.rembrandt argues that new rockwell had no authority to further sublicense conexant because the law does not recognize any right of a nonexclusive licensee to assign the license or to further sublicense.appellant br.
rembrandt is generally correct,unless,as here,a contract provides otherwise.the express language of the side letter agreement provided that the licenses and rights granted in the agreement may be sublicensed to any future divested present business of rockwell.old rockwell rights under the license and side letter agreements were extended by the terms of the side letter agreement to new rockwell,and in turn,conexant.such sublicensing is effective so long as the sublicensed future divested business continues to operate as a separately identifiable business selling products and services sold by the future divested business prior to its divestiture.new rockwell and conexant satisfy the side letter agreement because new rockwell sold protocolcompliant modem chips prior to spinning off conexant,and conexant,the future divested business,continues to manufacture modems.
finally,rembrandt argues that even if conexant was properly sublicensed,the sublicense does not apply to the modem chipsets at issue because they are not the products and services sold by the future divested business prior to its divestiture,products and services sold by december when old rockwell divested its semiconductor business to new rockwell.appellant br.rembrandt maintains that the district court erred by holding that the parties intended to cover modems generally,not specifically the exact types of modems in production at the time of the sublicense divestiture.
the side letter agreement states 
t he licenses and rights granted in the agreement may be sublicensed to any future divested present business of rockwell only to the extent applicable to products and services sold by the future divested business prior to its divestiture.
neither the original license agreement nor the side letter agreement refers to specific models of modems.rather,these agreements specify product types using general,functional terms.section of the license agreement provides rockwell with a license to make,have made,use,lease,sell,and import licensed products.the license agreement defines licensed products as any product including any specified combination of other products or service listed under section.section lists general categories,including data communication station systems and digital transmission systems.rembrandt,d at.although the side letter agreement does not explicitly define products and services,it requires royalty payments for old rockwell telecom sales and reportable products.the side letter agreement defines telecom sales generally as any sales of a business unit reported in rockwell international corporation annual report as of under telecommunication or its equivalent in future reports regardless of a telecom name change of the assignment of any reported business unit to another organization within rockwell.according to old rockwell annual report,old rockwell telecommunications business unit sold modems.prior to new rockwell divestiture of its modem business to conexant,it sold modem chipsets,including chipsets.conexant continues to sell chipsets.thus,the sublicensing conditions in the side letter agreement are satisfied.
as the district court correctly explained,the term products covers modems generally,not specifically the exact types of modems in production at the time of the sublicense divestiture.rembrandt,d at.the language of the license and side letter agreements favors a broad interpretation of product,rather than the narrow one rembrandt suggests.conexant sublicense thus precludes rembrandt recovery against canon and hp for infringement of the and patents.
the district court properly held claims of the patent invalid for indefiniteness,but incorrectly held claims and of the patent invalid for failure to disclose necessary algorithms because there was a genuine issue of material fact regarding the disclosure of the specification.
