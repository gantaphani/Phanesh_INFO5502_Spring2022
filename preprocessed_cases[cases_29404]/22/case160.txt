gte corporation gte seeks coverage for costs and expenses incurred in remediating its computer systems to avoid year related date recognition problems.gte contends that it is entitled to such costs and expenses pursuant to insurance policies entered into with allendale mutual insurance company allendale,affiliated fm insurance company affiliated,allianz insurance company allianz,federal insurance company federal,and industrial risk insurers iri collectively insurers.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the insurers.specifically,the district court concluded that gte remediation falls under the design defect and inherent vice exclusions of the policies the exceptions to these exclusions were inapplicable and the sue and labor and preservation of property clauses hereinafter referred to collectively as the sue and labor provisions of the policies did not entitle gte to coverage for costs incurred to prevent an excluded loss.for the reasons stated below,we will affirm the district court grant of summary judgment.
a.the problem 
the approach of the year evoked fears of various millenarian catastrophes.one such fear was the problem,and it arose from the entirely predictable fact that the passing of the year resulted in a change in all four digits of the written representation of the succeeding years.
historically,software was routinely programmed omitting the first two digits in year dates.see,steve lohr,technology and relief computers prevail in first hours of,times,january,at.there were a number of reasons for this traditional use of years as an ingredient of software programing.the shortcut originally was taken to conserve space that a entry would have occupied in a computer memory.bruce foudree,the year problem and the courts.pub.pol y.particularly in light of the high cost of storing information in the early days of computers,this shortcut provided numerous benefits,including allow ing substantial cost savings,enabling m anufacturers to make chips available to consumers at more affordable prices,and shortening the production time for chips and software.id.
with the approach of the year,however,experts voiced dire predictions that the changeover could utterly upset computer programs.this problem,commonly referred to as the problem,is essentially summarized as follows 
c omputers have trouble distinguishing between years in the and years in the.until comparatively recently,computer programs identified years by their last two digits.for example,using the standard format of,was entered as by programers.thus,on january,many computers and equipment which contain computer chips embedded chips may not be able to recognize the difference between and since both are abbreviated as.
foudree,supra,at see also jeffrey stempel,a mixed bag for chicken little analyzing year claims and insurance coverage,emory.
commentators acknowledged that while n o one can accurately predict the scope,severity,or duration of disruptions,failures have the potential to touch every sector of society and cause widespread and systemic economic failures and public panic.foudree,supra,at.a likely scenario of the consequences of the problem was described as follows 
the most common scenario for a problem involves a computer reading dates of or and either being stymied if an inanimate object can be stymied or reading the dates erroneously as or,a misreading that in the estimation of many has potentially devastating results.
for example,information systems may lock or freeze,causing interruptions and emergency repairs or perhaps even requiring the discarding of old equipment and its replacement with new.misread dates could lead to lost funds,improperly administered medicine,or failure to replenish inventory.for example,an insurance policy could be canceled,a lease terminated,or astounding late fees assessed when a computer mistakenly reads the date as.
stempel,supra,at internal citations omitted.
these fears prompted the undertaking of extensive remediation efforts.corporations and governments invested more than billion worldwide in addressing the program,with the united states government alone spending billion.lohr,supra,at.
in retrospect,we now know that catastrophe did not materialize,perhaps in part because of the success of remediation efforts.see,lohr,supra,at.nevertheless,the benefit of hindsight should not cloud our appreciation of the widespread perception,in the years leading up to,that failure to correct the problem could result in disastrous consequences.moreover,even those who did not predict catastrophic consequences cautioned that the problem was serious enough to require correction if contemporary business is to continue to function in the century.stempel,supra,at.
gte efforts 
because this is an appeal from a grant of summary judgment,we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party gte.see marino,crating,cir.
gte is a worldwide leader in telecommunications services,including local telephone,wireless,and internet services.gte operated a substantial number of computer based systems and networks which employed the common practice of date recognition.as the new millennium approached,gte identified several threats.such harms included the prospect that gte computer programs and external programs interacting with gte systems would crash immediately,make erroneous calculations while continuing to process,endlessly churn before taking a time out or shutting down,or process data correctly to no avail.gte rule statement of material facts,at citing gte president operations review,corp pmo exhibit.
in an effort to protect its expansive network,gte undertook an extensive program at a cost of about million to protect data,records,and to ensure continued business operations.in a december,corporate disclosure document,gte explained its activities as follows

insurance policy provisions 
gte contends that in an effort t o protect its expansive network from damage and destruction,it contracted for extensive insurance protection.appellant br.at.the insurance policies to which gte refers were sold in and.as the district court explained,gte was actually insured by a panel of insurers who provided different percentages of coverage on the primary layer and excess layer of coverage although the policies at issue in this litigation are actually five distinct policies,because the terms of the relevant policy provisions are identical,the district court and the parties did not analyze the provisions separately.therefore,we do not differentiate among the policies 
the primary layer policies outline the scope of the coverage.in pertinent part,the provisions read

procedural history and standard of review 
on june,gte filed a declaratory judgment action seeking coverage for costs and expenses incurred remediating its computer systems to avoid problems count one sought a declaratory judgment that the costs were covered by the policies sue and labor provisions count two alleged breach of contract and count three sought damages from allendale for bad faith.the appellees each answered the complaint,and appellee federal counterclaimed seeking a declaration denying coverage.to facilitate the ease of the litigation,on august,the magistrate judge entered an order dividing the litigation into phases.in phase i,the parties were instructed to address whether insurance coverage existed under the insurance policies.following discovery on phase i issues,the parties filed motions for summary judgment on october.
the district court properly exercised jurisdiction under on march,the district court granted the insurers joint motion for summary judgment in its entirety.as an initial matter,the district court noted that the sue and labor provisions only permit gte to recover for costs incurred to prevent a loss that is covered under the policies.the district court went on to conclude that the problem was not covered because it fell within the design defect and inherent vice exclusions.moreover,the exceptions to these ensuing and resulting loss not permit gte to recover.in light of this finding of,the district court also granted allendale motion for summary judgment on the third count claim of bad faith that is,there being no coverage,gte can not claim bad faith denial of coverage.the district court also granted iri and federal supplementary summary judgment motions,alleging that gte costs were not incurred to avoid loss or damage that occurred during those insurers policy periods 
notice of appeal was timely filed on april.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to.we conduct plenary review over a district court order granting summary judgment.morton int l,staley,cir.summary judgment will be granted if the record establishes there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c see also celotex catrett,d anderson liberty lobby,d matsushita indus.zenith radio,d for the reasons elaborated below,we agree with the district court.
as a preliminary matter,gte argues that consideration of the exclusionary provisions was premature because factual issues regarding design defect are reserved for later stages of the litigation.see gte allendale mut.ins,d.gte argues that there is a disputed factual issue,which can not be resolved on summary judgment,about whether software programming is a design defect or inherent vice.furthermore,gte argues that these issues of fact fall within the province of a jury.we are unpersuaded.
the motions for summary judgment were brought following discovery in phase i of the litigation,pertaining to whether insurance coverage existed for gte claims.as the district court noted,any factual issues pertaining to whether the problem constitutes a design defect are inextricably tied to the phase i issue of coverage.id.in fact,perhaps the most quintessential coverage issue is the applicability of policy exclusions.moreover,there is no indication that gte was prohibited by order or otherwise from taking any discovery relevant to the coverage issue if gte felt that additional evidence,including expert testimony,was required,gte was free to conduct such discovery and present such evidence to the district court.to the extent gte argument constitutes a challenge to the district court discovery orders,this court will not disturb those discovery decisions because there has been no showing of an abuse of discretion.see arnold,general motors,cir.thus,the exclusionary provisions were properly within the consideration of the district court in considering the motions for summary judgment in phase i of the litigation.
in addition,the design defect issue did not need to be resolved by a jury.we agree with the district court that in arguing that the issue falls within the province of the jury,gte erroneously looks to products liability cases for the standards applicable to this insurance contract dispute.see motter everest jennings,cir cited before the district court holding issues of whether product was defectively designed and whether defective design was proximate cause of injury were jury questions rooney federal press,cir hunter,iii,dissenting in part and concurring in part internal quotations and citations omitted cited in appellant br.the question whether a design defect exists,that is,whether the product left the supplier control lacking an element necessary to make it safe for its intended use,remains within the province of the jury.this case does not involve a question of whether a product was defectively designed for purposes of a tort action.gte cites no case concluding that and offers no explanation as to why product liability cases and concepts,which concern the balance between the risk of a product versus its social utility,motter,at,are relevant to insurance contract disputes that involve agreements between specific parties.the issue of whether the defective design and inherent vice exclusions bar recovery were questions of contract interpretation properly within the province of the district court at the summary judgment stage of the litigation.
generally,under new jersey law the interpretation of insurance contracts requires generous readings of coverage provisions,narrow readings of exclusionary provisions,resolution of ambiguities in favor of the insured,and construction consistent with the insured reasonable expectations.cobra,fed.ins,see also elizabethtown water hartford cas.ins.insurers contend this rule is inapplicable where the insured is a large sophisticated corporation,such as gte.see pittston allianz ins,rev in part,cir.however,we need not address this issue because we conclude that the contract is not ambiguous rather,the exclusions clearly bar coverage.because the contract in this case is clear and unambiguous,it must be enforced as written.cobra,at.
policy exclusions 
we agree with the district court that coverage for gte remediation measures is barred by the plain language of both the defective design and inherent vice exclusions,and disagree with gte contention that its claim is not subject to these exclusions because the threats were external.
defective design exclusion 
the policy provisions outlining excluded perils specifically preclude coverage for the cost of making good defective design or specifications.the district court concluded that any efforts taken to correct a date recognition problem within the computer systems,in order to ensure that the computer systems continue to process dates as expected and required,are efforts undertaken to correct a problem with the design or specification of the system.d at.we agree.
the problem squarely falls within the defective design or specification exclusion.the essence of the problem is that the date design precludes the system from functioning properly on or after january.the problem in this case was not that a program or system malfunctioned,or some external threat caused damage to gte systems.rather,the system performed in exactly the manner it was designed to problem is that the system as designed and specified did not permit recognition of dates in the century 
gte argues that the designation system can not be a defective design because,at the time of its implementation,such a design conformed with industry standard either as a widespread practice or best practice,complied with government regulation,and was required for gte systems to be able to interface with other systems.even assuming all these factors are true,we still conclude that gte claim is barred by the defective design exclusion.industry standards and the existence of alternative feasible designs may be relevant standards in determining whether there is a design defect for the purpose of tort liability.see,restatement third of torts prod.liab,cmt.b.the fact that something was designed in accordance with best practice or industry standard does not,however,mean that gte insurance policy provides coverage for necessary changes and upgrades to that system.
the policies in this case explicitly exclude the cost of making good defective design or specification.defective is defined as a n imperfection or shortcoming,esp.in a part that is essential to the operation or safety of a product.black law dictionary ed here there was an imperfection or shortcoming the inability of the system to properly read dates on or after the year the system design or specification.the district court pointed to extensive testimony from gte employees to buttress the conclusion that the remediation measures fall within the policies exclusions.see d at.admittedly,some of this testimony is confusing nevertheless,this testimony supports the view that gte remediation efforts were taken to correct an imperfection or shortcoming in the system,and thus fall within the policies defective design exclusions.for example,in the context of explaining the relationship between and legacy migration,michael lawrence brodie,who worked as a senior staff scientist and a senior technologist at gte,testified 
the premise is you have a system that has something in it that you do like,and you want to get into a state where that thing is no longer present.you migrate from one state to another state,whether it is or whether its an old database system,or a code that no longer is appropriate you trying to change an existing system into a new form that no longer manifests the problem you trying to get away from.
deposition of michael lawrence brodie at,at.in other words,remediation,like other database and code upgrades,is targeted at changing an existing system because of a problem or limitation within that system.
the fact that gte may have utilized the best available system,and subsequently faced the need to remedy a problem with that system,does not save gte from the defective design exclusion.taken to its logical conclusion,gte argument would render virtually every business upgrade an insurable risk.for example,gte could argue that upgrades to its software or computers undertaken in the name of mitigating an insurable risk would be insurable as long as it used the best system at the time of initial installation.
gte also suggests that a design can not be faulty if it meets the specifications at the time of its design.that is unpersuasive.if,for example,an airplane is built pursuant to specifications and is unable to,it is defective or contains an imperfection or shortcoming despite the fact that it conformed with the specifications.more important,gte very argument is undermined by the plain language of the policy provisions.the defective design provision expressly provides that the policy does not ensure against the cost of making good defective design or specifications.emphasis added.
inherent vice exclusion 
there is an additional ground to reject gte coverage claim the insurance policies explicitly do not insure against inherent vice.the district court concluded that,in addition to the defective design exclusion,the inherent vice provision barred gte from recovering for remediation measures.in reaching this conclusion,the district court relied heavily,as persuasive authority,on the washington court of appeal conclusion in port of seattle lexington ins.that the problem was an inherent vice.
as noted by the district court,the port of seattle court began by surveying definitions of inherent vice 
an inherent vice is defined by various courts as any existing defects,diseases,decay or the inherent nature of the commodity which will cause it to deteriorate with a lapse of time.it is also defined as a cause of loss not covered by the policy,does not relate to an extraneous cause but to a loss entirely from internal decomposition or some quality which brings about its own injury or destruction.the vice must be inherent in the property for which recovery is sought.
at quoting.pac.elmore stahl,d employers cas.holm,additional citations omitted.in other words,the question is whether the insured property contain s its own seeds of destruction or whether it was threatened by an outside natural force.american home assurance shea.
port of seattle went on to conclude that the problem fell within the inherent vice exclusion b ut for the date field code programmed into the port software,the arrival of january,would not result in loss.thus,the port problem is an excluded inherent vice because the date field is an internal quality that brought about its own problem.at,quoted in d at.
the district court found the port of seattle analysis persuasive,and concluded that the inherent vice exclusion is applicable.we agree.as the district court explained,h ere the insured property,gte computer systems,do contain their own seeds of destruction that is,the date limitation.d at.furthermore,gte is not threatened by any external force the threat is entirely internal.id.
on appeal,gte principal objection to this conclusion,as elaborated below,is that the threats posed by were not exclusively internal.
external threats 
in concluding that gte claims were barred by the defective design and inherent vice exclusions,the district court rejected gte argument that its claim can not be barred by these provisions because it faced risk from events caused by external systems.the district court explained that while t his argument gives the court pause,t he record does not reflect that the program was intended to eliminate any external threats,as described by gte.d at.
in support of its contention that it faced external threats,gte provided numerous citations to the record in both its brief,see appellant br.at citing at,and at argument,see tr.of argument at citing at.gte provides minimal explanation for how these citations support its argument.moreover,upon examination,we are not satisfied that the record supports the conclusion that gte faced an external threat such that the defective design and inherent vice exclusions do not apply at best,these citations appear to support the claim that the problem is particularly complex because of the manner in which gte systems interface with third party systems 
we disagree with the suggestion that the threat is external merely because gte systems interacted with other systems or read data from outside sources.such a conception of external would essentially allow all defective designs and inherent vices to be characterized as external problems.for example,if a car is defectively designed so that the tires come off when the car is driven at miles per hour,the threat is not external merely because the external event of the road contacting the tire caused the tires to fly off.the road contacting the tire is an entirely predictable event that is inherent to the very function and purpose of the is no problem independent of the automotive design.to take another example,if a dam whose very purpose is to hold water falls apart when the water rises to an entirely predictable level,the rising of the water is not an external problem is that the dam was not properly designed to allow it to perform precisely the function it was intended to perform,the holding of water.
by contrast,if as a consequence of a defective design the fire retardation system in a building does not function and the building goes up in flames,the fire would be an external event.the fire represents an independent problem external to the design of the computer system.
in this case,there was no unpredictable external threat posing a risk to gte system the problem is that the systems were programmed only to recognize the last two digits of the preface remaining a constant.the fact,however,that at the turn of the millennium,the preface would now be rather than,thereby requiring date recognition,was entirely predictable.the annual change in date,like the road impacting the tire and the water level rising,is within the scope of occurrences for which the system was purposely designed.the the systems were limited to date entirely endemic to the system.that is,the insured systems contain s its own seeds of destruction and is not threatened by an outside natural force.american home assurance.at 
exceptions to exclusions 
gte argues that the district court failed to consider all relevant policy provisions in finding that gte claim fell within the defective design and inherent vice exclusions.in particular,gte points out that the defective design and inherent vice provisions except from the exclusions resulting damage and ensuing loss or damage.
specifically,the primary layer policies state that the defective design or specifications exclusion shall not apply to loss or damage resulting from such defective design or specifications however any such resulting damage will be subject to all other exclusions in this policy.additionally,inherent vices are not covered unless loss or damage from a peril insured herein ensues and then this policy shall cover for such ensuing loss or damage.similarly,the excess layer policies do not insure against faulty design or inherent vice all unless physical damage not excluded by this policy results,in which event,this policy will cover only such resulting damage.
we are not persuaded that the ensuing and resulting loss provisions allow gte to recover in this case.several courts considering similar policy provisions have concluded that the cost of correcting design defects can not be covered under an ensuing loss provision where it was incurred to correct an excluded peril.see swire pac.holdings zurich ins,cir hereinafter swire ii citing cases see also montefiore med.center am.protect,d,an ensuing loss provision does not cover loss caused by the excluded peril,but rather covers loss caused to other property wholly separate from the defective property itself.prudential property cas.ins,wl,at.that is,an ensuing loss provision does not cover loss caused by the excluded peril,but rather covers loss caused to other property wholly separate from the defective property itself.swire pac.holdings,zurich ins,d,hereinafter swire i,certified on appeal cir emphasis in original.moreover,in the factually analogous port of seattle case,the washington court of appeals rejected the contention that even if the port problem was an excluded inherent vice,the port could recover under the ensuing loss provision.at.
an alternative reading of the ensuing and resulting loss provisions would render the policy exclusions virtually meaningless.that is,the exception to the exclusion can not be construed so broadly that the rule the exclusion is swallowed by the exception.swire i,d at.rather,the ensuing loss provisions are best read as permitting recovery where a covered peril or damage results from the design defect or inherent vice thus we disagree that gte is entitled to coverage because data destruction and business interruption are specifically covered perils.
data destruction 
the policies in this case ensure against all risks of physical loss of or damage to property described herein.physical loss or damage is defined to include any destruction,distortion or corruption of any computer data,coding,program except as hereinafter excluded emphasis added.
gte conceded at argument that t here has to be a physical damage resulting from design defect or inherent vice.tr.of argument at.gte agrees with the court,for example,that if,as a consequence of a defective design,the fire retardation system in a building does not function and the building goes up in flames,t his provision means that the building gets covered,because it is a physical damage to the building,but it does mean that the redesign of the software gets covered.id.at.this concession seriously undermines gte argument.in this case,gte is essentially seeking recovery for measures taken to correct its systems,and not for some eventuating physical damage sustained to its property.
gte argues that because the problem would inflict physical damage to the system data,it can recover,under the sue and labor provisions discussed more extensively below,for preventive measures taken to mitigate this ensuing loss.the problem,however,is that gte has failed to adequately demonstrate that it was threatened by physical loss in the form of destruction,distortion or corruption of any computer data,coding,program,as distinct from the otherwise excluded defective design and inherent vice.that is,gte has not illustrated that the consequences of failing to correct the date designation system,causing data to enter the system in an unrecognizable format,are a covered loss.
in response to this court inquiry at oral argument,gte provided record citations on the issue of the data destruction,distortion and corruption that gte potentially faced as distinct from the impact on gte computers software.gte strongest claim appears to be its allegation that absent remediation,some of its systems might have generated incorrect data,thereby corrupting financial records and other databases.letter from raymond alletto,gte director of risk management,to ronald davis et,executive general adjuster mclarens toplis,at.the record,however,does not appear to provide support for this allegation of data corruption.moreover,at best this establishes that incorrect data may have been generated as a result of problems within gte own does not establish that data destruction or corruption would have ensued to other property wholly separate from the defective property itself.swire i,d at.here,the plain language of the policies provides coverage for data destruction or corruption except as hereinafter excluded.as discussed above,the defective design and inherent vice exclusions bar recovery,and a reading of the ensuing loss provisions to provide coverage would essentially read these exclusions out of the policy.
business interruption 
gte also points to the fact that business interruption is a specifically covered peril.the primary layer policies provide for coverage for l oss resulting from necessary interruption of business conducted by the insured and caused by loss,damage,or destruction by any of the perils covered herein emphasis added.the business interruption endorsement in the excess policies provides coverage for business interruption resulting from physical loss or damage of the type insured against by this policy,to property not otherwise excluded by this policy.emphasis added.
as the district court explained,in this case,in contrast to the factually analogous port of seattle case,gte has done more than claim testing losses gte clearly claims that had it not remediated its computer system in preparation for,it would have faced separate business interruption losses of a great magnitude.d at.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to gte,the district court concluded that gte faced potential business interruption losses and its remediation efforts were taken to prevent such losses.nevertheless,the district court concluded that,pursuant to the terms of the policies,the alleged business interruption losses were not insurable.we agree.
the district court explained that t he ensuing loss provisions clearly only provide coverage for a covered loss ensuing from one of the excluded perils.d at.moreover,u nder the plain language of the policies,the business interruption loss must be caused by a covered peril.id.as a result,because design defects and inherent vices are not perils covered,the business interruption loss ensuing from a design defect or inherent vice would not be a covered loss.id.in other words,gte can not recover for just any ensuing or resulting business underlying peril resulting in business interruption must be covered.returning to the fire example above,business interruption losses ensuing or resulting from any physical damage sustained by a fire would be covered because such physical damage is a covered peril.however,gte can not claim business interruption losses ensuing or resulting from the specifically excluded intrinsic design defect and inherent vice perils.any other reading of the exclusionary provisions would render the provisions a virtual nullity.gte could argue,for example,that any upgrade to or correction of a defective system is reimbursable because the ensuing loss from failing to correct the system would result in business interruption.
in sum,we conclude that even when read in conjunction with the other terms of the ensuing loss,data destruction,and business interruption claim is still barred by the defective design and inherent vice exclusions.
consideration of correspondence 
finally,gte argues that the district court,in interpreting the foregoing contract provisions,erred by failing to consider the insurers alleged efforts to amend the policies to exclude coverage for costs.to begin,gte points out that the insurers chose to extend gte insurance policies through the millennium without including a exclusion.moreover,gte alleges that,in and the spring of,each insurer asked gte to accept a exclusion gte contends that insurers should not now be permitted to obtain from the court contract terms they were unsuccessful in negotiating,and suggests that the efforts to negotiate exclusions illustrate an awareness on the part of insurers that under the existing language they were liable for gte remediation measures.we conclude that such alleged correspondence is not properly considered in interpreting this contract,and,moreover,that the correspondence in this case does not appear to support gte claim.
new jersey courts consider the insurer conduct in determining whether a policy terms are ambiguous.see fortunato highlands ins.group,law div the ambiguity of the umbrella policy here is also shown by the conduct of the insurer.moreover,courts do not permi t insurance companies to seek refuge in the literal language of their policies when the company conduct and actions causes sic the insured to act or to fail to act based on that conduct.doto russo.we have already concluded,however,that the terms of the policy unambiguously exclude gte claim.therefore,we find no reason to look to the insurers alleged conduct.in addition,gte has failed to point to conduct by the insurers that caused gte to act or fail to is not a case where gte took some action,to its detriment,in reliance on the insurers statements or conduct.
in fact,the correspondence in this case does not even appear to support gte contention that the insurers sought to amend the policies to exclude coverage.in a fax dated june,gte counsel requested that allendale include clarifying language that it would not add such a exclusion.the fax provides 
the letter received was incomplete in gte and our estimation based on our meeting and allendale positive response.we would like the letter to read as follows 
allendale will not add any additional exclusions,amendments or endorsements regarding year issues inability to recognize the correct data including year to the currently in force gte allendale policies prior to the expiration of such policies july.
at emphasis added.
on june,allendale appears to have transmitted to gte insurance broker proposed agreements between allendale,affiliated,and gte.one of the stated objectives of the agreement was to e liminat e uncertainty and achiev e mutual agreement as to how the policy responds to or other similar date or time recognition claims.letter from brian krais,vice president and operations manager of allendale insurance,to adam kagan,j h marsh mclennan june,at.the proposed agreement provided that afilliated and gte agree that afilliated will not endorse onto the existing policy any restriction or clarifica
