owens,circuit judge 
mohamed osman mohamud appeals from his conviction for attempting to detonate a large bomb during the annual christmas tree lighting ceremony in pioneer courthouse square in downtown portland,oregon,in violation of a a.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm 
factual background 
mohamud activities before contact with the fbi 
in many respects,mohamud was like any other american teenager.he liked music,the los angeles lakers,and hanging out with his friends.born in somalia,he immigrated to the united states at the age of three,and grew up in the portland area.
but after a december incident at london heathrow airport,things changed.believing that airport security racially profiled him,mohamud wrote an email in london stating that it is the evil lobbyists who control the world,and calling on allah to send fighters against them.he also created a new email account while in.that email account would play a significant role in the prosecution case.
in,mohamud began communicating over the internet with samir khan,a united states citizen then living in north carolina khan published jihad recollections,an online magazine aimed at supporters.from february to august,mohamud and khan exchanged roughly emails,with mohamud using his truthbespoken email account.topics included islamic law and advice about personal relationships.they also outlined mohamud support for osama bin laden.
during this time period,mohamud wrote four articles for jihad recollections among other things,the articles recommended physical exercise to prepare for war with the west and analyzed europe vulnerability to a jihadi attack.mohamud initial drafts of these articles contained more incendiary content.for example,mohamud praised the proficiency of the september,hijackers who hit them so fast the americans became dumbfounded,the mumbai attackers,who were a great display of quickly entering the arena of battle and just decimating the kuffar unbelievers,and the fighters in afghanistan who attacked landing american helicopters and then finish ed off the wounded american soldiers.mohamud also prayed for allah to help the reader prepar e you to meet allah as a martyr and included a photograph of the twin towers burning during the september attacks.khan removed this more inflammatory material from the final versions of mohamud articles.on august,mohamud informed khan that he would no longer write for jihad recollections because he was going through alot sic of things and i have a lot of things to do.
mohamud also struck up a relationship with amro,a saudi citizen who mohamud met at a portland mosque and who subsequently left the united states on august,sent information to mohamud at his truthbespoken email account about an islamic school in yemen.that same day,mohamud called his father to say that he was leaving the country.his father begged him to stay in the united states,but mohamud told him it was too late he had his passport,visa,and ticket ready to go.when his parents confirmed that his passport was missing,they feared that mohamud might return to somalia,his place of birth.and when they could not reach mohamud,they called the fbi and asked an agent to stop their son from leaving the country.eventually,mohamud mother got in touch with her son,scolded him,and brought him home.mohamud did not actually have a visa or plane ticket,and he returned his passport to his parents.a few days later,mohamud father called the fbi agent back and told him that mohamud had agreed to finish college and would not leave the country until he graduated.he also explained that his son had wanted to go to yemen to study arabic and islam.mohamud father forwarded the fbi an email from his son about a school in yemen,which allowed the fbi to identify mohamud as the user of the truthbespoken email account.
mohamud attends college and the fbi initiates its investigation 
in september,mohamud began studying engineering at oregon state university in corvallis,where he had a typical college experience he had a roommate,made friends,and attended parties where he drank alcohol and used marijuana.his activities and religious principles often clashed,and in november he sought advice from a muslim website on the difficulties of living a pious life on a college campus.
after the urgent august,call from mohamud father,the fbi opened an investigation into mohamud.agents conducted physical and electronic surveillance of mohamud,but did not identify any overtly dangerous communications.the case agent believed that mohamud communications lacked the same radical speak that he had espoused early on when he was communicating with samir khan.the agent opined that mohamud had left behind his radical thinking and was a pretty manipula ble,conflicted kid.
c.the fbi first direct contacts with mohamud 
in november,a contractor working undercover for the fbi using the alias bill smith emailed mohamud at his truthbespoken account.pretending to be an isolated muslim in eastern idaho,the contractor asked mohamud for advice on how to get more involved in the fight for the islamic community,and he stated that he wanted to help rid the occupiers from p alestine.although mohamud gave some general advice to move to a community with more muslims,take care when talking about such issues online,and look out for spies,he never openly encouraged the contractor to commit acts of violence.by may,their email communications had ended.
mohamud planned to work in alaska with his college roommate during the summer of.but when his parents brought him to the portland airport,he was not permitted to fly to alaska.instead,fbi agents met with mohamud and his parents at the airport and questioned them.when asked,mohamud denied having a ticket or visa to travel to yemen,or having any interest in jihadi websites.when asked if he knew anyone in yemen,he said amr,but provided little detail.mohamud made no mention of his jihad recollections articles or similar writings.when mohamud returned home,he drafted a to do list which included find a job,work till september,get help from his parents for food and rent,and you might have to take less classes at oregon state.
introduction to fbi undercover agent youssef 
the initial email contacts 
on june,an fbi undercover agent,using the alias youssef,emailed mohamud at his truthbespoken account and instructed him to set up a new hushmail email account that would be secure and encrypted.mohamud responded later that same day assalamu alaykum god be with you brother how are you two days later,youssef emailed mohamud again 
wa alaikoom salem.hamdullah i am good brother thank you for asking.i sorry for the delay in our communication,we been on the move.jazakallah khairan for responding so soon.are you still able to help the brothers in,i hear from you soon.salem,youssef.
mohamud responded the same day that he was unable to travel 
i have been betrayed by my family,i was supposed to travel last year but allah had decreed that i stay here longer than my heart desired.i am trying to find a way to go.i do not think i will be able to go for a while.i need to save up and also clear up somethings sic.look for my emails inshallah,i will contact you when i am able to travel.pray for me that allah will free my passage from the lands of the polytheists,peace be upon the messenger of allah,his family and his companions.
three days later,on june,youssef replied that allah swt i sure has good reason for you to stay where you are and asked to meet mohamud.about two weeks later,when mohamud had still not responded,youssef sent a email.a week later,on july,mohamud responded and agreed to meet.
youssef declined mohamud suggestion to meet at the local mosque because he wanted to meet privately and the kuffar unbelievers have eyes and ears in almost all masjids in the us.mohamud responded that he would have a set of questions for you when we meet to make s ure you are not a spy yourself.mohamud also wrote that amr as in amro was the only person who could have given youssef his email address,so he would want to know how youssef knew as a precaution.youssef praised mohamud for thinking about security.
the first meeting with youssef 
on july,youssef met mohamud for the first time in downtown portland youssef told mohamud he was from an ihataa a religious council and was interviewing seven people in the united states and canada for possible inclusion in a council project youssef asked mohamud what he had been doing lately to continue being a good muslim.mohamud said that he had been writing poetry and articles for jihad recollections.mohamud asked youssef how he got his email address,and youssef explained that the council had forwarded it to him.
when asked about travel,mohamud described his unsuccessful attempt to go to alaska.and when asked what he was willing to do for the cause,youssef testified that mohamud said that originally he had planned to wage war within the united states,but then he dreamt that he traveled to yemen,received training,and went to afghanistan where he led an army against the kuffar or the unbelievers.
youssef asked mohamud again what he would do for the cause,and mohamud responded,anything.when offered five ways to be a good muslim pray five times a day go to school to learn something that would help the brothers overseas,such as engineering or medicine raise money for the brothers become operational or become a martyr mohamud almost immediately picked become operational.mohamud explained operational meant doing like the other brothers do when they get a car,fill it with explosives,park it near a target location,and detonate the vehicle.when asked about targets,mohamud said he had thought about washington,because of all the government buildings,but admitted he was not familiar with the area.youssef told mohamud to research possible targets in portland,and that he had a brother that could help him with explosives.
about four hours after their meeting,mohamud sent youssef an unprompted email with copies of his three articles published in jihad recollections youssef replied that mohamud was talented.
meeting with hussein 
a few weeks later,on august,youssef met with mohamud again in downtown portland and introduced him to hussein,an undercover fbi agent posing as an explosives expert.youssef described mohamud as a jewel in the rough.during the meeting,mohamud told the agents he admired the mumbai terrorist attack in which ten men stormed buildings in mumbai,india,and killed people.
about minutes into the meeting,mohamud told the agents that he wanted to detonate a bomb in pioneer courthouse square during the annual christmas tree lighting ceremony on november,the day after thanksgiving.mohamud explained that he had researched other potential targets,but this was the best option because he could drive a car right into the square from the street many people would be there nobody expected an attack in portland and security would be light.mohamud said that he planned on being in the car when it blew up.the agents who were not familiar with portland had no input into mohamud chosen target.
youssef wanted mohamud to realize the seriousness of what he was saying.mohamud assured them he did.he said that since i was fifteen i thought about all this things before,and explained 
i magine every day we see you know in arab,you know,newspapers and news you know our people are killed you know.so for us to see that you know it would be a smile from me to see them in the same.you know,you know what i like,what makes me happy you know,what i like to see is when i see the enemy of allah then they are you know their bodies are torn everywhere.that gives me you know like high hope and happiness you know.
when youssef pointed out that there would many women and children at the event,mohamud responded 
i n general just a huge mass that will,you know like for them you know to be attacked in their own element with their families celebrating their holidays.and then for later on to be saying this was done for you to refrain from killing our children,women.
the agents told mohamud there was no shame in not going through with his plan.they reminded him that w ith us you always have a choice.when asked what he would have done if he had not met the agents,mohamud said that he had planned to leave the country,find the right people,be somewhere they can not capture you,and meet up with.the three then walked to pioneer courthouse square,where mohamud detailed the proposed attack.
two days later,youssef emailed mohamud that he and hussein would present mohamud plan to the council.he also asked mohamud to explain his rationale for the attack,as a bomb is a very serious matter.mohamud replied that he had prayed for guidance and that his faith was sky high for no apparent reason,which he saw as a sign that the traffic l ight is green lol.
youssef and hussein test mohamud resolve 
on september,youssef and hussein met again with mohamud.they convinced mohamud not to martyr himself,to detonate the bomb remotely,and offered to help him leave the country after the bombing.they also advised that he did not have to go forward with the plan.the agents showed mohamud an mock jihadi training video,which included an explosion being triggered by cell phone.mohamud said the video was beautiful.
to test his resolve,the agents gave mohamud to carry out specific tasks purchase a list of bomb components,decide where to park the van with the bomb,and rent his own apartment on october,they again met with mohamud and told him to rent a storage unit for the van.mohamud completed these tasks.
g.the test bomb 
on november,mohamud,youssef,and hussein drove to the oregon countryside to explode a test bomb.on the drive,when asked what he wanted to do once he was overseas,mohamud first said he wanted to learn arabic,and later that he wanted to learn the inside and out of weaponry and.when asked whether he saw himself teaching,he said he also wanted to teach special operations,and specialize in making the enemies you know afraid.during this conversation,mohamud stated that these people who live in this country are the most evil people on earth.
hussein again advised that mohamud did not have to go through with the bombing.mohamud ignored him,instead commenting on the irony of the term black friday,the day after thanksgiving.when asked if he had told anybody about the plan,mohamud responded that his image was just a college student and nobody even knows that i have you know,that i inclined toward jihad,or even towards even like being islamic.
to test the bomb,mohamud pushed buttons on a cell phone,which appeared to trigger an explosion,though an fbi agent actually detonated the bomb.after the explosion,mohamud said god is great in arabic,that he felt good,and that the bomb test was just motivation for me.when youssef and hussein asked if he had ever seen dead bodies,mohamud responded that he thought it was awesome when people were jumping from skyscrapers during the september attacks.
on the ride home,youssef suggested that mohamud make a video to explain his actions because it could be inspirational.mohamud ultimately agreed and wrote a script for the video using topics youssef suggested.
mohamud made the video later that day,and explained that this is a message to those who have wronged themselves.he described the dark day that was coming,and said that no one would be safe for as long as you threaten our security.he said that living in the united states is a sin,and urged that muslim parents living in the west not do what his did to him that is,not hold others back from completing their obligation to allah.mohamud finished by reading his own poem that extolled the virtues of muslims and jihad,and ended with a call to 
carry on oh brothers,and march on ahead to meet your creator and lie on silk beds,and the martyrs do die,so do say they dead.explode on these kuffar unbelievers.alleviate our pain.assassinate their leaders,commanders,and chiefs.from your brother to his brother a poem in brief.
h.the final countdown 
about a week after the test bomb,mohamud exchanged emails with a friend in afghanistan.on november,the friend asked mohamud to investigate predator and reaper strike drones to figure out how to down them.on november,mohamud responded d o worry,brother,i will find you something inshallah.please do not email this email any longer.if someone replies from now on from this is not me,remember that.i hope we meet again soon inshallah.
on november,an excited mohamud met with youssef and hussein for six hours.they went to the storage unit mohamud had rented,which he had selected in part because there were no surveillance cameras.the three then drove to a hotel in portland,where mohamud showed the agents potential parking spots he had researched on his computer.next,they walked to pioneer courthouse square to discuss the plan further.
during the november meeting,youssef asked what a victory gon na be for you mohamud replied try to get most,the most casualties.mohamud thought the bombing would get a lot of publicity because america boasting it so oh we have been attacked since.hussein asked mohamud if he had any doubts about the bombing.he did not.
on november,mohamud and hussein went to the storage unit to see the bomb parts.mohamud helped load purported bomb parts into hussein car,including barrels,wires,and nails.mohamud also provided hussein with items for their disguises to pose as water workers.
on november,thanksgiving day,mohamud drove to portland and spent the day with friends.his friends said he seemed happy,although at dinner he became reserved.they all went shopping at an outlet mall that night.
black friday november,
early the next morning,on november,mohamud ran into a friend and told him that i having the greatest morning of my life.around noon,youssef picked up mohamud and they drove to a store to buy reflective vests as part of their disguises.then they met up with hussein in downtown portland.mohamud appeared happy and excited.
the three drove about a mile to the parked van.when shown the bomb in the back of the van which an fbi agent had constructed to look real but which was,in fact,inert,mohamud said it was beautiful.they returned to their hotel,ate,talked,and prayed.shortly before,the three drove to the van.youssef dropped off mohamud and hussein,then drove to a meeting location a few blocks west of pioneer courthouse square.
hussein and mohamud drove the van to pioneer courthouse square.before exiting the van,hussein told mohamud to connect the wires for the detonator to work.mohamud did so,and then they walked several blocks to join youssef in his car.the three drove toward a train station,dropped off youssef,and then hussein and mohamud parked a few blocks from the station.
mohamud pulled out the cell phone and hussein read him the number to dial to detonate the bomb.when mohamud dialed the number and nothing happened,hussein suggested that they step out of the car for better reception the arrest signal.mohamud was dialing the number into the cell phone a second time when fbi agents arrested them both.hussein was shouting allahu akbar god is great as he was being arrested.mohamud was quiet initially,but during transport he began to kick and had to be restrained.later,when speaking with the jail psychiatric nurse,mohamud cried and said he could not understand how he had gotten from just being a student to being labeled a terrorist in jail.
agents found an undated email printout from in mohamud wallet.a search of mohamud computer revealed videos of the and portland christmas tree lighting ceremonies,as well as an video,an audio file titled no peace with the jews,and numerous references to the word jihad.in a notebook found in his apartment,mohamud had written non muslims are the eternal enemies of islam and they must be subdued and humiliated.he also described the need to mistrust everyone and to act normal to secure myself from the fbi.
ii.procedural history 
indictment and trial 
a indictment charged mohamud with attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction in violation of a a.after several years of pretrial litigation and review of immense discovery including considerable litigation under the classified information procedures act,app,trial began in january and lasted thirteen days.both sides called numerous witnesses,and the were sharp and thorough.
there was no dispute that mohamud had tried to blow up pioneer courthouse square while it was filled with people.the spirited and supportable defense was entrapment mohamud,a teenager with no criminal record,had neither the means nor the intent to commit domestic terrorism until he became involved with the undercover fbi contractor bill smith and fbi agents youssef and hussein.the government countered that mohamud actions before any contact with the fbi including his jihad recollections articles as well as his readiness to commit such a horrific act of violence proved that he had the necessary predisposition to commit the crime.after the close of evidence and argument,the jury returned a guilty verdict,rejecting the entrapment defense.
mohamud challenged his conviction on numerous grounds.he cited sherman united states,to argue that the government had entrapped him as a matter of law.mohamud contended that he had intended to complete college in the united states,and only the fbi aggressive and coercive actions had led him down the bombing path.the district court rejected that argument,pointing to evidence that before any contact with the fbi,mohamud originally planned to wage war in the united states until a dream refocused him on yemen wrote articles for jihad recollections which advised how best to prepare to carry out jihad on and had lengthy email conversations with men that the fbi believed promoted terrorism.the court also highlighted that mohamud never showed any reluctance unlike the defendant in sherman,and only thirteen minutes after meeting youssef in person,he said that he wanted to become operational by using a car bomb.
after the verdict but before sentencing,the government filed a supplemental notice that it had offered into evidence or otherwise used or disclosed in proceedings,including at trial information derived from information collected pursuant to of the foreign intelligence surveillance act of fisa,hereinafter referred to as mohamud argued that this late notice warranted suppression of this evidence and any fruits thereof.the government countered that fisa did not provide for suppression in these circumstances,and in any case,there was no substantial prejudice,as the district court could conduct a suppression analysis.the district court agreed,finding no misconduct in the late disclosure,and that mohamud had suffered no prejudice from the delayed disclosure.
mohamud also argued that suppression was warranted because violates the first and fourth amendments,as well as the separation of powers doctrine as a threshold matter,the district court first held that did not interfere with the prerogatives of another branch of government beyond requiring the executive branch to conform to the statute.it also reasoned that because the fisc either approves or denies the requested acquisition and electronic communication service providers must follow the directives or challenge them,its opinions are not advisory.the court then explained that mohamud had not raised an independent first amendment claim,because motions to suppress based on first amendment violations are analyzed under the fourth amendment.
finally,the district court held that does not violate the fourth amendment.the court reasoned that surveillance does not trigger the fourth amendment warrant requirement because persons data is collected only incidentally,but even if it did,no warrant would be required because the foreign intelligence exception would apply the court then balanced the government interests in the search against the intrusions on mohamud privacy,and held that the collection here was reasonable under the fourth amendment.
sentencing 
the sentencing guidelines called for a life sentence.the government recommended a sentence of forty years imprisonment,whereas mohamud urged a sentence of ten years imprisonment.
during the sentencing hearing,the district court acknowledged that,although the jury had rejected the entrapment defense,youssef and hussein imperfect ly entrapped mohamud through their frequent praise and religious references,especially considering his youth.but the horrific nature of the intended crime,which would have resulted in a great deal of death and mutilation,still warranted a sentence of thirty years imprisonment.
iii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review the district court ruling on a motion for acquittal de novo.see united states sanchez,cir.when a defendant pursues an entrapment defense,we should not disturb the jury finding unless,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,no reasonable jury could have concluded that the defendant was predisposed to commit the charged offenses.united states davis,cir.we review the denial of a motion to dismiss based on a violation of constitutional rights de novo.united states brobst,cir.
we review de novo the denial of a motion to suppress evidence,but underlying factual findings are reviewed for clear error.united states crawford,cir.en banc.we review for an abuse of discretion a district court decision whether to use its supervisory powers in this case,the supervisory power to decide whether to suppress evidence as a sanction for the government late supplemental fisa notice.united states stinson,cir.discovery rulings and the denial of an evidentiary hearing are also reviewed for an abuse of discretion.united states mazzarella,cir.
we review de novo the constitutionality of a statute.united states vongxay,cir.
entrapment as a matter of law 
as the district court stated at sentencing,the defense made a solid case for entrapment.but the jury rejected that defense,and found mohamud guilty despite the actions and encouragement of youssef and hussein and the communications and attempted communications from other government agents.and in light of that verdict,mohamud has a steep hill to climb.to establish entrapment as a matter of law,the defendant must point to undisputed evidence making it patently clear that an otherwise innocent person was induced to commit the illegal act by trickery,persuasion,or fraud of a government agent.united states smith,cir.see also united states williams,cir.
to avoid a finding of entrapment,the government must prove that mohamud was predisposed to commit the crime before government agents contacted him,or government agents did not induce him to commit the crime.united states mcclelland,cir.we focus our inquiry on mohamud predisposition.
when evaluating predisposition,we often analyze five factors the character and reputation of the defendant whether the government made the initial suggestion of criminal activity whether the defendant engaged in the activity for profit whether the defendant showed any reluctance and the nature of the government inducement.id.although none of these factors is controlling,the defendant reluctance to engage in the criminal activity is the most important.id.
we can assume that factors,and are in mohamud favor.the second factor whether the government made the initial suggestion of criminal activity weighs against mohamud.although youssef discussed with mohamud five options of how to be a good muslim,including the option to become operational,mohamud not youssef made the initial suggestion to fill a car with explosives near a target location.mohamud also told youssef that he wanted to wage war within the united states before youssef mentioned the possibility of an operational role.the government can rely upon mohamud statements to prove predisposition even though he made them after the initial contact by the government.united states tucker,cir.here,mohamud discussed placing explosives in vehicles near target locations after the government initial contact with him but before youssef suggested criminal activity.the second factor therefore weighs against mohamud.
the fourth and most important factor also weighs overwhelmingly in the government favor.the government initiated its contact with mohamud in november with the bill smith emails,and the more aggressive youssef and hussein operation began in june.despite being provided numerous opportunities to deviate from or terminate the plan,mohamud never displayed any reluctance in going through with a horrific attack that would have killed and maimed countless people,including young children.indeed,he expressed great enthusiasm in seeing it through.he picked the target the pioneer courthouse square christmas tree lighting ceremony and planned where the van containing the explosives would be parked.he praised the terror attack in mumbai,described the victims jumping from the twin towers on september as awesome,and stated that he would be happy to see the bodies of enemies of allah torn apart.
the complete lack of reluctance on mohamud part to participate in the bombing indeed,his immediate zeal to see it through separates this case from those in which courts have found defendants entrapped as a matter of law.for example,in jacobson united states,jacobson was not predisposed in part because t he evidence that jacobson was ready and willing to commit the offense came only after the government had devoted years to convincing him that he had or should have the right to engage in the very behavior proscribed by law.in sherman,a government informant approached the defendant,a recovering drug addict,and asked for narcotics,ostensibly because the informant was not responding to treatment.at.the defendant resisted f rom the first,he tried to avoid the issue.id.only after a number of repetitions of the request,predicated on the informant presumed suffering,did the defendant finally acquiesce.see also id.at one request was not enough,for additional ones were necessary to overcome,first,the defendant refusal,then his evasiveness,and then his hesitancy in order to achieve capitulation.and in united states poehlman,cir,the government agent aggressively pushed the idea of sexual activities with children on an uninterested defendant until eventually he gave in 
while poehlman reluctance might have been borne of caution the fact remains that poehlman earliest messages which would be most indicative of his state of mind provide no support for the government case on predisposition.to the contrary,poehlman reluctance forced the agent to become more aggressive in her suggestions 
id.at see also id.at.at least as to this factor,this case is more akin to williams,in which we held that the defendant was not entrapped as a matter of law in part because t here is no evidence that the defendant expressed any reluctance about the robbery that needed to be overcome by repeated government inducement or persuasion.the evidence indicated that he was ready and willing at all times to participate in the robbery.at citation omitted.
mohamud argues that his actions after the bill smith emails are irrelevant for entrapment purposes,as they were tainted by the government overwhelming inducement.and with those smith actions set aside,the argument goes,there was insufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that he had the necessary predisposition to commit this crime.this is wrong for two reasons.
first,although only those statements that indicate a state of mind untainted by the inducement are relevant to show predisposition,statements made after the inducement which make clear that mohamud would have committed the offense even without the inducement are evidence of predisposition.poehlman,at.this would include mohamud statements that he made about the awesome terrorist attacks in mumbai and on september,and that he had been thinking about these things since he was fifteen years old.and a reasonable jury could infer that his decisions to become operational and blow something up the first time he met youssef and later,to choose pioneer courthouse square at its most crowded time were evidence that his predisposition existed long before fbi contractor bill smith emailed him.
second,even if there were a rigid wall between pre and,there was sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to reject the entrapment defense.mohamud jihad recollections articles both the draft and final versions provided ample evidence of his predisposition to carry out the charged crime.in those articles,he,among other things,coached people on how to prepare themselves physically to attack and kill their western enemies,and saluted those in afghanistan who finish ed off wounded american soldiers.although these articles may come across as a teenager trying to talk tough,they were enough to support the jury finding,and for us to conclude that mohamud was not the otherwise innocent person that the doctrine requires.smith,at united states cromitie,cir.holding that the defendant in a similar case was not entrapped as a matter of law,and observing that potential terrorists who are available to be recruited by al qaeda or similar groups may not have necessarily already formed a specific plan,but t heir predisposition is to have a state of mind that inclines them to inflict harm on the united states,be willing to die like a martyr,be receptive to a recruiter presentation,and welcome an invitation to participate.
in addition,the jury learned of mohamud correspondence with,which began months before the first contact from bill smith.the jury also learned of mohamud desire to go abroad and study at the islamic school in yemen that recommended to him.a government expert testified that this school was founded by a muslim cleric who supported jihad and that it served as a stepping stone to violent jihad,especially for people from the west.as detailed above,the same day that told mohamud about the school in yemen,mohamud apparently made plans to leave the united states.though mohamud ultimately remained in the country,the jury could have reasonably interpreted his attempt as evidence of a predisposition to commit the crime charged.further,mohamud continued to demonstrate interest in attending the school in his december emails to,which occurred after the bill smith emails.
in sum,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,we can not say that no reasonable jury could have concluded that mohamud was predisposed to commit the charged offense.davis,at.we therefore conclude that the district court properly rejected his defense of entrapment as a matter of law.
mohamud alternative argument that we should dismiss this case because the government overreached in its sting and violated due process also fails.while the government conduct in this case was quite aggressive at times,it fell short of a due process violation.
in united states black,we made clear that d ismissing an indictment for outrageous government conduct is limited to extreme cases in which the defendant can demonstrate that the government conduct violates fundamental fairness and is so grossly shocking and so outrageous as to violate the universal sense of justice,cir.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.this is an extremely high standard.see also united states pedrin,cir.i n assessing whether the government conduct was outrageous,the relevant question is what the government knew when it was setting up the sting,not what it learned later.for example,we have denied challenges to sting operations involving armed robberies of phony drug stash houses which necessarily put law enforcement and the defendant in grave peril.see black,at williams,at.mohamud argues that the six factors for evaluating outrageous government conduct set out in black favor dismissal of the indictment we disagree.
in cromitie,a comparable second circuit case,the defendant was convicted of planning and attempting to carry out domestic terrorism offenses.at.the defendant claimed that the government conduct in persuading him to commit the charged offenses violated due process.id.at.the second circuit held that it did not.even though the government invented all of the details of the scheme,the defendant express desire to do something to america and die like a martyr was sufficient to justify the government testing of how far he would go.id.at.like mohamud,cromitie argued that the government took advantage of his religious affiliation,but the court explained that a government agent is entitled to probe the attitudes of an individual who volunteers that he wants to do something to america to learn whether his religious views have impelled him toward the violent brand of radical islam that poses a dire threat to the united states.id.at.
cromitie further claimed that the government had violated due process because a government informant had exploited his relationship with cromitie to manipulate cromitie into agreeing to the planned attacks the court cited our precedent indicating that the illusory cultivation of emotional intimacy does not exceed due process limits.id.at quoting united states simpson,cir.even considering certain monetary benefits offered by the government informant including cash,a barbershop valued at,a new bmw,and a vacation the court held that the overall operation did not rise to the level of a due process violation.id.although mohamud may have been more vulnerable than cromitie,the government questionable actions in that case far exceeded anything here.
in light of the extremely high standard set out in black,we hold that the government conduct here did not violate due process.
late notice of evidence 
fisa requires the government to notify the aggrieved person and the court prior to trial when it intends to use at trial evidence obtained or derived from electronic surveillance pursuant to fisa.c see also a stating that information acquired under is subject to the notice requirement in c.the government provided a supplemental notice regarding evidence derived under after the trial concluded.mohamud argues that this late disclosure mandates suppression,or at a minimum,discovery and an evidentiary hearing to explore the tardy disclosure.
in answering this question,we must keep two principles in mind.first,s uppression of evidence has always been our last resort,not our first impulse.hudson michigan,see also davis united states,for exclusion to be appropriate,the deterrence benefits of suppression must outweigh its heavy costs.oregon,t he exclusionary rule is not a remedy we apply lightly.second,congress has the power to authorize suppression for statutory violations,as it has done elsewhere in fisa.see g,h,g fisa see also a title iii wiretap.however,congress has not mandated suppression as a remedy for late disclosure of a fisa notice,and,indeed,it apparently anticipated the possibility of notification.see e providing that a motion to suppress unlawfully acquired or nonconforming information shall be made before the trial unless the person was not aware of the grounds of the motion.these two principles strongly suggest that automatic suppression is not a required remedy for delayed fisa disclosure.
and in any case,mohamud can not demonstrate how the late disclosure prejudiced him.as the district court explained,it fully evaluated the evidence as if the motion had been brought before trial.this put mohamud in the same position he would have been in if the government had provided timely notice.
moreover,the district court found that the late disclosure was not due to prosecutorial misconduct.rather,the government had changed its legal opinion about when evidence could be considered derived from surveillance,performed another review of this case,and provided the late supplemental notice on its own initiative.our review of the unclassified and classified record supports that the district court did not clearly err in finding no prosecutorial misconduct 
as the district court recognized,it had the power to suppress evidence,or even dismiss the indictment or grant a new trial,under its supervisory and statutory authority.see stinson,at stating that a court may exercise its supervisory powers to remedy a constitutional or statutory violation to protect judicial integrity by ensuring that a conviction rests on appropriate considerations validly before a jury or to deter future illegal conduct citation omitted see also fed.crim.d.however,the district court determined that suppression as a sanction for the late supplemental fisa notice was not warranted here,and we agree.
we conclude that,under the circumstances of this case,the district court did not err in denying mohamud motion to suppress premised on the late supplemental fisa notice 
section collection of mohamud email communications 
legal background 
in,congress enacted fisa to authorize and regulate certain governmental electronic surveillance of communications for foreign intelligence purposes.clapper amnesty int l usa,citing et.to do so,the government must obtain a fisa warrant from the fisc.id.the fisa court of review assesses any denials by the fisc of applications for electronic surveillance.id.
thirty years later,congress enacted as part of the fisa amendments act of.section supplements fisa authority by creating a new framework under which the government may seek the fisc authorization of certain foreign intelligence surveillance targeting the communications of persons located abroad.clapper,at.unlike traditional fisa surveillance,does not require the government to demonstrate probable cause that the target of the electronic surveillance is a foreign power or agent of a foreign power.id.and,unlike traditional fisa,does not require the government to specify the nature and location of each of the particular facilities or places at which the electronic surveillance will occur.id.instead,mandates that the government obtain the fisc approval of targeting procedures,minimization procedures,and a governmental certification regarding proposed surveillance.id.at quoting a,c,i,i.
no fourth amendment violation 
although potentially raises complex statutory and constitutional issues,this case does not.as explained below,the initial collection of mohamud email communications did not involve upstreaming or targeting of mohamud under,more controversial methods of collecting information it also did not involve the retention and querying of incidentally collected communications.all this case involved was the targeting of a foreign national under,through which mohamud email communications were incidentally collected.confined to the particular facts of this case,we hold that the acquisition of mohamud email communications did not violate the fourth amendment 
at our request,the government declassified certain facts about mohamud surveillance.through the monitoring of a foreign national email account,the united states government learned that mohamud was in contact with that foreign national,who was located overseas.this contact a limited number of emails between mohamud and the foreign national was used to obtain a fisa warrant to surveil mohamud and his activities.none of these emails was introduced at trial we permitted the parties to file supplemental briefs to address the facts offered in the disclosure.
no warrant required to intercept overseas foreign national communications or to intercept person communications incidentally 
as a threshold matter,the fourth amendment does not apply to searches and seizures by the united states against a alien in a foreign country.united states zakharov,cir.citing united states,see also,at at the time of the search,respondent was a citizen and resident of mexico with no voluntary attachment to the united states,and the place searched was located in mexico.under these circumstances,the fourth amendment has no application.thus,the government monitoring of the overseas foreign national email fell outside the fourth amendment.
mohamud argues that under,the location of the search matters,and that here,the searches took place in the united states indeed,the government acknowledges that collection from service providers under section takes place within the united states.yet,as one court put it,what matters here is the location of the target,and not where the government literally obtained the electronic data.united states hasbajrami,wl,at,emphasis in original see also kris wilson,national security investigations prosecutions for person targets,there is no requirement the only thing that matters is the government reasonable belief about the target location.
consistent with and our precedent,we hold that this particular type of collection where a search was not directed at a person communications,though some were incidentally swept up in it does not require a warrant,because the search was targeted at a person with no fourth amendment right.
the fisa review court in in re directives pursuant to section of fisa,similarly applied this principle,holding that incidental collections occurring as a result of constitutionally permissible acquisitions do not render those acquisitions unlawful,fisa.see also united states donovan,holding that a title iii wiretap warrant is not made unconstitutional by failure to identify every individual who could be expected to be overheard,but the complete absence of prior judicial authorization would make an intercept unlawful united states bin laden,supp,explaining that in the title iii context,incidental interception of a person conversations during an otherwise lawful surveillance does not violate the fourth amendment.
mohamud and amici urge us not to apply this incidental overhear approach.first,amici contend that surveillance of persons communications under is not incidental because the monitoring of communications between foreign targets and persons was specifically contemplated and to some degree desired.we agree that such communications were anticipated.as the privacy and civil liberties oversight board found with respect to prism collection,t he collection of communications to and from a target inevitably returns communications in which are on the other end,some of whom will be persons.such incidental collection of communications is not accidental,nor is it inadvertent.pclob report at see also laura donohue,section and the collection of international telephone and internet content,harv.pub.pol y,discussing the relative volume and intrusiveness of surveillance authorized under.the fact that the government knew some persons communications would be swept up during foreign intelligence gathering does not make such collection any more unlawful in this context than in the title iii or traditional fisa context.
mohamud and amici also contend that the sheer amount of incidental collection separates from prior cases where courts have found such collection permissible.we agree with the district court observation that the most troubling aspect of this incidental collection is not whether such collection was anticipated,but rather its volume,which is vast,not de minimis.see pclob report at the term incidental is appropriate because such collection is not accidental or inadvertent,but rather is an anticipated collateral result of monitoring an overseas target.but the term should not be understood to suggest that such collection is infrequent or that it is an inconsequential part of the section program.this quantity distinguishes collection from title iii and traditional fisa interceptions.however,the mere fact that more communications are being collected incidentally does not make it unconstitutional to apply the same approach to collection,though it does increase the importance of minimization procedures once the communications are collected 
additionally,mohamud and amici contend that prior cases upholding incidental collection involved prior judicial review or a narrowly drawn exception to the warrant requirement,as opposed to the collection here.see,united states kahn,upholding interception of communications of a woman that were incidentally collected under a wiretap order targeting her husband united states figueroa,cir.holding that wiretap order was not made unconstitutional by permitting interception of conversations of others as yet unknown see also united states martin,cir.holding that the fourth amendment does not require wiretap application to show probable cause that individual named as a probable converser committed a crime,overruled on other grounds by united states de bright,cir.en banc.however,the searches in those cases targeted united states citizens and took place within the united states,so a warrant was required for the initial search to be constitutionally permissible.but the guiding principle behind them applies with equal force here when surveillance is lawful in the first place whether it is the domestic surveillance of persons pursuant to a warrant,or the warrantless surveillance of persons who are abroad the incidental interception of persons communications with the targeted persons is also lawful.hasbajrami,wl,at.
for these reasons,and because the target of the surveillance was a person located outside of the united states at the time of the surveillance,the government was not required to obtain a search warrant to collect mohamud email communications with the overseas foreign national as an incident to its lawful search of the foreign national email 
collection of mohamud emails was reasonable 
assuming that mohamud had a fourth amendment right in the incidentally collected communications,the search at issue was reasonable under the fourth amendment 
even if a warrant is not required,a search is not beyond fourth amendment scrutiny for it must be reasonable in its scope and manner of execution.maryland king.in deciding reasonableness,we examine the totality of the circumstances and weigh the promotion of legitimate governmental interests against the degree to which the search intrudes upon an individual privacy.id.quoting wyoming houghton.we agree with the district court that under these circumstances,the search was reasonable under the fourth amendment.
government interest 
t he government interest in combating terrorism is an urgent objective of the highest order.holder humanitarian law project.neither mohamud nor amici challenge this.instead,they argue that the statutory definition of foreign intelligence information in is overbroad because it is not confined to national security information but also includes the conduct of foreign affairs and even if national security justifies the initial acquisition,it is unreasonable to then retain and later search persons communications without a warrant.
the declassified facts foreclose both arguments.first,as the district court observed,the discovery in this case all concerned protecting the country from a terrorist threat and did not stray into the broader category of the conduct of foreign affairs.thus,we need not determine whether the collection of foreign affairs communications is reasonable.similarly,the second argument is also outside the scope of our review,as no such retention and querying is at issue in this case.
ii.mohamud privacy interest 
the parties agree that mohamud had some expectation of privacy in his electronic communications,but disagree as to the strength of his interest.the government argues that persons have a limited expectation of privacy when communicating electronically with persons located outside the united states because of the fourth amendment doctrine that a person privacy interest is diminished where he or she reveals information to a third party,even in confidence.mohamud contends that the voluntary disclosure of information to third parties does not reduce the expectation of privacy.the district court determined that under the doctrine,mohamud had a reduced expectation of privacy in his communications to third parties.we agree.
with respect to a person privacy interest,we treat emails as letters.see,redacted,wl,at fisa,whether they are transmitted by letter,telephone or,a person private communications are akin to personal papers.united states warshak,cir.given the fundamental similarities between email and traditional forms of communication,it would defy common sense to afford emails lesser fourth amendment protection.accordingly,until electronic communications reach the recipient,they retain the same level of privacy interest as if they were still in the home.see,united states van leeuwen.
but as with letters,a person reasonable expectation of privacy may be diminished in transmissions over the internet or that have already arrived at the recipient.united states heckenkamp,cir.quoting united states lifshitz,cir.citing guest leis,cir.see also guest,at users would lose a legitimate expectation of privacy in an that had already reached its recipient at this moment,the would be analogous to a,whose expectation of privacy ordinarily terminates upon delivery of the letter.citation omitted.
it is true that prior case law contemplates a diminished expectation of privacy due to the risk that the recipient will reveal the communication,not that the government will be monitoring the communication unbeknownst to the third party.see,united states miller,united states white,hoffa united states.while these cases do not address the question of government interception,the communications at issue here had been sent to a third party,which reduces mohamud privacy interest at least somewhat,if perhaps not as much as if the foreign national had turned them over to the government voluntarily.see also hasbajrami,wl at observing same distinction.
thus,mohamud interest in the privacy of his communications received by the overseas foreign national is diminished.
iii.privacy protecting measures 
an important component of the reasonableness inquiry is whether the targeting and minimization measures sufficiently protect the privacy interests of persons.targeting and minimization procedures govern,respectively,who may be targeted for surveillance and how intercepted communications are to be retained and disseminated.
in brief,targeting procedures must be reasonably designed to ensure that any acquisition authorized under the certification is limited to targeting persons reasonably believed to be located outside the united states and to prevent the intentional acquisition of any communication as to which the sender and all intended recipients are known at the time of the acquisition to be located in the united states.d.among other requirements,minimization procedures must be reasonably designed to minimize the acquisition and retention,and prohibit the dissemination,of nonpublicly available information concerning u
