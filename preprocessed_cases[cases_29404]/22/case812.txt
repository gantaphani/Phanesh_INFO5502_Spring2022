netword,llc,appeals the summary judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia,ruling that claim of netword united states patent the patent is not infringed by centraal corporation realnames system,either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents we affirm the judgment of.
claim construction 
an infringement analysis entails two steps.in the first step the court construes the patent claims by establishing the scope and boundaries of the subject matter that is patented,as a matter of law,and in the second step the trier of fact applies the construed claims to the accused device.see markman westview instruments,en banc,aff,d.the court construction of the claims often decides the question of infringement,whether literal infringement or under the doctrine of equivalents.see vivid technologies,american science engineering,it is well recognized that the construction of the claims may resolve some or all of the issues of infringement.
the district court claim construction,and the grant of summary judgment based thereon,receive plenary review on appeal.see emi group north america,intel.if disputed questions of material fact underlie the summary judgment t he evidence of the nonmovant is to be believed,and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.anderson liberty lobby,d.the appellate tribunal must assure itself that the nonmovant could not prevail on any reasonable version of the facts as presented on the summary judgment record.see id.at.the purpose of the summary judgment procedure is to avoid an unnecessary trial.
the patent,entitled universal electronic resource denotation,request and delivery system,describes and claims a system for locating and retrieving information on a distributed computer system or network,such as the internet,using aliases informal or incomplete designations to denote resources whose retrieval is sought.the accused centraal system,having the brand name realnames,also locates and retrieves internet information using aliases.in both systems,when a user enters an informal designation ibm the systems direct the user computer to the corresponding resource the web site of international business machines,the dispute concerns how these systems are structured and operate.
the patent system is directed to a computer network as set forth in claim 
an electronic resource denotation,request and delivery system within a network which shares information resources among its user community,comprising 
a central registry computer whose action is directed by software components,
one or more local server computers whose actions are directed by software components and linked to the central registry computer 
one or more client computers whose actions are directed by software components,and linked to a local server computer 
wherein the software components in these computers operate in concert as a distributed entity to allow client computers to denote resources with aliases that are unique across said server computers and said client computers,and further allow client computers to retrieve information corresponding to said aliases and 
wherein said aliases are maintained in at least said central registry computer and one or more of said local server computers.
as described in the patent,the central registry computer and local server computer maintain aliases and associated information such as resource addresses or uniform resource locators urls,descriptions of designated resources,and update information.the specification states that the local server database contains only certain of the resource aliases and their records and that the central registry computer maintains the entire collection of resource aliases in its database.relying on this and other descriptive text in the specification and explanations presented by an expert witness,the district court construed claim as directed to a system wherein the local server computer maintains a cache or limited database of aliases,and pulls information when needed from the central registry computer.on this claim construction,the district court granted centraal motion for summary judgment of.
netword argues that the functions of caching and pulling information by the local server are not required by claim,and that the district court impermissibly imported limitations into claim from the specification and from claims and.centraal responds that the specification and the prosecution history stress the role of the local server as an intermediary computer with a limited database that stores frequently accessed alias records the central registry computer updates this limited database on request from the local server.centraal states that the district court correctly construed claim as requiring that software components in the local server computer perform these functions.
netword argument that the district court improperly limited the scope of claim by importing the caching and pulling functions from the specification misperceives the role of claim construction in infringement analysis.the role is neither to limit nor to broaden the claims,but to define,as a matter of law,the invention that has been patented.the claims are always construed in light of the specification,of which they are a part.see slimfold kinkead.the role of the specification includes presenting a description of the technologic subject matter of the invention,while the role of claims is to point out with particularity the subject matter that is patented.see.the claims are directed to the invention that is described in the specification they do not have meaning removed from the context from which they arose.thus the claims are construed to state the legal scope of each patented invention,on examination of the language of the claims,the description in the specification,and the prosecution history.see renishaw plc marposs societa per azioni,t he interpretation to be given a term can only be determined and confirmed with a full understanding of what the inventors actually invented and intended to envelop with the claim.although the specification need not present every embodiment or permutation of the invention and the claims are not limited to the preferred embodiment of the invention,see comark communications,harris,neither do the claims enlarge what is patented beyond what the inventor has described as the invention.claim construction is the judicial statement of what is and is not covered by the technical terms and other words of the claims.see united states surgical ethicon.
the specification states that the local server computer functions to cache or locally store frequently accessed alias records,to obtain updates from the central registry computer,and to transmit records from the cache to the client computer.the specification states that the client computer first searches its own limited database and,if the alias is not stored therein,then requests the information from the local server computer,which in turn has a limited database that may be updated by request to the central registry database.in the system the local server computer only queries the central registry computer when the resource alias can not be found in the local server database.the specification explains caching as encompassing the storage of resource information for a period of time or while this information continues to be accessed at a reasonable rate.that such storage is inherently limited is shown in the specification statement that the aggregate of resource information at such a site directly reflects the level of use or access of a particular subset of the totality of resource aliases by client computers and users which connect to such a site,lines.thus the local server computer is a site containing a limited database of aliases reflecting the level of use or access of the totality of aliases maintained in the central registry.
netword argues that the district court erred when it construed claim to require the local server computer to maintain a cache of aliases,for claim does not state this limitation.netword argues that a broader construction is warranted by the specification,pointing to a version that is described in the specification as a implementation wherein both the local server software and the central registry software can be located in a single machine,enabling the client computer to be directly serviced by a single computer performing the functions of both the local server and the central registry computers.thus netword argues that the specification does not require that the local server computer maintain a limited database of aliases separate from that of the central registry computer,and that claim was incorrectly construed.
centraal responds that the specification defines the local server computer as an intermediary computer that caches frequently accessed alias records,transmits cached alias records to the client computer,and requests updates from the central registry.centraal points to various statements to this effect during prosecution of the claims.although the specification indeed shows the alternative system which simultaneously performs both central registry and local server functions,we agree with the district court that even in that system the distinct local server functions must be present and be performed as described in the specification.
we conclude that the district court correctly construed claim as requiring a local server computer that has a limited database of aliases and that may request updates from a central registry computer.the district court construction of the claimed element local server computer as requiring performance of these functions is affirmed.
netword also argues that the district court erred by reading into the claim term client computer the required performance of the function of caching as described in the specification,as well as the function of downloading and storing alias records that is specific to dependent claim.we do not reach this issue,for the construction of local server computer resolves the question of infringement,as we next discuss.
infringement 
to support a summary judgment of noninfringement it must be shown that,on the correct claim construction,no reasonable jury could have found infringement on the undisputed facts or when all reasonable factual inferences are drawn in favor of the patentee.see.c anderson liberty lobby,d a dispute is genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.our review of a grant of summary judgment is plenary.see cole.
to establish literal infringement,all of the elements of the claim,as correctly construed,must be present in the accused system.see cole,at,at.
netword did not dispute the centraal expert description of the accused realnames system.this expert technical explanation was the only expert evidence provided by either party.the expert explained that the centraal system creates and maintains metadata in the form of xml metadata database entries each entry represents a resource and its associated url.the metadata are kept on the computers that host the subscribers world wide web pages and therefore are distributed across the internet,forming a decentralized database.the realnames system,according to the centraal expert,does not use local server computers instead,the subscribers computers communicate directly with computers that are called resolver computers and store all of the realnames metadata entries.
the district court concluded that the system and the realnames system are fundamentally different in how they are structured and how they operate.in the realnames system its two groups of resolver computers,one on the east coast and one on the west coast of the united states,do not function as intermediary local servers between the client computers and a central computer,as in the system.instead,each resolver group has a complete copy of the realnames database,and does not function as an intermediary dissemination point.as a further distinction,the resolver computers do not request updated realnames metadata from a central computer if the information is not in the resolvers memory,the function that the district court described as pulling information by the local servers in the system.instead,the centraal central computer pushes updates to the resolvers,periodically transmitting unsolicited data to the resolvers and directing them to update the metadata in their memory.the resolver computers possess all of the information available through this system,and do not query a central registry 
the district court concluded that the realnames computers do not perform all of the functions of the local server computer in accordance with the correct construction of claim.we agree that the realnames computer system does not contain a local server counterpart of the limited database caching function of the local server and the pulling of information by the local server from a central registry.on the correct construction of the claim element local server computer and the undisputed facts of the operation of the realnames system,the summary judgment that the realnames system does not literally infringe the patent must be affirmed.
netword argues that even if there is not literal infringement,the realnames system infringes in terms of the doctrine of equivalents.for infringement by equivalency,all of the elements of the claimed invention or an equivalent thereof must be present in the accused system.see hilton davis chem,d,the rule reinforces the notice function of patent claims.the centraal system does not contain any element that is the same as or equivalent to the local server of claim.instead,the centraal system resolver computers serve as copies of a central registry or a central registry and a root server,but do not serve as a local server computer or the equivalent thereof.thus the rule is not satisfied by the centraal system.
the summary judgment that claim is not infringed under the doctrine of equivalents is affirmed.
evidentiary mattersa 
netword criticizes the district court reference to a conversation that was recorded between one of the inventors and his patent attorney about two months before the patent application was filed.netword argues that the district court improperly relied on this conversation in construing the claim.
netword is correct in its position that an inventor communication to his patent attorney is not dispositive of the scope of a patent and the construction of the claims.many factors can affect the description of an invention as it is presented in the specification and as it is claimed.this description,as well as the scope of the claims as ultimately granted after examination,may differ significantly from that of an inventor early communication to his attorney.however,an inventor communication to his attorney,if not asserted as privileged,may be received by the court and given whatever weight its content and the circumstances warrant.see stratoflex.aeroquip,uspq,it is jurisprudentially inappropriate to disregard any relevant evidence on any issue in any case,patent cases included.see generally charles mccormick,mccormick on evidence,john strong,ed discussing the role of the judge in determining admissibility.admissible evidence is weighed in accordance with its evidentiary value.
no objection to the inventor communication as privileged appears in the record provided.see in re spalding sports worldwide,the privilege applies to communications between an inventor and his patent attorney.it was not reversible error for the district court to refer to it as supporting the court view of the scope of the invention.
netword also criticizes the district court reliance on the centraal expert explanation of the structure and operation of the system of the patent and of the centraal system.the technical correctness of the expert explanation of these systems was not challenged by netword,although netword strongly disagrees with the expert conclusions as they relate to claim construction and infringement.
netword argues that the expert contradicts the functions of local server and client computers as claimed in claim.this criticism,however,is directed to the legal conclusion concerning the scope of the claim,not to the expert explanation of how the patented system works.we d
