matthew schuster pleaded guilty to intentionally accessing and recklessly causing damage to a protected computer in violation of a a ii.he was sentenced to fifteen months imprisonment and ordered to pay in restitution.schuster appeals his sentence,arguing that the district court erred in calculating both the loss amount resulting from the offense and the amount of restitution.we affirm schuster sentence.
background 
from until his termination,schuster worked as a computer technician for alpha computer services,wausau,wisconsin alpha.as an alpha employee,schuster provided computer technical support to central wisconsin wireless internet services cwwis,a wireless internet service provider,and its customers.he was also a paying customer of cwwis,using cwwis service for his home computer.
on may,alpha terminated schuster for refusing to provide technical support to a cwwis client.the same day,cwwis sent schuster a registered letter informing him that it had terminated his cwwis wireless internet access and refunded the balance of his monthly payment.
schuster continued to access cwwis wireless network with his home computer,however,by using the internet access information of various cwwis customers fischer group,riverbend properties,the wausau central wisconsin convention visitors bureau,and straight shot express.by connecting to cwwis network with the internet access information of these companies,schuster disrupted their wireless internet connection,which adversely affected their productivity.schuster continued his unauthorized use of cwwis network until october,when a police officer who was executing a search warrant at schuster house disconnected his computer.
a federal grand jury returned a indictment against schuster on october.count i charged schuster with violating a a i by knowingly causing the transmission of a code,program,command,or information to a protected computer used in interstate commerce and communication and intentionally causing damage of at least to the computer and to the computer user and customers.count ii charged schuster with violating a a ii by intentionally accessing a protected computer used in interstate commerce and communication without authorization and recklessly causing damage of at least to the computer and its user and customers.
on may,schuster pleaded guilty to count ii,conceding that the criminal conduct occurred between september,and october.he acknowledged that the government could prove at trial that he accessed the cwwis system,a protected system,without authorization.he further conceded that his access of the cwwis system caused damage by impairing the availability of the cwwis system to its customers and impairing the availability of information over the cwwis network to their customers.schuster also agreed to pay restitution and all losses covered by the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.
at the sentencing hearing,the district court considered and rejected several objections raised by schuster to the investigation report psr,finding that the loss amount and restitution amount were both.the district court determined that schuster total offense level was fourteen and the guideline imprisonment range was fifteen to months.the district court then sentenced schuster to fifteen months in prison to be followed by three years of supervised release and ordered him to pay in restitution.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
schuster appeals the district court determination of both the loss amount and amount of restitution.he argues that the loss amount should be below,which would result in an offense level of twelve and a guideline range of ten to sixteen months imprisonment.schuster contends that the district court erred by including in its calculation of the loss amount for fischer group based on lost productivity for approximately five days that fischer group spent to switch internet providers for travel by victims to meet with the fbi and for two victims to testify at the sentencing hearing on behalf of the government.he also asserts that the amount of restitution should be,not,because the government failed to meet its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that schuster actions caused fischer group to lose.
our review of a district court sentencing decision is deferential.we review the district court assessment of the amount of loss for clear error and will reverse only if the district court calculation evokes a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.united states schaefer,cir quoting united states vivit,cir.the meaning of loss under the sentencing guidelines,however,is a question of law that we review de novo.vivit,at.
fischer group loss of 
schuster challenges the district court inclusion of fischer group entire claim for in its calculation of the actual loss amount,arguing that this amount should be reduced by based on fischer group lost productivity preceding october,and for its costs in switching internet providers.he asserts that the government failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he was responsible for fischer group lost productivity and associated costs.we find that the district court did not clearly err in including the in its calculation of the loss amount attributable to schuster conduct and affirm the district court order of restitution in the amount of.
at the sentencing hearing,the district court heard testimony from two witnesses curt brodjieski,who testified on behalf of alpha and cwwis,and robert fischer,who testified on behalf of fischer.both witnesses testified regarding the existence of technologically unexplainable problems with cwwis internet service and fischer group internet connection.they testified that these problems were consistent with schuster use of fischer internet access information.these problems arose before september,and ended once schuster equipment was removed from his home in connection with the search warrant.such evidence was sufficient to raise the reasonable inference that schuster had caused the inexplicable problems before october.
this inference is bolstered by schuster threats of causing interference with the services delivered by alpha and cwwis.the psr reported that schuster had telephoned an alpha employee on october,and,during the course of the conversation,informed the alpha employee that he was leaving his home wireless antenna and equipment plugged in to harass alpha and cwwis.later,while playing an game,schuster wrote in a chat session with other game players that he was experiencing a poor wireless connection because he was not on any internet service provider customer list.he explained that the provider was making encryption changes and that he was having difficulty keeping up with these changes.schuster then wrote that he needed to find a way to broadcast interference from his wireless antenna just to fuck with them.the following day,october,schuster ran a google search over cwwis network using the following search terms how to broadcast interference over wifi ghz,interference over wifi ghz,wireless networks interference,and make device interfere wireless network.
the inference that schuster caused the,problems is supported further by the existence of denial of service attacks against cwwis customers throughout the summer.the psr reported that brodjieski had received a customer complaint on october,that the customer website was down.brodjieski investigated the computer that hosted that company website.he discovered that the computer was under a denial of service attack,which,in this instance,had occurred because the computer was overwhelmed with information or requests and could not keep up with the demand.brodjieski had encountered similar denial of service attacks during the summer.aware that schuster was connected to cwwis network,brodjieski terminated schuster connection and saw that the denial of service attack had ended.
schuster argues,however,that the district court finding that he was responsible for problems occurring before october,was contrary to the evidence.he asserts that from the day he was fired until september,he used cwwis i
