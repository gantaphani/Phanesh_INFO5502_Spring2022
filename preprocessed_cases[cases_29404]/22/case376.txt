a indictment charged chad hughes and gary bovey with various offenses involving the production and distribution of counterfeit united states currency.count i alleged that both individuals had conspired to make and to pass counterfeit currency count ii alleged that both individuals had made counterfeit currency and counts iii and iv charged them with passing counterfeit currency.after a jury trial,hughes was convicted on all counts he was sentenced to concurrent terms of months imprisonment on each count.bovey was convicted on counts i,ii and iii he was sentenced to concurrent terms of months imprisonment on each count.a fine also was imposed on hughes,and a period of supervised release and restitutionary obligations were imposed on each defendant.both defendants now appeal to this court.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we affirm the judgments entered by the district court 
background 
according to the government case at trial,hughes and bovey began producing counterfeit united states currency during or.the pair produced the counterfeit bills with a hewlett packard ink jet printer that bovey had stolen from an office supply store.hughes and bovey used bonded paper as well as colored ink to produce the bogus currency.at least one individual,chris ward,witnessed both defendants produce the fake bills.
in february,hughes and bovey passed several counterfeit bills to unsuspecting merchants in the west lafayette,indiana area.for instance,hughes paid for two purchases at a local tavern with counterfeit one hundred dollar bills.he also passed a counterfeit twenty dollar bill to a sales clerk at a target store.
an investigation into the forged bills led authorities to hughes and bovey.when the investigators first contacted them about the counterfeit bills,both defendants indicated that they had not passed fake one hundred dollar bills on the days in question.these statements further strengthened the investigators suspicions because,during these interviews,they had not mentioned the denomination of the phony currency.a grand jury returned a indictment against hughes and bovey for their involvement in the production and distribution of counterfeit currency.
discussiona.
prior to trial,hughes moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the first count was duplicitous because it charged him with conspiring to make and to pass counterfeit currency.in his view,this allegation comprised two separate crimes and therefore should not have been included in a single count.the district court denied the motion.the court reasoned that a conspiracy,even one with multiple illicit objectives,constitutes a single crime.
before this court,hughes again submits that the first count of the indictment contained duplicitous charges.in his view,the district court should have dismissed this count of the indictment.duplicity is the joining of two or more offenses in a single count.united states marshall,cir.the overall vice of duplicity is that the jury can not in a general verdict render its findings on each offense,making it difficult to determine whether a conviction rests on only one of the offenses or both.united states buchmeier,cir internal quotations omitted.a duplicitous indictment also may expose a defendant to other adverse effects including improper notice of the charges against him,prejudice in the shaping of evidentiary rulings,in sentencing and of course the danger that a conviction will result from less than a unanimous verdict.id.at internal quotations omitted.
count i of the indictment alleged that the defendants had conspired to make and to pass counterfeit bills in violation of the federal conspiracy statute.as hughes notes,making counterfeit bills alone constitutes a federal crime passing such counterfeit currency also constitutes a federal crime.see unlawful to counterfeit obligations unlawful to pass falsely made counterfeit obligations.
count i of this indictment,however,did not charge hughes with either of these violations.rather,the first count alleged a single criminal to commit an offense against the united states.to be sure,the indictment alleges that this single conspiracy had two illicit objectives,each of which constitutes a crime.however,as the supreme court has observed a conspiracy is not the commission of the crime which it contemplates,and neither violates nor arises under the statute whose violation is its object the single agreement is the prohibited conspiracy,and however diverse its objects it violates but a single statute.braverman united states.see also united states bruun,cir.consequently,t he allegation in a single count of a conspiracy to commit several crimes is not duplicitous,for t he conspiracy is the crime,and that is one,however diverse its objects.braverman,at.internal quotations omitted see also bruun,at.
we have recognized that when several statutes are alleged as the objective of a conspiracy,the government need only establish that the defendant illicit objective involved one of those statutes to convict.united states muelbl,cir.however,when several different crimes are the object of a single conspiracy,a jury possibly could find a defendant guilty of conspiracy even though the jurors do not agree on which crime was the object of the conspiracy.as the government points out,however,the instructions concerning count i given to the jury in this case told the jurors that,in order to convict hughes on count i,they had to agree unanimously that the defendants conspired to make counterfeit money or that they conspired to pass counterfeit money or that they conspired to do both accordingly,the instructions negated any possibility that hughes was convicted on the basis of a verdict.
the district court correctly determined that count i of the indictment was not duplicitous.
hughes also submits that the district court erred in calculating his sentence under b.in calculating the respective sentences of hughes and bovey,the district court relied,in part,upon b the defendants vigorously contested the applicability of this provision to their conduct.in particular,relying on application note to this provision,hughes and bovey submitted that b did not apply to individuals who produced the counterfeit bills through photocopying.in rejecting this contention,the district court took the view that the defendants had read too narrowly this application note.the court held that the application note did not exempt those who had photocopied from b enhancement rather,it exempted from an enhancement those individuals who had made obvious forgeries.on appeal,relying on application note of this provision,hughes renews his assertion that b does not apply to his conduct because he produced the counterfeit currency through photocopying 
under the sentencing guidelines,an offense involving counterfeit currency of the united states mandates a base offense level of.see.if the defendant manufactured or produced any counterfeit obligation or security of the united states,or possessed or had custody of or control over a counterfeit device or materials used for counterfeiting,the district court may increase the base level to pursuant to b.the guidelines create,however,a narrow exception to this enhancement embodied in b.at the time of hughes sentence,the commentary to provided that b and its enhancement do not apply to persons who merely photocopy notes or otherwise produce items that are so obviously counterfeit that they are unlikely to be accepted even if subjected to only minimal scrutiny,application 
however,contrary to hughes assertion,an individual conduct is not removed from the ambit of b simply because he produced the counterfeit notes through photocopying.as we have explained,t he obviously counterfeit language in application note modifies and limits both the merely photocopy and the otherwise produce language,and therefore the exception describes only one situation when the method used by the counterfeiter produces an obvious by photocopying or some other method.united states baronia,cir.simply put,t he proper inquiry for exclusion from b is not how the bills were made,but rather how well they were made.baronia,at.
