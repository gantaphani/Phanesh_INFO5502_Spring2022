insight,llc,and david linhardt collectively,brought this action in the cook county circuit court,alleging various tort claims against the spamhaus project spamhaus.spamhaus removed the case to the united states district court for the northern district of illinois.spamhaus answered the complaint and then,one month later,in open court,moved to withdraw its answer.the court granted that motion,as well as a motion by spamhaus counsel to withdraw.because spamhaus had elected not to defend the action,the court also entered a default,issued a preliminary injunction and requested evidence from to support a default judgment against spamhaus.upon receiving response,the court entered judgment,awarding to in damages,plus costs,and a permanent injunction.spamhaus,then represented by new counsel,challenged the judgment in a rule b motion to the district court.that motion was denied.spamhaus timely appeals both the default judgment and the district court denial of its rule b motion.for the reasons stated in this opinion,we affirm the entry of a default judgment,but vacate the award of damages and injunctive relief and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
backgrounda.facts 
spamhaus is a company limited by guarantee and organized under the laws of the united kingdom.it is an internet watchdog group in the business of identifying and blocking internet spam,or unsolicited bulk.in that capacity,it maintains the register of known spam operations rokso,a strikes list for internet users it believes are responsible for creating and distributing spam messages,ex.a at.through the rokso,spamhaus publishes a sort of blacklist of persons or businesses that have been thrown off a minimum of three internet service providers isps for violating the terms of use of the isp spamhaus classifies persons or entities who have had at least three strikes as spammers.although the process is not entirely clear from the record,it appears that isps can access spamhaus rokso list either directly or through the use of other databases into which the rokso is integrated if an isp then elects,it can employ the rokso as part of its own screening process for incoming messages directed to its spam filter.that is,an isp could see that a particular internet protocol ip address had been marked as a spammer on spamhaus rokso and then,as a result,might refuse to allow a message sent from that ip address to reach the intended recipient.

in december,spamhaus placed insight,llc,and linhardt on the rokso list.claims that it contacted spamhaus to inform it that a mistake had been made,but nevertheless it remains on the rokso list.also claims that spamhaus businesses who partner with companies and individuals on the rokso list and refuses to remove these partners from the blacklist until they terminate their relationship with the primary spammer on the rokso list.
district court proceedings 
brought this action in state court,claiming that spamhaus was liable in tort for losses suffered as a result of its placement on the rokso.specifically,the complaint alleged that spamhaus placing on the rokso list amounted to tortious interference with contractual relations,tortious interference with prospective economic advantage,defamation per se and defamation quod.it sought compensatory and punitive damages,as well as an injunction requiring spamhaus both to remove from the list and to place a notice on the spamhaus website that had been included on the rokso list in error.
spamhaus removed the case to the district court on the basis of diversity of citizenship.spamhaus then answered the complaint on july.in that answer,it denied many of allegations and asserted fourteen affirmative defenses.among those defenses were lack of personal jurisdiction,insufficient process and insufficient service of process.at.
on august,counsel for both sides appeared before the district court at a status call.the court began addressing the issue of diversity of citizenship when for spamhaus interrupted the court and the following exchange ensued 
brown for spamhaus your honor,if i may,before we get too far down what we are talking about here today,i have been authorized by my client to do precisely two things here this morning and,i do acknowledge that it is a bit of an unconventional maneuver.my client wants to 
the court you represent who 
brown the defendant 
the court okay.
brown spamhaus.
and my client wants to participate in the defense no further.
i am not authorized to do anything more today than to ask this court that the answer be withdrawn and,then,once we hear from this court on that,to get a ruling on our motion to withdraw as counsel.
the court engages counsel for the plaintiffs.
the court all right.
do you know whether your client has another law firm in hand or what their position is 
brown my my them is that they want to do absolutely nothing.
so,i do know for certain 
the court do they want to lose 
i mean,that is what is on the horizon if they want to do nothing.you have to defend the case.
brown they have been fully informed of the fact that the default judgment is a real possibility.and they are aware of that and are prepared to take that risk.
exchange regarding motion to withdraw as counsel the court okay.
here is what we are going to do.i am going to give you leave to withdraw the answer i am going to give you leave to withdraw and,in light of the fact that your client is aware of,apparently,has sent no one here to disagree with the request to withdraw and,i assume you told them it was a certainty that default is going to be entered without any resistance to the am going to enter a default order today.
court reinstates tro entered in state court 
the court granting the motion to withdraw as counsel 
and i will ask you,as your,if not your final act,at least approaching finality,to let you r client know what happened this morning.and tell them it is not just a risk that they will lose the case,but it is a certainty.and the first step has been undertaken with the entry of a default.
but no judgment,just a default.okay 
a week later,filed a motion for a default judgment,supported by an affidavit from linhardt that stated the amounts in which he believed his business had been harmed by being placed on the rokso.on september,the district court entered judgment and awarded the full amount of compensatory damages stated in linhardt affidavit,as well as in costs.it denied attorney fees and punitive damages.the court also entered a permanent injunction,the details of which we shall examine shortly.
spamhaus filed a timely rule b motion to vacate the default and the default judgment.at the hearing on that motion,new counsel for spamhaus articulated several bases for the motion.first,spamhaus reasserted its challenge to the fundamental power of the court to exercise jurisdiction for default or other purposes over a internet company.at.according to spamhaus,that defense could be independently raise d,and ha d nothing to do with whether the attorney appeared or not.because when they did appear,they properly asserted these defenses.id.at.spamhaus also advised the district court that it had received conflicting legal advice and that its instruction that prior counsel withdraw was based on a misunderstanding of the applicable law.finally,spamhaus raised various objections to the propriety of the specific relief awarded.the district court gave the following response 
i do not think there was anything unknowing or unintentional about the decision made not to defend this case once it got over here at some point 
t he idea that rule accommodates at least what may have seemed at the time an intelligent an intentional be used to reopen the consequence of the decision,knowingly made,i am not sure that is what rule is about.
secondly,yes,we do have to have jurisdiction over subject matter,as well as the person or presence of a defendant in the first instance.there is no question about that.
that was apparently,you say,pressed by way of an affirmative,at least,it was suggested as an affirmative defense,but not pressed.
we do not undertake to take one side of a case and look for,as meticulously as we can,for holes in the conduct of the party seeking some relief because the other side has failed to defend this case,or at least chose to abandon the defense of the case.
so,i think it would be unfair to the plaintiff at this point to,if you will,pretend as if none of these things took place before no opportunity to defend this case no decision made to knowingly abandon the defense and,then,start over and give somebody a brand new track.
id.at.although briefing was requested by spamhaus,the court immediately denied the motion 
spamhaus timely appealed both the entry of default judgment and the denial of its rule b motion to vacate that judgment.
discussion 
spamhaus raises many challenges to the district court entry of default judgment,the character of the relief awarded and the failure of the court to grant its rule b motion and to reopen for factual development certain of the issues decided in the default.specifically,spamhaus challenges the district court authority to enter a default judgment without affirmatively inquiring into the factual basis for personal jurisdiction and effective service.spamhaus also claims that it may assert lack of jurisdiction and improper service in this court and be relieved of the default judgment.on the question of the specific relief awarded,spamhaus challenges the district court calculation of damages based on linhardt affidavit alone.it also challenges the grant of injunctive relief and claims that,as written,the injunction violates the first amendment and is overbroad.
validity of the default 
we review both the district court decision to enter a default judgment and the denial of a motion to vacate the judgment for an abuse of discretion.homer,cir.
personal jurisdiction and service 
default judgments rendered without personal jurisdiction are void and,therefore,we shall set aside a default judgment as a per se abuse of discretion if the district court that entered the judgment lacked jurisdiction.swaim moltan,cir see also homer,at robinson eng g.pension plan trust george,cir bally export balicar,cir.
in support of its argument that the judgment is void,spamhaus contends that the district court abused its discretion in entering judgment without first conducting an affirmative inquiry into whether it had personal jurisdiction over spamhaus and whether service of process was effected in compliance with applicable rules.spamhaus concedes that this court has not imposed an affirmative duty on the district court to inquire into the factual bases for jurisdiction or service prior to entering a default.instead,at oral argument,spamhaus asked this court to craft a special rule,applicable in cases involving a foreign,defendant.such a rule is justified,claims spamhaus,by the emerging jurisprudence on entities and personal jurisdiction and by a series of other cases in which other courts have imposed such a duty in cases involving foreign defendants 
the cases on which spamhaus relies involve foreign defendants who had not appeared in the action.see dennis garberg,int l,cir a district court must determine whether it has jurisdiction over the defendant before entering judgment by default against a party who has not appeared in the case.emphasis added.we need not decide whether we would impose the same rule on district courts in this circuit if faced with that situation because it is not the one we face here spamhaus removed the case,actually appeared through counsel in federal court and filed an answer specifically challenging personal jurisdiction 
we see no reason to require the district court to raise sua sponte affirmative defenses,which may,of course,be waived or forfeited,on behalf of an appearing party who elects not to pursue those defenses for itself.see truserv flegles,cir noting that personal jurisdiction may be waived.for similar reasons,we do not believe that the district court was obligated to consider the validity of the judgment on jurisdictional grounds in its ruling on the rule b motion.nor do we see any reason why this court should reexamine the issue of personal jurisdiction.we acknowledge that under rule b,a party generally may challenge a default judgment as void for lack of personal jurisdiction at any time.see swaim,at noting that this rule recognizes that it is unfair to strip parties of a defense that may explain the omission that is potentially the basis for judgment against them.however,that general rule does not preserve in perpetuity a party claim regarding personal jurisdiction,regardless of any strategy it pursues in the district court.
as is clear from its oral ruling on spamhaus b motion,the district court interpreted its conduct preceding default as a waiver of the previously asserted defenses.see at noting that the court would not pretend as if none of these things took place and there had been no opportunity to defend this case,no decision made to knowingly abandon the defense id.at t he idea that rule accommodates at least what may have seemed at the time an intelligent an intentional be used to reopen the consequence of the decision,knowingly made,i am not sure that is what rule is about spamhaus chose to abandon the defense of the case.we review the factual determinations upon which a district court predicates a finding of waiver for clear error and the legal question of whether the conduct amounts to waiver de novo.ernst young llp baker holdings,cir.
we perceive no error in the district court conclusion that spamhaus intentionally elected to abandon its available defenses when it withdrew those defenses from consideration by the court and indicated that it was prepared to accept a default.spamhaus confirmed that it wished to participate in the defense no further and do absolutely nothing.see at.it was not erroneous to treat this kind of voluntary abandonment of defenses,raised but not pursued,as a waiver.see johnson zerbst.trs.of cent.laborers welfare fund lowery,cir noting that courts have recognized privileged defenses referred to in rule h may be waived by formal submission in a cause,or by submission through conduct,even before an answer is filed quoting marcial ucin,ss galicia,cir.based on its conduct before the court,we have no doubt that spamhaus understood the defenses available to it,consistently asserted those defenses in the early stages of those proceedings and then affirmatively elected to abandon those defenses before the district court.we see no reason to allow spamhaus to escape the consequences of that decision in the later stages of this proceeding 
notice of the default judgment 
spamhaus also claims that the default judgment entered was invalid because spamhaus was not served with the written notice of the application for a default judgment as provided by federal rule of civil procedure b and in a manner approved by rule.our review of the sufficiency of service of notice of a motion for a default judgment is de novo.homer,at.spamhaus requests a remand to determine whether,as a factual matter,service was proper.
a certificate of service attached to the motion for default and signed by an attorney for states that service of the motion was effected in three ways electronic filing with the clerk of the court,which will send notification of such filing to listed attorneys with the firm that formerly represented spamhaus federal express via international priority and caus ing to be hand delivered to the spamhaus project.at.under local rule a,this certification made by an attorney of record qualifies as proof of service.accordingly,the remaining question is whether any of these methods of service was acceptable under rule of the federal rules.
federal rule of civil procedure lists the acceptable methods of service of process under the federal rules.included among the acceptable forms of service is 
a delivering a copy to the person served by 
i handing it to the person 
ii leaving it at the person office with a clerk or other person in charge,or if no one is in charge leaving it in a conspicuous place in the office or 
iii if the person has no office or the office is closed,leaving it at the person dwelling house or usual place of abode with someone of suitable age and discretion residing there.
b a.delivery is,therefore,a specifically approved method of service under the rules.spamhaus conclusory allegation that no authorized representative of spamhaus has ever been properly served with delivery of any document,appellant br.at,without more,does not defeat the proof of service provided to the district court,nor does it require this court to remand to allow further factual development in the face of a certificate of service by an officer of the court.nor has spamhaus cited any precedent in support of its contention that the record must contain more specific evidence demonstrating how service was purportedly perfected.id.at.
moreover,although a party is not required to file a rule b motion in the district court to raise challenges to the entry of a default judgment,this court has recognized that when a party does so,the failure to raise certain defenses specifically may waive those defenses for purposes of appeal of the underlying judgment.see swaim,at.although our cases applying this rule have dealt with issues of personal jurisdiction,service to bring a party into the action and capacity to be sued,the logic employed in those cases applies with equal force to the particular defense of failure of notice under rule b.in each case,the request made on appeal from the underlying default judgment is that we remand for factual findings that would justify relief from the judgment because the district court has the special competence to make those findings of fact.see id.sensibly,then,when a party chooses to move for relief from judgment under rule b in the district court,that party should raise those defenses which require factual development that it anticipates raising in an appeal taken from the underlying judgment.as we stated in swaim moltan,cir,this approach 
promotes the twin concerns of juridical efficiency and respect for the unique factfinding capability of a district court this is not to deny our jurisdiction to entertain a direct appeal from a default judgment,see,but when a party chooses to utilize the attention and limited resources of a district court in a motion under rule b,we think it just and proper that it be required to put before the district court whatever infirmities support setting aside the default judgment.this brings to bear the district court factfinding function and unique knowledge of the case and maintains the court of appeals role as a forum for resolving disputed questions of fact.
id.at.in its b motion in this case,spamhaus never asserted that had failed to comply with the notice requirements of rule and that this failure justified relief from judgment.its only contention regarding service of process was a failure of service to bring it into the case,in connection with its argument that the district court lacked in personam jurisdiction.spamhaus now seeks an opportunity to offer countervailing proof on the issue of service of the motion for default judgment that is an argument that spamhaus should have addressed to the district court in the first instance when,as here,a rule b motion challenging the default judgment also was filed.
because the jurisdictional challenges spamhaus now seeks to raise have been waived and neither the district court nor this court has the duty to resurrect them,the district court did not abuse its discretion in entering judgment of liability nor in denying the motion for rule b relief.accordingly,we affirm the district court judgment on liability.
remedial issues 
spamhaus asserts that the district court erred in entering judgment in an amount of more than million on the basis of linhardt affidavit alone.it also cites a host of objections to the district court entry of injunctive relief.we consider each of its objections in turn.
as we have noted,at the hearing in which spamhaus withdrew its answer and prior counsel withdrew their appearance,the district court informed that it would be required to prove up its damages.at minimum,according to the court,the affidavit of a knowledgeable person would be required.in response,filed a formal motion for default judgment and attached linhardt affidavit.in his affidavit,linhardt stated that had lost actual and pending contracts,the value of which he had calculated to be,ex.a at.he further stated that he had lost numerous opportunities to obtain future work and that he had calculated the lost value of the business as a result of the inability to monetize the revenue potential from the company and in the lost enterprise value to be at least.id.he then provided a cursory statement of his calculation of the lost value to his enterprise.on the basis of this evidence,the district court entered judgment for compensatory damages in the full amount requested,more than million.
generally,this court will not reverse a damages award in a default judgment unless it is clearly excessive.merrill lynch mortgage narayan,cir.a default judgment establishes,as a matter of law,that defendants are liable to plaintiff on each cause of action alleged in the complaint.united states di mucci,cir.we also have stated,however,that,
e ven when a default judgment is warranted based on a party failure to defend,the allegations in the complaint with respect to the amount of the damages are not deemed true.the district court must instead conduct an inquiry in order to ascertain the amount of damages with reasonable certainty.
in re catt,cir citing credit lyonnais sec.usa,alcantara,cir.under the law of this circuit,judgment by default may not be entered without a hearing on damages unless the amount claimed is liquidated or capable of ascertainment from definite figures contained in the documentary evidence or in detailed affidavits.dundee cement howard pipe concrete,cir collecting authority.
linhardt affidavit is a conclusory statement of the lost value of his business,based largely on his calculations of lost future profits.it provides a list of businesses involved in actual and pending contracts and a total calculation of his calculation of loss,but says nothing about the status of his relationship with those businesses before was listed on the rokso.that is,the affidavit claims profit loss in absolute numbers,but provides no information whatsoever to support a finding that such future profits were certain prior to spamhaus act.particularly given the difficulties that illinois courts have acknowledged in proving amounts of lost future profits,see,sk hand tool dresser,d,see also tas distrib.cummins engine,cir collecting illinois authority on the difficulty of proving lost future profits as damages,this affidavit alone can not provide the requisite reasonable certainty for a damages award without the necessity of a hearing we therefore vacate the damages award and remand to the district court for a more extensive inquiry into the damages to which is entitled.
injunctive relief 
spamhaus also raises a number of challenges to the district court entry of a permanent injunction.under the terms of the injunction,spamhaus is prohibited from tak ing any action to cause email sent by plaintiffs or their affiliates,subsidiaries,or related companies owned or controlled by plaintiffs to be blocked,delayed,altered,or interrupted in any way,including,without limitation,by listing plaintiff sic on spamhaus rokso list unless spamhaus can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that plaintiffs have violated relevant united states law listing other networks owned or operated by as spammers without demonstrating that the clear and convincing standard had been met and contacting any customers or suppliers of in efforts to cause said customers or suppliers to cease doing business with or to alleg
