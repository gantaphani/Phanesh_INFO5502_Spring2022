appellant roger james sullivan pled guilty to one count of knowingly possessing child pornography images that were transported in interstate commerce via the internet,in violation of a b.appellant moved to have his indictment dismissed by the district court,arguing that congress lacked the power to proscribe purely intrastate possession of pornography,regardless of whether the pornography had traversed interstate over the internet.the district court denied sullivan motion,holding that congress acted within its authority under article i,of the constitution when it criminalized certain activities relating to material constituting or containing child pornography.
on appeal,sullivan renews his constitutional claim.we agree with the district court that his argument fails.the supreme court decision in gonzales raich,d,which was decided after the district court ruling,directly controls the disposition of this case.we also reject appellant objections to the conditions of his supervised release imposed by the district court.
background 
section a b prohibits 
knowingly possess ing any book,magazine,periodical,film,videotape,computer disk,or any other material that contains an image of child pornography that has been mailed,or shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means,including by computer,or that was produced using materials that have been mailed,or shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means,including by computer.
a b.on february,appellant was indicted on one count of possession often or more items of child pornography that had been transported in interstate or foreign commerce by computer,in violation of a b.in november,sullivan executed a plea agreement,which included a proffer of facts supporting a guilty plea on the a b charge he then entered a conditional plea of guilty,preserving for appeal the issue of whether a b,as applied to him,exceeded congress authority under the commerce clause.
the proffer of facts supporting the plea agreement is straightforward.in,appellant was working for fox news productions in washington,fox is a broadcast and cable news network that produces and distributes news and information programs throughout the united states.in march,the fbi received a telephone call from an employee at fox,reporting that approximately files of pornography had been found on the computer at appellant workplace.the fbi retrieved the hard drive and zip disks from appellant computer and found thousands of images of child pornography that had been downloaded from various internet sites,through usenet,located in atlanta,georgia,via the fox news internet provider,mci uunet,whose server is located in herndon,virginia.the national center for missing and exploited children analyzed the pornography and determined that many of the images were downloaded from eastern european and russian internet sites.an officer from the united states navy center for child protection would have testified that,in her expert opinion,at least of the images given to her for examination contained enough detail and content to determine that they depicted children who were under years of age and four images depicted children who were prepubescent.an expert in forensic audio,video and image analysis from the fbi laboratory would have testified that these images were taken from photographs of real children and were not artificially created.
appellant admitted that he personally downloaded the images of child pornography from the internet.he admitted that he knew it was illegal to download the images of child pornography from the internet.he acknowledged that he had exclusive access to his computer,so no one else was involved in downloading the pornography to his computer.he also admitted that he had copied the contents of his hard drive to a substitute hard drive and that he had acquired the zip disks in order to move personal data,including the images of child pornography,from the hard drive of his workplace computer.
on december,sullivan moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that a b,as it applied to him,exceeded congress authority under the commerce clause.on december,the district court convened a motions hearing and both parties offered arguments addressing the eleventh circuit decision in united states maxwell,cir maxwell i,which had held that congress could not regulate intrastate possession of child pornography.maxwell i was vacated and remanded by the supreme court in light of gonzales raich,see united states maxwell,d mem,and subsequently overturned by the eleventh circuit,see united states maxwell,cir maxwell ii.
without the benefit of either raich or maxwell ii,the district court denied appellant motion to dismiss the indictment.the court ruled that a b was constitutional as applied to sullivan,because the images of child pornography were instrumentalities or things in interstate commerce and passed over the internet,a channel of interstate commerce,or,alternatively,because the conduct at of child a substantial relation to interstate commerce.in the trial court view,congress acted within its authority when it sought to limit the supply and demand for child pornography by targeting all participants in the illicit market 
congress intended to reach people who create this kind of material,and also people who are seeking it through whatever means,including through the internet.people like sullivan fuel the market for it.
motions tr.at.
subsequently,on september,the district court conducted a hearing to address issues related to appellant sentence.after securing the parties agreement that the presentence report psr contained no factual errors,the court went on to hear arguments regarding the proper sentence.the court explained that it would apply the sentencing guidelines,not the version currently in force,in order to give appellant the benefit of a lower base offense level.see united states bolla,discussing a b.the parties presented arguments related mainly to sullivan psychological condition and the method of applying the guidelines in light of united states booker,d.the district court then sentenced appellant to months imprisonment,to be followed by two years of supervised release.three of the conditions of supervised release are at issue in this appeal 
the defendant shall not possess or use a computer that has access to any computer service at any location,including his place of employment,without the prior written approval of the probation office.computer service includes,but is not limited to,any internet service provider,bulletin board system,or any other public or private computer network.
without the approval of a legal guardian,the defendant shall have no direct,or indirect,contact with children,age or younger,and shall refrain from loitering in any place where children congregate,including but not limited to residences,arcades,parks,playgrounds,and schools.he shall not reside with a child or children under the age of without the expressed and written approval of the minor legal guardian and the written permission of the court.
the defendant shall not possess any pornographic,sexually oriented,or sexually stimulating materials,including visual,auditory,telephonic,or electronic media,computer programs or services that relevant sic to the offender deviant behavior pattern.he shall not patronize any place where pornography or erotica can be accessed,obtained,or viewed,including establishment sic where sexual entertainment is available.
judgment in a criminal case,united states sullivan,cr,at numbering added.
appellant now renews his challenge to the indictment,maintaining that,as applied to him,a b represents an unconstitutional exercise of congressional power.he also challenges certain of the conditions of supervised release imposed by the district court.
ii.analysis 
a.the constitutionality of sullivan indictment 
appellant makes the following argument in support of his appeal 
title a b is unconstitutional as applied to sullivan because the statute exceeds congress authority pursuant to the commerce clause.in united states lopez,d,the supreme court identified three areas that congress could regulate pursuant to the commerce clause the channels of interstate commerce the instrumentalities of interstate commerce and conduct that substantially affects interstate commerce.at.as case authority shows,the conduct regulated a purely intrastate activity,and therefore if it may be regulated at all,it can be regulated only pursuant to the third lopez category congress can not regulate sullivan conduct pursuant to the third lopez category because the conduct did not substantially affect interstate commerce.
appellant br.at.the problem with this argument is that it completely ignores the court decision in gonzales raich.
the question before the court in raich was whether the power vested in congress by article i,of the constitution t o make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution its authority to regulate commerce with foreign nations,and among the several states includes the power to prohibit the local cultivation and use of marijuana in compliance with california law.at.in answering this question in the affirmative,the court tellingly noted 
our case law firmly establishes congress power to regulate purely local activities that are part of an economic class of activities that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.see,perez united states,d wickard filburn.as we stated in wickard,even if appellee activity be local and though it may not be regarded as commerce,it may still,whatever its nature,be reached by congress if it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce,at.we have never required congress to legislate with scientific exactitude.when congress decides that the total incidence of a practice poses a threat to a national market,it may regulate the entire class.
id.at.careful review of the court decision in raich makes it clear to us that the holding there controls the disposition of this case.if,under raich,congress may criminalize purely intrastate production and use of marijuana,it follows here that it may criminalize possession of child pornography that has been transmitted through multiple states via the internet.
under federal law,marijuana is classified as a schedule i drug,c,and its use is therefore illegal,id.a,a,with a very limited exception for research uses,id.f.california compassionate use act,however,allowed certain patients with a doctor approval to cultivate,possess,and consume marijuana.raich.at.the plaintiffs in raich included california residents who suffer ed from a variety of serious medical conditions and sought to avail themselves of medical marijuana pursuant to the terms of the compassionate use act.id.at.they were under the care of licensed,family practitioners,who had concluded that marijuana was the only drug available that would give these parties effective treatment.id.at.when it was determined that their possession and use of marijuana violated federal law,the raich plaintiffs brought suit against the attorney general seeking injunctive and declaratory relief prohibiting the enforcement of the controlled substances act csa insofar as it abrogated their rights under the compassionate use act.as noted above,the only issue before the court in raich was whether congress could criminalize intrastate possession and use of marijuana.significantly,the raich plaintiffs did not attack the provisions of the csa on their face,but mounted only an challenge.see id.at.despite the narrowness of the challenge,the court found no constitutional defect in the government enforcement of federal drug law.
in support of the proposition that congress had power to regulate purely local activities that are part of an economic class of activities that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce,id.at,the court described the evolution of the commerce clause 
as charted in considerable detail in united states lopez,our understanding of the reach of the commerce clause,as well as congress assertion of authority thereunder,has evolved over time.the commerce clause emerged as the framers response to the central problem giving rise to the constitution itself the absence of any federal commerce power under the articles of confederation.for the first century of our history,the primary use of the clause was to preclude the kind of discriminatory state legislation that had once been permissible.then,in response to rapid industrial development and an increasingly interdependent national economy,congress ushered in a new era of federal regulation under the commerce power,beginning with the enactment of the interstate commerce act in,stat,and the sherman antitrust act in,stat,as amended,et.
cases decided during that new era,which now spans more than a century,have identified three general categories of regulation in which congress is authorized to engage under its commerce power.first,congress can regulate the channels of interstate commerce.perez united states,d.second,congress has authority to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce,and persons or things in interstate commerce.ibid.third,congress has the power to regulate activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.nlrb jones laughlin steel.
id.at footnotes omitted.the court then noted that only the third of activities that substantially affect interstate at issue in the case.id.
in amplifying this third category,the raich court focused on its decision in wickard filburn,which had held that congress interstate commerce authority allowed it to regulate the production of wheat intended for personal consumption on a farm.central to the court analysis in wickard was the premise that even if the effect of homegrown wheat on interstate commerce was trivial,it remained within the ambit of congressional authority.see wickard,at.the raich court found that the similarities between this case and wickard are striking.at.both cases involved the cultivation,for home consumption,of a fungible commodity for which there is an established interstate market.id.and j ust as the agricultural adjustment act in wickard was designed to control the volume of wheat moving in interstate and foreign commerce in order to avoid surpluses and consequently control the market price,a primary purpose of the csa in raich is to control the supply and demand of controlled substances in both lawful and unlawful drug markets.id.at third and fourth alterations in original internal citations omitted.the court thus concluded that congress had a rational basis for concluding that leaving marijuana outside federal control would affect price and market conditions,especially given the risk of illicit diversion of homegrown marijuana into the interstate market.id.at.
the court in raich then stated the applicable test for assessing the scope of congress authority under the commerce clause to enact comprehensive legislation 
w e stress that the task before us is a modest one.we need not determine whether respondents activities,taken in the aggregate,substantially affect interstate commerce in fact,but only whether a rational basis exists for so concluding.
id.at.applying this test,the court held that,
g iven the enforcement difficulties that attend distinguishing between marijuana cultivated locally and marijuana grown elsewhere and concerns about diversion into illicit channels,we have no difficulty concluding that congress had a rational basis for believing that failure to regulate the intrastate manufacture and possession of marijuana would leave a gaping hole in the csa.thus,as in wickard,when it enacted comprehensive legislation to regulate the interstate market in a fungible commodity,congress was acting well within its authority to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper to regulate commerce among the several states,art.i.that the regulation ensnares some purely intrastate activity is of no moment.as we have done many times before,we refuse to excise individual components of that larger scheme.
id.at footnote omitted and second ellipsis in original.
applying this test to facts of this case,we must conclude that congress was acting well within its authority under article i,to regulate activities that substantially affect interstate commerce,raich.at criminalizing possession of child pornography transmitted through several states via the internet.the prohibition against possessing child pornography transported in interstate commerce by computer is one important aspect of a comprehensive legislative scheme aimed at eliminating traffic in child pornography.section a b,which is at issue in this case,was enacted as part of the child pornography prevention act of,stat,the cppa.the regulatory scheme enacted by congress to deal with child pornography prohibits exploiting children by producing child pornography using materials in interstate commerce,transporting,shipping,or receiving depictions of child pornography in foreign or interstate commerce,id.producing or exporting child pornography abroad with the intent that it enter the united states,id.and possessing child pornography that has traveled in interstate commerce,id.the statute also subjects property used in child pornography offenses to criminal and civil forfeiture provisions.id.
like the illicit drug networks motivating passage of the csa,the trade in child pornography is quintessentially economic.see raich.at.the court explained that economics refers to the production,distribution,and consumption of commodities.id.at quotingwebster third new international dictionary.the activities targeted by congress in its pornography legislation clearly fit this definition.like marijuana,child pornography is a fungible commodity for which there is an established,albeit illegal,interstate market.id.at.controlling the trade of child pornography thus requires regulation of the illicit marketplace.intrastate possession of digital child pornography is susceptible to diversion into interstate markets,at least as much as marijuana.accordingly,the government efforts to control the illicit marketplace by limiting supply and demand is facilitated by regulation of intrastate possession of child pornography.
indeed,the economic effects in this case appear to be even more compelling than those in raich or wickard.in contrast to wheat or marijuana,the supply of electronic images of child pornography has a viral character every time one user downloads an image,he simultaneously produces a duplicate version of that image.transfers of wheat or marijuana merely subdivide an existing cache transfers of digital pornography,on the other hand,multiply the existing supply of the commodity,so that even if the initial possessor holdings are destroyed,subsequent possessors may further propagate the images.this means that each new possessor increases the available supply of pornographic images.this multiplying effect highlights the importance of eliminating a possessor stash in the first instance,before it can be disseminated into the marketplace.
as congress noted in the findings attached to the cppa,prohibiting the possession and viewing of child pornography will encourage the possessors of such material to rid themselves of or destroy the material,thereby helping to protect the victims of child pornography and to eliminate the market for the sexual exploitative use of children,stat.at emphasis added.in wickard,the court recognized that the congressional objective of controlling the market for wheat by regulating its price can be accomplished as effectively by sustaining or increasing the demand as by limiting supply,including the homegrown supply consumed by farmers.at.criminalizing possession of child pornography likewise increases the price of pornography by attaching the risk of prosecution,a market intervention meant to eliminate the illicit trade.
in sum,following raich,we find that a rational basis exists for believing that failure to regulate the intrastate possession of child pornography that has been transported in interstate or foreign commerce by computer,see a b,would leave a significant gap in congress comprehensive efforts to eliminate the market for sexually exploitative uses of children.that the application of a b might ensnare some purely intrastate activity is of no moment.raich.at.congress legitimately identified a national problem that is quintessentially economic,it involves the manufacture and distribution of a commodity subject to the forces of supply and demand.to ameliorate that problem,congress intervened in an illicit marketplace.because it could rationally conclude that intrastate possession of child pornography has an effect on those market forces,it acted within its authority in proscribing possession.both the holding and reasoning of raich apply easily to this case.
it is noteworthy that every appellate court that has considered this question has reached the same conclusion that we reach today.in maxwell ii,the eleventh circuit was able to find very little to distinguish constitutionally maxwell claim from raich.maxwell ii,at footnote omitted.following the court analysis in raich,the maxwell ii court determined that the cppa is part of a comprehensive regulatory scheme criminalizing the receipt,distribution,sale,production,possession,solicitation and advertisement of child pornography.id.at.the court therefore reversed its earlier course and upheld maxwell conviction.the fourth circuit likewise rejected an challenge to a b in united states forrest,cir.having found the case before it strikingly similar to raich,the court explained that in both instances congress had a rational basis for concluding that prohibition of mere local possession of the commodity was essential to the regulation of an established,albeit illegal,interstate market.id.at quoting raich.at.finally,the tenth circuit has twice invoked raich in rejecting similar attacks on prohibition against producing child pornography using materials that have been shipped in interstate commerce,united states grimmett,cir united states,cir,and the sixth circuit has cited raich in rebuffing an attack on a,united states chambers,cir.applying the principles set forth in raich,we,too,are constrained to reject the constitutional challenge to a b.
b.the terms of supervised release 
sullivan also challenges the conditions of supervised release,focusing on the conditions that restrict his use of computer and internet services,require him to have approval from the probation office before having any contact with minors,and forbid his possession of sexually stimulating material and video equipment.he asserts that these conditions were unlawfully imposed,because they were not listed as suggested conditions of release in either the sentencing guidelines or the psr and he received no other advance notice that the court might impose them,as allegedly required by federal rule of criminal procedure i c.appellant also contends that the conditions are inconsistent with the statutory factors listed in a,which the court was bound to consider in issuing or special terms of supervised release,see id.d,and that the district court never substantiated the need for the disputed conditions.applying the applicable plain error standard of review,we find none of these arguments persuasive.
our analysis of appellant sentencing arguments turns on his failure to lodge any objections with the district court.appellant and his counsel stood in the sentencing judge presence,listened to the specific terms of the sentence,and yet voiced no objections to any alleged lack of advance notice or opportunity to comment on the proposed conditions,or to the substance of the terms of supervised release.when a defendant fails to raise a timely objection with the district court,we review arguments introduced on appeal for plain error.united states simpson.to prevail,an appellant must show that the district court committed a legal error that was plain a term that is synonymous with clear or obvious,and that affected the appellant substantial rights.united states olano,d.if all three conditions are met,we retain discretion to notice a forfeited error,but only if the error seriously affects the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.at.
appellant first contends that,because the challenged conditions of supervised release were not listed as mandatory or discretionary conditions in th
