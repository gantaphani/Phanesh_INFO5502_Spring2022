alois larry wolk,was convicted of one count of transporting child pornography violating a and three counts of possessing child pornography violating a b.wolk primary argument on appeal is that the supreme court decision in ashcroft free speech coalition,d requires the dismissal of his indictment.wolk also challenges the district court denial of his suppression motion,his batson challenge,and his objection to the district court sentencing enhancement under section b of the sentencing guidelines.we find no error and affirm his sentence.
as part of an undercover investigation,detective sergeant michael zaglifa posed as a girl with the screen name in an internet relay chat room entitled preteen.eventually,received a request for a private internet chat from wolk,who was using the screen name of fish.wolk then sent obscene,graphic photos of children engaging in sex,incest,and bondage.during the conversation,wolk identified himself as a man named simon.
based upon the chat room exchange and upon information obtained from wolk internet service provider,the federal bureau of investigation fbi obtained a search warrant for wolk residence.on november,at approximately,seven state agents and federal officers executed the search warrant.the officers knocked at the door wolk wife answered and advised them that wolk was at a training seminar.after attempting to contact wolk,two of the state officers traveled to wolk nearby office and informed him that a search warrant was being executed at his residence.at that time,the officers advised wolk that although he did not have to return to his residence,his wife wished for him to be there.
wolk then drove himself home,and the officers followed him.however,at one point the cars were separated,and as a result wolk arrived before the officers at approximately upon arrival,he encountered fbi special agent gerald bell,who informed him that the officers had a search warrant for his residence,acquired in the course of a child pornography investigation.wolk then sat down in the living room with bell and two other officers.wolk wife remained in the kitchen with another officer.
bell told wolk that if he wanted to talk,it was of his own free will and that he was free to go at any time.h e was not under arrest.wolk replied that he was willing to talk with them.he admitted to the officers that he had installed a file server on his computer,but insisted that he only used it to trade music files.
one officer then told wolk that the authorities knew there was child pornography in the house.wolk then admitted that he had child pornography on his computer,that he had been collecting it for two years,and that he had sent child pornography from the file server in his house.wolk indicated that he archived his file server onto three cd roms.the officers then seized the cds and his computer.on them,officers found numerous pornographic images,a portion of which contained child pornography.
wolk then voluntarily signed a statement.in the statement,he admitted he used the screen name fish,identified himself as a sixty to male named simon,and traded nude internet pictures of adults,teens,and some child pornography.the authorities completed the residential search at approximately 
wolk was then indicted and later convicted of one count of transporting child pornography and three counts of possessing child pornography.his appeal alleges four errors.
first,wolk argues that the supreme court decision in ashcroft free speech coalition,d requires the dismissal of his indictment.we disagree.ashcroft,which declared portions of the child pornography prevention act of unconstitutional and overbroad,does not provide the relief wolk seeks.
in congress passed the child pornography prevention act of the act.prior to the passage of the act,the definition of child pornography applied to visual depictions of actual minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct.ashcroft,at.after its passage,however,the act expanded the definition of child pornography to criminalize virtual pornography.this included any visual depiction,including a image,that is,or appears to be,of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct,and also included any sexually explicit image that was advertised,promoted,presented,described,or distributed in such a manner that convey ed the impression of depicting a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.united states deaton,cir per curium citing ashcroft,at.
however,in ashcroft,the supreme court declared these in b and d and overbroad under the first amendment.ashcroft,at.in declaring these provisions unconstitutional,the court relied upon two of its prior first amendment decisions miller california,d and new york ferber,d.the court noted that generally under miller,pornography can be banned only if it is obscene.ashcroft,at.nevertheless,it observed that under ferber pornographic images depicting actual children can be proscribed regardless of their obscenity.id.at.the court observed that ferber permits such regulation because production of child pornography is intrinsically related to child sexual abuse.child pornography is a permanent record of a child abuse and the continued circulation itself would harm the child.id.however,the court noted that the act ban on virtual child pornography in section b prohibits speech that records no crime and creates no victims by its production and covers materials beyond the categories recognized in ferber and miller.id.at.as a result,it declared section b overbroad.id.at.likewise,the court concluded that section d was overbroad.id.at.after considering the government reasons for such regulation,the court held that their justifications were insufficient,and thus these sections were unconstitutional under the first amendment.id.at.
the government charged wolk with transporting and possessing child pornography.a,a b.ashcroft did not declare either of these statutes unconstitutional,united states kelly,cir ashcroft struck down only the statute expanded definition of child pornography to encompass virtual material.however,the government indictment defined child pornography to include virtual pornography and contained the precise language that ashcroft later declared unconstitutional wolk thus argues that his indictment is constitutionally infirm and should be dismissed.
before considering wolk claim,however,we must first identify our standard of review.the government urges that plain error is the appropriate standard because wolk failed to preserve this objection below.we agree.
in order to preserve an issue for appeal,a defendant must timely object and clearly state grounds for his objection so that the trial court has an opportunity to prevent or correct error.united states williams,cir.wolk filed a timely motion to dismiss,but whether he clearly stated the grounds for his objection is at issue.in one section of his motion,wolk stated 
because defendant constitutional rights a against,b to equal protection,c his civil rights to be free from oppressive acts of the police and d to due process of law under the missouri and united states constitution have been violated,the defendant respectfully requests that all charges brought against him by the state be dismissed by this court.
appellant app.at.on its face this section does not clearly state grounds for objection.instead the section is vague,conclusory,and confusing.not only does it not reference the indictment,it does not address anything even remotely relating to the issue of virtual the first amendment or the statutes,a,a b.
however,when we read with it other sections of the motion,his objection becomes motion related to his argument that the police obtained evidence in violation of miranda.paragraph three of the motion states that i f the court grants the defendant motion to suppress all evidence gathered after the failure to give miranda warnings to the defendant,there would be insufficient evidence to support the above referenced charges and therefore,such charges would be subject to dismissal due to lack of evidence.id.further,the statements of wolk counsel at the motion hearing confirm this conclusion.wolk counsel stated that the motion to dismiss only bears relevance after the court makes a determination on the suppression hearing.i do think that it ripe until after the court determines whether the statements are admissible by wolk.mot.hearing trans.at.
no mention was made of virtual pornography or of any first amendment claims.thus,by negative inference,wolk has stated both orally and in writing that the motion does not relate to any of the issues presented in ashcroft.wolk even conceded this expressly.at the beginning of the hearing,the district court asked wolk counsel whether his motion was attacking the facial validity of the statute.wolk counsel replied that his rights were being by being by the involuntary statement that was taken id.at.as a result,the district court summarized his understanding of the motion so really,it all goes to the evidence that to be offered in the suppression hearing,to which wolk counsel replied,that correct,your honor.id.
therefore,not only did wolk not preserve the virtual pornography argument,he never made it.as a result,we review wolk constitutional challenge for plain error.
in order to establish plain error,wolk must show that the district court committed an error,deviated from a legal rule,the error was plain,clear under current law,and the error affected wolk substantial rights.united states white,cir.if there is indeed error that is plain,then wolk bears the burden of proving that it affec ted his substantial rights.united states olano,d citations omitted.in most cases,this means that he must show that the error was prejudicial.id.if wolk can overcome these obstacles,he still must overcome one more hurdle.because our authority to correct plain error is discretionary,we will not exercise our discretion unless the error seriously affects the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.at.citations omitted.
the government concedes the first two the indictment was erroneous because it included a definition that was unconstitutional and that the error was plain because of ashcroft.it submits,however,that the error did not affect wolk substantial rights and,alternatively,that affirming wolk convictions would not seriously affect the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.we agree that wolk has not carried his burden.
we come to this conclusion because the evidence established that the children depicted in the pictures introduced at trial were actual children,no one ever claimed,or even hinted,that the images were of virtual children,and wolk stipulated that these were actual children.united states hall,cir.
first,the evidence establishes that the children in the pictures at issue were real.the photos introduced for count i transportation of child pornography were described by the undercover agent in human terms boys with erections brother and a sister enjoying each other girls engaging in sex acts.trans.of voir dire tr.at.likewise,fbi special agent jerry bell testified that the photos introduced for counts ii,iii,and iv possession of child pornography were images of child pornography,which he defined as children under eighteen engaged in sex acts or sexually explicit activity.tr.trans.at.
moreover,these pictures are in the record.we have examined them.upon review,we conclude the children depicted in these images were real.see united states richardson,cir performing a plain error analysis and concluding the same see also hall,at same united states pearl,cir briscoe,dissenting same.
second,there was no testimony or evidence presented at trial that the pictures were virtual images.while not evidence in the case,the opening statements of both counsel are illustrative.in the government opening statement,the assistant united states attorney stated,let me be clear here.i am not talking about art.i talking about children engaged in sex acts.that what this child pornography is.trans.of voir dire tr.at.wolk counsel stated likewise,now what i also want to make clear is we not disputing that the pictures that they going to show you are child pornography.evidence is going to show that the pictures are child pornography.we not standing here defending those disgusting pictures.id.at.wolk counsel also stipulated to the court the same.tr.of testimony of alois larry wolk direct examination vol.at.these comments are consistent with wolk he did not knowingly possess or transport the child pornography images.
finally,wolk admitted numerous times that the images were child pornography and that there were actual minors in the pictures.he first admitted this during his initial questioning when he told bell that he had child pornography on his computer.another officer then advised wolk that child pornography involved children engaged in sexual activity,photos of children engaged in sexual activity.wolk agreed that he had photographs which met the described definition.tr.of testimony of alois larry wolk direct examination vol.at.
later at trial wolk testified that the images from the three computer cds that were introduced into evidence were child pornography.tr.of testimony of alois larry wolk direct examination vol.at.he also admitted that it is harmful to possess and trade child pornography because it harmful to our society,to the people doing it,to the children.id.at.emphasis added.
we thus conclude that although plain error exists in the indictment,wolk was not prejudiced.his indictment did contain two portions of the definition of child pornography that were later found to be unconstitutional.however,this error did not prejudicially influence wolk trial because the pictures he transported and possessed were of real children as a result,wolk constitutional challenge fails.
wolk also argues that the district court erred when it denied his motion to suppress.wolk motion contended the police obtained his confession in violation of miranda arizona,d because they did not advise him of his constitutional rights.miranda dictates that an individual must be warned about the rights encompassed in the privilege against before he or she is taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom by the authorities in any significant way and is subjected to questioning.united states wallace,cir citing miranda,at.
the government agreed that no miranda warnings were given,but responds they were not necessary because wolk was not in custody.the district court concurred with the government and denied wolk motion to suppress.in determining whether wolk was in custody,we uphold the district court findings of historical fact unless clearly erroneous,but we apply the controlling legal standard to the historical facts utilizing an independent review.united states axsom,cir citation omitted.
t he initial determination of custody depends on the objective circumstances of the interrogation,not on the subjective views harbored by either the interrogating officers or the person being questioned.stansbury california,d.further,we must examine both the presence and extent of physical and psychological restraints placed upon the person liberty during the interrogation in light of whether a reasonable person in the suspect position would have understood his situation to be one of custody.axsom,at citation omitted.
to do this,we have developed a list of six common,but indicia to determine whether an individual is in custody 
whether the suspect was informed at the time of questioning that the questioning was voluntary,that the suspect was free to leave or request the officers to do so,or that the suspect was not considered under arrest whether the suspect possessed unrestrained freedom of movement during questioning whether the suspect initiated contact with authorities or voluntarily acquiesced to official requests to respond to questions whether strong arm tactics or deceptive stratagems were employed during questioning whether the atmosphere of the questioning was police dominated or,whether the suspect was placed under arrest at the termination of the questioning.
united states wallace,cir.in applying these indicia we employ a balancing test.axsom,at.the first three indicia are mitigating factors which,if present,mitigate against the existenc
