background 
beginning in november,pearl had a series of conversations via,internet chat,and telephone with camielle,a social worker in utah posing undercover as kami,a twelve year old girl.pearl lived in the washington,area at the time.pearl sent kami images of child pornography and attempted to arrange to have a sexual encounter with her from their first encounter over the internet.contacted detective brad franke of the logan city,utah,police department and told him that she had received child pornography over the internet from an individual who apparently also wanted to have a sexual relationship with a twelve year old girl.detective franke contacted agent don daufenbach of the customs service to aid in the investigation.
detective franke posed undercover as kami uncle dan and claimed to be a year old man attempting to molest kami.together with,franke arranged for pearl to visit salt lake city in may of.pearl was arrested upon arrival at the salt lake city airport on may.he was carrying with him computer disks containing child pornography.a search of his laptop computer also revealed files containing child pornography and records of his messages.
on june,pearl was indicted by a grand jury on three counts of transporting child pornography by computer counts,one count of transporting child pornography by airplane count,one count of possessing child pornography count,one count of coercion and enticement to engage in sexual conduct with a minor count,and one count of traveling to engage in sexual conduct with a minor count.following a jury trial,pearl was found guilty of counts through and was found not guilty of count.
discussion 
ashcroft free speech coalition 
the district court instructions to the jury on counts through contained both constitutional and unconstitutional definitions of child pornography.the court instructed the jury that child pornography is any visual depiction where the production of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct,or such visual depiction is,or appears to be,of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.supp.i,instruction.the is,or appears to be aspect of the definition of child pornography in b and relied upon by the district court in its instructions to the jury,see united states pearl,d,finding appears to be language in statute constitutional,was found to be overbroad and thereby unconstitutional by the supreme court.free speech coalition.at.because pearl began his challenge as to the sufficiency of the indictment and the jury here returned a general verdict and did not specify the grounds for conviction,we must vacate the convictions on counts through because one of the possible grounds for conviction is unconstitutional.see griffin united states,d w here a provision of the constitution forbids conviction on a particular ground,the constitutional guarantee is violated by a general verdict that may have rested on that ground.stromberg california.i f any of the clauses in question is invalid under the federal constitution,the conviction can not be upheld.the government concedes that pearl convictions on these counts must be vacated in light of the supreme court ruling in free speech coalition,though appending a footnote in a later brief asking this court to affirm the convictions outright.aplee.supp.br.at aplee d supp br.at.
we disagree with the dissent view that,because pearl failed to object to the jury instructions pursuant to,this court need only review for plain error and can affirm the convictions.first,this court has endorsed the view that the application of the plain error standard is inappropriate when the aggrieved party may object to the error at any time,as is the case with respect to challenges to an indictment under.b.united states,cir citations omitted.pearl moved to dismiss his indictment on the grounds that the cppa definition of child pornography was unconstitutionally overbroad,a view endorsed by the supreme court in free speech coalition.though the safer course would have been to pursue the argument as applied to the jury instructions,the district court had already issued a ruling squarely finding the cppa definition of child pornography ruling manifested in the erroneous jury instructions.the motion to dismiss the indictment plainly,then,preserved pearl right to challenge his convictions on appeal.see united states hathaway,cir holding that a defendant can not waive his right to challenge an indictment based upon its failure to charge an offense 
in the cases cited by the dissent in which convictions under the cppa were affirmed speech coalition,we do not know whether the defendants challenged the indictments,and,furthermore,the government offered expert testimony at trial to prove that the images depicted actual minors.united states hall,cir united states richardson,cir.our review of the images in this case on appeal,however much they might appear to be actual minors,should not serve as a substitute for the government burden of proving at trial the depiction of actual minors.similarly,the fact that pearl acknowledged at trial that the images depict ed minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct,rec.vol.xv at,does not require affirmation of his convictions because it is precisely the ambiguity in the word depict that led to the supreme court holding in free speech coalition.
our conclusion that pearl convictions on counts through must be reversed does not,however,preclude retrial of pearl on these counts,the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment notwithstanding.the government may retry a defendant whose convictions,as here,are set aside due to trial error without running afoul of the double jeopardy clause.see united states scott,d the successful appeal of a judgment of conviction,on any ground other than the insufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict,poses no bar to further prosecution on the same charge.citations omitted.where the government produces no evidence at trial,then double jeopardy bars retrial.see united states smith,cir.that is certainly not the case here there is sufficient evidence in this record to permit a jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the children in the pornographic images were actual minors.because the government can not be held responsible for failing to muster evidence sufficient to satisfy a standard actual minors which did not exist at the time of trial,and because this is trial error rather than pure insufficiency of evidence,pearl may be retried without violating double jeopardy.united states wacker,cir.
violations 
pearl claims that detective franke deleted messages and discarded a computer hard drive relevant to the case.in particular,pearl alleges that detective franke deleted messages from sent during the course of the investigation.according to detective franke,the hard drive on the computer on which the messages were stored malfunctioned,and he threw it in the garbage.because entrapment was part of his defense,pearl claims that the messages reveal the ongoing project between franke and whereby they hook fish on the internet,and promotes detective franke as jamasis in sex chat rooms.aplt.br.at.upon defendant motion for a new trial,the district court denied the motion on the grounds that the defendant was able to produce the messages from the sender computer and cross examine detective franke about the deleted messages.vi rec.doc.at.
we review the district court factual finding concluding that the government did not destroy potentially exculpatory evidence for clear error,see united states parker,cir,though where a new trial motion is based on an alleged brady violation,we review the district court ruling de novo.united states quintanilla,cir.the same de novo standard is applied to the district court determination whether the undisclosed evidence was material.united states hughes,cir.brady maryland,d governs exculpatory material that is still in the government possession,and california trombetta,d,and arizona youngblood,d,govern exculpatory evidence no longer in the government possession.see united states gomez,cir.
to establish a brady violation,a defendant must show that the prosecution suppressed evidence that the evidence was favorable to the accused and that the evidence was material.smith sec y of dep t of,cir internal quotation marks omitted.for police destruction of evidence to rise to the level of affecting a defendant due process rights under california trombetta,the evidence must both possess an exculpatory value that was apparent before the evidence was destroyed,and be of such a nature that the defendant would be unable to obtain comparable evidence by other reasonably available means,d.in addition,unlike a brady analysis,the defendant must show that the government acted in bad faith.youngblood,at.because this case presents an issue of the government destruction of evidence,we analyze pearl claim under the trombetta standard.
pearl utterly failed in his motion for a new trial to demonstrate that the messages were exculpatory and that the government acted in bad faith.all or virtually all of the deleted messages contained on the damaged and discarded hard drive were contained on another drive either pearl or computer,thereby failing to satisfy the unable to obtain comparable evidence by other reasonably available means aspect of trombetta analysis.furthermore,there was no evidence that the detective acted in bad faith.the loss of the messages and hard drive was,at worst,the product of negligence.parker,at mere negligence is not sufficient to establish bad faith.furthermore,defense counsel had an adequate opportunity to cross examine detective franke concerning the deleted messages and to raise the entrapment defense before the jury.
pearl also argues that the district court should have held an evidentiary hearing to determine whether loss of the messages constituted a due process violation.we review the decision of the district court on the propriety of an evidentiary hearing for an abuse of discretion.united states nichols,cir.the district court was under no obligation to hold an evidentiary hearing,see united states sutton,cir,and we find that the district court acted well within its discretion when it decided not to hold an evidentiary hearing and instead resolved defendant brady claim on the record.see lawrence lensing,cir.
sentencing issues 
pearl was given a increase to the guideline calculation pursuant to b.under that section of the guidelines,a defendant sentence can be increased i f the offense involved distribution.distribution,in turn,is defined as includ ing any act related to distribution for pecuniary gain,application note.application note to provides that t he term includes is not exhaustive.
because we are remanding counts through for retrial,we need not address the apparent circuit split over whether an increase may be imposed absent a pecuniary gain.compare united states laney,cir and united states black,cir pecuniary gain required with united states probel,cir united states lorge,cir united states hibbler,cir and united states canada,cir pecuniary gain not required in order to impose increase.
pearl initially contested the district court sentencing decision not to group counts and relating to possession and transportation of child pornography with counts and relating to enticement and traveling to engage in sexual activity with a minor.aplt.br.at.he then filed a motion to withdraw this argument,confirming this at oral argument.because the convictions on counts and will now be vacated and remanded for retrial,it would be premature to address this issue at this time.we thus deny the motion as moot.
in a pro se filing to this court,pearl seeks leave to raise a claim that the district court erred in responding to a question from the jury about the application of the entrapment instruction,and reasserts the argument made by his counsel regarding the alleged brady violation.as pearl is represented by counsel,we deny his motion to file an additional pro se supplemental brief which the court received but did not file.to the extent he seeks to raise claims of ineffective assistance of counsel,we note that i neffective assistance of counsel claims should be brought in collateral proceedings,not on direct appeal.such claims brought on direct appeal are presumptively dismissible,and virtually all will be dismissed.united states galloway,cir.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we vacate the convictions on counts through and remand the case to the district court for retrial of those counts.the convictions on counts and are affirmed.the motion to supplement the record with trial counsel letter requesting the government take into custody various computers of law enforcement personnel is granted.
i concur in the majority resolution of the issue and its affirmance of defendant thomas pearl convictions on counts and.i respectfully dissent,however,from the majority decision to vacate pearl convictions on counts through for transporting and possessing child pornography.
prior to,congress defined child pornography as images made using actual minors.ashcroft free speech coalition,d.in,congress enacted the child pornography prevention act cppa,et,and extend ed the federal prohibition against child pornography to include sexually explicit images that appear ed to depict minors but were produced without using any real children.id.at.more specifically,the cppa added two prohibited categories of speech b,which prohibited any visual depiction,including any photograph,film,video,picture,or computer or image or picture that wa s,or appear ed to be,of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct and d,which defined child pornography to include any sexually explicit image that was advertised,promoted,presented,described,or distributed in such a manner that convey ed the impression it depicted a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.
these additional categories of prohibited speech were in place at the time pearl committed the acts in question and was charged in this case.thus,counts through of the indictment,which charged pearl with transporting and possessing child pornography in violation of a and a b implicitly incorporated these additional categories of prohibited speech.after he was indicted,pearl moved to dismiss counts through of the indictment on the grounds that the two categories of prohibited speech added by the cppa,b and d,were overbroad,vague,and unconstitutional.in support of his motion,pearl asserted that n o evidence ha d yet been adduced on the record as to whether the alleged images we re images of actual minors or whether the alleged images we re computer morphed images,computer composite images that may contain body parts from various individuals which are combined or morphed into an image that is not real.roa,vol.i,doc.at.the district court denied pearl motion.
at no time thereafter did pearl question whether the images at issue showed actual children engaged in explicit sexual activity.indeed,prior to trial,pearl stipulated that he knew the images at issue were child pornography and that minors appear ed in the images.roa,vol.iv,d
