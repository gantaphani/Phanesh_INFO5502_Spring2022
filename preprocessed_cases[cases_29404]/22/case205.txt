during bonnie van alstyne employment with electronic scriptorium limited esl,esl president,edward leonard,began accessing her personal email account.van alstyne discovered leonard actions,which continued for more than a year after van alstyne left esl,while litigating an unrelated matter with esl in virginia state court.thereafter,van alstyne brought suit under the stored communications act,a west sca,alleging that leonard and esl illegally accessed her personal email account.following trial,a jury awarded van alstyne in statutory damages and in punitive damages against leonard.the jury awarded an additional in statutory damages and in punitive damages against esl.the district court also awarded van alstyne in attorney fees and costs.
on appeal,esl and leonard contend that the district court erred in permitting the jury to award statutory damages of per violation of the sca punitive damages and attorney fees,without first finding that van alstyne suffered actual damages.we agree with esl and leonard in part,concluding that plaintiffs pursuing claims under the sca must prove actual damages in order to be eligible for an award of statutory damages.we disagree,however,that this requirement holds for punitive damages or attorney fees.accordingly,we vacate the awards in favor of van alstyne and remand for further proceedings.
esl is a small company owned and operated by leonard and his wife,brett,in leesburg,virginia.esl hired van alstyne,a friend of the leonards,in january to serve as vice president of marketing.esl assigned van alstyne a company email account,but she also used her private email account with america aol to conduct business from time to time.
according to van alstyne,in october,leonard sexually propositioned her,but she declined his advances.shortly thereafter,in december,van alstyne and esl agreed that van alstyne would be recategorized as an independent contractor with the company.in march,esl unilaterally terminated van alstyne.
van alstyne thereafter pursued several claims for relief against esl a sexual harassment charge with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc a claim for unemployment benefits with the virginia employment commission vec and a claim for unpaid commissions in virginia state court.van alstyne eeoc claim was dismissed for want of jurisdiction because esl employed fewer than fifteen individuals,and she eventually nonsuited her claim for unpaid commissions.van alstyne did,however,prevail on her claim with the vec.
meanwhile,esl instituted an action against van alstyne in virginia state court,alleging several business torts against her it was in the midst of discovery in that suit that the seeds for the instant action were sown.during a deposition in february,esl counsel used several emails from van alstyne as exhibits.van alstyne believed that these exhibits were actually taken from her aol account and not her company account.with her suspicions aroused,van alstyne began pursuing the possibility that leonard and esl had broken into that private account.sure enough,during a june deposition,leonard admitted that he accessed van alstyne aol account after she left the company.he further testified that the emails produced during the deposition represented the only occasions on which he had accessed her account 
no doubt disturbed by leonard behavior,van alstyne promptly instituted an action against leonard in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia,alleging that leonard actions violated the of the electronic communications privacy act ecpa,et west and the virginia computer crimes act,ann,et.van alstyne requested compensatory and punitive damages under the sca,contending that leonard actions caused her actual damages,or,in the alternative,that she was entitled to an award of the statutory minimum damage figure provided for by the sca.at.van alstyne claim for actual damages encompassed a claim for attorney fees and costs in defending the esl suit and a claim for damages for mental anguish and emotional distress arising from defending the esl suit.
before leonard responded,van alstyne filed an amended complaint adding esl as an additional defendant.van alstyne filed a second amended complaint in march,removing her claims of mental anguish and emotional distress in order to maintain a modicum of privacy and avoid further invasion of it through discovery.at.after leonard and esl filed a motion to compel evidence of van alstyne actual damages,van alstyne amended her complaint for a third time.the third amended complaint withdrew the claims under the virginia computer crimes act against both leonard and esl and also withdr e w any claim for damages premised upon the costs she incurred in defending the esl suit.at.van alstyne claim for relief was thus limited to punitive damages and statutory minimum damage s under the sca.at.
leonard and esl moved for summary judgment,relying principally on the supreme court opinion in doe chao,d,for the proposition that the sca did not provide for statutory damages absent a showing that the plaintiff suffered actual damages.see doe,at.holding that,under the privacy act,minimum statutory damages award was available only to plaintiffs who suffered some actual damages.
on june,the district court denied the motion for summary judgment,and the case continued to a jury trial.on june,the jury returned a verdict in favor of van alstyne against leonard in the amount of in compensatory damages and in punitive damages and against esl in the amount of in compensatory damages and in punitive damages.the compensatory damages award represented a statutory damages award of for each violation of the sca.esl and leonard filed a motion for a new trial and judgment as a matter of law,which the district court denied.on august,the district court entered its final judgment,which also awarded van alstyne in attorney fees and in costs against leonard and esl,jointly and severally.leonard and esl noted a timely appeal.
on appeal,leonard and esl contend that the district court erred in permitting the jury to award van alstyne statutory damages,punitive damages,and attorney fees and costs without first requiring her to prove actual damages under the sca we review these issues de novo.henson liggett group,cir.when interpreting statutes we start with the plain language.dep t of labor growers ass n,cir.it is well established that when the statute language is plain,the sole function of the least where the disposition required by the text is not to enforce it according to its terms.lamie,d internal quotation marks omitted.in interpreting the plain language of a statute,we give the terms their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning,absent an indication congress intended it to bear some different import.north carolina.valley,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we follow the cardinal rule that statutory language must be read in context because a phrase gathers meaning from the words around it.dynamics land,cline,d internal quotation marks omitted.

the court may assess as damages in a civil action under this section the sum of the actual damages suffered by the plaintiff and any profits made by the violator as a result of the violation,but in no case shall a person entitled to recover receive less than the sum of.if the violation is willful or intentional,the court may assess punitive damages.in the case of a successful action to enforce liability under this section,the court may assess the costs of the action,together with reasonable attorney fees determined by the court.
in doe,the supreme court reviewed the privacy act,which provided that in cases in which the united states had willfully or intentionally violated the act,it would be liable for actual damages sustained by the individual as a result of the refusal or failure,but in no case shall a person entitled to recovery receive less than the sum of.g a.interpreting this language,the court concluded that by using the phrase actual damages sustained,congress made specific provision for what a victim within the limited class may recover.at.and,the simplest reading of the clause a person entitled to recovery,looks back to the immediately preceding provision for recovering actual damages.id.a contrary view,the court continued,simply pays no attention to the fact that the statute does not speak of liability and consequent entitlement to recovery in a freestanding,unqualified way,but in a limited way,by reference to enumerated damages.id.at.accordingly,the doe court concluded that statutory damages were available only to plaintiffs who first proved that they suffered actual damages.id.at.the doe court reached this result using a straightforward textual analysis.id.at.
like the privacy act,the sca limits an award of damages to the actual damages suffered,as well as any profits,thus ma king specific provision for what a victim may recover.id.furthermore,the sca and privacy act contain the substantively identical following phrase but in no case shall a person entitled to recover receive less than the sum of,which looks back to the immediately preceding provision for recovering actual damages.id.indeed,the only differences between the damages provisions in the two statutes is the sca use of the term suffered instead of sustained and its use of the phrase and any profits made by the violator.neither difference,it seems to us,has any material impact.thus,we are left to interpret statutory language in all important respects identical to that already interpreted by the supreme court.our answer,it appears,should be obvious just as the privacy act required proof of actual damages as a prerequisite to recovering statutory damages,so does the sca.
buttressing this conclusion is the fact that congress,if it wished the result that van alstyne presses for,could have written a simpler,unambiguous statute.as we explained in interpreting the privacy act 
for instance,section and subsection a could have been phrased in the following,or similar,terms the united states shall be liable to the individual in an amount equal to the sum of a whichever is greater actual damages sustained by the individual as a result of the refusal or failure,or.

congress has followed such a course in several enactments.the wiretap act,which like the sca is found within the ecpa,provides 
in any other action under this section,the court may assess as damages whichever is the greater of the sum of the actual damages suffered by the plaintiff and any profits made by the violator or statutory damages of whichever is the greater of a day for each day of violation or.

in sum,the supreme court has already interpreted language that is substantively identical to c to require proof of actual damages as a prerequisite to recovering statutory damages,and congress has shown the ability to enact statutes that clearly award statutory damages absent proof of actual damages.accordingly,we hold that the plain language of c unambiguously requires proof of actual damages as a prerequisite to recovery of statutory damages.
van alstyne makes several arguments in response,none of which we believe are.first,van alstyne contends that the structure and legislative history of the sca dictate a different result,a conclusion reached by the district courts to have considered the issue.see in re hawaiian airlines,concluding that the supreme court interpretation of the privacy act in doe chao does not apply to the similar statutory language found in the stored communications act freedman town of fairfield,pcd,dist.lexis,at,wl,at,allowing recovery of statutory damages and explaining that if doe cited section c as authority for congress intention as to damages recoverable under the earlier enacted privacy act,it would have said so as dicta,instead of rejecting its history as not determinative cedar hill assocs.paget,c,dist.lexis,at,wl,at,noting the language in the privacy act and sca were admittedly very similar,but nonetheless concluding that the legislative history dictated finding that statutory damages could be awarded without proof of actual damages under the sca.
to that end,van alstyne refers back to a,which provides that any person aggrieved may recover from the violator.according to van alstyne,this provision means that,in order to be a person entitled to recover under c,a plaintiff need only be a person aggrieved,not a person who suffered actual damages.a closer look,however,renders this argument unpersuasive.the phrase van alstyne refers to provides that an aggrieved person may recover such relief as may be appropriate.a.subsection b then defines appropriate relief to include preliminary and other equitable or declaratory relief and attorney fees and costs.b.it also provides that appropriate relief may include damages under subsection c.b.thus,a person aggrieved is not automatically a person entitled to recover as defined by subsection c.instead,a person aggrieved may recover appropriate relief,which encompasses damages as defined and limited by subsection c.the reference to a person entitled to recover in c is best read,just as in doe,to refer back to the beginning of that sentence,that is,a person who suffered actual damages.that conclusion can not be avoided by the circular logic van alstyne proposes.
van alstyne next points us to legislative history,specifically,the senate report that accompanied the passage of the sca.of course,when statutory language is plain and we believe that the language of the sca is no need for recourse to legislative history.moreover,the legislative history van alstyne relies on,which consists of a single sentence in the senate report from,is not as helpful as van alstyne suggests and does not provide clearly expressed legislative intention in conflict with our result.consumer product safety comm gte sylvania,d.the senate report provides,in discussing c,that damages under the section includ e the sum of actual damages suffered by the plaintiff and any profits made by the violator as the result of the violation as provided in c with minimum statutory damages of,at.the mere mention of statutory damages in the legislative history hardly works to conclusively establish that a plaintiff is entitled to minimum statutory damages absent any proof of actual damages.the same senate report also addresses amendments to the ecpa,specifically the remedies provision of the wiretap act.in describing those amendments,the report explains,
proposed subsection c provides a method for the computation of damages.the general rule is set out in paragraph of subsection c.the court may assess damages consisting of whichever is the greater of a the sum of the plaintiff actual damages and any profits the violator made as a result of the violation or b statutory damages of whichever is the greater of a day or.
id.at emphasis added.
unlike the single sentence van alstyne relies upon,this portion of the senate report clearly specifies that a court may award,in actions under the wiretap act,actual damages or statutory damages.such clear authorization is missing from the sentence quoted above addressing the sca.
van alstyne next suggests that an examination of the common law roots of the sca and the privacy act must lead us to a contrary conclusion.in doe,after concluding that the statutory text of the privacy act did not support the plaintiff position,the court further noted that the plainti
