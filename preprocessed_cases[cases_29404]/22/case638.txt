in this case john doe,a registered sex offender living in the state of utah,appeals the district court decision to allow enforcement of a utah statute requiring all sex offenders living in utah to register their internet identifiers and the corresponding websites with the state.we now uphold that decision based on our conclusion that the statute does not violate the first or fourth amendments or the facto clause of the united states constitution,made applicable to utah through the fourteenth amendment.
background 
appellant,proceeding anonymously as john doe,was convicted by the united states military court system of sex offenses involving a minor and sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment.after serving thirteen months of this sentence,doe was released without being placed on probation or supervised release.however,as a resident of utah and a convicted sex offender,doe was still required to register with the utah department of corrections,pursuant to utah code ann.west.among its many provisions,this registry law required doe to provide all internet and the addresses he uses for routing or in internet communications or postings.id.i the statute also required that doe provide all online identifiers and passwords used to access websites where he was using an online identifier,with the exception of identifiers used for employment or financial accounts.id.j.
believing that these requirements violated his first and fourth amendment rights as well as the ex post facto clause of the united states constitution,doe refused to provide the requested information and brought a lawsuit challenging the law.upon doe motion for summary judgment,the district court invalidated the statute based on its conclusion that the statute,which provided no restrictions on how the state c ould use or disseminate registrants internet information,improperly infringed on doe first amendment right to anonymous speech.appellant app.at.shortly after this ruling,the utah legislature amended the statute.first,the legislature removed any requirement that offenders disclose their passwords,and second,it placed some limits on how a state official can use identifiers provided by an offender.specifically,the statute provides that 
the state,to assist in investigating kidnapping and crimes,and in apprehending offenders,shall 
a develop and operate a system to collect,analyze,maintain,and disseminate information on offenders and sex and kidnap offenses 
b make information listed in subsection available to the public and 
c share information provided by an offender under this section that may not be made available to the public under subsection,but only 
i for the purposes under this subsection or 
ii in accordance with the government records 
access and management act.
utah code ann.west supp.additionally,the legislature amended utah government records access and management act,or grama,to designate certain information provided by an offender,including internet identifiers,as private see utah code ann.m west supp.
following these amendments,the state filed a motion for the district court to vacate its earlier order pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.after considering the briefs,the district court granted the motion,holding that the new restrictions diminished the chilling effect on doe speech so that his first amendment right to anonymous speech was no longer significantly threatened.appellant app.at.the court then concluded that the statute did not violate the fourth amendment because doe had failed to show he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his internet identifiers,which are communicated to a third party.finally,the court held,relying on our earlier decision in femedeer haun,cir,that the registry statute did not violate the ex post facto clause.doe now appeals each of these rulings.
discussion 
we generally review a decision to grant a rule b motion for an abuse of discretion.see stubblefield windsor capital,cir.nevertheless,we review the district court decision de novo where,as here,the district court granted relief as a matter of law.see lyons jefferson bank trust,cir a district court would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its rulings on an erroneous view of the law.
doe claim under the first amendment 
we first consider doe contention that utah registration statute violates his first amendment right to engage in anonymous speech.that the first amendment guarantees a right to anonymous speech is beyond question.as the supreme court explained in mcintyre ohio elections commission,anonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority.it thus exemplifies the purpose behind the bill of rights,and of the first amendment in particular to protect unpopular individuals from their ideas from the hand of an intolerant society,citation omitted.that the right to engage in anonymous speech should extend fully to communications made through the medium of the internet is equally clear.see reno aclu,explaining that the internet allows any person with a phone line to become a town crier with a voice that resonates farther than it could from any soapbox and that our cases provide no basis for qualifying the level of first amendment scrutiny that should be applied to this medium.in spite of these protections,however,a state may permissibly infringe upon this right when its interest is important enough and the law is appropriately tailored to meet the stated interest.see am.constitutional law,meyer,cir.
according to doe,we should view utah statute as a restriction,subject to the strictest of scrutiny,because it has the effect of taking away doe right to choose whether to speak anonymously or under a pseudonym.appellant br.at.we are not persuaded.the principal inquiry in determining content neutrality is whether the government has adopted a regulation of speech because of disagreement with the message it conveys.am.target,giani,cir internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted.
as a general rule,laws that by their terms distinguish favored speech from disfavored speech on the basis of ideas or views expressed are content based.by contrast,laws that confer benefits or impose burdens on speech without reference to the ideas or views expressed are in most instances content neutral.
turner broad,fcc,citation omitted.simply because an otherwise law has an incidental effect on some speakers or messages does not change its classification so long as it serves purposes unrelated to the content of expression.golan holder,cir.on its face,section is a regulation.the law says nothing about the ideas or opinions that doe may or may not express,anonymously or otherwise.neither is it aimed at supress ing the expression of unpopular views,am.target,at,but rather it is directed towards aiding the police in solving crimes.we will therefore examine the state law as a regulation.
as a regulation,utah reporting law is subject to intermediate scrutiny,meaning that the law will be upheld if the act serves a substantial government interest and is narrowly drawn to serve that interest without unnecessarily interfering with first amendment freedoms.id.quoting vill.of schaumburg citizens for a better env t.both sides have agreed that utah has a compelling interest in protecting the public from kidnapping and crimes,and we conclude that the reporting statute serves that interest.thus,our consideration of this statute must focus on whether it unnecessarily interferes with doe first amendment freedoms.in reviewing state statutes challenged on first amendment grounds,we will uphold a law if it is readily susceptible to a narrowing construction that would make it constitutional.aclu johnson,cir.nevertheless,t he key to application of this principle is that the statute must be readily susceptible to the limitation we will not rewrite a state law to conform it to constitutional requirements.id.
doe argues that the statute is unconstitutional because the required disclosure of internet identifiers to state officials,as well as the possibility of disclosure of those identifiers to the public,chills his speech turning first to the possibility of disclosure to the public,doe focuses on
