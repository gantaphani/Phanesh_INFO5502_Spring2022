we are asked here to review cross appeals from two interlocutory orders in an antitrust action by novell,novell against microsoft.novell seeks treble damages under of the clayton act,for injuries allegedly suffered as a result of microsoft anticompetitive conduct in violation of and of the sherman act.in its suit filed in the district of utah and transferred by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation to the district of maryland,novell made six specific claims for damages to software applications it owned between and.two of the six claims allege that microsoft conduct injured competition in the market for pc operating systems,a market in which novell products did not directly compete.the district court declined to dismiss these claims over microsoft objection that novell,as neither a consumer nor a competitor in the relevant market,lacks antitrust standing to bring them.microsoft appeals the denial of this motion to dismiss.
the remaining four claims allege harm to competition in the market,in which novell did compete.the district court dismissed these claims as untimely,and novell appeals.
for the reasons that follow,we affirm both rulings.
novell is a software company that owned wordperfect,a application and quattro pro,a spreadsheet application from until wordperfect and quattro pro are applications,which novell marketed together as an package called perfectoffice.microsoft is a software company that owns windows,a pc operating system,as well as applications of its own an operating system is software that controls the computer resources,including memory,disk space,keyboards,and the central processing unit.an operating system also facilitates communication between the computer resources and software applications,including and spreadsheet applications.united states microsoft microsoft ii,en banc united states microsoft microsoft i,d.therefore,computer users need an operating system to serve as a platform for the applications they wish to run microsoft ii,at.at one time,pcs were used primarily for,and even today,applications remain among the most widely used types of applications available for pcs.
although microsoft overwhelmingly dominates the pc market other operating systems exist because these operating systems work differently from each other,software developers must create separate versions of their applications for each operating system in order for the applications to function properly on it.modifying an application written for one operating system so that it can run on another is and costly.because of this,a new or less popular operating system faces significant obstacles to gaining market share.as the circuit has explained,
the applications barrier to entry stems from two characteristics of the software market most consumers prefer operating systems for which a large number of applications have already been written and most developers prefer to write for operating systems that already have a substantial consumer base.this situation ensures that applications will continue to be written for the already dominant windows,which in turn ensures that consumers will continue to prefer it over other operating systems.
microsoft ii,at internal citations omitted.
in microsoft ii,the united states government and the governments of several states challenged activities by microsoft that allegedly harmed competition in the pc market the united states department of justice filed a complaint against microsoft on may,the doj complaint.the doj complaint is based on allegations of anticompetitive conduct in violation of and of the sherman act,by microsoft in two product markets the market for pc operating systems and the market for internet browsers.doj compl.in a per curiam opinion,the circuit,sitting en banc,found that microsoft was not liable for attempted monopolization of the market for internet browsers because the government had failed to carry its burden in two ways it failed to define the relevant market and it failed to demonstrate that such a market could be monopolized,that a hypothetical monopolist in that market could enjoy market power because substantial barriers to entry protect it.microsoft ii,at.nevertheless,the court affirmed liability with respect to the claim that microsoft unlawfully maintained a monopoly in the pc market.id.at.
the government litigation in microsoft ii forms the basis of microsoft challenge to two of novell claims,as discussed below.
novell pursues six claims on appeal.four of these,styled counts ii,iii,iv,and v,allege monopolization or attempted monopolization of the markets for applications.novell products,word perfect and quattro pro,directly competed in such markets.the other two claims,counts i and vi,are based on the same alleged conduct as counts ii through v and seek recovery for damage to the same novell products,but are predicated on the theory that microsoft conduct injured competition in the market for pc operating systems,a market in which novell did not directly compete 
all six of novell claims arose prior to march,when novell sold wordperfect and quattro pro to corel corporation.the statute of limitations for federal antitrust claims is four years.see.therefore,all of novell claims asserted in its november complaint are unless the statute of limitations is tolled by the filing of the doj complaint in may.see i.section i of the clayton act provides that government proceedings toll the statute of limitations for private antitrust actions based in whole or in part on any matter complained of by the government.id.
novell counts i and vi are indeed based on microsoft anticompetitive conduct in the pc market,which was at issue in the doj complaint.novell four other counts,however,allege microsoft monopolization or attempted monopolization of the markets for applications,which conduct was not specifically alleged in the doj complaint.
microsoft moved to dismiss all six counts in the complaint.because counts ii through v allege injury that is not specifically alleged in the doj complaint,microsoft argued these claims were not tolled by the doj complaint and thus were.microsoft sought dismissal of novell claims of injury to competition in the pc market the same market at issue in the doj complaint in counts i and vi on different grounds.microsoft contended that novell did not have antitrust standing to raise such claims and also that novell did not own these claims.
the district court agreed with microsoft regarding counts ii through v and dismissed those claims as untimely.however,the district court rejected microsoft arguments regarding antitrust standing and ownership of the claims and declined to dismiss counts i and vi.
the district court certified its and ownership rulings on counts i and vi pursuant to b and microsoft petitioned this court for leave to appeal.we granted the petition with respect to the issue only.thereafter,novell the dismissal of counts ii through v.we address,in turn,the issues of whether novell has antitrust standing to bring counts i and vi and the timeliness of novell claims in counts ii through 
we review de novo the district court rulings on a motion to dismiss under rule b.see holly scott,cir.in assessing rulings on dismissals under rule b,we accept the allegations of the plaintiff complaint as true.advanced,radford cmty,cir.
we first review the district court ruling that novell has antitrust standing to bring counts i and vi.
novell concedes that its products did not directly compete in the market for pc operating systems.nevertheless,novell contends that the technological connection between operating systems and applications gives rise to a significant barrier to entry into the market and thus protects microsoft windows monopoly.novell maintains that its applications could perform well on a variety of operating systems and that,during the relevant time period,they were the dominant applications in the market the thrust of novell argument is that its popular applications,though themselves not competitors or potential competitors to microsoft windows,offered competing operating systems the prospect of surmounting the applications barrier to entry and breaking the windows monopoly that is,novell argues its products could provide a path onto the playing field for an actual competitor of windows,because a competing operating system,running the popular novell software applications,would offer consumers an attractive alternative to windows.
novell relies on certain unique characteristics of technological markets in making this argument.courts have recognized that such markets are characterized by network effects,and thus behave somewhat differently from more traditional markets.microsoft ii,at.because the utility that a user derives from consumption of the good increases with the number of other agents consuming the good,one product tends towards dominance.id.quoting michael katz carl shapiro,network externalities,competition,and compatibility,am.econ.in this way,then,competition is for the field rather than within the field.id.quoting harold demsetz,why regulate utilities,econ,emphasis omitted.put another way,firms compete to dominate the market,and once dominance is achieved,threats come largely from outside the dominated market,because the degree of dominance of such a market tends to become so extreme.indeed,in microsoft ii,microsoft did not dispute the finding that windows controlled more than of the market.id.at.
building on this same theory,the government in microsoft ii argued that microsoft preserved its advantage in the pc market by targeting certain middleware products,specifically sun java programming environment and netscape navigator web browser at.java and navigator were defined by the district court as outside of the pc market,a finding affirmed by the circuit.see id.at.notwithstanding the fact that the primary threats at issue in the government action stood outside of the pc market,microsoft was found to have unlawfully monopolized that market.id.at.
novell present claims echo the government theory in microsoft ii.just as the middleware threat posed by java and navigator came from outside the microsoft dominated pc market,novell now argues that its products,though also outside the relevant market,similarly threatened microsoft windows.
novell alleges three specific unlawful actions on the part of that harmed its products and also harmed competition in the pc market.first,novell claims microsoft withheld from novell key technical information necessary to make applications for windows,an updated version of windows launched by microsoft during the period that novell owned wordperfect and quattro pro.because pc users would,upon the launch of windows,upgrade their applications en masse,novell applications would lose critical market share if novell did not have viable windows versions ready at the time of the launch.because of the network effects that favor already popular applications,novell applications loss of market share could in turn lead to a decrease in demand for the competing operating systems that support these applications.thus,wordperfect and quattro pro loss of market share would reduce the potential for novell products to enable an alternative operating system to surmount the applications barrier to entry and compete with windows.
second,novell argues that microsoft impeded novell access to distribution channels,including original equipment manufacturers oems.oems manufacture pcs and typically preinstall an operating system and certain commonly used applications.because windows monopoly in the market means most consumers want to buy pcs,oems desire windows licenses that enable them to install windows on pcs.novell asserts that oems dependence on windows licenses furnished microsoft with leverage that it used to impose restrictive and exclusionary agreements on oems.these agreements rewarded,or required as a condition of obtaining a windows license,the preinstallation of microsoft suite,and prohibited or punished the installation of competing applications.as with microsoft alleged conduct regarding windows described above,this action would have the effect of decreasing novell market share and its products popularity,hampering novell ability to make an alternative operating system attractive to pc users.
finally,because windows is the dominant operating system serving as a platform for software applications,software makers seek to have their products certified as.such certification is a signal to software consumers that a product is compatible with the most popular operating system.novell claims that microsoft required it,as a condition of being certified as,to use technologies that degraded the performance of novell applications on other operating systems.this requirement neutralized novell applications purported advantage of working well on a variety of operating systems.novell claims that such an advantage,along with novell applications popularity,could have enabled other operating systems to bridge the moat that protected microsoft windows monopoly 
we now turn to the legal underpinnings of antitrust standing.in a private antitrust action,a plaintiff must go beyond a showing that it meets the article iii standing requirements of injury,causation,and redressability it must also demonstrate antitrust standing.section of the clayton act,provides 
a ny person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained,and the cost of suit,including a reasonable attorney fee.
although a literal reading of is broad enough to encompass every harm that can be attributed directly or indirectly to the consequences of an antitrust violation,the supreme court has interpreted the provision more restrictively.see contractors of,cal.state council of carpenters agc,d.congress did not intend the antitrust laws to provide a remedy in damages for all injuries that might conceivably be traced to an antitrust violation.hawaii standard oil,d.an antitrust violation may be expected to cause ripples of harm to flow through the nation economy but despite the broad wording of there is a point beyond which the wrongdoer should not be held liable.agc,at.internal quotation omitted.
a plaintiff sufficiently connected to the violation propagating these ripples of harm is said to have antitrust standing.id.at.the supreme court has held that a analysis is required to determine whether a private plaintiff has antitrust standing.see id.at.these factors circumscribe and guide courts judgments on whether plaintiffs have antitrust standing.id.at.the courts of appeals have since relied on the agc factors to determine antitrust standing.see assocs.mars,cir reazin blue cross blue shield of,cir crimpers promotions,home box office,cir.this court recently had the occasion to apply the agc factors,distilling them to five 
the causal connection between an antitrust violation and harm to the plaintiffs,and whether that harm was intended whether the harm was of a type that congress sought to redress in providing a private remedy for violations of the antitrust laws the directness of the alleged injury the existence of more direct victims of the alleged antitrust injury and problems of identifying damages and apportioning them among those directly and indirectly harmed.
kloth microsoft,cir internal quotations and citations omitted 
the first two of these factors together encompass the concept of antitrust injury.see cargill,monfort of,d brunswick pueblo,d.antitrust injury has been defined as injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to and that flows from that which makes the defendants acts unlawful.brunswick,at.the other three agc factors focus on the directness or remoteness of the plaintiff alleged injury.
before applying the agc factors to the facts of this case,however,we must first consider microsoft argument that novell claims fail as a threshold matter.microsoft asks us to adopt a rule that only consumers or competitors in the relevant market have antitrust standing to bring private claims under.were we to adopt this proffered rule,microsoft argues,we would be compelled to find,before reaching the analysis,that novell does not have standing in this case because its products did not directly compete in the market.
we must decline to adopt microsoft rule.we note that the supreme court has rejected the utility of the very type of approach on which microsoft seeks to rely the infinite variety of claims that may arise make it virtually impossible to announce a rule that will dictate the result in every case.agc,at.in fact,a careful examination of the cases on which microsoft relies for support of its proposed rule reveals that in most instances the claims were defeated by the absence of an antitrust injury,rather than the plaintiff s failure to demonstrate consumer or competitor status 
for example,in agc,the claimed that the association and its members violated the laws by coercing third parties and some of the association members into doing business with nonunion firms.id.at.in denying standing to the union,the supreme court noted that the plaintiff was neither a consumer nor a competitor in the market in which trade was restrained.id.at.but the court went on to discuss other factors,and ultimately concluded that the injury did not flow from a breakdown in competition.indeed,it was not clear whether the union interests would be served or disserved by enhanced competition in the market for contractors services.id.the court cited brunswick for the proposition that unions will be unlikely to have antitrust standing,especially in disputes with employers with whom they bargain,because in those instances the unions injuries will most likely not be of the type the antitrust statute was intended to forestall.id.at.
significantly,had the supreme court in agc intended that status be a necessary prerequisite for standing,it need not,after noting that the plaintiff was neither,have then discussed the other relevant factors and instructed lower courts to do the same.id.at.c ourts should analyze each situation in light of these factors.that a plaintiff status as a consumer or a competitor in the restrained market is relevant to the issue of antitrust standing is clear the cases upon which microsoft relies do not compel the conclusion that it is necessary.
microsoft nevertheless insists that our own precedents rely on its proposed rule see thompson everett,cable,cir white rockingham radiologists,cir.careful consideration of those cases,however,reveals that they do not provide direct support for the position microsoft advances.indeed,the cases are not decisions on the merits at all but rather arise in the context of plaintiffs appeals from grants of summary judgment in favor of defendants.because of the relevant differences in procedural posture between these two cases and the case at bar,neither thompson everett nor white is supportive of microsoft position at this stage of the litigation.
microsoft correctly notes that we found the plaintiff in thompson everett to be neither a consumer nor a competitor at.the decision to affirm summary judgment in favor of the defendants,however,was not based on this finding alone.rather,we focused in thompson everett on the patent lack of any antitrust injury proven by the plaintiff at the stage.id.plaintiff is not being denied access to the cable company sales service market by any act in violation of the antitrust laws.the plaintiff in thompson everett was a firm that sought to place advertising on cable television and other media for clients.id.at.defendants were traditional cable representatives,retained by companies to sell air time.id.thompson everett complained that the traditional cable representatives engaged in a horizontal conspiracy with one another and a vertical conspiracy with the cable companies to use their exclusive contracts to exclude independent firms,like the plaintiff,from competition.id.at.however,at summary judgment,the district court found no evidence to support the plaintiff claim of a horizontal conspiracy or that the exclusive agreements between the cable companies and traditional cable representatives had an anticompetitive effect.id.at.thus,thompson everett could not recover under the antitrust laws because it failed to show it had suffered antitrust injury,not because it was neither a consumer nor a competitor.
similarly,white involved a appeal from the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of a.the plaintiff alleged that the hospital had violated antitrust laws in designating a certain radiology practice as its preferred interpreter of ct scans.white,at.as in thompson everett,we noted that the plaintiff was neither a provider nor consumer of hospital services.id.at.but we affirmed summary judgment for other reasons,among them that the was not a competitor in the market for interpreting ct scans and therefore could not be held liable as a monopolist in that market.id.at.additionally,we found a lack of antitrust injury because there was no evidence of a conspiracy between the hospital and the preferred radiology practice.id.at.
we find additional support for our understanding that the agc factors are not confined by a rule in a supreme court case decided one term earlier.see blue shield mccready,d.in mccready,the plaintiff challenged her group health plan refusal to reimburse subscribers for psychologists services while reimbursing comparable treatment by psychiatrists.the supreme court affirmed that the plaintiff did have standing under of the clayton act.id.at.although the plaintiff was a consumer in the relevant market,the supreme court focused not on this status,but rather on the directness of the plaintiff injury and the fact that her loss was of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent.id.at.the supreme court stated denying reimbursement to subscribers for the cost of treatment was the very means by which it is alleged that blue shield sought to achieve its illegal ends.id.at.additionally,the plaintiff the unreimbursed cost of her psychologist inextricably intertwined with the injury the conspirators sought to inflict on psychologists and the psychotherapy market.id.at.
notably,the court in a footnote specifically contemplates a party other than a consumer or competitor having antitrust standing if a group of psychiatrists conspired to boycott a bank until the bank ceased making loans to psychologists,the bank would no doubt be able to recover the injuries suffered as a consequence of the psychiatrists actions.id.at.even if this footnote is read as dicta,it provides further evidence that the supreme court does not limit the universe of proper plaintiffs under as narrowly as would microsoft.the court decision not to adopt a rule the next year in agc bolsters this conclusion.see at.
finally,the government may antitrust suit against microsoft detailed microsoft anticompetitive activities in the market that harmed middleware products,sun java programming environment and netscape navigator web browser,defined by the circuit as outside of the market.microsoft ii,at.although standing was not at issue,an implication of the government action is that sun or consumers nor competitors in the pc have had standing to sue microsoft privately under,and microsoft concedes as much 
having rejected microsoft argument that a rule strips novell of antitrust standing,we now consider whether the five agc factors,as formulated in our decision in kloth,compel dismissal of novell claims on grounds.the first two factors the causal connection between an antitrust violation and harm to the plaintiffs,and whether that harm was intended and whether the harm was of a type that congress sought to redress in providing a private remedy for violations of the antitrust laws are closely related.see kloth,at citations and internal quotations omitted.they ensure that the plaintiff claims the proper type of injury to be accorded antitrust standing.see agc,at.e ach plaintiff alleged injury must be analyzed to determine whether it is of the type that the antitrust statute was intended to forestall.the other factors,which involve examination of the directness or remoteness of the plaintiff injury and the ease or difficulty of apportioning damages,may further constrict the number of private plaintiffs eligible to bring a action under the federal antitrust laws 
we begin by reviewing the first two agc factors.for ease of analysis,we reverse their order and examine first whether novell has alleged an injury that the antitrust laws were intended to prevent,and then the causal connection between microsoft conduct and novell injuries.it is helpful in this regard to briefly revisit the purposes of antitrust laws.
antitrust laws are the magna carta of free enterprise.united states topco,d.as the supreme court clarified in brunswick,they were enacted for the protection of competition not competitors.at.internal quotation omitted.thus,the sherman act does not protect competitors from being destroyed through competition on the contrary,such destruction can signal healthy functioning of the system.see id.the sherman act was enacted to protect the freedom to compete by curtailing the destruction of competition through anticompetitive practices.for example,a firm violates of the sherman act when it acquires or maintains,or attempts to acquire or maintain,a monopoly by engaging in exclusionary conduct as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of superior product,business acumen,or historic accident.microsoft ii,at quoting united states grinnell,d.
taking novell allegations as true,as we must,the injury that novell alleges here is plainly an injury to competition that the laws were intended to forestall.microsoft activities,novell claims,were intended to and did restrain competition in the pc market by keeping the barriers to entry into that market high thus,we conclude that novell has alleged harm of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent.
we now turn to the second facet of antitrust injury the causal connection between novell injuries and microsoft alleged antitrust violations.novell claims that its market share in the market was eroded as a result of microsoft activity,which was designed to and effectively did elevate the barriers to entry into the pc market.as chronicled earlier in this opinion,novell complains that microsoft withheld key technical information from its software designers,disadvantaging novell in preparing for the launch of the windows operating system that microsoft exploited its monopoly power to require or encourage oems to refrain from installing novell products on their computers,cutting off novell distribution channels and that microsoft required novell to use technologies in order to be certified as,degrading novell products performance on other operating systems and harming their advantageous compatibility.all of these activities allegedly had the effect of thwarting the ability of novell products to lower the applications barrier to entry into the market,therefore harming competition in that market.
the analysis of the causal link between these activities and the decline in novell market share is straightforward.microsoft use of its monopoly power in the market to foreclose the distribution channels for novell applications,for example,would have naturally tended to decrease novell market share and consequently decrease the value of its applications.likewise,withholding crucial data on its windows operating system would have put novell at a competitive disadvantage microsoft applications,leading naturally to a loss of market share for novell.this loss of market share could make a competing operating system featuring novell applications less attractive to consumers,harming that competing operating system potential to surmount the barrier protecting the windows monopoly.
in examining causation,we also consider whether the harm was intended.kloth,at see also agc,at.while mindful that the defendant specific intent to injure the plaintiff is not a panacea that will enable any complaint to withstand a motion to dismiss,we recognize that there no doubt are cases in which such an allegation would adequately support a plaintiff claim under.agc,at.here,novell alleges that microsoft specifically targeted its products for destruction as a means to damage competition in the market.novell allegations go beyond mere speculation.they are supported by internal microsoft communications.for example,microsoft chairman bill gates specifically suggested waiting to publish critical technical specifications of windows until we have a way to do a high level of integration between microsoft office and windows that will be harder for the likes of wordperfect to achieve.otherwise,gates noted,w e ca compete with.id.additionally,novell proffers the following email from senior microsoft official jeff raikes to investor warren buffett 
if we own the key franchises built on top of the operating systems,we dramatically widen the moat that protects the operating system business we hope to make a lot of money off these franchises,but even more important is that they should protect our windows royalty per pc.
the moat protecting windows to which raikes refers is the applications barrier to entry the email therefore supports novell assertions that its products were directly targeted.
in sum,the first two agc factors weigh in favor of granting novell antitrust standing.the facts alleged by novell,taken as true for the purposes of this appeal,are sufficient to demonstrate that novell suffered an antitrust injury and that its injury can be traced to microsoft alleged antitrust violations.while the showing of an antitrust injury demonstrates that a case is of the type for which antitrust standing is recognized,such a showing is not necessarily sufficient to demonstrate that the particular plaintiff has antitrust standing.thus,we now turn to an analysis of the remaining agc factors.
the latter three agc factors require us to consider the directness of the alleged injury the existence of more direct victims of the alleged antitrust injury and problems of identifying damages and apportioning them among those directly and indirectly harmed.kloth,at internal quotations omitted.these additional factors are intended to further restrict entry into the federal courts for private enforcement of the antitrust laws.i f afforded to every person tangentially affected by an antitrust violation or for all injuries that might conceivably be traced to an antitrust violation,the remedy would open the door to much mischief,including the filing of claims that are remote from the forbidden anticompetitive activity and the risk of duplicative lawsuits.cargill,at.internal quotations omitted.that said,the supreme court has recognized that in enacting,congress sought to create a private enforcement mechanism that would deter violators and deprive them of the fruits of their illegal actions,and would provide ample compensation to the victims of antitrust violations.see mccready,at.the broad language of the statute,and the avowed breadth of the congressional purpose,caution us not to cabin in ways that will defeat its broad remedial objective.id.at.
considerations of the directness of the plaintiff injury and of the existence of harmed parties are closely related.law favors granting standing to the most direct victims of defendants anticompetitive conduct and denying standing to more remote victims on the theory that the direct victims have the greatest motivation to act as private attorney s general and to vindicate the public interest in antitrust enforcement.agc,at.further,compensating only direct victims avoids duplicative recoveries.id.at.therefore,the existence of an identifiable,harmed class of victims with the incentive to sue under the antitrust laws weighs against granting standing to a more remote plaintiff.if,however,there is no harmed party with motivation to act as a private attorney general than the plaintiff,the risk of duplicative recoveries on the one hand,or the danger of complex apportionment of damages on the other is mitigated.agc,at.brick,d limiting standing to recover money damages in claim to direct purchasers in order to avoid duplicative recoveries and difficult problems.
for example,in agc,the sued a contractors association,alleging that the defendants coerced members of the association and certain nonmembers to hire nonunion contractors and subcontractors.at.the court found that the union injuries were derivative of any harm that may have been suffered by certain of its members.id.at.by contrast,in mccready,there was no more direct victim of the defendants anticompetitive acts than the she had paid for the services of a mental healthcare provider that itself could not complain of blue cross refusal to reimburse mccready at.
here,novell alleges that its software applications popularity,quality,and ability to function well on multiple operating systems posed a potential threat to microsoft windows monopoly by offering competing pc operating systems a bridge across the applications barrier to entry,the moat that protects windows monopoly into that market.novell claims that because of this threat,microsoft directly targeted its products.as noted above,microsoft specific intent with respect to novell is not the decisive factor,but it is evidence that microsoft viewed novell as a threat that could enable competitors to gain a foothold in the market.furthermore,microsoft withholding of information from novell software developers relating to windows clearly has no more direct victim than novell.finally,microsoft exclusive deals with oems that ensured that novell products would not be preinstalled on new pcs built by those oems directly curtailed novell distribution channels.
although microsoft argues that a long list of plaintiffs than novell exists,it mentions none by name or by category.nevertheless,we surmise that such plaintiffs might include potentially competing operating systems,the oems who were restrained from installing novell products on computers they manufactured,or even consumers who purchased computers installed with microsoft products at an inflated price because of a lack of competition.without addressing whether plaintiffs representing each of these groups would have antitrust standing,we note that none of these parties has sued microsoft on the theory that microsoft alleged destruction of novell dominant applications harmed competition in the pc market.it may be that oems,for example,are too dependent on relationships with microsoft for their business livelihood to have the incentive to pursue claims under.see berger bernstein,an analytical framework for antitrust standing,yale,noting some parties affected by an antitrust violation may well not sue because of their stake in an ongoing commercial relationship with the violator.this suggests that novell may be the plaintiff to assert these claims.indeed,today novell may be one of the few private plaintiffs whose claims in this regard are neither nor too tenuous to support antitrust standing.
certain characteristics of the pc market also weigh in favor of finding novell to be the most direct victim with incentive to serve as a private attorney general.as noted earlier in this opinion,in technologically dynamic markets characterized by network effects,one dominant product typically reigns supreme.see supra.microsoft windows thus competes more for the field,parrying threats from outside the field instead of from within.see id.given the apparent absence of a harmed party than novell outside the filed and the dominance of microsoft windows within the field,we conclude that the agc directness factors weigh in favor of finding antitrust standing here.
finally,we turn to the fifth agc factor which considers whether a finding of antitrust standing would lead to problems of identifying damages and apportioning them among those directly and indirectly harmed.kloth microsoft,cir internal quotations omitted.cases where this factor has been found to bar standing often involve potential plaintiffs indirectly injured by the allegedly anticompetitive behavior,raising the specter of complex apportionment of damages among,or duplicative recoveries by,direct and indirect victims of such conduct.see agc,at.denying standing to the union in part because damages would have to be allocated between directly victimized union subcontractors and their indirectly victimized employees.brick,at.prohibiting a plaintiff down a distribution change from bringing a private action for an overcharge that may have been passed on to it by a middleman.because we have already determined,on the record before us,that microsoft allegedly anticompetitive conduct was directly aimed at novell,there is little risk that any damages novell might prove would need to be allocated or apportioned among any injured parties.
we therefore find that the agc factors favor granting standing to novell to assert counts i and vi.we thus affirm the district court denial of microsoft motion to dismiss as to these claims on the issue.
we wish to emphasize here that we address the limited issue of novell antitrust standing on these facts.we do not view our decision with respect to novell as unduly expanding the universe of private antitrust plaintiffs.we recognize,as has the supreme court in its consideration of the scope of antitrust standing,that suits under of the clayton act are not to be wielded indiscriminately.we merely hold that novell,like the owners of the middleware products at issue in microsoft ii,is a member of a limited class of plaintiffs for whom the agc factors support antitrust standing,even though they are outside the restrained pc market.
having concluded that novell does have antitrust standing to assert counts i and vi,we now turn to novell argument that the district court erred in dismissing as untimely counts ii through v,which allege injury to competition in the market.
as noted earlier,this action was commenced more than eight years after novell claims arose therefore,all of the claims are,see federal antitrust claims barred if brought more than four years after accruing,unless saved by the tolling provision of i of the clayton act.this section provides in relevant part 
whenever any civil or criminal proceeding is instituted by the united states to punish violations of any of the antitrust laws the running of the statute of limitations in respect of every private right of action based in whole or in part on any matter complained of in said proceeding shall be suspended during the pendency thereof and for one year thereafter 
i emphasis added.
the tolling statute contemplates an analysis of the relationship between the violations alleged in the government action and those alleged in the private action.leh,at.for the tolling provision to apply,the private plaintiffs must prove,by comparison of the two complaints on their face s,a significant overlap of subject matter between the two actions.id.at.there is no requirement,however,of complete identity of the means,objectives,or statutory violations in the public and private lawsuits.mining wood finishing,d.
section i represents a balance struck by congress between competing policy objectives.on the one hand,a grudging interpretation of i would collide with congress belief that private antitrust litigation is one of the surest weapons for effective enforcement of the antitrust laws.mining,at.on the other hand,i reflects a congressional emphasis on certainty and predictability in the application of the tolling provision so as to avoid undue prolongation of antitrust proceedings.greyhound hood stages,d citing.
beyond these broad principles,the district court here relied upon the general rule that limitations are not tolled when the government and subsequent private suits arose in distinct markets.philip areeda herbert hovenkamp,antitrust law,at ed.other courts have also applied this rule.for example,in in re coordinated pretrial proceedings in petroleum prods.antitrust,the markets defined by the government and the private plaintiffs were the same refined oil products except that they covered different geographical nearly all of the same producers were active in both areas.id.at.nonetheless,the court rejected tolling because the markets were not identical,as they covered different geographical areas.see id.at see also charley tour and,interisland resorts,stating,in a case involving the market in the government action and the market in the private action,that i does not mean that a defendant in a government action doing business in different markets has the statute of limitations tolled as to all of its markets.
novell argues that the tolling provision preserves counts ii through v because its complaint overlaps significantly with the doj complaint.the doj complaint,as discussed earlier,was based on allegations of anticompetitive conduct by microsoft in two product markets the market for pc operating systems and the market for internet browsers.doj compl.novell argues that the core elements of its claims echo allegations made throughout the government complaint against microsoft,even though novell claims in counts ii through v are for harm to a market distinct from those specifically at issue in the doj complaint.appellee br.at.novell cites,inter alia,paragraph of the doj complaint,which alleges,microsoft conduct includes exclusionary agreements precluding companies from distributing,promoting,buying,or using products of microsoft software competitors,doj compl.paragraph of the doj complaint,which avers that microsoft conduct with respect to browsers is an example of microsoft activities with the purpose and effect of maintaining its pc monopoly and extending that monopoly to other related markets,doj compl.emphasis added and the government prayer for relief,which is peppered with references to other software products.novell argues that because the doj complaint references other software markets,the complaint should be interpreted as complain ing of harm to applications as well as the two markets to which it clearly did allege harm,markets for pc operating systems and for internet browsers.appellee br.at.
we can not accept novell proffered interpretation.though we are mindful of the tolling provision purpose of providing private plaintiffs the opportunity to wait to assert claims that are the subject of a government action during the pendency of that action,novell reading would require us to look beyond the face of the doj complaint,in contravention of leh,at.the doj complaint only expressly alleges harm to the markets for pc operating systems and for internet browsers.novell allegations of harm to the market,therefore,overlap little with the subject matter of the doj complaint.
a straightforward application of the rule also bars application of the tolling provision here.though novell characterizes the rule as merely a helpful rule of thumb,appellee br.at,novell cites only cases involving either the same markets in the government and private suits,or markets much more closely linked than the pc market and the market.indeed,the supreme court has accepted tolling only where the private plaintiffs make claims in markets identical to,or completely encompassed by,those at issue in the earlier government suit.see zenith hazeltine research,d same markets leh,at.market in government suit was that for distribution of refined gasoline in pacific coast states,whereas private suit focused on the same market in southern california only.mining,at.same markets because the market at issue in counts ii through v is neither identical to nor completely encompassed by the pc market at issue in the government action,these cases are of little service to novell.
supporting our conclusion regarding the distinct nature of the markets is the fact that the government decision to pursue claims involving only the and internet browser markets rested on a deliberate choice.the department of justice knew that state attorneys general originally included a claim in their action against microsoft,filed on the same day as the doj complaint in the same court,for harm to a market for applications.see compl.at,new york microsoft,wl.this claim was subsequently dropped in an amended complaint.see first am,id 
on these facts,we do not believe i of the clayton act should be construed to permit private plaintiffs to sit on their rights and to assert,years after the traditional statute of limitations has run,claims so much broader than those asserted by the government that they open entirely new vistas of litigation.novell,microsoft,civ,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.june.to allow novell to go forward with counts ii through v now would have precisely this undesirable effect,in addition to extending the tolling effect of i beyond what the supreme court has accepted or condoned in this area.such an extension of the tolling provision would contravene the goals of certainty and predictability in this area,as well as avoidance of the undue prolongation of proceedings.greyhound,at.quotation omitted.
we therefore hold that the tolling provision of i of the clayton act does not preserve counts ii through v of novell complaint.after tarrying with these claims for more than eight years,novell can not now resurrect stale causes of action,and microsoft is entitled to the comfort of repose.novell,civ,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
the judgment of the district court is 
a application is software that enables an to create,edit,and print documents.
a spreadsheet application is software that enables an to organize and manipulate quantitative data.
in march,novell sold its applications to corel corporation.
microsoft suite is called microsoft office and includes word,a application,and excel,a spreadsheet application.
operating systems serve as platforms for software applications by making available to software developers protocols that perform certain functions.microsoft ii,at.these protocols are referred to as application programming interfaces apis.id.for example,windows includes an api that allows users to draw a box on the computer screen.id.software developers wishing to include that function in their applications for the windows operating system may utilize the windows api.id.
in microsoft ii,microsoft did not challenge the district court finding that windows controlled greater than of the pc market.at.
these other pc operating systems include or at one time included linux,unix,and ibm.see microsoft ii,at.additionally,apple macintosh operating system,mac os,exists outside of the pc market.see id.
since that time,microsoft has faced a number of private antitrust suits for allegedly unlawfully monopolizing or otherwise harming competition in the pc market.see,kloth microsoft,cir deiter microsoft,cir in re microsoft.antitrust,cir in re microsoft.antitrust,cir.
novell does not market an operating system comparable to microsoft windows.novell did at one time own an operating system known as novell dos,which it sold to caldera,caldera in.before the district court,microsoft argued that novell sold its claims for monopolization and attempted monopolization of the pc market to caldera along with its pc business.therefore,microsoft asserted that in addition to lacking antitrust standing as to counts i and vi,novell no longer owned the claims district court rejected microsoft argument.however,as noted above,we granted microsoft petition for interlocutory appeal on the issue only,and thus the question of ownership of the claims is not before us.
b provides,in pertinent part when a district judge,in making in a civil action an order not otherwise appealable,shall be of the opinion that such order involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation,he shall so state in writing such order.the court of appeals which would have jurisdiction of an appeal of such action may thereupon,in its discretion,permit an appeal to be taken of such order

according to novell,monopolizing the market was an end in itself for microsoft and the subject of counts ii through v of novell complaint,but the primary purpose of microsoft anticompetitive scheme was to protect microsoft pc monopoly,its real cash cow.appellee br.at.
