before the court are consolidated petitions for review which challenge an order of the federal communications commission fcc preempting state regulation of telecommunication services which utilize a relatively new technology called voice over internet protocol voip.the fcc preempted state regulation after determining it would be impractical,if not impossible,to separate the intrastate portions of voip service from the interstate portions,and state regulation would conflict with federal rules and policies.we conclude the issue raised in the petition filed by the public service commission of the state of new york is not ripe for review and otherwise affirm the fcc order and deny the petitions for review.
voip is an internet application utilizing to transmit a voice communication over a broadband internet connection.in that respect,it is different from the application used to route traditional landline telephone calls.in communications,an electrical circuit must be kept clear of other signals for the duration of a telephone call.communications travel in small digital packets along with many other packets,allowing for more efficient utilization of circuits.while sophisticated,the application is also more cost effective than traditional circuit switches.
voip communications also differ from traditional telephone communications in another significant way.the geographic locations of traditional telephone communications are readily known,so it is easy to determine whether a particular phone call is intrastate or interstate in nature.conversely,communications originate and terminate at ip addresses which exist in cyberspace,but are tied to no identifiable geographic location.for example,a voip customer residing in minnesota but visiting new york could connect a laptop computer to a broadband internet connection and communicate with a neighbor via computer back in minnesota,while the next day the same caller could be in los angeles and talk to the same friend who now happens to be in los angeles as well.the internet would recognize both communications as taking place between the same two ip addresses,but when considering the geographic locations of the caller and recipient,the first call would be interstate while the second intrastate in nature.
similarly,in or communications,known as interconnected voip service,the geographic location of the landline part of the call can be determined,but the geographic location of the voip part of the call could be anywhere in the universe the voip customer obtains broadband access to the internet,not necessarily confined to the geographic location associated with the customer billing address or assigned telephone number.furthermore,using the north american numbering plan nanp,the system of using a area code followed by a number or a voip customer billing address as proxies for the originating or terminating points of interconnected voip communications causes some interstate calls to appear to be intrastate in nature and vice versa.in the example used above,if we assume both the caller and recipient had minnesota billing addresses and nanp numbers with minnesota area codes,both communications would appear to be intrastate minnesota calls if the billing addresses or nanp numbers were used as proxies for the originating and terminating points of the communications,even though the first was an interstate call between new york and minnesota and the second an intrastate california call.
the use of such proxies as substitutes for the actual originating and terminating points of voip communications is further complicated by the fact voip customers can choose nanp numbers with area codes different from those associated with their billing addresses.again referring to the example used above,assume the voip customer residing in minnesota chose a nanp number with an arizona area code.in such a case,the interstate communication between new york and minnesota would appear to be a minnesota intrastate call if the customer billing address were used as a proxy for the originating point,but appear to be an interstate call between arizona and minnesota if the nanp number were used as a proxy for the originating point.
a distinction can be drawn,however,between what is referred to as nomadic voip service and fixed voip service.nomadic service is the type described above,where a voip customer can use the service nomadically by connecting with a broadband internet connection anywhere in the universe to place a call.fixed voip service describes the use of the same technology,that is,converting a voice communication into digital packets before transmitting it to another location,but in a way where the service is used from a fixed location.for example,cable television companies offer voip service to their customers,but when they do so the ensuing transmissions use the cable running to and from the customer residence.as a result,the geographic originating point of the communications can be determined.thus,when voip is offered as a fixed service rather than a nomadic service,the interstate and intrastate portions of the service can be more easily distinguished.
the use of voip technology has grown rapidly,and with this growth has come controversy over the technology regulatory status.some voip providers contend the service should be classified for regulatory purposes as an information service which,like the internet itself,congress has deemed should be free from almost all federal and state regulation.meanwhile,many state regulators argue voip service should be classified as a telecommunications service,with the intrastate aspects of the service regulated at the state level and the interstate aspects regulated at the federal level.a primary point of contention about how voip service should be regulated deals with the provision of emergency services,which necessitate the identification of a caller geographic location.
with this oversimplified summary of voip service as a backdrop,we consider the particular dispute which gave rise to the consolidated petitions for review now before our court.
on july,the minnesota department of commerce mdoc filed a complaint with the minnesota public utilities commission mpuc alleging the digitalvoice services being offered by vonage holdings corporation vonage,which utilized voip technology,were telephone services.the complaint further alleged vonage was offering such services without complying with the state regulations governing telephone as obtaining a service permit and filing a tariff listing the prices,terms,and conditions applicable to digitalvoice.as a result of the mdoc complaint,the mpuc ordered vonage to comply with the minnesota regulations applicable to telephone service and to cease and desist offering digitalvoice services within the state until it did so.
in response to the mpuc order,vonage filed a petition with the fcc requesting it to preempt the order on the grounds vonage was a provider of information services,rather than a telecommunications carrier,and thus exempt from state regulation for its digitalvoice service.in the alternative,vonage invoked the impossibility exception of b,which allows the fcc to preempt state regulation of a service which would otherwise be subject to dual federal and state regulation where it is impossible or impractical to separate the service intrastate and interstate components,and the state regulation interferes with valid federal rules or policies.see.pub.serv.comm fcc,d indicating the fcc can preempt state law where compliance with both federal and state law is in effect physically impossible see also id.at.fcc of state regulation should be upheld where it is not possible to separate the interstate and the intrastate components of the asserted fcc regulation.
vonage also filed suit against the mpuc in federal district court seeking to enjoin enforcement of the cease and desist order.the district court granted a permanent injunction which barred the mpuc from enforcing its order,concluding vonage was providing information services rather than telecommunication services and therefore not subject to state regulation.vonage holdings.pub.utils.comm n,d.the mpuc appealed the ruling to the eighth circuit.
while the mpuc appeal was pending,the fcc issued an order addressing vonage petition.in its order,the fcc adopted vonage alternative position,which is,irrespective of whether vonage services should be characterized as telecommunication services or information services,the fcc determined it was appropriate to preempt state regulation because it was impossible or impractical to separate the intrastate components of voip service from its interstate components.the fcc stated t he practical inseverability of other types of services having basic characteristics similar to digitalvoice would likewise preclude state regulation accordingly,to the extent other entities,such as cable companies,provide voip services,we would preempt state regulation to an extent comparable to what we have done in this order.in re vonage holdings,at,wl at emphasis added.
shortly after the fcc issued its ruling on vonage petition,the eighth circuit concluded the fcc order was binding with respect to the mpuc appeal of the permanent injunction barring enforcement of the cease and desist order,unless and until an aggrieved party invoked jurisdiction under the hobbs act,relevant provision codified at,by filing a petition for review in an appropriate court of appeals seeking direct review of the fcc order.vonage holdings.pub.utils.comm n,cir.following the fcc order,several petitions seeking direct review of the order were filed in various courts of in the second circuit,one in the sixth circuit,and two in the eighth circuit.after brief transfers to the ninth circuit,all four petitions ultimately found their way to the eighth circuit and were consolidated into this one case.
the four primary issues raised in the consolidated petitions are whether the fcc order is arbitrary and capricious because it failed to make a threshold determination about whether voip services were information services or telecommunications services,determined it is impractical or impossible to separate the intrastate components of voip service from its interstate components,determined state regulation of voip service conflicts with federal regulatory policies,and preempted emergency telephone service requirements.a fifth issue raised in the petition filed by the public service commission of the state of new york is whether of the fcc order arbitrarily preempted fixed voip services offered by cable television companies,even though the intrastate components of such service can more easily be separated from the interstate components of such services.

the first issue is whether the fcc arbitrarily or capriciously failed to classify voip service as either an information service or a telecommunications service.the fcc concluded state regulation of voip service should be preempted regardless of its regulatory classification because it was impossible or impractical to separate the intrastate components of voip service from its interstate components.the fcc deferred resolution of the regulatory classification of voip service in its order because the issue was already the subject of its services proceeding where the commission is comprehensively examining numerous types of services,including services like digitalvoice.in re vonage holdings,at.as to this order,the fcc contends the dispositive nature of the impossibility exception made it unnecessary to first classify voip service.see cable telecomms.ass gulf power,d d ecisionmakers sometimes dodge hard questions where easier ones are dispositive.
in gulf power,the supreme court described as sensible the fcc decision not to determine whether internet services are cable services under the communications act,given the fcc decision that such a determination was unnecessary for the fcc to assert jurisdiction over rates for internet traffic.at.this case is similar to gulf power.the impossibility exception,if applicable,is dispositive of the issue whether the fcc has authority to preempt state regulation of voip services.it was therefore sensible for the fcc to address that question first without having to determine whether voip service should be classified as a telecommunication service or an information service.
the next issue is whether the fcc arbitrarily or capriciously concluded the impossibility exception applies to voip services.as already discussed,the impossibility exception of b allows the fcc to preempt state regulation of a service if it is not possible to separate the interstate and intrastate aspects of the service,and federal regulation is necessary to further a valid federal regulatory objective,state regulation would conflict with federal regulatory policies.qwest scott,cir.we address each of the components of the impossibility exception in turn.
the fcc determined on the basis of the record before it that there was no practical means of directly or indirectly identifying the geographic location of a digitalvoice subscriber.in re vonage holdings,at.the fcc further emphasized 
the significant costs and operational complexities associated with modifying or procuring systems to track,record and process geographic location information as a necessary aspect of the service would substantially reduce the benefits of using the internet to provide the service,and potentially inhibit its deployment and continued availability to consumers.
the internet inherently global and open architecture obviates the need for any correlation between vonage digitalvoice service and its end users geographic locations.
id.at.additionally,the fcc recognized communications over the internet were very different from traditional telephone calls because of the multiple service features which might come into play during a voip call,access ing different websites or ip addresses during the same communication and perform ing different types of communications simultaneously,none of which the provider has a means to separately track or record by geographic location.id.at.
it was proper for the fcc to consider the economic burden of identifying the geographic endpoints of voip communications in determining whether it was impractical or impossible to separate the service into its interstate and intrastate components.see california fcc,cir the fcc is empowered to make reasonable assumptions about economic impact based on the evidence currently available.quoting utils.comm fcc,cir.service providers are not required to develop a mechanism for distinguishing between interstate and intrastate communications merely to provide state commissions with an intrastate communication they can then regulate.bell.fcc,noting the communications act does not require construction of wholly independent intrastate and interstate networks see also california fcc,upholding fcc preemption on basis that it would be impractical to require investment in expensive additional equipment solely to create a separate intrastate communication service.in addition,the issue whether voip services can be separated into interstate and intrastate components is a largely inquiry requiring a high level of technical expertise.as noted above,in such situations we accord a high level of deference to the informed decision of the agency charged with making those fact findings.see cent.coop.grazing,at.after carefully examining the record in this case,as well as the parties arguments,we conclude the fcc did not arbitrarily or capriciously determine it was impractical or impossible to separate the intrastate components of voip serv
