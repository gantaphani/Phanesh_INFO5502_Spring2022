when the complexities inherent in the english language meet the peculiarities of patent jargon,the result can be the bane of many unsuspecting patentees.while claim language is generally the product of the patentee alone,the patentee drafting efforts are sometimes aided by the examiner.usually,such collaborative efforts are constructive.on occasion,however,these efforts result in confusion,not clarity.in this case,there were two such occasions.the first was during the original the patentee authored and the examiner allowed a claim with an arguably ambiguous limitation.the second was during the patentee and the examiner clarified the claim but failed to make an adequate record explaining the rationale for the amendment.careful and straightforward claim drafting by prosecuting attorneys and agents,and rigorous application by examiners of the statutory standard to particularly point out and distinctly claim the subject matter regarded to be the invention,see,serve an important public notice function.here,the public notice function was not well served.indeed,the controversy in this case might have been avoided had the claims been presented differently and accepted by the examiner only after more careful scrutiny.
in this action,predicate logic,predicate brought suit against distributive software,distributive for infringement of patent the patent.the patent relates to measurement and analysis technologies for use in software development.during the litigation,distributive requested ex parte reexamination of the patent,and the claims were allowed as amended during reexamination.distributive then argued to the district court that the asserted claims were invalid because the amendment during reexamination improperly broadened the claims.the district court agreed and granted distributive motion for summary judgment of invalidity.predicate logic,distributive software,llc,slip op.at,op.predicate logic,distributive software,llc,slip op.at,wl.july,slip op.at july op.because we disagree with the district court conclusion that the amendment substantively changed the scope of claim of the patent,we reverse and remand.
background 
the patent discloses a universal data measurement,analysis,and control method that can be used in the software development process.patent.measuring and forecasting the software development process is difficult because multiple different programming languages may be used on a single project,and each programming language has different metrics.id.for example,in one programming language,the number of lines of code written may be a good metric to track programming progress,while in another programming language,code may not be organized into lines at all.thus,the lack of internally consistent data makes it difficult to measure and forecast software development.id.
the patent attempts to solve this problem with a universal system for data measurement and analysis.id.because software is typically organized hierarchically,the invention of the patent uses a series of rules to generate one or more hierarchical indexes that serve as templates for the data to be collected from all of the components of the project.id.the invention then discloses selectively instantiating those hierarchical,populating the index fields with data from the comparing the results of these instantiations.id.
predicate brought suit against distributive in alleging infringement of the patent.op.at.at distributive request,the united states patent and trademark office initiated reexamination of the patent,and the district court stayed the infringement action pending the outcome of the reexamination.id.at.during reexamination,the examiner initially found all claims anticipated by the reference that was the basis for distributive reexamination request,as well as obvious in light of that reference combined with other art.id.following a response by predicate,the examiner withdrew the anticipation rejection but maintained the obviousness rejection.id.predicate appealed to the board of patent appeals and interferences,but the examiner withdrew the obviousness rejection in light of predicate brief to the board.id.additionally,the examiner issued an examiner amendment to claims and only independent claims of the patent.id.the examiner did not give any reason for the amendment.id.the claims as amended were allowed.patent,reexamination certificate.
the amendment to claim is at issue in this appeal.claim,as amended,is as follows 
a method of providing a universal data analysis,measurement and control system for a variety of types of input data components comprising data sets,the method being implemented in a programmed computer comprising a processor,at least one data storage system,at least one input device and at least one output device,the method comprising the steps of 
generating,by means of the programmed computer,at least one hierarchical index linked to each of the input data components,said at least one index being generated under formatting rules and further including a description of each of the data sets,each said data set description including at least one quantified description of each data set 
storing said at least one index in at least one of the data storage systems 
instantiating said at least one index by means of the programmed computer 
first instantiating at least one said index by means of the programmed computer 
second instantiating at least one said index by means of the programmed computer 
storing said first and second instantiations of said at least one said index in at least one of the data storage systems 
comparing at least one of the data sets linked to at least one of said instantiated indexes to at least another of the data sets linked to at least another of said instantiated indexes by means of the programmed computer and 
applying the output of said comparing to at least one of the output devices.

the infringement action resumed after the conclusion of the reexamination proceeding.distributive argued that the amendments during reexamination substantively changed the claims and resulted in an improper broadening of claim scope.the district court agreed and found that the patent was substantively changed during reexamination in two respects.op.at.first,the district court found that the amendment from said at least one index to at least one said index broadened the scope of claim.id.at.second,the district court found that the amendment deleting the instantiating step and replacing it with two steps first instantiating and second instantiating substantively changed the claim by narrowing it.id.at.the district court granted summary judgment of invalidity in favor of distributive.july op.at.

amendment of said at least one index to at least one said index 
under,n o proposed amended or new claim enlarging the scope of a claim of the patent will be permitted in a reexamination proceeding.claims that are impermissibly broadened during reexamination are invalid,and a violation of is an invalidity defense in a patent infringement action.quantum rodime,plc.whether amendments made during reexamination enlarge the scope of a claim is a matter of claim construction,which this court reviews de novo.creo,presstek.
the district court concluded that shifting of the word said in the instantiating step of claim broadened the claim scope.op.at.in the claim,the first step of both the original and the amended versions requires generating at least one hierarchical index.patent,reexamination certificate.in the original claim,there is an instantiating step that requires instantiating said at least one index.id.emphasis added.in the amended claim,each instantiation step requires instantiating at least one said index.id,emphasis added.
the district court construed said to have its ordinary meaning of aforementioned,and therefore reasoned that said at least one index of the original claim must be the index or indexes that are generated in the generating step.op.at.the district court reasoned that,because the antecedent
