plaintiffs universal communication systems,and its chief executive officer,michael zwebner,collectively,ucs brought suit,objecting to a series of allegedly false and defamatory postings made under pseudonymous screen names on an internet message board operated by lycos.ucs identified two of the screen names as having been registered to roberto villasenor.ucs sued not only villasenor and the other posters of messages,as john does,but also lycos and terra networks,lycos corporate parent at the time of the postings in question.
in section of the communications decency act cda,congress has granted broad immunity to entities,such as lycos,that facilitate the speech of others on the internet.whatever the limits of that immunity,it is clear that lycos activities in this case fall squarely within those that congress intended to immunize.ucs attempted to plead around this section statutory immunity by asserting that lycos did not qualify for immunity and that ucs claims fell within certain exceptions to that immunity.the district court rejected these arguments and dismissed the claims against lycos and terra networks for failure to state a claim.we agree and affirm the dismissals,joining the other courts that have uniformly given effect to section in similar circumstances.
as for the claims against the individuals who posted,ucs alleged violations of federal and state securities laws,but made only conclusory allegations that the postings at issue were in connection with a scheme involving ucs stock.it thus failed to meet the particularity requirement for pleading fraud under federal rule of civil procedure b.in the absence of any substantial allegations on this point,we affirm the district court dismissal of those claims.
because we review here the district court granting of a motion to dismiss,we recite the facts as alleged in ucs complaint,mccloskey mueller,cir,but without crediting unsupported conclusions and assertions,palmer champion mortgage,cir.
universal communication systems,is a nevada corporation with its corporate offices in florida.the company at one point provided telecommunications services and currently is developing water extraction systems.it is a company that trades under the ticker symbol ucsy,a label that the company also uses in its promotional materials.zwebner is chairman and ceo of the company.he is a citizen of the united kingdom and of israel,with his principal residence in israel and a secondary residence in florida.
lycos is a massachusetts corporation with its principal place of business in massachusetts.terra networks is a spanish corporation with its principal place of business in spain.terra networks owned lycos from to.
lycos operates a network of web sites devoted to a wide array of content.at times relevant here,these web sites included,which provides stock quotation information and financial data for companies,and,which hosts message boards,including ones designed to allow users to post comments about companies.the message board for each such company is generally created by a user and is generally identified using the company stock ticker in this case.in addition,the two web sites are linked to each other,so that a user who retrieves a stock quote from is also given a link to the corresponding message board on raging bull.both web sites contain advertisements,and lycos derives advertising revenue that depends in some measure on the volume of usage of its sites.
individuals must register with lycos in order to post messages on raging bull message boards.as part of the registration process,users are required to agree to a subscriber agreement,which,inter alia,requires users to comply with federal and state securities laws.upon registration,a member obtains a screen name.postings on the message board are identified by screen name,but no further identifying information is automatically included with the posting.the registration process does not prevent a single individual from registering under multiple screen names.
starting at least in,a number of postings disparaging the financial condition,business prospects and management integrity of ucs appeared on raging bull ucsy message board.ucs alleges that these postings were false,misleading incomplete.in particular,ucs identified postings made under eight different screen names as objectionable.ucs alleges that the individuals registered under each of these screen names are one and the same individual,roberto villasenor,are individuals acting in concert with roberto villasenor.
on january,ucs filed suit against lycos and terra networks in federal district court in the southern district of florida.on february,before either defendant responded to the complaint,ucs filed a first amended complaint,adding as defendants eight john does,each identified by a raging bull screen name.in this first amended complaint,ucs alleged four claims fraudulent securities transactions under.stat.cyberstalking under dilution of trade name under.stat.and cyberstalking under.stat.the florida securities claim was made against all of the defendants,and the remaining claims were made against lycos and terra networks only.
in response,lycos filed a motion to dismiss,arguing that ucs claims were barred under section of the communications decency act,and that there was no basis for either the federal cyberstalking claim or the state dilution claim.section provides that n o provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider,id.c,and that n o cause of action may be brought and no liability may be imposed under any state or local law that is inconsistent with this section,id.e.
in the alternative,lycos moved to transfer the case to the district of massachusetts,citing a forum selection clause in its subscriber agreement.in addition,lycos sought a stay of discovery pending the resolution of these motions.the district court in florida granted the stay and shortly thereafter transferred the case to massachusetts.this left pending the motion to dismiss.
following the transfer,the district court in massachusetts held a hearing on july,at which it denied all pending motions without prejudice.it then scheduled a later conference at which to consider any renewed motions,and held that it would not lift the stay on discovery at this time.in response to ucs request for limited discovery in the interim,the district court judge stated that he would not allow that until i had an opportunity to hear you on the matter.that will be an issue that we will take up at the later conference.
lycos and terra networks again filed motions to dismiss,and on october,the district court granted the motions.the court ruled from the bench that section immunizes lycos and terra networks from all of the four counts in the plaintiffs complaint and did not address any of the alternate arguments for dismissal.at that hearing,ucs made no mention of any need for discovery in order to properly oppose the motions to dismiss.
ucs then moved for leave to amend its complaint again.in the proposed second amended complaint,ucs alleged essentially the same four causes of action,but added factual allegations going to the construct and operation of lycos web sites,evidently assuming that such facts would take lycos outside section immunity.
on december,the district court denied the motion to amend the complaint as to lycos and terra networks,finding that the claims against those defendants,as framed in the proposed second amended complaint,would continue to be barred by section.in addition,the district court held that the claim for cyberstalking under would be dismissed for failure to state a claim,because that statute does not provide a private right of action.as to the florida trademark dilution claim,the court held that because lycos was not using the ucsy trademark to market incompatible products or services,but was only using it on the raging bull message board,the claim was effectively a defamation claim in the guise of an antidilution claim,and was thus barred by section.
the district court did,however,grant leave to file a complaint against the john doe defendants to assert a claim under the florida securities statute.on february,ucs filed a second amended complaint against villasenor and the john does.in this complaint,ucs substituted roberto villasenor,for two of the john does,previously identified as and.the complaint alleged that villasenor was a citizen of california.in addition to asserting a cause of action under florida securities laws against villasenor and the remaining john does,the complaint alleged causes of action,founded on the same set of operative facts,under federal securities laws,massachusetts securities laws,and massachusetts common law fraud.subject matter jurisdiction was alleged based on both federal question jurisdiction and diversity jurisdiction.ucs then moved for entry of separate and final judgment against lycos and terra networks.on april,villasenor filed an answer to the complaint,also asserting counterclaims and claims.
on april,the district court denied the motion for entry of separate and final judgment as to lycos and terra networks,finding that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the remaining claims and so judgment should be entered on all claims filed against all defendants.the court found that diversity jurisdiction was destroyed by the presence of the john doe defendants.the court also found that the claim under the federal securities laws against villasenor and the john does was not sufficiently substantial to confer federal question jurisdiction,as ucs had failed to allege that any individual defendant owned,borrowed,sold,or purchased any shares in ucsy.as a result,the district court ordered the case dismissed as to all defendants.
we review a denial of leave to amend the complaint for abuse of discretion,deferring to the district court for any adequate reason apparent from the record.resolution trust gold,cir.the futility of the amendment is an adequate reason to reject it,see,and here the district court found that the amendment would be futile because the amended complaint would be subject to dismissal.our review of a dismissal for either failure to state a claim or lack of subject matter jurisdiction so long as made without factfinding is de novo.mccloskey,at.we are not limited by the district court reasoning,and we may affirm an order of dismissal on any basis made apparent by the record.id.
we begin with the florida law claims against lycos and terra networks because these claims are based,at least in part,on the alleged impropriety of postings made by third parties on raging bull,ucs must contend with the statutory immunity provided by section.ucs has attempted to plead around that immunity by casting its claims only in terms of lycos actions and by asserting causes of action that purportedly fall into one of the statutory exceptions to section immunity.whatever the viability of ucs legal theories in the abstract,however,the facts pleaded simply do not fit those theories.on the facts alleged,congress intended that,within broad limits,message board operators would not be held responsible for the postings made by others on that board.no amount of artful pleading can avoid that result.
applicability of cda section immunity 
section provides that n o provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider,c,and that n o cause of action may be brought and no liability may be imposed under any state or local law that is inconsistent with this section,id.e.thus,unless an exception applies,lycos is immunized from a state law claim if lycos is a provider or user of an interactive computer service the claim is based on information provided by another information content provider and the claim would treat lycos as the publisher or speaker of that information.
although this court has not previously interpreted cda section,we do not write on a blank slate.the other courts that have addressed these issues have generally interpreted section immunity broadly,so as to effectuate congress policy choice not to deter harmful online speech through the route of imposing tort liability on companies that serve as intermediaries for other parties potentially injurious messages.zeran am.online,cir see also carafano,cir ben ezra,weinstein,am.online,cir.in zeran,the fourth circuit noted the obvious chilling effect that such intermediary tort liability could have,given the volume of material communicated through such intermediaries,the difficulty of separating lawful from unlawful speech,and the relative lack of incentives to protect lawful speech.at.the fourth circuit also recognized the congressional purpose of removing the disincentives to that would otherwise result if liability were imposed on intermediaries that took an active role in screening content.id.
in light of these policy concerns,we too find that section immunity should be broadly construed.in the context of this case,we have no trouble finding that lycos conduct in operating the raging bull web site fits comfortably within the immunity intended by congress.in particular web site operators,such as lycos,are provider s of an interactive computer service message board postings do not cease to be information provided by another information content provider merely because the construct and operation of the web site might have some influence on the content of the postings and immunity extends beyond publisher liability in defamation law to cover any claim that would treat lycos as the publisher.
interactive computer service provider 
there is no merit to ucs suggestion that lycos might not be a provider of an interactive computer service and so is not entitled to section immunity.the statute defines interactive computer service to be any information service,system,or access software provider that provides or enables computer access by multiple users to a computer server,including specifically a service or system that provides access to the internet.f.a web site,such as the raging bull site,enables computer access by multiple users to a computer server,namely,the server that hosts the web site.therefore,web site operators,such as lycos,are providers of interactive computer services within the meaning of section.
ucs argues that lycos might not be such a provider because it does not provide user access to the internet.providing access to the internet is,however,not the only way to be an interactive computer service provider.while such providers are specifically included,there is no indication that the definition should be so limited.other courts have reached the same conclusion.see,carafano,at.
information provided by another 
the message board postings to which ucs objects are,on their face,information provided by another information content provider.section defines information content provider to be any person or entity that is responsible,in whole or in part,for the creation or development of information provided through the internet or any other interactive computer service.f.this is a broad definition,covering even those who are responsible for the development of content only in part.in this case,it is clear that the individual posters on the raging bull web site are information content providers.
a key limitation in section,however,is that immunity only applies when the information that forms the basis for the state law claim has been provided by another information content provider.id.c emphasis added.thus,an interactive computer service provider remains liable for its own speech.see anthony,d,finding an online dating service not immune under section from claims that it manufactured false profiles and sent profiles of actual,legitimate former subscribers whose subscriptions had expired internal quotation marks omitted.
it is,by now,well established that notice of the unlawful nature of the information provided is not enough to make it the service provider own speech.see zeran,at see also barrett rosenthal,cal th,d.we confirm that view and join the other courts that have held that section immunity applies even after notice of the potentially unlawful nature of the content.
ucs emphasize s that lycos was manifestly aware of the illegal nature of the subscriber postings,but does not rely on notice alone in arguing against immunity.ucs argues instead that lycos has involved itself with its subscriber s rendered culpable assistance to its registered subscribers to the lycos network,through the construct and operation of its web site,and that such conduct falls outside section immunity.ucs has alleged nothing,however,that suggests that lycos should be considered to have been responsible,even in part,for the creation or development of the alleged misinformation.at best,ucs allegations establish that lycos conduct may have made it marginally easier for others to develop and disseminate misinformation.that is not enough to overcome section immunity.
in carafano,the ninth circuit rejected the plaintiff suggestion that an online dating service should have been considered a developer of a false profile because it provided the questionnaire that a user of the service answered falsely.at.the court reasoned that the underlying misinformation that formed the basis for the complaint was contained entirely in the responses provided by the user,and that the particularly objectionable content bore no more than a tenuous relationship to the actual questions asked.id.at.
compared to carafano,the allegations in this case provide an even less substantial basis to find that lycos was a developer of the alleged misinformation.ucs points to the fact that lycos does not prevent a single individual from registering under multiple screen names,and to the fact that lycos links sites providing objective financial information to the raging bull site.ucs theory is that these features of the raging bull site make it possible for individuals to spread misinformation more credibly,by doing so under multiple screen names and in a context that is associated with objective content.in carafano,the plaintiff at least had a colorable argument that the misinformation may have been prompted by the dating service questions.here there is not even a colorable argument that any misinformation was prompted by lycos registration process or its link structure.there is no indication that the lycos features that ucs criticizes are anything but standard for message boards and other web sites.to impose liability here would contravene congress intent and eviscerate section immunity.
in a related argument,ucs argues that lycos has provided culpable assistance to subscribers wishing to disseminate misinformation,and hence lycos exceeded the bounds of section immunity.ucs draws an analogy to the copyright case of mgm studios,grokster,d.in grokster,the supreme court held that copyright liability could be premised on a theory of active inducement of infringement,so that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright,as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement,is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties.id.at.ucs argues that,similarly,lycos should enjoy no immunity if it actively induces its subscribers to post unlawful content.
it is not at all clear that there is a culpable assistance exception to section immunity.the language of culpable assistance used by ucs appears to have been drawn from doe gte,cir.but that court used the language in the context of determining whether the defendant might be secondarily liable under the electronic communications privacy act of ecpa,stat.codified as amended in scattered sections of.we note that liability under the ecpa is specifically exempted from section immunity.see e.there is no ecpa claim here.similarly,grokster itself was a copyright case,and secondary liability for copyright infringement is not affected by section because intellectual property laws are also exempted.see id.e.
we need not decide whether a claim premised on active inducement might be consistent with section in the absence of a specific exception.even assuming arguendo that active inducement could negate section immunity,it is clear that ucs has not alleged any acts by lycos that come even close to constituting the clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster unlawful activity that would be necessary to find active inducement.see grokster.at.ucs relies in part on lycos registration process and link structure as described above,these are standard elements of web sites with both lawful and unlawful potential,see id.at,and hence,without more,can not form the basis to find inducement.ucs complaint also cites the fact that lycos has taken legal action to protect its subscribers,including moving to quash subpoenas and intervening in relevant cases.actions taken to protect subscribers legal rights,however,can not be construed as inducement of unlawful activity,and ucs does not allege that lycos lacked a reasonable basis for its legal activities.prof l real estate investors,columbia pictures,d l itigation can not be deprived of antitrust immunity as a sham unless the litigation is objectively baseless.the unmistakable evidence of an unlawful objective found in grokster.at,is entirely absent here 
thus,it is clear that,taking ucs allegations as true,lycos has done nothing in this case that might make the misinformation at issue its own,rather than that of another information content provider.
treatment as the publisher 
finally,liability under either the florida securities law or the florida cyberstalking law would involve treating lycos as the publisher of the misinformation ucs securities claims are based on the theory that individuals were taking a short position in ucs stock and then spreading misinformation to depress the stock price,so as to profit from their short position there is no allegation that lycos has been involved in any ucs stock transactions thus,any liability against it must be premised on imputing to it the alleged misinformation,that is,on treating it as the publisher of that information similarly,the alleged cyberstalking involves only the publication of a series of postings on the raging bull web site.again,lycos liability would depend on treating it as the publisher of those postings.
ucs argues that the prohibition against treating lycos as the publisher only immunizes lycos exercise of a publisher traditional editorial as deciding whether to publish,withdraw,postpone or alter content,zeran,at,and not its decisions regarding the construct and operation of its web sites.this argument misapprehends the scope of section immunity.if the cause of action is one that would treat the service provider as the publisher of a particular posting,immunity applies not only for the service provider decisions with respect to that posting,but also for its inherent decisions about how to treat postings generally.ucs is ultimately alleging that the construct and operation of lycos web sites contributed to the proliferation of misinformation lycos decision not to reduce misinformation by changing its web site policies was as much an editorial decision with respect to that misinformation as a decision not to delete a particular posting.section immunity does not depend on the form that decision takes.see green am.online aol,cir finding that liability for the alleged negligent failure to properly police aol network for content transmitted by its users would treat aol as the publisher or speaker of that content.
we hold that,given the allegations in ucs complaint,liability for lycos under either the florida securities statute or the florida cyberstalking statute would involve treating lycos as the publisher of information provided by another information content provider.thus,we affirm the district court ruling that both claims are barred by section.
trademark dilution 
ucs remaining claim against lycos was brought under florida trademark law,alleging dilution of the ucsy trade name under.stat.claims based on intellectual property laws are not subject to section immunity.see e nothing in this section shall be construed to limit or expand any law pertaining to intellectual property.see also gucci,hall,d,finding that the plain language of section e precludes the defendant claim of immunity from a claim for trademark infringement.
thus,the pivotal issue for consideration here is whether plaintiff complaint would withstand a motion to dismiss even in the absence of.id.at.we hold that,because of the serious first amendment issues that would be raised by allowing ucs claim here,the claim would not survive,even in the absence of section 
during the relevant time period.stat.provided that one who adopts and uses a trademark or trade name has a cause of action 
to enjoin subsequent use by another of the same or any similar mark or trade name if it appears to the court that there exists a likelihood of injury to business reputation or of dilution of the distinctive quality of the mark or trade name of the prior user,notwithstanding the absence of competition between the parties or of confusion as to the source of goods or services 
ucs theory is that lycos is liable under this statute for suggesting to its subscribers that they use the ucsy mark for designation of a message board on the raging bull web site and then contribut ing to the development of misinformation on that message board and failing to remove such misinformation.ucs alleges that these acts have caused injury to its business reputation and dilution of its ucsy trade name.
the injury that ucs alleges,however,is not a form of trademark injury.trademark injury arises from an improper association between the mark and products or services marketed by others.see bean,drake publishers,cir.but any injury to ucs ultimately arises from its being criticized on the raging bull site.to premise liability on such criticism would raise serious first amendment concerns.see id.at.in bean,this court held that the application of the maine statute to defendant noncommercial parody can not withstand constitutional scrutiny under the first amendment,recognizing the role of parody as a form of social and literary criticism.id.quoting berlin publ ns,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in that case,as in this one,i f the statute were construed as permitting a trademark owner to enjoin the use of his mark in a noncommercial context found to be negative or offensive,then a corporation could shield itself from criticism by forbidding the use of its name in commentaries critical of its conduct.id.
to be sure,ucs does allege that in this case the criticism is false and misleading.but while such an allegation might be relevant to a defamation claim,it is not determinative of whether ucs allegations can support a trademark claim.if the injury alleged is one of critical commentary,it falls outside trademark law,whether the criticism is warranted or unwarranted.ucs itself makes no distinction between lawful and unlawful criticism in its proposed remedy under trademark law it requests an injunction that would require lycos to permanently and irrevocably delete the ucsy message board and refrain from creat ing and maintaining a ucsy message board in the future.
ucs tries to avoid the thrust of cases like bean by characterizing lycos use of the ucsy trade name as commercial.it certainly appears from the complaint that lycos derives advertising revenues from the use of its web sites,including raging bull,and that lycos is a commercial venture.this does not imply,however,that lycos use of the ucsy trade name is commercial in the relevant sense under trademark law.in bean,the defendant had used the plaintiff trademark in a parody article published in a monthly periodical.at.we found the use noncommercial because the mark had not been used to identify or promote goods or services to consumers,id.at,regardless of whether the article appeared in a magazine being sold for profit.similarly,courts have interpreted the noncommercial use exemption in the federal trademark dilution act,c,to apply to commentary about trademarked products,even if that commentary takes the form of a commercial product,such as a song.see mattel,mca records,cir.thus,lycos might profit by encouraging others to talk about ucs under the ucsy name,but neither that speech nor lycos providing a forum for that speech is the type of use that is subject to trademark liability.
other courts have dealt with similar issues under the rubric of a nominative fair use defense.new kids on the block news am.publ g,cir.unlike a classic fair use defense,where the defendant has used the plaintiff mark to describe the defendant own product,a nominative fair use defense is designed to protect the ability of others to use a mark to describe the plaintiff product.id.thus,the ninth circuit found that a newspaper use of a musical group trademarked name to conduct a poll about the group was a nominative fair use,even though the poll was conducted for profit.see id.at.
this court has not previously decided whether to endorse the ninth circuit test for nominative fair uses,and we have no occasion to do so here.we have,however,recognized the underlying principle.in boston athletic ass n,cir,the owner of the mark boston marathon tried to enjoin the use of the mark on an unlicensed broadcast of the marathon.id.at.in rejecting a right to such an injunction,we noted 
t he words boston marathon do more than call attention to channel program they also describe the event that channel will broadcast t he use of words for descriptive purposes is called a fair use,and the law usually permits it even if the words themselves also constitute a trademark.
id.at.the unlicensed broadcaster,channel,was not asserting a right to use the mark for a different marathon located in boston it was using the mark to indicate that it was broadcasting the boston marathon.we held that it had the right to use the mark to indicate what it was in fact broadcasting.similarly here,trademark law should not prevent lycos from using the ucsy mark to indicate that a particular company is the subject of a particular message board.
while florida courts do not appear to have addressed this particular issue with respect to the florida statute,there is every indication that the florida courts would read the florida statute to exclude the uses made in this case.despite its broad language,the florida antidilution statute is not intended to apply to the use of a similar mark on similar goods,but rather only to the use of similar marks on dissimilar products.motor iron eagle of cent.lycos is not using the ucsy trade name on a product or business at all,but is simply referring to the existing company that has adopted that trade name.
it is not our role to define the specific contours of the florida law,and we do not do so here.as other courts have also found,however,laws should be interpreted to provide breathing room for first amendment concerns.see mca records,at.whether lycos use of the ucsy trade name is viewed as a noncommercial use,as a nominative use,or in some other way,we hold that using a company trade name to label a message board on which the company is discussed is not a use covered by the florida statute.as a result,we affirm the district court dismissal of ucs dilution claim for failure to state a claim.
ucs argues that its claims against lycos would not have fared so poorly had the district court given it the opportunity to conduct preliminary discovery.we review this claim for an abuse of the district court broad discretion in managing discovery,and we will not interfere unless it clearly appears that a discovery order was plainly wrong and resulted in substantial prejudice to the aggrieved party.dynamic image,united states,cir quoting mack great atl.pac.tea,cir.
at the outset,ucs may well have forfeited this point by failing to explain to the district court its need for discovery either in its opposition to the motions to dismiss or at the october,hearing on those motions.see id.ucs argues that the need for discovery was apparent from its request at the july,hearing,together with the nature of the arguments made at the october hearing,but it was not the district court job to infer an explanation from these scattered statements.
in any event,it is clear that even before this court,ucs has not pointed to any discovery that would support
