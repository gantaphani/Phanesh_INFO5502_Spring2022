wwp,wounded warrior project wwp and wounded warriors family support,wounded warriors,wounded warriors hospital fund wwfs are two distinct charities that assist injured veterans and their families.wwp alleges wwfs sowed confusion on the internet by using a website to solicit donations intended for wwp,in violation of nebraska law.after a jury trial,the district awarded wwp approximately million and entered a permanent injunction against wwfs.wwfs appeals.we dismiss in part and affirm in part.
john melia founded wwp.melia is a former green beret and member of the special forces group airborne.in,melia was a passenger in a helicopter that caught fire and exploded over the red sea off the coast of somalia.melia suffered burns over of his body.while recovering in military hospitals around the world,melia noticed that,although he was receiving medical treatment,there were gaps in the services the armed forces provided to wounded veterans.in,melia left the military.
in,as wounded veterans began returning to the united states from the afghanistan war,melia decided to help.melia just wanted to provide something simple,the things that i did have when i came back like underwear and socks and a calling card and a backpack to carry my stuff in.melia founded wwp in the basement of his virginia home and,with the donations he collected,delivered backpacks stocked with care and comfort items to nearby military hospitals.
in the ensuing years,wwp has greatly expanded its offerings to wounded veterans from the afghanistan and iraq wars.today wwp provides bedside training about veterans and social security disability benefits,an adaptive sports program,college preparatory courses,and small group combat stress counseling.in partnership with trek bicycle,which donates bicycles to disabled veterans,wwp sponsors soldier ride.
wwp employs over people and spends to of donations directly on wounded soldiers and their families.in,wwp spent million.advertising,marketing,and other public relations activities allow wwp to tell stories of wounded warriors and the way that wwp has helped them in order to drive up an interest and a public awareness about wwp cause.wwp sends over ten million mailers annually and appears on a massive amount of television and radio shows wwp has become synonymous with veteran service to this generation of wounded veterans and their families.
wwp operates two websites,and,which were first registered in january and march,respectively.in,wwp registered its now famous trademark,which depicts one soldier carrying another soldier on his back.
in,colonel john folsom founded the wounded warriors hospital fund during his military service in germany.folsom is a resident of omaha,nebraska,a marine helicopter pilot,and a veteran of operation desert storm.he is also a licensed realtor and a former stockbroker.
folsom believed the military was to help wounded soldiers returning from combat concerning morale and comfort items.in early,folsom organized small fundraising events in germany,such as brat sales,ultimately raising under the wounded warrior hospital fund moniker.folsom used the funds he raised to purchase electronic equipment,sweat suits,and chewing tobacco for wounded soldiers in germany.folsom also developed a website to solicit donations.
in,folsom incorporated wounded warriors hospital fund as wounded warriors,and started a new website.folsom contemporaneously moved the charity operations to the united states.wwfs used incoming donations to buy computers,which folsom shipped to military hospitals throughout the united states.at all relevant times,wwfs conducted little to no advertising,fundraising,or marketing,instead relying on networking and its websites to receive donations.
donations to wwfs increased dramatically upon the launch of the website.in,wwfs bought condominiums in florida and texas with the donations.wwfs offers the condominiums to wounded veterans and their families for vacations.the condominiums occupancy rate for soldiers and others staying for free is only approximately,so wwfs rents the condominiums to others at a profit when wounded veterans,their families,or wwfs employees are not staying in them.
by,melia discovered wounded warrior hospital fund on the internet.melia sent folsom an email,in which melia pointed out the two charities were engaging in similar work,but said,you in germany,i here.melia was not concerned about potential confusion between the two charities in the public eye,because he did think that we were in any way crossing each other.melia offered to help folsom in his fundraising efforts,although folsom declined.wwfs later listed wwp on its website,as one of its charities,and twice donated to wwp.
melia became concerned about confusion in,when folsom renamed his charity wounded warrior,moved its operations to the united states,and established the website.the website was very similar to wwp website.folsom changed the website color scheme and font and the text phraseology to mimic wwp website.folsom placed a disclaimer at the bottom of wwfs new homepage in a typeface with cream on white coloring.
when giving money to wwp,donors would often write checks in shorthand to wounded warriors.melia feared folsom actions would engender major confusion among potential donors.
misdirected donations 
after folsom launched the website,wwp was contacted by individuals indicating there was some confusion and that people were trying to reach wwp and instead reaching wwfs.years later,during discovery in the instant lawsuit,wwp learned wwfs was receiving and cashing a large number of checks intended for wwp.some checks were made payable to wounded warriors project other checks were accompanied by correspondence indicating support for wwp or mentioning one of wwp marketing or fundraising efforts.for example,in,wwfs received a donation for jerrod week in alaska immediately after wwp had publicized providing an alaskan rehabilitation trip for a wounded veteran named jerrod.wwfs simply cashed and deposited every check sent to wwfs address 
after subpoenaing wwfs financial records,wwp hired a forensic accountant from omaha,robert kirchner.kirchner reviewed approximately checks sent to wwfs between november,and july,roughly when wwfs operated the website.in his analysis,kirchner determined wwfs received donations intended for wwp.
to determine the amount of donations misdirected from wwp to wwfs,kirchner compared the amount of donations wwfs received immediately before and after operating the website with the amount of donations wwfs received while such website was operational.kirchner found that,in mid to,wwfs received an average of per month in donations.when the website went live,wwfs receipts spiked to per month.after wwfs shut down the website,donations immediately decreased using the more conservative latter valuation,kirchner calculated the amount of misdirected donations to be.using the former valuation,the calculated amount of misdirected donations exceeded million.
prior proceedings 
in september,wwp filed the instant lawsuit against wwfs.as relevant here,wwp amended complaint alleged three state law claims.first,wwp claimed wwfs violated the nebraska deceptive trade practices act ndtpa,by passing off its services as those of wwp causing likelihood of confusion or misunderstanding as to the source,sponsorship,approval or certification of goods or services causing likelihood of confusion or misunderstanding as to affiliation,connection or association with,or certification by,wwp disparaging the goods,services,or business of wwp by false or misleading representations of fact.second,wwp claimed wwfs violated the nebraska consumer protection act ncpa.et,insofar as wwfs use of the name wounded warriors was likely to confuse the public and thus constituted an unfair method of competition or an unfair and deceptive act or practice in the conduct of trade or commerce and was an unfair and deceptive act or practice which has occurred in trade and commerce,that impacts the public interest,which has caused injury to wwp in its business or property and which injury is causally linked to wwfs unfair and deceptive act.third,wwp claimed unjust enrichment,in violation of nebraska common law.wwp alleged wwfs knowingly received donations intended for wwp.
in july,the district court entered a preliminary injunction against wwfs.the district court held wwp was likely to succeed on its ndtpa claim and ordered wwfs to shut down the website wwfs did not appeal the entry of the preliminary injunction and shut down the website.
in september,the matter proceeded to trial on wwp ndtpa,ncpa,and unjust enrichment claims.after a trial,a jury returned verdicts in wwp favor on the ncpa and unjust enrichment claims.the jury awarded wwp on its ncpa claim for loss to wwp reputation and goodwill and on wwp unjust enrichment claim for misdirected donations.the district court entered judgment on the jury verdicts,but did not rule on wwp ndtpa claim.
the district court denied a series of motions filed by the parties,with one exception.in january,the district court granted in part wwp motion to alter or amend the judgment to the extent wwp sought entry of judgment on its ndtpa claim,and conversion of the preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction.
ii.discussion 
wwfs argues the district court erred in six respects.we consider each of wwfs arguments,in turn.
preliminary injunction 
wwfs argues the district court abused its discretion in issuing the preliminary injunction.with the entry of the permanent injunction,this portion of wwfs appeal is moot and must be dismissed.see grupo mexicano de desarrollo,alliance bond fund,generally,an appeal from the grant of a preliminary injunction becomes moot when the trial court enters a permanent injunction,because the former merges into the latter.we have dismissed appeals in such circumstances.
motion to compel 
wwfs argues the district court abused its discretion in overruling wwfs motion to compel.see duffy wolle,cir reviewing denial of motion to compel for gross abuse of discretion.we disagree.
during discovery,wwfs requested wwp produce a ll documents relating to or evidencing any donations received by wwp from january,to the present.wwp refused,and wwfs moved to compel.the district court denied wwfs motion for a number of reasons.the district court found,among other things,wwfs motion to compel was temporally overbroad because wwfs was not operating in the united states in overbroad in scope because wwfs was seeking donor information without regard to source or location unduly burdensome because wwfs was requesting production of all documents relating to tens of thousands or more of donors and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence,because wwfs had not asserted a counterclaim for unjust enrichment seeking the return of any misdirected donations.the district court concluded the discovery of some donations intended for wwfs but instead retained by wwp is not relevant to the calculation of damages here,recognizing wwp expert,kirchner,did not rely on wwp donor information in reaching his opinion regarding wwp damages.
parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party claim or defense.b.broad discovery is an important tool for the litigant,and so r elevant information need not be admissible at the trial if the discovery appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.id.that said,
the district court must limit the frequency or extent of discovery otherwise allowed if it determines that the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit,considering the needs of the case,the amount in controversy,the parties resources,the importance of the issues at stake in the action,and the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues.
id.at b c iii.
wwfs asserts wwp donation records are relevant in determining whether confusion exist ed and to what extent wwp profited from the confusion,thereby affecting kirchner damage calculation.even if we grant wwfs this premise,the district court nonetheless did not err in finding wwfs request was overly broad and unduly burdensome.wwfs request was excessively broad,and wwfs never attempted to narrow the scope of its request.see mcgowan dynamics,cir holding the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying a broad discovery request in part because the movant made no effort to limit the scope of her requests even after the trial court denial of her initial motion to compel.wwp did produce its tax returns,audited financial statements,and monthly contribution summaries to wwfs,which totaled the donations to wwp for the relevant time periods.see id.identifying other relevant evidence was available to the plaintiff,thereby justifying the denial of her broad discovery request.the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to require wwp to dump all of its donation records on wwfs.
motion in limine expert testimony 
in a motion in limine,wwfs asked the district court to bar kirchner from testifying at trial.wwfs argued kirchner testimony did not meet the helpful requirement of.and daubert merrell dow,and therefore,should be excluded.wwfs stressed kirchner made only simple mathematical calculations to arrive at his damages calculation,and his determinations with respect to misdirected donations were speculative at best,fail ed to rule out other alternative explanations,and fail ed to connect with the facts of the case.
the district court denied wwfs motion,finding kirchner relied on his experience as a forensic accountant,analyz ed a substantial amount of financial data,and applied reliable methods in forming opinions that would help the jury understand the evidence.the district court averred wwfs challenges to kirchner failure to consider and account for certain factors goes to the weight of his testimony rather than admissibility.
wwfs reasserts its arguments on appeal.wwp responds that wwfs waived its arguments by failing to renew its objections to kirchner testimony at trial.
the district court denial of wwfs motion in limine was sufficient to preserve error,see.a shelton kennedy funding,cir discussing the most recent iteration of rule a,but we hold the district court did not abuse its broad discretion in permitting kirchner testimony,see khoury philips med,cir standard of review.provides 
if scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge,skill,experience,training,or education,may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise,if the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data,the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods,and the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.
there is not,as wwfs suggests,an implicit requirement in.for the proffered expert to make complicated mathematical calculations.see in re prempro prods.liab,cir holding district court did not abuse its discretion in failing to exclude expert testimony that represented an exercise in basic math using simple deductive reasoning.forensic accountants routinely rely,surely to no one surprise,on the books and records and financial information provided.forklifts of louis,komatsu forklift,usa,cir wwfs attacks on kirchner methodology lack merit.
motion in limine preliminary injunction evidence 
wwfs argues the district court abused its discretion in allowing wwp to introduce evidence of the district court decision to enter a preliminary injunction shutting down the website.wwfs opines that,by allowing the jury to speculate as to the reasons why the district court enjoined wwfs,the district court improperly influence d the jury impartiality from the outset of trial and effectively eviscerate d wwfs constitutional right to a jury trial.wwp responds we should only review for plain error,because the first mention of the preliminary injunction and wwfs actions came without objection from folsom own testimony.
we disagree with wwp characterization of the sequence of events in the district court and will review wwfs argument under the familiar standard.wwfs filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude any
