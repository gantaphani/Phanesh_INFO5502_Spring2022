this is a patent infringement suit brought by,amazon against,and llc together,bn.amazon moved for a preliminary injunction to prohibit bn use of a feature of its web site called express lane.bn resisted the preliminary injunction on several grounds,including that its express lane feature did not infringe the claims of amazon patent,and that substantial questions exist as to the validity of amazon patent.the united states district court for the western district of washington rejected bn contentions.instead,the district court held that amazon had presented a case showing a likelihood of infringement by bn,and that bn challenges to the validity of the patent in suit lacked sufficient merit to avoid awarding extraordinary preliminary injunctive relief to amazon.the district court granted amazon motion,and now bn brings its timely appeal from the order entering the preliminary injunction.we have jurisdiction to review the district court order under c.
after careful review of the district court opinion,the record,and the arguments advanced by the parties,we conclude that bn has mounted a substantial challenge to the validity of the patent in suit.because amazon is not entitled to preliminary injunctive relief under these circumstances,we vacate the order of the district court that set the preliminary injunction in place and remand the case for further proceedings.
this case involves united states patent the patent,which issued on september,and is assigned to amazon.on october,amazon brought suit against bn alleging infringement of the patent and seeking a preliminary injunction.
amazon patent is directed to a method and system for single action ordering of items in a environment such as the internet.in the context of the patent,a environment describes the relationship between two computer systems in which a program executing on a client computer system makes a service request from another program executing on a server computer system,which fulfills the request.see,ll,ll,to.typically,the client computer system and the server computer system are located remotely from each other and communicate via a data communication network.
the patent describes a method and system in which a consumer can complete a purchase order for an item via an electronic network using only a single action,such as the click of a computer mouse button on the client computer system.amazon developed the patent to cope with what it considered to be frustrations presented by what is known as the shopping cart model purchase system for electronic commerce purchasing events.in previous incarnations of the shopping cart model,a purchaser using a client computer system such as a personal computer executing a web browser program could select an item from an electronic catalog,typically by clicking on an add to shopping cart icon,thereby placing the item in the virtual shopping cart.other items from the catalog could be added to the shopping cart in the same manner.when the shopper completed the selecting process,the electronic commercial event would move to the counter,so to speak.then,information regarding the purchaser identity,billing and shipping addresses,and credit payment method would be inserted into the transactional information base by the purchaser.finally,the purchaser would click on a button displayed on the screen or somehow issue a command to execute the completed order,and the server computer system would verify and store the information concerning the transaction.
as is evident from the foregoing,an electronic commerce purchaser using the shopping cart model is required to perform several actions before achieving the ultimate goal of the placed order.the patent sought to reduce the number of actions required from a consumer to effect a placed order.in the words of the written description of the patent 
the present invention provides a method and system for ordering of items in a environment.the ordering system of the present invention reduces the number of purchaser interactions needed to place an order and reduces the amount of sensitive information that is transmitted between a client system and a server system.
ll.how,one may ask,is the number of purchaser interactions reduced the answer is that the number of purchaser interactions is reduced because the purchaser has previously visited the seller web site and has previously entered into the database of the seller all of the required billing and shipping information that is needed to effect a sales transaction.thereafter,when the purchaser visits the seller web site and wishes to purchase a product from that site,the patent specifies that only a single action is necessary to place the order for the item.in the words of the written description,once the description of an item is displayed,the purchaser need only take a single action to place the order to purchase that item,ll.
the patent has claims,of which are independent.independent claims and are method claims directed to placing an order for an item,while independent claim is an apparatus claim directed to a client system for ordering an item,and independent claim is an apparatus claim directed to a server system for generating an order.amazon asserted claims,and against bn.although there are significant differences among the various independent and dependent claims in issue,for purposes of this appeal we may initially direct our primary focus on the single action limitation that is included in each claim.this focus is appropriate because bn appeal attacks the injunction on the grounds that either its accused method does not infringe the single action limitation present in all of the claims,that the single action feature of the patent is invalid,or both.
we set forth below the text of the claims pertinent to our deliberations,claims,and,with emphasis added to highlight the disputed claim terms 
a method of placing an order for an item comprising 
under control of a client system,
displaying information identifying the item and in response to only a single action being performed,sending a request to order the item along with an identifier of a purchaser of the item to a server system under control of a ordering component of the server system,receiving the request retrieving additional information previously stored for the purchaser identified by the identifier in the received request and generating an order to purchase the requested item for the purchaser identified by the identifier in the received request using the retrieved additional information and fulfilling the generated order to complete purchase of the item whereby the item is ordered without using a shopping cart ordering model.
the method of claim wherein the displaying of information includes displaying information indicating the single action.
a client system for ordering an item comprising an identifier that identifies a customer a display component for displaying information identifying the item 
a ordering component that in response to performance of only a single action,sends a request to a server system to order the identified item,the request including the identifier so that the server system can locate additional information needed to complete the order and so that the server system can fulfill the generated order to complete purchase of the item and 
a shopping cart ordering component that in response to performance of an action,sends a request to the server system to add the item to a shopping cart.
a server system for generating an order comprising 
a shopping cart ordering component and 
a ordering component including 
a data storage medium storing information for a plurality of users 
a receiving component for receiving requests to order an item,a request including an indication of one of the plurality of users,the request being sent in response to only a single action being performed and 
an order placement component that retrieves from the data storage medium information for the indicated user and that uses the retrieved information to place an order for the indicated user for the item and an order fulfillment component that completes a purchase of the item in accordance with the order placed by the ordering component.
a method for ordering an item using a client system,the method comprising 
displaying information identifying the item and displaying an indication of a single action that is to be performed to order the identified item and 
in response to only the indicated single action being performed,sending to a server system a request to order the identified item 
whereby the item is ordered independently of a shopping cart model and the order is fulfilled to complete a purchase of the item.
the district court interpreted the key single action claim limitation,which appears in each of the pertinent claims,to mean 
the term single action is not defined by the patent specification as a result,the term single action as used in the patent appears to refer to one action such as clicking a mouse button that a user takes to purchase an item once the following information is displayed to the user a description of the item and a description of the single action the user must take to complete a purchase order for that item.
with this interpretation of the key claim limitation in hand,the district court turned to bn accused ordering system.bn ordering system,called express lane,like the system contemplated by the patent,contains previously entered billing and shipping information for the customer.in one implementation,after a person is presented with bn initial web page referred to as the menu page or home page,the person can click on an icon on the menu page to get to what is called the product page.bn product page displays an image and a description of the selected product,and also presents the person with a description of a single action that can be taken to complete a purchase order for the item.if the single action described is taken,for example by a mouse click,the person will have effected a purchase order using bn express lane feature.
bn express lane thus presents a product page that contains the description of the item to be purchased and a description of the single action to be taken to effect placement of the order.because only a single action need be taken to complete the purchase order once the product page is displayed,the district court concluded that amazon had made a showing of likelihood of success on its allegation of patent infringement.
in response to bn contention that substantial questions exist as to the validity of the patent,the district court reviewed the prior art references upon which bn validity challenge rested.the district court concluded that none of the prior art references anticipated the claims of the patent under or rendered the claimed invention obvious under.
the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction under is within the sound discretion of the district court.novo nordisk of,genentech.an abuse of discretion may be established by showing that the court made a clear error of judgment in weighing relevant factors or exercised its discretion based upon an error of law or clearly erroneous factual findings.id.

our case law and logic both require that a movant can not be granted a preliminary injunction unless it establishes both of the first two factors,likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm.vehicular techs.titan wheel int l,citing reebok int l,at,at.
in order to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits,amazon must show that,in light of the presumptions and burdens that will inhere at trial on the merits,amazon will likely prove that bn infringes the patent,and amazon infringement claim will likely withstand bn challenges to the validity and enforceability of the patent.genentech,novo nordisk.if bn raises a substantial question concerning either infringement or validity,asserts an infringement or invalidity defense that the patentee can not prove lacks substantial merit,the preliminary injunction should not issue.id.
of course,whether performed at the preliminary injunction stage or at some later stage in the course of a particular case,infringement and validity analyses must be performed on a basis.see,bayer ag elan pharm.research,literal infringement requires the patentee to prove that the accused device contains each limitation of the asserted claim s.citations omitted ortho pharm.smith,concluding that all grounds of invalidity must be evaluated against individual claims,as required by the plain language of.therefore,in cases involving multiple patent claims,to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits,the patentee must demonstrate that it will likely prove infringement of one or more claims of the,and that at least one of those same allegedly infringed claims will also likely withstand the validity challenges presented by the accused infringer.
both infringement and validity are at issue in this appeal.it is well settled that an infringement analysis involves two steps the claim scope is first determined,and then the properly construed claim is compared with the accused device to determine whether all of the claim limitations are present either literally or by a substantial equivalent.see,young dental special.conceptually,the first step of an invalidity analysis based on anticipation obviousness in view of prior art references is no different from that of an infringement analysis.it is elementary in patent law that,in determining whether a patent is valid and,if valid,infringed,the first step is to determine the meaning and scope of each claim in suit.lemelson mills.a claim must be construed before determining its validity just as it is first construed before deciding infringement.markman westview instruments,mayer,concurring,aff,d.
only when a claim is properly understood can a determination be made whether the claim reads on an accused device or method,or whether the prior art anticipates renders obvious the claimed invention.see id.because the claims of a patent measure the invention at issue,the claims must be interpreted and given the same meaning for purposes of both validity and infringement analyses.see smithkline diagnostics,helena labs.a patent may not,like a nose of wax,be twisted one way to avoid anticipation and another to find infringement.sterner lighting,allied supply,cir citing white dunbar.the court must properly interpret the claims,because an improper claim construction may distort the infringement and validity analyses.see bausch lomb,uspq.
bn contends on appeal that the district court committed legal errors that undermine the legitimacy of the preliminary injunction.in particular,bn asserts that the district court construed key claim limitations one way for purposes of its infringement analysis,and another way when considering bn validity challenges.bn asserts that under a consistent claim interpretation,its express lane feature either does not infringe the patent,or that if the patent is interpreted so as to support the charge of infringement,then the claims of the patent are subject to a severe validity challenge.when the key claim limitations are properly interpreted,bn thus asserts,it will be clear that amazon is not likely to succeed on the merits of its infringement claim,or that bn has succeeded in calling the validity of the patent into serious question.in addition,bn asserts that the district court misunderstood the teaching of the prior art references,thereby committing clear error in the factual predicates it established for comprehension of the prior art references.
amazon understandably aligns itself with the district court,asserting that no error of claim interpretation and no clear error in has occurred that would undermine the grant of the preliminary injunction.we thus turn to the legal gist of this appeal.
it is clear from the district court opinion that the meaning it ascribed to the single action limitation includes a temporal consideration.the single action to be taken to complete the purchase order,according to the district court,only occurs after other events have transpired.these preliminary events required pursuant to the district court claim interpretation are the presentation of a description of the item to be purchased and the presentation of the single action the user must take to complete the purchase order for the item.
amazon defends this temporal interpretation based on statements made by the applicant during prosecution of the patent.these statements,set forth below,are significant,because they were made at the point in the file history where the claims were amended to include the single action limitation.
in remarks accompanying an amendment dated february,amazon provided the following comments not limited to specific claims to explain proposed amendments to the claims and to clarify that the claimed ordering technology is different from the shopping cart metaphor 
applicants single action ordering technology facilitates electronic ordering of items by reducing the number of purchaser interactions needed to place an order and reducing the amount of sensitive information that is transmitted between a client computer and a server computer when placing an order.to order an item using ordering technology,the purchaser first locates the item by browsing through a catalog of items,by searching for the item,by selecting a link to the item,or by using any other means for locating the item.once the item is located,the purchaser need only perform a single action to generate an order for the item and to fulfill that generated order.the single action may be,for example,the selecting of a button that is displayed on the web page or the speaking of a command.because information,billing and shipping about the purchaser has been saved,from a previous purchase,that information can be combined with the identification of the located item to generate and fulfill an order when the single action is performed.
on its face,this passage from the file history establishes that once a purchaser has located an item by any means,only a single action is required to generate an order for the item.amazon,however,would put a special reading on the concept of a purchaser locating an item by any means.in amazon view of the file history,a purchaser has not located the item,for the purpose of counting the number of steps thereafter to generate the order,until the purchaser has made the decision to purchase the item.as applied to the present case,amazon argues that display of information about an item on bn menu page does not indicate an item located with an intent to place the order only after one moves from bn menu page to its product page has one located the item for purposes of placing the order by a single action.since it only takes a single action on bn product page to place the order,amazon contends that bn likely infringes the patent.
amazon reading of the key passage from the file history injects subjective notions into the infringement analysis.for example,if a purchaser has made the decision to purchase an item before coming to bn menu page,and there the purchaser sees the item displayed,amazon would have to concede that no single action taken after the item display would achieve placement of the order.instead,the purchaser would need to take a first action to advance from the menu page to the product page,and then a second action to place the order.we are not prepared to assign a meaning to a patent claim that depends on the state of mind of the accused infringer.we thus reject amazon special meaning for the location of an item to be purchased.
however,as we now discuss in detail,we ultimately agree with amazon and construe all four independent claims,claims,and to call for the single action to be performed immediately after a display of information about an item and without any intervening action,but not necessarily immediately after the first display or every display.
our analysis begins with the plain language of the claims themselves.the term single action appears in the independent claims of the patent in the following forms in response to only a single action being performed claims and,ordering component claims,and,in response to performance of only a single action claim,in response to only the indicated single action being performed claim,and displaying an indication of a single action that is to be performed to order the identified item claim.
in claims,and,the context of the claim makes it clear that the single action is performed after some information about the item is displayed.claim provides for displaying information identifying the item,and then immediately recites that in response to only a single action being performed,a request to purchase the item is sent to a server system.claim provides for a display component for displaying information identifying the item,and then immediately recites the single action ordering component that in response to performance of only a single action sends a request to purchase the item to a server system.claim provides for displaying information identifying the item and displaying an indication of the single action,and then immediately recites that in response to only the indicated single action being performed a request to purchase the item is sent to a server system.the context also indicates that the single action is performed,or is capable of being performed,after information about the item is displayed,without any intervening action.nothing suggests,however,that the single action must be performed after every display or even immediately after the first display of information.claim does not explicitly provide for displaying information.it merely recites that a request to order an item is sent in response to only a single action being performed.however,although claim does not recite displaying,the written description defines the claim language of single action being performed to require that information has been displayed.
the ordinary meaning of single action as used in the various claims is straightforward,but the phrase alone does not indicate when to start counting actions.therefore,we must look first to the written description of the patent for further guidance.
the written description supports a construction that after information is displayed,ordering is an option available to the user,and the counting falls within the scope of the claim when ordering is actually selected by the user.to the extent that the claims are considered ambiguous on this point,the written description defines single action to require as much.in the summary of the invention,the written description describes an embodiment that displays information that identifies the item and displays an indication of an action and i n response to the indicated action being performed orders the item,ll.similarly,in the detailed description of the invention,the written description states that o nce the description of an item is displayed,the purchaser need only take a single action,ll.this is consistent for all of the disclosed embodiments.
therefore,neither the written description nor the plain meaning of the claims require that single action ordering be possible after each and every display of information or even immediately after the first display of information.the plain language of the claims and the written description require only that single action ordering be possible after some display of information.indeed,the written description allows for and suggests the possibility that previous displays of information will have occurred before the display immediately preceding an order.
the detailed description of the invention describes the first figure by stating that this example web page containing a summary description of the item was sent when the purchaser requested to review detailed information about the item,ll.emphasis added.given that the written description earlier described purchasing as involving browsing,it is reasonable to conclude that some less detailed information about the item has already been displayed.
this passage also allows for the possibility that the purchaser sees a display of the less detailed information on an item,decides to browse elsewhere,then ultimately returns to obtain more detailed information on the item and to finally order it.thus,there could be intermittent displays of information on an item,in addition to successive displays of information on an item,and each and every display need not have single action ordering capability.
the above passages indicate that the written description is not concerned with what happens on every display of information,or even immediately after the first display,but only that there be some display from which single action ordering can be performed.
the prosecution history of the patent also supports the above claim construction.in response to an office action,in the passage from the prosecution history cited earlier in this opinion,the patentee stated a purchaser first locates the item by browsing through a catalog of items,by searching for the item,by selecting a link to the item,or by using any other means for locating the item.once the item is located,the purchaser need only perform a single action to generate an order enumeration added.this enumeration of the various ways an item may be located allows for information on the item to be displayed prior to single action ordering being enabled.this is seen most clearly in the third enumerated method,selecting a link to the item.if it is to serve as a link to the item emphasis added,then there must be some display of information on the item either in the link or around the link.thus,information on the item may sometimes be displayed before locating the item and,hence,before single action ordering is enabled.
likewise,the first enumerated method browsing is explained in the written description to entail requesting detailed information about an item before single action ordering is enabled.this presumes that or general information was previously displayed.similarly,the second enumerated method searching commonly entails first displaying information on various items that match a search string,such as a list of all books written by a particular author or dealing with a particular subject.the purchaser than typically selects one of these items to receive more detailed information,at which point the selected item is presumably located and single action ordering is enabled.
when the correct meaning of the single action limitation is read on the accused bn system,it becomes apparent that the limitations of claim are likely met by the accused system.the evidence on the record concerning the operation of bn express lane feature is not in dispute.at the time that the patent was issued,bn offered customers two purchasing options.one was called shopping cart,and the other was called express lane.the shopping cart option involved the steps of adding items to a virtual shopping cart and then checking out to complete the purchase.in contrast,the express lane option allowed customers who had registered for the feature to purchase items simply by clicking on the express lane button provided on the detail page or product page describing and identifying the book or other item to be purchased.the text beneath the express lane button invited users to buy it now with just click 
bn allegedly infringing web site thus may be characterized as having page,the menu page which displays a catalog listing several items but which does not contain an order icon,and page,the product or detail page which includes information on one item and also shows an order icon.someone shopping at this web site would look at the catalog on page and perform a first click to go to page.once at page,a second click on the ordering icon would cause the order request to be sent.under the claim construction set forth herein,bn likely infringes claim because on page,the item is there displayed meeting step of the claim and only a single action thereafter causes the order request to be transmitted meeting step.the method implemented on page of the bn web site does not infringe,but the method on page does.this has nothing to do with the state of mind of the purchaser,but simply reflects the ordinary meaning of the words of the claim in the context of the written description and in light of the prosecution history.
we recognize that under this construction,claim would appear to read on the prior art shopping cart model because the final page of a shopping cart model both displays the item to be purchased in a list of selected products and sends the order request signal in response to the single next action of clicking on the confirm purchase icon.however,the shopping cart model is expressly excluded from claim by the whereby clause at the end of the claim.
we note that the district court concluded that b infringes claims,and,and also infringes claims of the patent.however,the relevant determination at the preliminary injunction stage is substantial likelihood of success by amazon of its infringement claims,not a legal conclusion as to the ultimate issue of infringement.we therefore interpret the district court conclusions as determining that amazon had demonstrated a substantial likelihood of establishing literal infringement of the enumerated claims.
according to the plain language of claim,the point of reference from which to start counting clicks does not begin until information indicating the single action to be performed is displayed,when the express lane or buy now button is displayed.amazon is thus correct in its assertion that only a single action is required after that point to send a request to order an item using bn express lane feature.for this reason,we can not say that bn raised a substantial question of noninfringement of claim in the patent with respect to the single action limitation at this stage in the litigation.
we point out that bn mounted an additional noninfringement argument with respect to claims,and based on the term shopping cart model in the whereby clause of those claims.claims and require that the item be ordered without using a shopping cart model.similarly,claim requires that the item be ordered independently of a shopping cart model.thus,according to bn,even if an ordering system accused of infringement used the claimed single action technology,it would still not infringe claims,or so long as the single action technology was used within the paradigm of a shopping cart model.
accordingly,bn argues that,even if its express lane feature is said to use single action technology within the scope of the claims in the patent,the express lane feature is nevertheless a shopping cart model because,according to the written description,shopping cart model should be construed to include models in which checkout happens automatically when an item is selected for purchase.in fact,the written description of the patent does mention alternative prior art shopping cart models having the feature that when a purchaser selects any one item,then that item is checked out by automatically prompting the user for the billing and shipment information,ll.thus,bn argues that its express lane system does not infringe because it is an embodiment of such an alternative shopping cart model admitted to be prior art in the written description of the patent.
the district court construed shopping cart model to mean a method for ordering in which a user selects and accumulates items to be purchased while browsing a merchant site and then must proceed to one or more checkout or confirmation steps in order to complete the purchase.bn argues that this interpretation contradicts the written description of the patent because it allegedly excludes the alternative shopping cart models mentioned in the written description.however,we discern no error with the district court interpretation of shopping cart model,because it is consistent with the written description and with the comments made by amazon discussing the term during prosecution of the patent,as discussed earlier with reference to the single action limitation.the district court interpretation does not improperly exclude the alternative shopping cart models mentioned by bn,because although an item may be checked out automatically when using these alternative shopping cart models,the written description states that the user must still provide billing and shipping information unless the information is with information that was provided by the user when placing a previous order.additionally,regardless of whether the order information is or not,the user must still perform at least one confirmation step once the purchaser is presented with the order web page to complete the purchase.see,ll.it follows,then,that bn noninfringement argument based on characterizing its express lane feature as a shopping cart model fails because once a purchaser clicks on the express lane ordering button,no additional checkout or confirmation steps are required before a request to order the item is sent to the server system.
having considered and rejected bn alternative noninfringement arguments,we find that amazon has carried its merits burden with respect to likely infringement of claim.we note there is some redundancy between claims and under the claim interpretation set forth herein.however,the two claims are not identical in scope.for example,claim would not read on a method where the first page of a web site includes a textual message such as click directly on the picture of any item displayed on any of the following pages to place an order.under such a method,there would never be a page where both the item and the single action to be taken to order the item would be displayed.claim would not be infringed by such a system,but claim would.
we note further that amazon has also made out its likelihood of success case with respect to infringement of claim.claim is similar to claim because it also includes the limitation requiring displaying an indication of a single action that is to be performed.for the reasons noted above with respect to claim,the district court was correct in concluding that bn had not raised a substantial question of noninfringement regarding claim.
in view of our interpretation of single action,we find that the district court correctly concluded that bn had not raised a substantial question of noninfringement regarding claims and with respect to the single action limitation.
however,we note that bn also mounted an additional noninfringement argument with respect to claims and based on the terms fulfill and fulfillment in those claims.claim requires that the server system have the capability to fulfill the generated order to complete purchase of the item.similarly,claim requires that the single action ordering component of the server system must include an order fulfillment component that completes a purchase of the item.bn argues that fulfill and fulfillment refer to all of the steps required to pick the product from a warehouse shelf,pack it for shipment,and ship it to the customer.presumably,bn believes that such an interpretation would lead to noninfringement of claims and,at least under a theory of direct infringement.
the district court ruled that the various forms of fulfill throughout the claims refer to order fulfillment application software executing on the server system,as opposed to the physical steps of handling or packing tangible items.we discern no error with this interpretation.as bn admits,the plain language of claims and require that the fulfillment steps be capable of being performed by the server system as in claim and that the order fulfillment component be part of the server system as in claim.obviously a server system,as the term is used in the patent to refer to a computer system see,ll,is incapable of picking a product from a warehouse shelf,packing it for shipment,and shipping it to the customer.therefore the terms fulfill and its cognates are properly limited to refer to order fulfillment application software executed on the server system.
after full review of the record before us,we conclude that under a proper claim interpretation,amazon has made the showing that it is likely to succeed at trial on its infringement case.given that we conclude that amazon has demonstrated likely literal infringement of at least the four independent claims in the patent,we need not consider infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.the question remaining,however,is whether the district court correctly determined that bn failed to mount a substantial challenge to the validity of the claims in the patent.
the district court considered,but ultimately rejected,the potentially invalidating impact of several prior art references cited by bn.because the district court determined that bn likely infringed all of the asserted claims,it did not focus its analysis of the validity issue on any particular claim.instead,in its validity analysis,the district court appears to have primarily directed its attention to determining whether the references cited by bn implemented the single action limitation.
at the preliminary injunction stage of the litigation,the district court sits to deliver an equitable determination,and issues of fact naturally play into the final judgment of the district court.for example,in an invalidity analysis,the district court must assess the meaning of the prior art references cited to support the validity challenge.however,what a reference teaches is a question of fact.in re beattie.consequently,the district court necessarily makes,explicitly or implicitly,concerning the meaning of the asserted references.on the basis of the district court reading of the references,it makes judgments as to the validity of the patent in suit.we review the district court assessment of the prior art references for clear error.see novo nordisk,at,at stating that an abuse of discretion in granting a preliminary injunction may be established by showing that the court made a clear error of judgment in weighing relevant factors or exercised its discretion based upon an error of law or clearly erroneous factual findings.
in this case,we find that the district court committed clear error by misreading the factual content of the prior art references cited by bn and by failing to recognize that bn had raised a substantial question of invalidity of the asserted claims in view of these prior art references.
validity challenges during preliminary injunction proceedings can be successful,that is,they may raise substantial questions of invalidity,on evidence that would not suffice to support a judgment of invalidity at trial.see,helifix,holding that the allegedly anticipatory prior art references sufficiently raised a question of invalidity to deny a preliminary injunction,even though summary judgment of anticipation based on the same references was not supported.the test for invalidity at trial is by evidence that is clear and convincing.wms gaming,int l game.to succeed with a summary judgment motion of invalidity,for example,the movant must demonstrate a lack of genuine dispute about material facts and show that the facts not in dispute are clear and convincing in demonstrating invalidity.robotic vision,view eng g.in resisting a preliminary injunction,however,one need not make out a case of actual invalidity.vulnerability is the issue at the preliminary injunction stage,while validity is the issue at trial.the showing of a substantial question as to invalidity thus requires less proof than the clear and convincing showing necessary to establish invalidity itself.that this is so is plain from our cases.
when moving for the extraordinary relief of a preliminary injunction,a patentee need not establish the validity of a patent beyond question.atlas powder ireco,uspq.the patentee must,however,present a clear case supporting the validity of the patent in suit.see nutrition united states.such a case might be supported,for example,by showing that the patent in suit had successfully withstood previous validity challenges in other proceedings.further support for such a clear case might come from a long period of industry acquiescence in the patent validity.see donald chisum,chisum on patents c,at to citing cases.neither of those considerations benefit amazon in this case,however,because the patent has yet to be tested by trial,and it was issued only a few weeks before the start of this litigation.
in helifix,we recently confronted the situation in which a district court had granted a motion of summary judgment of invalidity based on allegedly anticipatory prior art references,and shortly thereafter denied a motion for a preliminary injunction based on a validity challenge using the same prior art references.at,at.on appeal,the patentee sought reversal of the summary judgment and claimed entitlement to a preliminary injunction.we held that the summary judgment could not stand,because disputed issues of material fact on invalidity remained for resolution at trial.id.at.nonetheless,we expressly held that the quantum of evidence put falling short of demonstrating invalidity sufficient to prevent issuance of the preliminary injunction.id.particularly instructive for purposes of this case is the treatment of the anticipation issue in helifix.a particular reference which did not on its face disclose all the limitations of the claim in suit was argued to be anticipatory,even though there was a conflict in the testimony as to whether the reference would have taught one of ordinary skill in the art the claim limitations not expressly stated on the face of the reference.although insufficient to demonstrate invalidity for the purposes of the summary judgment motion,the reference was enough to prevent issuance of the preliminary injunction.id.at,at.
the situation before us is similar.here,we have several references that were urged upon the court as invalidating the asserted claims.the district court dismissed those references,for purposes of its invalidity analysis,because it did not perceive them to recite each and every limitation of the claims in suit.as we explain below in our review of the asserted prior art in this case,each of the asserted references clearly teaches key limitations of the claims of the patent in suit.bn argued to the district court that one of ordinary skill in the art could fill in the gaps in the asserted references,given the opportunity to do so at trial.
when the heft of the asserted prior art is assessed in light of the correct legal standards,we conclude that bn has mounted a serious challenge to the validity of amazon patent.we hasten to add,however,that this conclusion only undermines the prerequisite for entry of a preliminary injunction.our decision today on the validity issue in no way resolves the ultimate question of invalidity.that is a matter for resolution at trial.it remains to be learned whether there are other references that may be cited against the patent,and it surely remains to be learned whether any shortcomings in bn initial preliminary validity challenge will be magnified or dissipated at trial.all we hold,in the meantime,is that bn cast enough doubt on the validity of the patent to avoid a preliminary injunction,and that the validity issue should be resolved finally at trial.
one of the references cited by bn was the compuserve trend system.the undisputed evidence indicates that in the,compuserve offered a service called trend whereby compuserve subscribers could obtain stock charts for a surcharge of cents per chart.before the district court,bn argued that this system anticipated claim of the patent.the district court failed to recognize the substantial question of invalidity raised by bn in citing the compuserve trend reference,in that this system appears to have used single action ordering technology within the scope of the claims in the patent.
first,the district court dismissed the significance of this system partly on the basis that t he compuserve system was not a world wide web application.this distinction is irrelevant,since none of the claims mention either the internet or the world wide web with the possible exception of dependent claim,which mentions html,a program commonly associated with both the internet and the world wide web.moreover,the patent specification explicitly notes that o ne skilled in the art would appreciate that the ordering techniques can be used in various environments other than the internet,ll.
more importantly,one of the screen shots in the record reproduced below indicates that with the compuserve trend system,once the item to be purchased,a stock chart has been displayed by typing in a valid stock symbol,only a single action,a single mouse click on the button labeled c hart is required to obtain immediate electronic delivery,fulfillment of the item.once the button labeled c hart was activated by a purchaser,an electronic version of the requested stock chart would be transmitted to the purchaser and displayed on the purchaser computer screen,and an automatic process to charge the purchaser account cents for the transaction would be initiated.in terms of the language of claims and in the compuserve trend system,the item to be ordered is displayed when the screen echoes back the characters of the stock symbol typed in by the purchaser before clicking on the ordering button.
the evidence before us indicates that the billing process for the electronic stock chart would not actually commence until the client system sent a message to the server system indicating that the electronic stock chart had been received at the client system.in its brief,amazon argues that this feature of the compuserve trend system amounts to an additional confirmation step necessary to complete the ordering process,and that the compuserve trend system therefore does not use single action technology within the scope of the claims in the patent.however,all of the claims only require sending a request to order an item in response to performance of only a single action.in the compuserve trend system,this requirement is satisfied when a purchaser performs the single action of clicking on the button labeled c hart.the claims do not require that the billing process for the item must also be initiated in response to performance of the single action.furthermore,in the compuserve trend system,the action of sending a message from the client system to the server system confirming successful reception of the electronic stock chart is performed automatically,without user intervention.
at oral argument,amazon counsel articulated three differences between the compuserve trend system and the claimed invention.first,amazon counsel repeated the district court reasoning,and asserted that the compuserve trend system is not on the internet or the world wide web.as mentioned above,the patent specification indicates that this distinction is irrelevant.
second,amazon counsel claimed that the compuserve trend system was different from the claims of the patent because it required a user to log in at the beginning of each session,and therefore would not send the claimed identifier along with a request to purchase each item.however,claim does not require transmission of an identifier along with a request to order an item.this requirement is found only in claims,and,and their respective dependent claims.
on its face,the compuserve trend reference does not mention transmission of the claimed identifier along with a request to purchase each item.nor does the evidence in the record at this stage indicate that the compuserve trend system transmitted such an identifier.bn has therefore not demonstrated that the compuserve trend reference anticipates the asserted claims of the patent requiring transmission of such an identifier with the degree of precision necessary to obtain summary judgment on this point.however,as noted above,validity challenges during preliminary injunction proceedings can be successful on evidence that would not suffice to support a judgm
