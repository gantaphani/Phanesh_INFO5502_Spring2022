rakesh dhingra appeals his conviction on one count of using the internet to solicit sexual activity from a minor,in violation of b.on appeal,dhingra raises a host of constitutional challenges.we conclude that b is not facially unconstitutional as overbroad and vague,nor does it violate the first and tenth amendments for incorporating state criminal sexual offense statutes.we are also unpersuaded by dhingra multiple evidentiary and sentencing challenges.accordingly,we affirm dhingra conviction and sentence.
background 
factual background 
in early july,rakesh dhingra contacted the victim,then a girl,using the america online instant messenger service im dhingra sent the girl an instant message after seeing her personal homepage,in which she referenced her age and a sexual experience she had during her freshman year of high school,the prior academic year.the victim recalled that,in their first conversation,the two discussed their ages and locations.
a few days later,dhingra again contacted the girl over im.in this conversation,dhingra asked for explicit details about the sexual experience recounted on the girl homepage,inquiring,u hand jobbed him put in mouth but he fingered you did he insert inside you dhingra then attempted to arrange a meeting with the girl for that evening.during the same conversation,the victim stated that she will only be,to which dhingra,who was years old at the time,replied,age is only a number.dhingra represented to the minor that he was years of age,and later attempted to downplay their age difference,stating,i look.
over the next four days,dhingra and the girl engaged in extensive im conversations revolving around sexual topics.during these exchanges,dhingra repeatedly urged the girl to sneak away to meet him or allow him to visit at her parents house.in an effort to gain her trust,dhingra assured he wanted hugs and kisses and no sex here.at least not on the first meetings.later in the same conversation,dhingra asked the girl if she would perform oral sex on him,saying that he had changed his mind about limiting their physical contact and remarking that the victim seem ed willing and flexible.
dhingra suggestions of sexual contact were unhindered by his knowledge of the victim age.the girl explicitly stated on multiple occasions that she was only years old,and dhingra made multiple references to her age.at one point,dhingra lamented that the girl should have been born when her mother was years old rather than years old so u could be now.when the girl expressed trepidation over meeting a stranger and the danger of being kidnapped,dhingra replied that he should be more afraid than you cause you are a teen.as the conversations progressed,the two discussed in increasingly explicit terms the sex acts they planned to perform on each other when they met in person.
dhingra and the victim also exchanged a series of.in multiple messages,dhingra told the girl i love you,and,in one message,the girl stated,i ca wait until i am in your arms and i can hear your voice.the girl sent a graphic description of a sexual encounter,at the end of which she wrote,i not saying all that will you do i hope i woke you up dhingra replied,hope this happens are we meeting tonite 
dhingra and the girl finally arranged to meet at a local community college.during their encounter,dhingra fondled her beneath her clothing and later placed her hand on his penis.the two then proceeded into his automobile,where they further engaged in sexual activity.after the incident,the girl sought help from a friend and one of her teachers,who subsequently informed law enforcement officials of the events.
procedural background 
the government indicted dhingra for one count of using a means of interstate commerce to entice a minor into engaging in sexual activity in violation of b the indictment specified that dhingra induced the minor to engage in lewd or lascivious conduct as would constitute a criminal offense under california penal code c,which criminalizes sexual contact between a victim or years of age and someone ten or more years older dhingra filed a motion to dismiss the indictment,alleging that b is facially unconstitutional under the first,fifth,and tenth amendments.the district court denied the motion to dismiss,and dhingra proceeded to trial.at trial,dhingra advanced the theory that it was the minor who induced him into sexual contact,and that he was therefore not guilty of inducement,enticement,persuasion,or coercion as defined by b.dhingra was found guilty by a jury and was sentenced to months custody and three years probation.dhingra now appeals his conviction and sentence.
fifth amendment vagueness challenge 
section b imposes criminal liability on a person who knowingly persuades,induces,entices,or coerces any individual who has not attained the age of years,to engage in prostitution or any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense,or attempts to do so.dhingra alleges that his conviction violates the due process clause of the fifth amendment because the statute allegedly requires the minor to engage in criminal sexual activity,thereby making it unclear whether culpability is contingent on the minor actions or those of the defendant.see united states adams,cir explaining that a statute is void for vagueness if it fails to give adequate notice to people of ordinary intelligence concerning the conduct it proscribes.
dhingra reading of the statute defies the ordinary understanding of the statutory language and introduces vagueness where there is none.the plain language of the statute makes clear that the relevant inquiry is the conduct of the defendant,not the minor.the conduct that the statute criminalizes is persuading,inducing,enticing,or coercing illegal sexual of the defendant alone.an individual of ordinary intelligence would have no doubt that criminal liability does not depend on whether the minor actually engaged in criminal sexual activity,but rather whether the defendant sought such sexual activity from a minor 
first amendment overbreadth challenge 
in asserting a facial challenge to b,dhingra does not dispute that the first amendment excludes from its ambit the persuasion or inducement of minors for sexual activity rather,dhingra alleges that b is not a specific and narrowly tailored regulation of content and,as a result,chills the legitimate speech of others.in short,he argues that the content of the speech is the crime.
this view of the b regulates speech rather than foreclosed by our recent decision in united states meek,cir.in rejecting an challenge to the statute,we held in meek that b regulates conduct,not speech no otherwise legitimate speech is jeopardized by b because the statute only criminalizes conduct,the targeted inducement of minors for illegal sexual activity and that speech is merely the vehicle through which a pedophile ensnares the victim.id.at.we also held that b does not chill legitimate speech because the scienter and intent requirements of the statute sufficiently limit criminal culpability to reach only conduct outside the protection of the first amendment.id.at.dhingra argument that b is a regulation of speech is therefore misplaced.
dhingra attempts to draw an analogy between b and reno aclu,arguing that b is unconstitutionally vague because it does not define the terms persuade,induce,entice,or coerce.we disagree.the communications decency act cda provisions rejected in reno differ from b in significant respects.the supreme court in reno objected to the statute failure to define the terms indecent and patently offensive,contained respectively in a b ii and d b.by virtue of the ambiguity,these terms effectively included material with serious educational or other value.reno,at.thus,a parent who discusses sexual health issues with her teenage child could have been subject to prosecution under the cda provision because,under the cda amorphous definition,such a discussion might be deemed indecent.id.at.
in contrast,the terms persuade,induce,entice,and coerce,as used in b,have a plain and ordinary meaning that does not need further technical explanation.more important to our analysis,lack of definitions for these terms poses no danger of chilling legitimate speech.the statute intent provision,coupled with the requirement that the purpose of the conduct must be for criminal sexual activity,sufficiently excludes legitimate activity,including speech,from its scope.meek,at.thus,to use the example from reno,a parent who counsels her minor child about sexual health would not fall within the ambit of b because she did not persuade,induce,entice,or coerce her child to engage in illegal sexual conduct.
dhingra claims that the planned parenthood organization could be prosecuted under b for giving teenagers information over the internet about birth control and safe sex.pointing to the organization website,dhingra argues that because some people believe sex education can promote promiscuity,the information can be read as inducing minors to have sex with.this attenuated argument glosses over the clear language of the statute,which requires the combination of three key elements i knowing ii inducement or enticement of a minor iii to engage in sexual activity that is a criminal offense.a general informational website falls far short of being a knowing inducement of minor readers to participate in criminal sexual activity.
the focus of the statute is on the actor and the intent of his actions,and thus liability depends on the audience for whom the communication is intended and the conduct the communication seeks to provoke.for example,the statute would not criminalize speech that is received by minors but is not spoken with the intent to persuade,induce,entice,or coerce a minor into illegal sexual activity.in this delineation between criminal and lawful behavior lies a key distinction between the cda provisions considered in reno and b.the cda criminalized if directed to a general it became known to the speaker that a minor was accessing the information.because the speaker burden of restricting minors access to otherwise legitimate speech would be so great,the statute effectively silenced the speaker altogether,imposing an impermissible blanket restriction that included legitimate adult communication.reno,at.in comparison,as a functional matter,b requires that an adult cease inducement for sex once he becomes aware that the object of his inducement is a a burden to legitimate speech,as the statute does not prevent the speaker from communicating with other adults 
first and tenth amendment challenges to decency standards 
section b does not define the specific criminal sexual acts that fall within its ambit.rather,it references prostitution or any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense.dhingra challenges the statute under the first and tenth amendments,alleging constitutional infirmities because the statute alludes to local criminal laws in determining whether the sexual activity solicited from the minor triggers culpability under b.
specifically,dhingra argues that b violates the first amendment by imposing a nationwide standard of decency with respect to sexual activity.although it is well settled that the proper metric of obscenity is the standard of the community,not the nation,see miller california,d,dhingra draws an imperfect analogy between obscenity restrictions and b.because the statute regulates conduct,not speech,it is inappropriate to bootstrap our first amendment jurisprudence into the context of criminal sexual contact.the collateral speech at issue in b is not,like obscenity,something that might fall under first amendment protection depending on which community standards apply rather,b contemplates the category of conduct in which speech is the vehicle for the commission of a crime,which does not depend on community standards as that term is understood in the first amendment context.simply put,the inducement of minors to engage in illegal sexual activity enjoys no first amendment protection.meek,at.
we similarly reject dhingra first amendment argument that b reference to local criminal laws renders the statute overbroad.in ashcroft aclu,d,the supreme court explained that a statute that is national in scope may rely on community standards for determining what is harmful to minors without being substantially overbroad for the purposes of the first amendment.id.at.see also hamling united states,d the fact that distributors of allegedly obscene materials may be subjected to varying community standards in the various federal judicial districts into which they transmit the materials does not render a federal statute unconstitutional.sable communications of,fcc,d if sable audience is comprised of different communities with different local standards,sable ultimately bears the burden of complying with the prohibition on obscene messages.
it is of little consequence that communication over the internet might present difficulties in determining which community standards might apply that the persuasion of others for sexual activity occurs over the internet offers no talismanic protection from the established rule that the burden of complying with the statute rests with the person doing the persuading.see ashcroft aclu,at.the fact that various community standards might apply does not make the statute unconstitutional.see hamling,at.any concern with not knowing the identity or whereabouts of the person at the other end of the,im,or website is addressed by the statute intent requirement,both with respect to the minor and the illegal sexual activity.
dhingra related tenth amendment challenge is similarly unavailing.dhingra argues that because b does not articulate when a particular state criminal law applies to a defendant,the statute incorporates all state and municipal laws across the country,thereby infringing upon the state police power.as dhingra interprets the statute,b makes criminal the engagement in sexual activity that is a crime under the law of any state,regardless of whether that state has jurisdiction over the defendant.we decline to embrace this interpretation of the statute and read b to incorporate only the laws for which a person could be charged with a criminal offense,the law of the venue that would have jurisdiction over the defendant.
we note at the outset that we have upheld as constitutional federal statutes that incorporate state laws.see united states iverson,cir rejecting vagueness challenge under the due process clause united states investments,cir rejecting notice challenge under the due process clause.also,in the rico context,other courts have held that a statute mere allusion to state crimes does not violate the tenth amendment because the reference does not supplant state crimes,but instead identifies the type of conduct that serves as a predicate to prosecution under rico.see united states kehoe,cir united states carrillo,cir united states crosby.similarly,because a b violation is its own offense subject to prosecution independent of other underlying offenses,the state power to prosecute criminal sexual conduct under state law is in no way abrogated.
contrary to dhingra suggestion,the sky is not falling his assertion that b allows prosecution under the disparate laws of fifty states misapprehends the statute.it would indeed be problematic if the statute permitted the prosecution of a defendant under the law of any jurisdiction,regardless of where the criminal conduct occurred or whether a charge could legitimately be brought.but the plain language of the statute limits its application to situations in which an individual could actually be prosecuted.
the practical reality is that the application of b is limited to the jurisdiction and venue restrictions of state and federal law.united states yazzie,cir federal criminal law can properly incorporate the criminal law of the state in which the offenses occurred.in adopting this reading of the statute,the alleged constitutional concerns evaporate.just as significantly,this approach is more functionally sound than the interpretation dhingra advances.as would be the case in the speech context,a bsent geographic specification,a juror applying community standards will inevitably draw upon personal knowledge of the community
