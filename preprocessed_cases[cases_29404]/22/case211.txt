to end previous litigation between them in minnesota state court,convey compliance systems,and pro,entered into a settlement agreement that included mutual general releases of all claims between them,known or unknown,arising out of any actions or events occurring in whole or part prior to or concurrent with the date of the settlement.
when,after the settlement,pro initiated a proceeding against convey in the world intellectual property organization to compel convey to give up an internet domain name that it had acquired before the settlement,convey commenced this action for breach of the settlement agreement.pro asserted that it was not aware of the domain name dispute when entering into the settlement agreement and that therefore its claim against convey was not within the scope of claims intended to be released in the settlement agreement.the jury rejected pro position and returned a verdict in favor of convey,declaring that pro breached the agreement.the district court,relying on the language of the settlement agreement,awarded convey its attorneys fees and costs in the amount of.
on appeal,pro challenges the sufficiency of the evidence,an evidentiary ruling made by the district court at trial,and the district court award of attorneys fees and costs.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
convey is a minnesota corporation engaged in the business of developing and selling computer software products used to generate tax forms,particularly those pertaining to compliance with irs code.its customers typically include tax,accounting,and information technology professionals,including chief financial officers,comptrollers,and other members of accounting and information technology departments.convey products range from relatively inexpensive software for desktop computers that typically generate less than tax forms to expensive and complex software for large operations that require the generation of over a million forms.
pro is a california corporation that competes with convey in the market for the less expensive software.
in late,pro hired convey former vice president of sales and marketing,edward mcnamara,as a consultant.when convey learned that mcnamara was employed by pro,convey commenced an action against pro and mcnamara in minnesota state court,alleging unfair competition,particularly pro conversion of customer and prospect lists mcnamara breach of contract pro tortious interference with a nondisclosure and noncompete contract mcnamara breach of fiduciary and loyalty duties pro vicarious liability for mcnamara improper disclosures and violations of the minnesota trade secrets act.
to end the minnesota litigation,convey and pro entered into a settlement agreement on may,in which they included mutual releases and covenants not to sue.the mutual releases provided 
in consideration of all the foregoing,defendants pro and mcnamara on behalf of themselves and any person or entity claiming any rights through them,do hereby absolutely and unconditionally release and forever discharge plaintiffs convey,their employees,agents,attorneys,insurers,successors and assigns from any claims,demands,rights and causes of action and damages,whether liquidated or unliquidated,absolute or contingent,known or unknown,arising out of any actions or events occurring in whole or part prior to or concurrent with the date hereof,including specifically,but without limiting the generality of the foregoing,any and all claims defendants have asserted or could have asserted in the litigation against plaintiffs,of any nature whatsoever.
the mutual covenants not to sue provided 
the parties hereby acknowledge and agree that they will not initiate any legal action against any other party based on any claim or obligation released pursuant to paragraph or of this agreement.any breach of this provision will entitle the party to damages,including reasonable attorneys fees.this provision shall not be construed to limit either parties sic right to initiate legal action to enforce the terms of this agreement.
approximately three months before executing the settlement agreement,convey marketing communications director,acting in the routine course of her duties for convey,registered the domain name and various cognate designations.convey marketing communications director was not involved in the minnesota state court litigation and its settlement,and she did not inform the convey executives who were involved in the litigation about the acquisition of the domain names.accordingly,at trial,convey corporate executives who were involved in the settlement negotiations testified that they could not have informed pro about the domain name acquisitions during negotiations because they themselves were unaware of the acquisitions.
convey did not activate or begin using the domain name.com until july,approximately two months after executing the settlement agreement.when pro learned that convey had registered the.com domain name and began using the name,it initiated an action in the world intellectual property organization wipo against convey under the uniform domain name dispute resolution policy,seeking an order transferring to it the domain name.com.convey defaulted in the wipo proceedings,and a wipo panel ordered the transfer of the.com domain name to pro.
convey commenced this action in the eastern district of virginia,seeking damages for pro alleged breach of its settlement agreement and to reverse the wipo decision.convey alleged that in the settlement agreement,pro had agreed not to sue convey for any claim,known or unknown,that arose out of any actions or events occurring in whole or in part prior to the settlement release.pro filed a counterclaim for federal trademark infringement,unfair competition,and cyberpiracy arising from convey acquisition and use of the.com domain name.following a trial,the jury returned a verdict declaring that pro breached the settlement agreement and ruling against pro on its counterclaim.following the verdict,the district court entered a declaratory judgment and awarded convey attorneys fees and costs in the amount of.
this appeal followed.
pro contends that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury verdict declaring that pro breached the settlement agreement in instituting the wipo proceeding.its contention is grounded on the principle of minnesota law that even though a release and covenant not to sue may apply to unknown claims,such language is not a bar to claims that were not within the contemplation of the parties.pro argues that the testimony was undisputed in this case that at the time the parties settled the minnesota trade secret case,neither convey nor pro contemplated any cyberpiracy claims stemming from convey registration of the domain name,much less any trademark or unfair competition claims that later might arise based on the future use of the domain name.
convey contends that the releases expressly apply to unknown claims based on actions taken by either party prior to the execution of the settlement agreement and that the parties in fact intended to give such broad releases.convey asserts that pro drafted the settlement agreement and insisted upon the breadth of the release provisions.it argues that the jury verdict was amply supported by this evidence.
under minnesota law,which the parties agree applies to the interpretation of the settlement agreement,the binding effect of a general release provision for unknown claims depends on the intent of the parties.if it can be shown that the parties intended to release all unknown claims,it will be considered binding.as the minnesota supreme court summarized 
e ven though a release expressly covers unknown injuries,it is not a bar to an action for such unknown injuries if it can be shown that such unknown injuries were not within the contemplation of the parties when the settlement was agreed upon,but that,if the parties did in fact intentionally agree upon a settlement for unknown injuries,such release will be binding.
