shlahtichman filed a class action suit in illinois state court on behalf of himself and others similarly situated,contending that contacts had violated the fcra as amended by facta by including the expiration date of a purchaser credit card in the order confirmations it sent by email.because the suit arises under a federal statute,contacts removed the action to the district court.see.it then moved to dismiss shlahtichman complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted.the district court granted the motion and dismissed the suit.shlahtichman contacts,c,wl.the court cited two principal reasons for concluding that an emailed order confirmation falls outside the scope of the statute.first,order confirmations are not electronically printed receipts under facta.id.at emphasis ours.noting that the statute leaves the term printed undefined,the court adopted the plain and ordinary meaning of the term,which signifies the transfer of text,images,designs,and other information to paper.id.at.it rejected shlahtichman contention that the term should also be taken to include the display of information on a computer screen,reasoning that even if the word print can be understood in this way,this is not its ordinary import.id.the fact that the effective date of the truncating provision turned on the date on which the vendor cash register or other machine or device that electronically prints receipts came into use confirmed that the provision should be understood to reach receipts that are printed on paper by cash registers and similar devices.id.at.and the legislative history revealed that it was the misappropriation of those kinds of receipts that congress was concerned about when it passed facta.id.second,an order confirmation is not provided at the point of the sale or transaction under facta.id.at emphasis ours.as other courts had observed,the statutory reference to receipts provided at the point of the sale or transaction contemplates transactions rather than electronic commerce.id.at.even if a point of sale can be ascribed to an internet argued that the computer used by the consumer to make the purchase represents the point of email sent to the purchaser to confirm that purchase is not provided at that point but rather is directed to an email account that can be accessed anywhere.id.
although shlahtichman brought this case as a class action,no class was ever certified no motion asking the district court to do so was filed,so the dismissal of the complaint only disposes of shlahtichman individual claim for relief.see,phillips.ford motor,cir.nonetheless,the district court made clear that it contemplated no further proceedings in this case,see deeming the case closed,so its judgment is final and our own appellate jurisdiction is secure.see,mcclain retail food employers joint pension plan,cir.consistent with the fact that no class was certified,we shall treat shlahtichman complaint as if it were filed solely on his own behalf.rutan republican party of,cir en banc,aff in part rev in part on other grounds.

as the district court noted,most courts have concluded that the term electronically printed reaches only those receipts that are printed on paper,as that understanding of the statute conforms to the ordinary meaning of the term print.see turner ticket animal,llc,wl,smith under armour,d smith,d,grabein jupiterimages,wl,report and recommendation of magistrate judge,adopted,wl s,king movie,d,haslam federated dep t stores,civ,wl.may,narson,no,wl.may.a minority have concluded that the term should be understood to reach electronic receipts that are displayed on the consumer computer.romano active network,c,wl,harris best buy,grabein.com,wl,stubhub,no.cv,dist.lexis,we conclude that the majority view adopted by the district court in this case is on firmer ground.
what facta covers are printed receipts.the same technological advances that have given consumers multiple means of paying their bills and purchasing goods and services have also made it possible for the receipts confirming those transactions to be provided in the form of a voicemail,email,and text message as well as the traditional paper receipt.but when one refers to a printed receipt,what springs to mind is a tangible document.to print a receipt thus ordinarily connotes recording it on paper.that is why the plaintiff had to print a copy of his receipt to get it off of his computer it is why the machine used to transfer text from a computer to paper is called a printer and it is why a judge who asks a law clerk to print a case does not intend for the clerk to merely display the case on his computer screen.jupiterimages,wl,at emphasis in original.
dictionaries are a helpful resource in ascertaining the common meaning of terms that a statute leaves undefined,see,crawford metro.gov t of nashville davidson county,and a canvass of several leading dictionaries reveals that print in its transitive verb form ordinarily connotes the transfer of words or images to a tangible paper.see oxford english dictionary online,available at http last visited,produce books,newspapers,magazines,especially in large quantities,by a mechanical process involving the transfer of text,images,or designs to paper a thousand copies of the book were printed dictionary online,available at last visited,a to impress something in or on b to stamp as a mark in or on something,available at last visited,to produce a text,picture,by applying inked types,plates,blocks,or the like,to paper or other material either by direct pressure or indirectly by offsetting an image onto an intermediate roller citing random house dictionary.true enough,these sources recognize that the term,when used with reference to computers,also can be understood to mean the display of text on a computer viewing screen.dictionary online print out also to display on a surface as a computer screen for viewing computers.to produce data in legible alphanumeric or graphic form.for that matter,one can also print to file and print to pdf portable document format in a computer environment without transferring anything to paper.see oxford english dictionary online send a computer file to a printer or to another,temporary file.but these usages of the term,while more frequent in recent years,do not yet represent the ordinary or natural meaning of print.shlahtichman suggests that use of the adverb electronically in section g t his subsection shall apply only to receipts that are electronically printed emphasis ours evinces a congressional intent to broaden the meaning of the statutory term to include the more modern usages,so that an electronically printed receipt will include one that is opened and displayed on the consumer computer.yet,the modifier electronically appears intended to distinguish those receipts that are printed by machine,as opposed to those which are handwritten or created by taking an impression of the card using an imprinter.see active network,wl,at.in any case,whatever sort of printing that the consumer might do on his or her computer is not printing done by a person that accepts credit cards or debit cards for the transaction of business,g and it is printing by the vendor,rather than by the consumer,at which the statute is aimed,d at,wl,at.an email generated by the vendor might never be viewed or displayed by the consumer and thus might never be printed even in the expansive sense that shlahtichman advocates.this leaves shlahtichman to argue that the vendor prints a receipt simply by sending the email to the consumer.shlahtichman reply at.but that too is a departure from the ordinary or natural meaning of the term.
ultimately,s tatutory language only has meaning in context,graham county soil water conservation dist.united states ex rel.wilson,and the overall statutory context of facta suggests,consistent with the ordinary meaning of the word print,that the statute is aimed at paper receipts.the statute ban on printing more than the last five digits of a debit or credit card or the expiration date of the card applies to receipts that are printed and provided to the cardholder at the point of the sale or transaction.g emphasis ours.this language has a ready application to transactions that take place in a store or some comparable physical location at which the consumer is handed a receipt.see,wl,at.its application to internet purchases raises a host of questions.where is the point of sale for such a consumer computer the vendor headquarters the vendor server cyberspace generally and is that the same point at which an emailed receipt is provided to the consumer assuming that these questions can be answered in a way that comports with the statutory language,see ehrheart bose,civ,wl,at,on premise that point of sale or transaction has no fixed meaning and can refer to a time or event rather than a location,court eschews an understanding of the term as used in facta that would refer to a particular physical site,a separate subsection of section g points again to traditional,transactions.in subsection g,congress specified two different effective dates for the truncation requirement december,with respect to any cash register or other machine or device that electronically prints receipts for credit card or debit card transactions that is in use before january,and december,with respect to any such machine or device that is first put into use on or after january.emphasis ours.the citation of the cash register as the lead example of a machine or device used to electronically print a receipt is consistent with the notion that congress meant to regulate the types of receipts that document transactions between the consumer and the merchant few terms bring to mind a store better than cash register.on the other hand,scores of businesses use the same sorts of computers to generate and print receipts that consumers now possess in their homes,and technological advances are fast blurring the line between traditional cash registers and devices that can perform the same functions.see,erick schonfeld,square turns your ipad into a cash register,tech crunch,available at http last visited.more telling,perhaps,is that congress chose to make the effective date of the truncation requirement dependent on the vintage of the device used to print the receipt.see,wl,at federated dep t stores,wl,at.if the statute applies to only those receipts that are printed on paper by a vendor using a cash register or similar device,then the two different effective dates comprised a workable scheme.if,however,the statute reaches not only those receipts that are printed by the vendor in the traditional way,but also those that are emailed to the consumer and displayed on the device of her choosing personal computer,smartphone,then with respect to the latter subset of receipts,congress made the effective date of the truncation requirement dependent on a fact the date the device was first put into use that was wholly beyond the contemplation and control of the vendor facing liability.of course,that is water under the bridge now that the later effective date has passed,but it is implausible to think that congress would have premised a vendor liability on circumstances that were entirely beyond its control.in short,t he language of g as a whole clearly shows that the statute contemplates transactions where receipts are physically printed using electronic point of sale devices like electronic cash registers or terminals,wl,at see also ticket animal,wl,at the terms point of the sale and any cash register or other machine or device immediately evoke the image of a paper receipt under armour,d at same,d at same.
