jurisdiction 
federal courts are not courts of general jurisdiction they have only the power that is authorized by article iii of the constitution and the statutes enacted by congress pursuant thereto.for that reason,every federal appellate court has a special obligation to satisfy itself of its own jurisdiction bender williamsport area sch,d citations omitted.thus,before reaching the parties arguments,we must first address the scope of our jurisdiction,which depends on how the judgment is construed.ilor contends that the judgment disposes of all claims and counterclaims and therefore is final.thus,according to ilor,we have jurisdiction under a to address all issues raised below,including the district court grant of summary judgment of noninfringement and the district court sua sponte dismissal of its remaining claims.alternatively,ilor argues that if it does not dispose of google counterclaims,the judgment certifies the decision for immediate appeal under federal rule of civil procedure b,and consequently vests us with jurisdiction to addition to the denial of the preliminary grant of summary judgment of noninfringement and the dismissal of ilor remaining claims.google contends that the judgment neither disposes of its counterclaims nor meets the requirements under rule b to certify the decision for immediate appeal.thus,according to google,our jurisdiction is limited under a to the district court denial of preliminary injunctive relief.
we agree with google.we do not interpret the judgment to dispose of google counterclaims or to certify the decision for immediate appeal under rule b.ilor contention that the judgment dismisses google counterclaims rests largely on its argument that the judgment dismissal of the action necessarily encompasses all claims at issue in the ilor claims and google counterclaims.for this contention ilor relies upon our decision in walter kidde portable equipment,universal security instruments.ilor reliance on walter kidde in this case is misplaced.
in walter kidde,we addressed the propriety of a district court grant of a plaintiff motion to voluntarily dismiss pursuant to rule a over the objection of a defendant who had filed counterclaims.the plaintiff in walter kidde had filed a rule a motion to dismiss the action so that it could correct a jurisdictional deficiency and refile the case.walter kidde,at.the defendant objected and requested dismissal with prejudice or without prejudice but with conditions.id.the district court dismissed the action without prejudice,and without further comment on the nature of the dismissal.id.at.because the district court order did not explicitly address the defendant counterclaims,the defendant argued on appeal that the judgment was not final and thus not appealable.we disagreed,stating that t he term action encompasses the entire proceedings in the district court,signifying that the order of dismissal terminated the defendant counterclaims.id.at.
ilor appears to contend that following walter kidde,a district court use of the word action robotically signifies all claims,counterclaims,regardless of the context in which that word is used.walter kidde did not go so far.indeed,our primary citation for the proposition that action included the defendant counterclaims was a second circuit case which stated that t he word action,without more,is arguably broad enough to encompass any type of judicial proceeding,including counterclaims.see local union,sh
