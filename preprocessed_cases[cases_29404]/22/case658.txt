after conviction of the offense of receiving child pornography and a second violation of a special condition of his supervised release,robert emerson white was sentenced to six months in the custody of the bureau of prisons followed by a term of supervised release.having served the custodial sentence,white now challenges three of the five special conditions imposed prohibition of internet access,physiological testing,and probationary searches,contending not one is reasonably related to protecting the public or achieving his rehabilitation,and all infringe his first,fourth,and fourteenth amendment rights.exercising our appellate jurisdiction,we affirm the trial court imposition of probationary searches but remand for the court clarification of the scope of the denial of internet access and the imposition of physiological testing.
in,white,using the address responded to an advertisement on the internet for videos of young girls engaged in fondling and sexual intercourse with adult men.after white selected the mode of delivery and was assured the seller was not involved in a sting operation,he ordered three tapes.despite his caution,united states customs officers,who had placed the ad,made the controlled delivery,triggering his arrest and the execution of a search warrant which permitted the seizure of the tapes.
subsequently,a federal grand jury charged white with receipt of child pornography in violation of a a,a,and e.after negotiations,white pled guilty to an information charging him with receipt of child pornography,attended by a term of incarceration and of supervised release.the week after completing his custodial sentence,white consumed alcohol in violation of a special condition of his supervised release.the court reimposed a term of supervised release but added another special condition.soon after,white was again discovered drinking alcohol,and the government filed a second petition to revoke his supervised release,the basis of this appeal.
in that sentencing hearing,the district court accepted white admission he consumed alcohol and heard arguments on two of the objections raised here,internet access and probationary searches.the court then sentenced white to six months in custody followed by two years of supervised release with five special conditions these are that white shall not consume alcohol participate in a mental health program for sex offenders,which may include physiological testing approved by the united states probation office uspo shall not possess erotica,or any other sexually explicit material,and shall not possess a computer with internet access throughout his period of supervised release submit to a search of his home,automobile,or person under direction of the uspo and not possess firearms,explosives,or other dangerous weapons.
white predicates his challenge to conditions,and solely on the facts underlying his present conviction of the single charge of receiving child pornography.in contrast,the government casts that conviction against a decade of conduct it believes demonstrates a history of sexual deviance.in,it offers,white was convicted of a child under eighteen in san diego county,california,when he lifted an old dress and attempted to remove her pants.as a condition of his parole,white had to register as a sex offender under california law.when he was later convicted of driving under the influence in,he volunteered that he had been driving around asking where he could find young girls.the following year,white was convicted of possession of child pornography in glendale,california,and as a condition of parole,was ordered not to have contact with children under fourteen years old.the government also apprized the sentencing court that while serving the first period of supervised release in this case,it received an affidavit sworn to by a woman who stated white invited her son to his room to use his computer.in each instance,the consumption of alcohol apparently was the catalyst for the aberrant behavior,it noted.
the government offers this extended history to provide context to the district court exercise of discretion under a in imposing a term of supervised release and in balancing the factors mandated for consideration by a.nonetheless,it characterizes the three issues raised as hypothetical and speculative.because,so far,no searches have occurred,physiological testing ordered,or internet access denied,the government contends the issues are not ripe for our consideration.white counters the conditions of supervised release incorporated in a final judgment of sentence are presently in effect in violation of his first,fourth,and fourteenth amendment rights.
while the question of prudential ripeness frequently surfaces in civil cases,often those involving the interpretation of administrative rules,see,utah united states dep t of the interior,cir park lake res.liab.united states dep t of agriculture,cir,rarely are criminal cases subject to clearing this hurdle.however,because a ripeness concern challenges our very power to resolve the case,we must be convinced the questions presented satisfy the several ramifications of our case or controversy jurisdiction.to do so,even in the context of a criminal case,we borrow from the analysis set forth in abbott laboratories gardner,d,and the recent application of the rationale in a similar context.united states loy,cir.
broadly,abbott laboratories cautions against the courts entangling themselves in abstract disagreements until the effects of a final order are felt in a concrete way by the challenging part y.at.to assure a live case or controversy,abbott instructs courts to assess both the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.id.at.this directive guided the third circuit when it addressed the government effort to forestall review of two special conditions of supervised release raised in loy.there,the court characterized the issue squarely as a matter of prudential ripeness at.its analysis is appropriate here.
in loy,defendant was convicted of receiving and possessing child pornography and,while serving his month sentence,appealed the imposition of two special conditions of his supervised release.one condition prohibited him from possessing all forms of pornography,including legal adult pornography,and the second from unsupervised contact with minor children and the requisite supervision must come from someone other than his wife.id.at.loy claimed the former was vague and overbroad,and the latter vague and unsupported by the record.the government countered the issues were not ripe for review it had neither attempted to enforce either condition nor had there been a violation.
applying abbott prudential directive to look first at the hardship to the parties in withholding court consideration and then at the fitness of the issues raised for judicial review,the third circuit agreed loy established hardship given that he could only learn of the prohibition reach when he faced a revocation proceeding second,it determined the issue raised was fit for judicial review,the breadth of the prohibition presenting a question of law for which prompt resolution would inform loy conduct.the government approach would have loy discover the meaning of his supervised release condition only under continual threat of reimprisonment,in sequential hearings before the court.such an exercise is not necessary nor will it clarify the issues.id.at.
further,the third circuit analysis fulfilled abbott teaching to examine congressional intent as an important component of the prudential ripeness inquiry.id.citing at.it ascertained the legislative history of the sentencing reform act of evidences congress intention that direct appellate review be the preferred method of reviewing a district court sentence.id.supporting statements found in,at,reprinted in.
in the third circuit view,the legislative history of the guidelines certainly envisioned the role of appellate courts in the determination of the legality of sentences and any conditions of supervised release both at the time of their imposition and in an appeal from a revocation proceeding,the posture here.id.in addition,such prompt review would promote judicial efficiency by eliminating the alternative of piecemeal appeals of parts of sentences.id.at.consequently,the court concluded the case was ripe for review having found 
we have case or controversy jurisdiction the issues are legal ones that we can easily resolve without reference to concrete facts defendant will experience a hardship if we do not resolve the issues the traditional canons that counsel against hearing these sorts of challenges are inapplicable in the context of supervised release conditions and the judicial system has an interest in dealing with this case as expeditiously as possible,instead of waiting for a distinct appeal of a conviction for a violation of the conditions of release.
id.thus,because the statute,makes supervised release a discretionary component of a final sentence,and it is punishment,united states ginyard,appellate courts have jurisdiction to consider the legality of its terms.
each of these factors is equally present here.indeed,the consequences for white are perhaps more serious,the case now before us after a revocation of supervised release hearing,which resulted in six months reincarceration followed by a term of supervised release with five special conditions attached.violation now of any of these special conditions after this second revocation of supervised release petition would more predictably foreclose his passageway from incarceration to the completion of his sentence.consequently,he has established hardship.the issues he has raised are legal questions capable of judicial resolution.finally,despite the government assurance it would not later raise a waiver argument in a subsequent proceeding,our interest in judicial efficiency finds this assurance vacuous.
because there is no applicable sentencing guideline for the sentence to be imposed after a violation of supervised release,the standard for review is plainly unreasonable under e in reviewing the sentence and the court explanation of it,we will not reverse if it can be determined from the record to have been reasoned and reasonable.united states lee,cir.
we are not without guidance,however.the sentencing guidelines,and its policy statements promulgated in ch,which mirror the statutes,a and a,and case law govern the goals of a term of supervised release and the validity of the conditions which may be attached.although a sentencing court enjoys broad discretion in setting a condition of supervised release,united states edgin,cir citations omitted,a that discretion is guided by the factors set forth in a and enumerated in d.to assure that a court shall impose a sentence sufficient,but not greater than necessary,the sentencing court must consider,in part 
the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant.
the need for the sentence imposed 
a to reflect the seriousness of the offense,to promote respect for the law,and to provide just punishment for the offense 
b to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct 
c to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant and 
d to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training,medical care,or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner 
a.while the district court then shall consider a multitude of factors when determining the appropriate sentence in revocation of supervised release,n o single factor necessarily predominates over any other,and the statutory language,the court shall consider,evidences that none of them,whenever applicable,should be ignored altogether.united states marvin,cir italics in original.thus,a condition that is reasonably related to these factors,involves no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary,and is consistent with pertinent policy statements of the sentencing commission,d,will surely be judged reasoned and reasonable.lee,at.
white contends each of the special conditions now challenged fails to satisfy these criteria.the factual predicate for purposes of a,he insists,is his plea to a single count of receiving child pornography which he ordered over the internet.that predicate is not reasonably related to prohibiting him from all access to the internet,he urges,and thus the special condition is greater than necessary in the equation balancing protection of the public with the goals of sentencing.he contends he is presently writing a book,and the prohibition of any access to the internet,an essential tool for his research,defeats any rehabilitative goals of his sentence,is not reasonably related to protecting the public,and unnecessarily infringes his first amendment rights.he suggests the court could have tailored the condition to prohibit his visiting child pornography chatrooms and sites or to permit probation officers to examine his computer files to verify the sites he has used.
the government counters the special condition reasonably relates to the offense of conviction and the history and characteristics of the defendant,a,referencing the span of defendant sex offenses.it relies on united states crandon,cir,in which the third circuit upheld a special condition of supervised release which specified defendant not possess,procure,purchase or otherwise obtain access to any form of computer network,bulletin board,internet or exchange format involving computers unless specifically approved by the united states probation office.id.at.
crandon differs on its facts,however.in that case,defendant,age,developed a relationship with a girl over the internet and eventually traveled from his home in new jersey to her home in minnesota,had sexual relations with her,and photographed her nude.his use of the internet clearly initiated and facilitated a pattern of criminal conduct and victimization that produced an immediate consequence and directly injured the victim.nonetheless,the sentencing court did not deny defendant all access to the internet.instead,it barred defendant from obtaining access to a computer network,bulletin board unless specifically approved by the united states probation office.id.the special condition is narrower in some respects and broader in others than that present here.
in the case before us,the district court ordered white shall not possess a computer with internet access throughout his period of supervised release.as worded,the prohibition does not bar white access to the internet only his possession of a computer with internet access the distinction is not without a difference.despite the apparent constraint,white may visit a library,cybercafe,even an airport,and log onto the internet.the internet is also accessible via by attaching an electronic device to a television.consequently,if the district court targeted this special condition at the nature and circumstances of the offense and white history and characteristics to prevent using the internet to order child pornography,it missed the mark 
even if we were to read the two clauses of the special condition together,shall not possess erotica and shall not possess a computer with internet access,inferentially linking the possession of the computer with the means of possessing erotica,white could still conform his conduct to the technical meaning of the condition while circumventing it.consequently,if the court endeavored to deny white access to internet sites that feature child pornography,erotica,and sexually explicit material,the source of possession,the special condition again overshoots the mark.as noted,white can presently access chatrooms,boards,game rooms,video audio streaming,or send and receive simply by logging onto the internet on a computer at another location.
however,if the district court intended to deny white any access whatsoever to the internet by having the word possess incorporate the concept of use,the special condition overreaches.that reading would bar white from using a computer at a library to do any research,get a weather forecast,or read a newspaper online.under these circumstances,the special condition is greater than necessary,a,and fails to balance the competing interests the sentencing co
