factual and procedural background 
pelican bay is a maximum security prison that houses some of the state most dangerous prisoners,including those who have become affiliated with prison gangs or committed serious disciplinary infractions in prison and are confined in its security housing unit.see madrid gomez.inmates at pelican bay do not have direct access to the internet through computer terminals at the prison.
inmate classified is a business that advertises itself as offering prison inmates a personal connection to the internet.for a fee,inmate classified designs personal home pages for inmates,which are accessible through links on inmate classified web page.each personal home page includes the inmate prison mail address and an individual address.prospective correspondents who want a response from the inmate are asked to include a return mail address because the inmate can not send.once a week inmate classified downloads and prints any received by an inmate and sends those messages to the inmate by regular mail.
collins subscribed to inmate classified sometime in mid,while he was incarcerated at california state prison sacramento.he was transferred to pelican bay in october and continued his subscription for several months,receiving multiple messages.but in may,the warden at pelican bay issued a memorandum informing inmates that there had been an influx of mail containing internet related material and that materials downloaded from the internet and sent to the prison were considered unauthorized publications pursuant to california code of regulations,title,section f.the memorandum stated that these publications and the mail in which they were enclosed would not be accepted by the prison mailroom.
after collins administrative challenges to this policy were unsuccessful,he filed the petition for habeas corpus that is the subject of this appeal.at the hearing on the petition,pelican bay presented the testimony of augie lopez,associate warden of central services,jill tholl,prison mail room supervisor,and michael menz,a detective in the sacramento county sheriff department assigned to the high tech crimes task force,who testified as an expert in internet law enforcement and investigation.according to lopez and tholl,the prison mail room staff opens between and pieces of mail daily,monday through friday.in addition to being searched for contraband,mail is screened to determine whether it is,mail sent through a third party to circumvent the regulation allowing correspondence between prison inmates only with prior approval of the warden of each facility.see,tit.mail also is checked for compliance with the regulation permitting inmates to receive publications such as books,periodicals,and newspapers only from approved vendors and in limited number.see,f.there is also a random screening of the content of approximately percent of the mail,which may result in more intense scrutiny by security staff 
associate warden lopez testified that the policy prohibiting inmates from receiving materials by regular mail was based on security concerns and the potential for increased workload on staff.he explained that pelican bay has a large population of inmates,many of whom have tried to use the mail to accomplish crimes,smuggling,extortion,and solicitation for murder both inside and outside the prison.the existing restrictions on the flow of information into and out of the prison,such as the limitation on communication,are aimed at impeding and curtailing criminal activity by inmates.the restrictions on published materials are also related to prison security their purpose is to keep out coded messages,narcotics,weapons,and other contraband.lopez believed that the quick and easy accessibility of communication by would generate an avalanche of mail to inmates,exacerbating security problems and resulting in an exorbitant workload for prison staff.
detective menz explained that ascertaining the source of messages can be difficult because senders can hide or disguise their identity more easily than can those who send regular mail.menz also was of the opinion that the availability of could dramatically increase the volume of mail to inmates,particularly given the likelihood that their would include junk mail or spam as well as personal communications.
the witnesses at the hearing also included donald byrd,who had provided a written statement and who testified as a computer consultant at the court request.byrd acknowledged that as a practical matter,the possibility of attaching material to an message makes it easier to send an unlimited amount of information by than by regular mail.he agreed that may be somewhat less traceable than regular mail,but thought that most people were not sophisticated enough to hide their tracks.as for whether it would be easier to place a code in the text of a typed letter or an message,byrd thought that would depend on the sender ingenuity rather than the medium.
the trial court took the matter under submission and eventually requested additional briefing from the parties on suggested language for a ruling directing the department of corrections to adopt a policy allowing inmates to receive materials,subject to various restrictions.subsequently,in october,in response to a request for further information by the trial court,a declaration was filed indicating that the california department of corrections had begun the lengthy process of developing and formulating administrative regulations governing inmate access to.as of yet,however,no such regulation has been adopted.
in december,the trial court issued the following order or other internet related materials may be received by inmates if sent to the inmate via mail.all internet related material received by way of mail shall be treated as mail and shall be governed by the california code of regulations,title,article,et the warden has appealed from the order.
