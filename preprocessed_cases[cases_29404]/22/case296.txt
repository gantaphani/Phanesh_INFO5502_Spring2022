lambert sued the defendants pursuant to,claiming that the publication of the citation violated her constitutional right to privacy under the fourteenth amendment to the constitution.she further asserted that her identity had been stolen by a third party as a direct result of the clerk publication of the citation,and that she had consequently suffered economic damages,damage to her personal credit rating,and damage to her reputation.lambert also raised claims and sought to certify her complaint as a class action.
the defendants moved to dismiss lambert complaint on the basis that she had failed to state a claim under.concluding that lambert claim must fail because her alleged privacy interest was not of a constitutional dimension,the district court granted the defendants motion.the court then dismissed her pendent claims without prejudice.lambert argues that the court erred in dismissing her complaint and renews her claim that the defendants violated her constitutional right to privacy.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual background 
in september of,lambert received a traffic citation for speeding in hamilton county,ohio.the issuing officer completed an ohio uniform traffic ticket,a form used throughout ohio that includes a person name,signature,home address,birth date,driver license number,and social security number.one copy of the citation was given to lambert and another was filed with the clerk office.approximately a year after she received the citation,lambert was contacted by two retail stores about suspicious purchases that had been made in her name.the individual who made the purchases presented a driver license that displayed lambert full name,home address,birth date,driver license number,and social security number.
during her conversations with the retailers,lambert was informed that the identity thief might have gained access to her personal information through the clerk website.lambert then looked on the internet and discovered that the clerk publicly accessible site made it possible to search and locate traffic citations that retained all of an individual identifying information,including his or her social security number.when lambert examined her citation on the website,she realized that,like the fake identification used by the identity thief,the citation contained a driver license number that was incorrect by one digit.lambert promptly called the clerk office to complain about the publication of her personal information.the clerk office refused to remove the information,explaining to lambert that the records were made public for the convenience of the parties and that to remove the records would require vast amounts of manpower.
lambert filed suit against the defendants in december of.by that time,law enforcement officials had apprehended a group of individuals who had gained access to the personal information of numerous people found on the clerk website and had used that information to commit identity theft.the police informed lambert that they had arrested a person who was a part of that ring,a woman who later admitted that she was the thief who stole lambert identity from the clerk website.that woman was later charged with a conspiracy to commit identity theft,convicted,and sentenced to months imprisonment for her actions.
procedural background 
lambert claim under alleged that the clerk policy and practice of publishing personal information on a public website violated her fourteenth amendment right to privacy,in addition to her fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures,and her fourteenth amendment rights to substantive and procedural due process.she contended that,as a result of the clerk policy,she had suffered economic damages,damages to her personal credit rating,and damage to her reputation.lambert also raised claims under the common law of ohio for violation of her right to privacy and the tort of publication of private facts.finally,she requested the certification of a class action under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure on behalf of a putative class of hundreds of thousands of people whose social security numbers had been published on the clerk website.
lambert originally sought declaratory relief,compensatory damages,and an injunction to prevent the publication of the personal information in question.she later sought leave to amend her complaint,removing her demand for compensatory damages and substituting instead a request for uniform,relief in the form of a credit monitoring fund or other prophylactic measure to detect or prevent potential identity theft.
the defendants moved to dismiss lambert complaint,arguing,among other things,that she had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.in december of,the district court entered an order granting the defendants motion and dismissing all of lambert claims.the court reviewed sixth circuit precedent addressing the constitutional right to privacy of personal information and concluded that lambert claim was without merit because the privacy interest she asserted did not implicate either a fundamental right or one implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.noting that lambert identified only a risk of financial harm,the court determined that this injury bears no equivalence to the potential and actual harm suffered by the plaintiffs in cases where the sixth circuit has recognized a fourteenth amendment right to privacy against the disclosure of personal information.the district court therefore agreed with the defendants that lambert claim failed to state a claim under,concluded that a ruling on her proposed amended complaint was unnecessary,and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over her claims.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
the defendants assert that because lambert is no longer seeking compensatory damages and limits her remedy to credit monitoring relief,she does not have standing to bring her claim.their contention on this point is somewhat confusing,interchangeably arguing that lambert injury is not fairly traceable to the publication of her social security number and that the injury of identity theft in the future is too speculative and conjectural to entitle her to relief.lambert has failed to address the defendants challenge,but we nevertheless conclude that she has standing to bring her claim.
to bring a claim in federal court,a plaintiff must satisfy the threshold requirement imposed by article iii of the constitution by alleging an actual case or controversy.city of los angeles lyons,d.this burden can be met by lambert showing that she has suffered an injury in fact that is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical her injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that her injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.see daubenmire city of columbus,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
lambert has alleged that her identity was stolen and that her financial security and credit rating suffered as a result.she also claims that because of the nature of identity theft,she has been exposed to the risk that people have accessed her personal information on the internet and will be able to use that information to commit future acts of identity theft against her.although this latter injury is somewhat hypothetical and conjectural,her actual financial injuries are sufficient to meet the requirement.see club italia soccer sports,charter twp.of shelby,cir noting that t his court has explicitly held that certain types of economic injuries are sufficient to confer standing.
indeed,the defendants do not dispute that lambert has been injured.they instead attack her standing on the basis that her injuries are not fairly traceable to the clerk website.specifically,they argue that the harm suffered by lambert was caused by an intervening criminal act of a third party.they therefore claim that lambert has not met the second prong of the standing test because she is unable to demonstrate that her injuries are fairly traceable to the defendants.
the defendants are correct in pointing out that a third party was undoubtedly the direct cause of lambert injuries.but because both the traffic citation and the fake identification used to make purchases in lambert name contained the identical,incorrect driver license number,lambert was able to link the act of identity theft to the personal information that was made available by the clerk.moreover,the identity thief who was indicted and convicted before the district court dismissed lambert case acknowledged that she had taken lambert personal information from the clerk website.lambert thus alleged sufficient facts to show that her injuries were fairly traceable to the publication of her personal information by the clerk.see village of arlington heights metro.housing dev,d explaining that the cause of the plaintiff asserted injury may be indirect so long as the complaint indicates that the injury is indeed fairly traceable to the defendant acts or omissions.
the defendants also challenge the relief sought by lambert.they argue that the fund requested by lambert would remedy neither her past injury of publication nor her potential injury of future identity theft.the defendants cite a number of cases that,according to their interpretation,support the contention that lambert does not have standing.but only one of these cases even addresses standing,and in that case the sixth circuit concluded that the plaintiff had pled facts sufficient to confer standing.see sutton jude medical,cir concluding that the plaintiff had standing to seek medical testing and monitoring allegedly made necessary by the increased risk of future harm created by a implant.
indeed,the defendants mischaracterize both the injury that lambert has alleged and the nature of the relief that she seeks.lambert claims that the past identity theft has damaged her credit rating and that the publication of her personal information has exposed her to a risk of future identity theft.this court decision in sutton undermines,rather than supports,the defendants contention that a monitoring fund would not redress these injuries.we explained in sutton that if the plaintiff could prove that the implanted heart valve had increased the future risk to his health,medical monitoring would undoubtedly help to remedy the situation.id.likewise,if lambert were able to prove that she continues to face an increased risk of identity theft,she could likely show that monitoring suspicious activity on her credit report would not only combat that future risk,but would also help to redress the past financial injury that she has suffered.for these reasons,we conclude that lambert has standing to bring her claims.
immunity claims 
the defendants also raise a number of immunity defenses as an alternative ground for rejecting lambert claims.although lambert acknowledges that her opponents raised these claims before the district court and on appeal,she declined to address them in either of her briefs or during oral argument.the district court likewise declined to consider any of these arguments,resting its dismissal of lambert claims on the merits.because we agree with the district court disposition of this case on the merits,we similarly see no need to address the defendants immunity arguments.see,nair oakland county cmty.mental health,cir explaining that where,as here,a defendant declines to raise eleventh amendment immunity as a threshold defense,federal courts have discretion to address the defense and the merits in whichever order they prefer.
lambert claim 
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court decision to grant a defendant motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.dubay wells,cir.a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is a test of the plaintiff cause of action as stated in the complaint,not a challenge to the plaintiff factual allegations.golden city of columbus,cir.we must therefore construe the complaint in a light most favorable to lambert and accept all of her factual allegations as true.see dubay,at.although the factual allegations in a complaint need not be detailed,they must do more than create speculation or suspicion of a legally cognizable cause of action they must show entitlement to relief.league of united latin am.citizens bredesen,cir emphasis in original citing bell atlantic twombly,d.
municipal liability under 
a prima facie case under has two elements the defendant must be acting under the color of state law,and the offending conduct must deprive the plaintiff of rights secured by federal law.bloch ribar,cir citing parratt taylor,d.to succeed on a claim against a local government,the plaintiff must also prove that the injury about which she complains was caused by an unconstitutional government policy or custom.see monell dep t of soc,d i t is when execution of a government policy or custom inflicts the injury that the government as an entity is responsible under.
there is no question,of course,that the defendants acted under color of state law in making lambert traffic citation available on the internet.but the defendants maintain that they can not be held liable for lambert injuries because they were caused by a third party,the identity thief.although they do not frame it as such,this position is in essence an attack on lambert ability to show that the violation she alleges was committed by a person acting under color of state law.see rutter,cir citing west atkins,d holding that a prison classification of an inmate as a security threat due to his gang affiliation did not constitute an equal protection violation.we have determined,however,that a plaintiff can circumvent the state action requirement if he demonstrated that the state created a special danger in releasing private information that leads to harm.barber overton,cir explaining that a plaintiff could meet the requirement by demonstrating that the state disclosure put the plaintiff at risk,but declining to reach that question because the prison guards challenging the release of their personal information by prison officials to prisoners had not demonstrated a constitutional violation of their rights to privacy see also kallstrom city of columbus,cir holding that police officers privacy interest in their personnel files were of a constitutional dimension where the city created a very real threat to the officers and their family members personal security and bodily integrity,and possibly their lives.
moreover,lambert sued the clerk in his official capacity,which is the equivalent of suing the clerk employer,the county.see alkire irving,cir while p suits seek to impose personal liability upon a government official for actions he takes under color of state law,individuals sued in their official capacities stand in the shoes of the entity they represent.alteration in original quoting kentucky graham,d.the only issue in the present case,then,is whether the clerk actions,as alleged in lambert complaint,were part of a policy or custom that violated lambert constitutional right to privacy.
the scope of the constitutional right to privacy 
two types of interests have been identified by the supreme court as protected by the right to privacy that is rooted in the substantive due process protections of the fourteenth amendment.one is the interest in independence in making certain kinds of important decisions.whalen roe,d noting that these decisions have been characterized as dealing with matters relating to procreation,marriage,contraception,family relationships,and child rearing and education quoting paul davis,d.the other type of privacy interest applicable to individuals is the interest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters.id.at.recognizing that a statute requiring that the state be provided with a copy of certain drug prescriptions implicated the individual interest in nondisclosure,but upholding the law because the statute contained adequate security measures nixon adm r of,d assuming that president nixon had a legitimate expectation of privacy in his private communications,but upholding a federal law that provided for the review and classification of presidential materials by professional archivists.lambert claim implicates the latter interest,which this court has described as an individual right to control the nature and extent of information released about that individual and that has been coined an informational right to privacy.bloch ribar,cir.
this court,in contrast to some of our sister circuits,has narrowly construed the holdings of whalen and nixon to extend the right to informational privacy only to interests that implicate a fundamental liberty interest.id.at.a plaintiff alleging a violation of her right to informational privacy must therefore demonstrate that the interest at stake relates to those personal rights that can be deemed fundamental or implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.id.quoting desanti,cir.only after a fundamental right is identified should the court proceed to the next step of the balancing of the government interest in disseminating the information against the individual interest in keeping the information private.see kallstrom,at this circuit will only balance an individual interest in nondisclosure against the public interest in and need for the invasion of privacy where the individual privacy interest is of constitutional dimension.
applying these standards,this court has recognized an interest of constitutional dimension in only two instances where the release of personal information could lead to bodily harm kallstrom,and where the information released was of a sexual,personal,and humiliating nature bloch.in kallstrom,the plaintiffs were undercover police officers who had been actively involved in a investigation of a violent gang and who had subsequently testified at trial against a number of the gang members.at.during the trial,the having promised to keep the officers personnel records the officers records to defense counsel.the records contained,among other personal information,the names and addresses of the officers,their immediate family members,and their personal references.id.
this court in kallstrom concluded that the officers privacy interests were of constitutional dimension because they implicated a fundamental interest in preserving their lives and the lives of their family members,as well as preserving their personal security and bodily integrity.id.at.that conclusion was supported by a long line of cases,dating back to the nineteenth century,in which courts have held that individuals have a constitutional right to avoid the kind of physical invasions or abuse that strip the very essence of personhood.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the kallstrom court holding therefore rested on the finding that the city disclosure had created a risk that the officers personal information might fall into the hands of persons likely to seek revenge upon the officers and had created a very real threat to the officers and their family members bodily integrity and possibly even their lives.id.
in bloch,this court considered whether the constitutional right to informational privacy was triggered by a press conference in which the sheriff released the highly personal and extremely humiliating details of the rape to which bloch had been subjected,some of which were so embarrassing she had not even told her husband.bloch,at.the court concluded that bloch could invoke her fourteenth amendment right to privacy because sexuality and choices about sex,in turn,are interests of an intimate nature which define significant portions of our personhood.id.at.
as in kallstrom,this court holding in bloch was premised on the notion that the disclosure of private sexual information implicated a fundamental right or one implicit in the concept of ordered liberty namely the fundamental right of privacy in one sexual life.id.at.the clear principle emerging from bloch is that the sheriff publication of the details of bloch rape implicated her right to be free from governmental intrusion into matters touching on sexuality and family life,and that to permit such an intrusion would be to strip away the very essence of her personhood.see id.at citing thorne city of el segundo,cir,for the proposition that an individual privacy right in her sexual activities follow ed from the cases holding that such basis matters as contraception,abortion,marriage,and family life are protected by the constitution from unwarranted government intrusion.
lambert claim of a constitutional deprivation 
in the face of the sixth circuit restrictive view of informational privacy,lambert makes two principal arguments to support her assertion that the district court erred in dismissing her complaint.she first claims that the district court analysis was flawed because t he proper framework should be whether the claimant has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the information he or she wants to keep private,and,if so,whether the government has any legitimate interest in disclosing such information to weigh against the individual interest in disclosure.second,she contends that the court erred in concluding that the clerk publication of her traffic citation on the internet did not implicate a fundamental right.
request for a new standard 
lambert first argument is a request for us to adopt a new approach to assessing informational privacy that does not require the court to first determine whether the privacy interest implicates a fundamental right.the standard that lambert proposes is in many ways similar to the more fluid approach that other circuits have adopted for assessing claims of informational privacy.see kallstrom,at citing cases in support of the proposition that o ther circuits have interpreted whalen and nixon as creating a broad constitutional right to informational privacy to be balanced against the public interest and need for the invasion of privacy helen gilbert,comment,minors constitutional right to informational privacy,chi,contrasting the sixth circuit approach to informational privacy with other circuits that do not require the implication of a fundamental liberty interest,and instead decide if the party alleging an invasion of privacy has a legitimate expectation of privacy in the information in question.
employing this standard,lambert argues that she has a reasonable expectation of privacy in her social security number,and that the district court therefore erred in failing to balance that interest against the defendants interest in publishing unredacted public records on the internet.lambert is of course correct in pointing out that both congress and the courts have recognized the privacy interest in one social security number.see,privacy act of,providing restrictions on the disclosure of social security numbers sherman dep t of the army,cir noting,in the context of a freedom of information act request,that an individual informational privacy interest in his or her ssn social security number is substantial in re crawford,cir recognizing that the indiscriminate public disclosure of social security numbers might implicate the constitutional right to privacy,but concluding that any interest in nondisclosure was outweighed by the government interest in making bankruptcy documents available to the general public.
the sixth circuit,however,has developed and applied a different approach to assessing informational privacy claims.as discussed above,that approach requires that the asserted privacy interest implicate a fundamental right.see bloch,at desanti,at holding that the disclosure of juveniles records to juvenile court personnel did not implicate the plaintiffs fundamental rights kallstrom,at explaining that the desanti court rejected the notion of a general constitut
