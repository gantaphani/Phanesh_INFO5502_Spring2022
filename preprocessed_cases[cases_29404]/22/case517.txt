lvrc holdings,llc lvrc filed this lawsuit in federal district court against its former employee,christopher brekka,his wife,carolyn quain,and the couple two consulting businesses,employee business solutions,a nevada corporation ebsn,and employee business solutions,a florida corporation ebsf.lvrc alleged that brekka violated the computer fraud and abuse act cfaa,by accessing lvrc computer without authorization,both while brekka was employed at lvrc and after he left the company.see a.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants.we affirm.because brekka was authorized to use lvrc computers while he was employed at lvrc,he did not access a computer without authorization in violation of a or a when he emailed documents to himself and to his wife prior to leaving lvrc.nor did emailing the documents exceed authorized access,because brekka was entitled to obtain the documents.further,lvrc failed to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact as to whether brekka accessed the lvrc website without authorization after he left the company.
lvrc operates fountain ridge,a residential treatment center for addicted persons,in nevada as part of its marketing efforts,lvrc retained load,to provide email,website,and related services for the facility.among other duties,load monitored internet traffic to lvrc website and compiled statistics about that traffic.
in april,lvrc hired brekka to oversee a number of aspects of the facility.part of his duties included conducting internet marketing programs and interacting with load.at the time brekka was hired,brekka owned and operated ebsn and ebsf,two consulting businesses that obtained referrals for addiction rehabilitation services and provided referrals of potential patients to rehabilitation facilities through the use of internet sites and advertisements.stuart smith,the owner and operator of lvrc,was aware of brekka businesses,although he states he was not aware of the full nature of their operations.
while brekka worked for lvrc,he commuted between florida,where his home and one of his businesses were located,and nevada,where fountain ridge and his second business were located.brekka was assigned a computer at lvrc,but while commuting back and forth between florida and nevada,he emailed documents he obtained or created in connection with his work for lvrc to his personal computer.lvrc and brekka did not have a written employment agreement,nor did lvrc promulgate employee guidelines that would prohibit employees from emailing lvrc documents to personal computers.
in june,brekka sent an email to load administrator,nick jones,requesting an administrative for lvrc website.jones sent an email with the administrative user name,and password,cbrekka,to brekka work email,which brekka downloaded onto his lvrc computer.by using the administrative,brekka gained access to information about lvrc website,including the usage statistics gathered by load.brekka used those statistics in managing lvrc internet marketing.
in august,brekka and lvrc entered into discussions regarding the possibility of brekka purchasing an ownership interest in lvrc.at the end of august,brekka emailed a number of lvrc documents to his personal email account and his wife personal email account.these documents included a financial statement for the company,lvrc marketing budget,admissions reports for patients at fountain ridge,and notes brekka took from a meeting with another nevada mental health provider.on september,brekka emailed a master admissions report,which included the names of past and current patients at fountain ridge,to his personal email account.
in,negotiations regarding brekka purchase of an ownership interest in lvrc broke down,and brekka ceased working for lvrc.brekka left his lvrc computer at the company and did not delete any emails from the computer,so the june email from nick jones,which included the administrative user name and password,remained on his computer.
after brekka left the company,other lvrc employees had access to brekka former computer,including brad greenstein,a consultant who was hired shortly before brekka left and who assumed many of brekka responsibilities.at some point after brekka left,the email with the administrative information was deleted from his lvrc computer.
on november,while performing routine monitoring of the load website,jones noticed that someone was logged into the lvrc website using the user name and was accessing lvrc load statistics.jones contacted greenstein about the use of the cbrekka.jones also provided the ip address of the and the location of the internet service provider isp associated with that ip address,namely,redwood city,california.greenstein instructed jones to deactivate the cbrekka,and jones did so the same day.shorting thereafter,lvrc filed a report with the fbi,alleging that brekka had unlawfully logged into lvrc website.
lvrc then brought an action in federal court,alleging that brekka violated the cfaa when he emailed lvrc documents to himself in september and when he continued to access the load website after he left lvrc.in addition,lvrc brought a number of state tort actions.in response,brekka filed a complaint against smith,greenstein,and frank szabo,alleging that they defamed him by making statements that brekka had stolen information from lvrc 
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of brekka.after dismissing the federal law claims,the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims and dismissed the case.lvrc filed a motion to reconsider.before the district court ruled on the motion,lvrc filed this appeal.we review the district court grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo,v.at t,cir.
the cfaa was enacted in to enhance the government ability to prosecute computer crimes.the act was originally designed to target hackers who accessed computers to steal information or to disrupt or destroy computer functionality,as well as criminals who possessed the capacity to access and control high technology processes vital to our everyday lives,july.the cfaa prohibits a number of different computer crimes,the majority of which involve accessing computers without authorization or in excess of authorization,and then taking specified forbidden actions,ranging from obtaining information to damaging a computer or computer data.see a 
lvrc complaint alleged that brekka committed two of the crimes established by the cfaa,a and a.section a provides for criminal penalties to be imposed on a person who 
intentionally accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized access,and thereby obtains 
c information from any protected computer if the conduct involved an interstate or foreign communication 
a.section a provides for criminal penalties to be imposed on a person who 
knowingly and with intent to defraud,accesses a protected computer without authorization,or exceeds authorized access,and by means of such conduct furthers the intended fraud and obtains anything of value 
lvrc brought suit under the provision of the statute that creates a right of action for private persons injured by such crimes.section g provides in pertinent part 
any person who suffers damage or loss by reason of a violation of this section may maintain a civil action against the violator to obtain compensatory damages and injunctive relief or other equitable relief.a civil action for a violation of this section may be brought only if the conduct involves of the factors set forth in clause i,ii,iii,iv,or v of subsection a b.
g.thus,a private plaintiff must prove that the defendant violated one of the provisions of a,and that the violation involved one of the factors listed in a b lvrc claims that brekka conduct involved the factor described in subsection a b i,which proscribes conduct that causes loss to or more persons during any period aggregating at least in value.a b i.
therefore,to bring an action successfully under g based on a violation of a,lvrc must show that brekka intentionally accessed a computer,without authorization or exceeding authorized access,and that he thereby obtained information from any protected computer if the conduct involved an interstate or foreign communication,and that there was loss to one or more persons during any period aggregating at least in value.to bring an action successfully under g based on a violation of a,lvrc must show that brekka accessed a protected computer,without authorization or exceeding such authorization that was granted,knowingly and with intent to defraud,and thereby further ed the intended fraud and obtain ed anything of value,causing a loss to one or more persons during any period aggregating at least in value.see a see also yonkers,celebrations the party and seasonal superstore,llc.cir theofel,cir.
in granting brekka summary judgment motion,the district court held that lvrc had failed to establish a violation of either a or.first,the district court stated that i t is undisputed that when brekka was employed by plaintiff that he had authority and authorization to access the documents and emails that were found on his home computer and laptop.according to the district court,lvrc adduced no evidence demonstrating that brekka accessed an lvrc computer or any of the documents on the computer without authorization an element of both a and when he emailed documents to himself and to his wife before he left the company.the district court based this ruling on its conclusion that brekka had authorization to access the lvrc computers for purposes of a and because he was employed by lvrc at the time he emailed documents to himself and his wife,and there was no evidence that brekka had agreed to keep the emailed documents confidential or to return or destroy those documents upon the conclusion of his employment.second,the district court held that lvrc had not put forth evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that brekka logged into the lvrc website after leaving lvrc employ.because of the lack of evidence that brekka violated a or,the district court dismissed lvrc claim under g.
lvrc disputes both of these determinations,and we address each in turn.
we first consider lvrc argument that the district court erred in assuming that if brekka access occurred during the term of his employment,it must have been authorized for purposes of the cfaa.lvrc argues that because brekka accessed the company computer and obtained lvrc confidential information to further his own personal interests,rather than the interests of lvrc,such access was without authorization for purposes of a and.
in interpreting the phrase without authorization,we start with the plain language of the statute.see united states blixt,cir.the cfaa does not define authorization,and it is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that,unless otherwise defined,words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.perrin united states,d see also united states morris,cir holding that the word authorization for purposes of the cfaa is of common usage,without any technical or ambiguous meaning,and therefore the district court was not obliged to instruct the jury on its meaning.authorization is defined in the dictionary as permission or power granted by an authority.random house unabridged dictionary,see also webster third international dictionary,defining authorization as the state of being authorized and authorize as to endorse,empower,justify,permit by or as if by some recognized or proper authority.based on this definition,an employer gives an employee authorization to access a company computer when the employer gives the employee permission to use it.because lvrc permitted brekka to use the company computer,the ordinary,contemporary,common meaning,perrin,at,of the statute suggests that brekka did not act without authorization.
no language in the cfaa supports lvrc argument that authorization to use a computer ceases when an employee resolves to use the computer contrary to the employer interest.rather,the definition of exceeds authorized access in e indicates that congress did not intend to include such an implicit limitation in the word authorization.section e provides the term exceeds authorized access means to access a computer with authorization and to use such access to obtain or alter information in the computer that the accesser is not entitled so to obtain or alter.e.as this definition makes clear,an individual who is authorized to use a computer for certain purposes but goes beyond those limitations is considered by the cfaa as someone who has exceed ed authorized access.on the other hand,a person who uses a computer without authorization has no rights,limited or otherwise,to access the computer in question.in other words,for purposes of the cfaa,when an employer authorizes an employee to use a company computer subject to certain limitations,the employee remains authorized to use the computer even if the employee violates those limitations.it is the employer decision to allow or to terminate an employee authorization to access a computer that determines whether the employee is with or without authorization.
this leads to a sensible interpretation of a and,which gives effect to both the phrase without authorization and the phrase exceeds authorized access a person who intentionally accesses a computer without authorization,a and,accesses a computer without any permission at all,while a person who exceeds authorized access,has permission to access the computer,but accesses information on the computer that the person is not entitled to access.
in this case,there is no dispute that brekka had permission to access the computer indeed,his job required him to use the computer.theofel,at holding that defendants had accessed a computer without authorization for purposes of the stored communications act,et,when they procured the access by fraud.moreover,there is no dispute that brekka was still employed by lvrc when he emailed the documents to himself and to his wife.the most straightforward interpretation of a and is that brekka had authorization to use the computer.
lvrc attempts to counter this conclusion by pointing to a seventh circuit decision,international airport centers,llc citrin,cir.according to lvrc,citrin supports its argument that the cfaa incorporates an additional limitation in the word authorization,such that an employee can lose authorization to use a company computer when the employee resolves to act contrary to the employer interest.in citrin,the court held that an employee authorization to access a computer ended for purposes of a when the employee violated his duty of loyalty to his employer.the employee had decided to start a competing business in violation of his employment contract and erased all data from his work laptop computer before quitting his job.id.at.the erased data included both valuable information belonging to his employer and evidence that the employee had engaged in misconduct.id.the seventh circuit held that,under common law agency principles,the employee breached his duty of loyalty to his employer when,having already engaged in misconduct and decided to quit the company in violation of his employment contract,he resolved to destroy files that incriminated himself and other files that were also the property of his employer,in violation of the duty of loyalty that agency law imposes on an employee.id.at.the court held that this breach of the duty of loyalty to his employer terminated the employee agency relationship and with it his authority to access the laptop,because the only basis of his authority had been that relationship.id.at.accordingly,the seventh circuit held that the employee actions were without authorization for purposes of a.id.at.
if we applied the reasoning in citrin to this case,brekka would have breached his duty of loyalty to lvrc when he allegedly resolved to transfer key lvrc documents and information to his personal computer to further his own competing business,and at that point his authorization to access the computer would have ended.applying this reasoning,brekka would have acted without authorization for purposes of a and once his mental state changed from loyal employee to disloyal competitor.
