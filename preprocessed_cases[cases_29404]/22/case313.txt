plaintiff amway corporation amway appeals from the district court order granting summary judgment in favor of defendants the procter and gamble company,the procter and gamble distributing company collectively p g,and the law firm of dinsmore shohl dinsmore p g and dinsmore collectively appellees,in amway diversity action raising a michigan claim of tortious interference with contract and with actual and prospective business relations,over the publication on the internet of an allegedly defamatory complaint filed by p g in federal court.following the close of extensive discovery in this corporate grudge match,which included the depositions of some eighty witnesses,the district court found that there was no evidence of a conspiracy between the appellees and the other defendants to publish the complaint that amway had failed to show that the appellees acted with actual malice and,in the alternative,that the appellees actions were protected by michigan fair reporting privilege.on appeal,amway argues that,because the appellees engaged in commercial speech,amway does not need to prove actual malice in this case that questions of material fact exist as to the existence of a conspiracy and that michigan reporting privilege for public documents does not protect parties such as p g and dinsmore who participated in both the filing of the documents in a court proceeding and the publication of those court documents on the internet.because we find that the michigan fair reporting privilege does apply to the appellees presumed publication of public court documents on the internet,we will affirm the judgment of the district court.
procedural history 
this case represents the third lawsuit in what the district court below correctly described as a long history of corporate warfare between amway and p amway originally brought this action against p g,alleging tortious interference with business relations,after sidney schwartz schwartz,the creator and editor of an website entitled amway the untold story,published a complaint filed by p g against amway in a texas federal district court,alleging,among other things,that amway operates as an illegal pyramid scheme.amway amended its complaint to add dinsmore,schwartz,and kenneth lowndes lowndes as defendants.
p g,dinsmore,and schwartz moved for summary judgment,arguing that the website was protected speech that amway was a public figure and needed to prove actual malice that there was no evidence that the defendant actions interfered with any of amway business relationships and that amway could not prove the existence of a conspiracy among the defendants.amway filed a brief in opposition to the motion,with more than exhibits,arguing that sufficient evidence existed for a reasonable trier of fact to find in amway favor.the district court,who had jurisdiction over this diversity action pursuant to,entered an order and partial judgment granting appellees motions for summary judgment,but denied schwartz motion after finding him to be in a completely different posture than p g and dinsmore.amway and schwartz subsequently settled their differences and entered into a stipulation dismissing all claims and counterclaims between them.the district court made its summary judgment order final by entering a default judgment against lowndes,who was the last defendant remaining before the district court.amway timely appealed the order and partial judgment and all prior rulings in this action,as well as an order denying its motion to supplement the record in opposition to defendant summary judgment motions.this court has jurisdiction to hear this appeal pursuant to.
factual background 
recitation of the extensive and history between p g and amway would take a writing as long as both the old and new testaments and involve at least one of the good book more prominent players.although each side would likely argue,if given the chance,that its opponent was in the garden advising the serpent when eve took her first bite of the apple,for our purposes we need only go back to the and satan rumored more recent activity with and interest in soap products.
for more than twenty years,rumors of a relationship between lucifer and the soap manufacturer p spread by amway circled the globe,dogging p g like a hound of hell despite every effort to eliminate the rumors through both public relations and litigation.see proctor gamble haugen,cir haugen i the and the widespread use of the internet brought a resurgence of the rumor throughout the world.following this new outbreak,p g learned that randy haugen,an amway distributor in utah,had broadcast an audio version of the rumor via amway internal business communications system in.in,p g brought suit against haugen and amway in the federal district court of utah,procter gamble haugen,dist.lexis,claiming that as a result of the subject message and other similar missives disseminated by defendants,p g lost customers concerned about supporting satan through their purchase of p g products.haugen i,at.the district court granted amway motion for summary judgment,finding that the message did not relate to qualities or characteristics of p g products and,therefore,the claim fell outside the ambit of the lanham act.id.at.the tenth circuit agreed with the district court holding,but nonetheless reversed the district court,deciding that the lower court should also look at whether the subject message was clearly related to p g commercial activities,a question the appellate court admitted p g failed properly to raise below.id.at.on remand,the district court dismissed all of p g claims that remained.procter gamble haugen,d,and the tenth circuit affirmed.procter gamble haugen,cir haugen ii.
while searching for information on the amway corporation during the prosecution of the utah suit,an attorney at dinsmore who was representing p g in that action discovered the website created and maintained by schwartz,a amway opponent.the website contained extensive information and documentation on amway.schwartz had maintained his site for eight months and accumulated thousands of pages of news articles,emails,and court documents from cases filed against amway.in october of,dinsmore attorneys met with schwartz at his oregon home and retained him as a consultant,to assist dinsmore in obtaining evidence and information about amway that might be useful in the utah litigation,and to provide leads concerning other potential sources of such evidence.to aid schwartz ability to assist in the utah proceedings,dinsmore provided schwartz with copies of some of the filings in the utah case,as well as copies of public filings in two other cases cairns amway,no,and setzer amway.
p g discovered in the course of the utah litigation that haugen dissemination of the rumor of p g satanic connections extended into texas.p g eventually brought suit in texas,alleging claims almost identical to the claims brought in the utah case,and also claiming fraud and specific violations of the rico act stemming from amway allegedly illegal pyramid structure.procter gamble amway,d the texas district court dismissed a majority of p g claims on res judicata grounds following the dismissal of the factually similar claims by the utah district court.the texas district court dismissed the remaining claims on several other grounds,including standing and the expiration of state statutes of limitation.although the fifth circuit affirmed part of the district court dismissal of p g claims,the circuit court reversed a majority of the district court holding,including the judgment based upon res judicata,the dismissal of p g lanham act claims,and the dismissal of p g civil rico claims.see procter gamble amway,cir.it appears from the record that the remaining claims in this case were scheduled for trial in january of,but it is unclear from the parties briefs whether there has been any conclusion to the proceedings.
at some point after p g filed its lawsuit in texas,schwartz asked dinsmore for a copy of the texas complaint.after dinsmore refused to supply schwartz with any documents filed in the texas litigation,schwartz obtained a copy of the complaint on his own and billed dinsmore for his copying expenses schwartz eventually posted the entirety of some of the documents from the earlier the setzer dinsmore had provided him,as well as the texas complaint he had obtained on his own.
in the present action,amway identified statements published on schwartz website that it claims are falsehoods.of those,eighteen were attributable to the appellees.these eighteen statements include sixteen paragraphs in the texas complaint,involving allegations that amway is an illegal pyramid scheme and that amway violated the rico act,and two statements in the complaint filed in the setzer case,in which neither p g nor dinsmore was involved.amway concedes that both complaints are public documents filed in a federal district court and available to the public.

amway claim 
amway asserts that schwartz and appellees conspired to disrupt the business structure and relationships of amway by disseminating untrue allegations.similar to p g complaint against the plaintiff,amway complaint here claims that the appellees conduct cost amway business and was undertaken with a malicious and manifest disregard for the rights of amway.the district court,clearly frustrated with both parties,narrowed its focus in this case down to what it believed to be the key issue before effort to recover damages for a speech tort committed by appellees.the court opinion correctly focuses on the fact that amway only allegation involves the appellees action of giving the documents to schwartz with the intent that the documents would be posted on the internet.in finding for the appellees,the court made several observations the evidence does not support a finding of a conspiracy not every document allegedly provided by the defendants is at issue in the case amway attributes only eighteen allegedly defamatory statements to the defendants all the posted documents were publicly available none of the allegedly defamatory statements is new amway is a public figure and the suit is really about business competition and bad blood rather than about the spread of rumors or the published attacks.the court went on to find that the relationship between schwartz and the appellees was not so irregular as to require an inference of a conspiracy under michigan law,and amway failed to provide any actual evidence of an agreement between the parties indicating their desire to interfere with amway business relations.additionally,the court found that the speech alleged to be defamatory was privileged and subject to first amendment protections,and that a public to prove not only that the speech was false,but that the defendants acted with malice or with the knowledge that their statements were false or made with reckless disregard of whether they were false.finally,the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment by applying michigan fair reporting privilege,which protects individuals who fairly and accurately report information that substantially represents matters contained in court records.
michigan fair reporting privilege 
under the michigan statute 
damages shall not be awarded in a libel action for the publication or broadcast of a fair and true report of matters of public record,a public and official proceeding,or of a governmental notice,announcement,written or recorded report or record generally available to the public,or act or action of a public body,or for a heading of the report which is a fair and true headnote of the report.this privilege shall not apply to a libel which is contained in a matter added by a person concerned in the publication or contained in the report of anything said or done at the time and place of the public and official proceeding or governmental notice,announcement,written or recorded report or record generally available to the public,or act or action of a public body,which was not a part of the public and official proceeding or governmental notice,announcement,written or recorded report or record generally available to the public,or act or action of a public body.
mcla amway does not dispute that,under this law,a verbatim reproduction of a public court document would be privileged.rather,amway argues that p g and created the complaint in the texas litigation and participated in the publication of the documents on schwartz not protected by the privilege 
in support of its position,amway cites park detroit free press,where the michigan supreme court said,i f pleadings and other documents can be published to the world by any one who gets access to them,no more effectual way of doing malicious mischief with impunity could be devised than filing papers containing false and scurrilous charges,and getting those printed as news.id.at.the park decision is consistent with the reporting privilege contained in the second restatement of torts.section of the second restatement provides 
the publication of defamatory matter concerning another in a report of an official action or proceeding or of a meeting open to the public that deals with a matter of public concern is privileged if the report is accurate and complete or a fair abridgement of the occurrence reported.
restatement second of torts.this privilege,however,is not absolute.similar to the court language in park,comment c provides,in relevant part 
a person can not confer this privilege upon himself by making the original defamatory publication himself and then reporting to other people what he had stated.this is true whether the original publication was privileged or not.nor may he confer the privilege upon a third person,even a member of the communications media,by making the original statement under a collusive arrangement with that person for the purpose of conferring the privilege upon him.
restatement second of torts cmt.c.if the publication involves some form of judicial proceeding,there must be official action in the proceeding before one can invoke the privilege 
a report of a judicial proceeding implies that some official action has been taken by the officer or body whose proceedings are thus reported.the publication,therefore,of the contents of preliminary pleadings such as a complaint or petition,before any judicial action has been taken is not within the rule stated in this section.an important reason for this position has been to prevent implementation of a scheme to file a complaint for the purpose of establishing a privilege to publicize its content and then dropping the action.see comment c.it is not necessary,however,that a final disposition be made of the matter in question it is enough that some judicial action has been taken so that,in the normal progress of the proceeding,a final decision will be rendered.so too,the fact that the proceedings are ex parte rather than inter partes is immaterial if the matter has come officially before the tribunal and action has been taken in reference to it.
