moses appeals from the district court order denying a new trial and its judgment in favor of defendant comprehensive software systems,css,claiming that it was prejudiced by the exclusion of evidence at trial.moses also appeals from the district court dismissal of moses claims against defendants southwest securities,southwest,and david glatstein and its refusal to grant moses leave to file a third amended complaint.we affirm.
moses planned to initiate a new business model as an online stock brokerage firm that would charge a monthly subscription fee to customers instead of a fee for each transaction.it began searching for a software company that could provide software with automated front and capabilities for stock trades that would comply with securities and exchange commission and national association of security dealers regulations.it began to work with css in,and hired imis,mastech,a technology consulting firm,to test and evaluate the css software system in light of moses needs.mastech tested the system in may and produced for moses a a gap analysis that highlighted the system strengths and limitations,noting that several aspects of the capabilities were still under development.after mastech finished its testing,moses and css executives met on june,to discuss goals and a potential time frame for the installation and initiation of the css system at moses facilities.the parties disagree over whether they agreed upon a particular time frame at the june meeting.
although moses and css did not sign a formal contract,they negotiated a letter of intent to work together in establishing an appropriate software system for moses needs.moses sought investors and initiated a costly marketing strategy that included advertising during the super bowl.moses executives became dissatisfied with css work,frustrated by the slow progress in providing the capabilities and functionality in the system that moses expected.moses claimed that css had represented that the system was already complete and functional at the june meeting,and it expected a faster conversion.
moses subsequently concluded that the css system did not work and asked css to leave its premises in february.it filed suit in missouri state court,raising state tort claims for fraudulent misrepresentation,negligent misrepresentation and negligence.css removed the case to federal court and moved to compel arbitration.the district court denied css motion to compel arbitration,a ruling that we affirmed on appeal.comprehensive software systems,cir.moses filed an amended complaint,adding several claims and additional defendants,including southwest and glatstein.after the district court found that moses allegations of conspiracy were too indefinite to resolve various motions to dismiss that had been raised.order of,moses filed a second amended complaint.when southwest and glatstein again filed a motion to dismiss,the district court dismissed the claims against them without prejudice under federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim.order of.moses moved to file a third amended complaint,adding more defendants and repleading the claims against southwest and glatstein.the district court denied leave to file the amended complaint.the remaining parties continued with discovery,during which the district court consistently denied moses discovery requests,which were designed to reveal the status and functionality of css software at southwest and scottsdale securities,scottsdale,two companies that had also hired css to provide software for securities transactions.
the claims against css ultimately proceeded to a jury trial.during trial,the district court prohibited any discussion of southwest and its relationship with css or its experience with css software.the district court submitted all the claims to the jury except the promissory estoppel claim.the jury returned a verdict for css on each of moses claims and also awarded to css on its counterclaim seeking damages for unpaid work in quantum meruit.moses filed a motion for a new prejudice in light of all the excluded the district court denied.
as stated earlier,moses appeals from the judgment in favor of css and from the denial of its motion for a new trial,alleging numerous errors that it claims resulted in prejudice.a trial court must determine whether an evidentiary ruling was so prejudicial as to require a new trial which would be likely to produce a different result.hercules,cir.we review a district court denial of a motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion,giving great deference to the district court ruling.children broad.walt disney,cir.

moses first argues that the district court improperly excluded during trial much of its evidence relating to css misrepresentations.having granted css motion in limine to exclude reference,argument,and discussion of the installations conversions that css was involved with at or about the similar time frames at southwest and scottsdale,the district court heard and rejected numerous offers of proof by moses as the trial proceeded,finding that such evidence was irrelevant and would serve only to distract the jury from the key issues.moses asserts that several pieces of excluded evidence would have provided substantial support for its claims of intentional misrepresentation and concealment.in particular,it argues that the evidence that css made statements at the june,meeting and in subsequent conversations that its system worked at southwest constituted the heart of the misrepresentation claim.moses also argues that the evidence that southwest and scottsdale css systems were not functioning properly was central to its ability to prove both that it was css software and not moses mismanagement that caused the problems,and that css had prior knowledge of the problems within its system that it failed to communicate to moses.
we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by excluding the proffered evidence.it was reasonable for the district court to conclude that evidence involving two companies could confuse the jury and was not probative of the central issues in the case,particularly when moses had failed to establish an adequate basis for its assumptions that the other companies systems were virtually identical to moses system.without a showing that the systems were virtually identical,that the excluded statements included definitive promises,or that css was intentionally concealing the state of its software from moses,the status of the css systems of other css clients is not clearly relevant.
the exclusion of the evidence was also not clearly prejudicial because there was substantial testimony about the communications between css and moses regarding the particular system that css was installing for moses.we can not say that further evidence of statements by css referencing its work elsewhere would likely have produced a different outcome in the case.see,at.moses chief executive officer,jim winkelmann,testified that he informed css of his desired timetables for public launch of his new business model at the june meeting and that css told him that that would not be a problem.he testified that he understood css assurance as a promise.in an offer of proof,winkelmann further testified that he was told that the system worked at southwest,and that he assumed based on that representation that the system was fully functioning.the statement about southwest system was neither clearly a promise nor an intended inducement,and it would have been unreasonable for winkelmann to rely on it in light of the gap analysis report that stated that css system was not complete and still had modules under development,a report that winkelmann had already received at the time he made the decision to work with css accordingly,the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the proffered testimony that css had described its work with the system at southwest as successful.likewise,we conclude that the offers of proof by moses remaining witnesses were of similarly limited probative force,and thus we find that the rulings excluding the proffered testimony did not result in prejudice sufficient to warrant reversal.
moses next asserts that the district court erred in granting css motion to quash moses discovery request for information about southwest and scottsdale,contending that it was thereby prevented from discovering relevant evidence.

moses listed several items that the district court barred from discovery and stated that it was prejudiced by the limitation.it did not,however,specify the way in which the various protective orders and discovery denials resulted in fundamental unfairness.most of the discovery requests at issue would have involved depositions of and document production by scottsdale executives and employees.although the district court did not set forth its reasoning in ruling on the discovery requests,the record does not support a finding that an abuse of discretion occurred,nor does it establish that moses suffered prejudice as a result of the rulings.
moses also claims that the district court committed error when it refused moses proffered jury instructions.in reviewing alleged errors in jury instructions,we ask whether the instructions,taken as a whole and viewed in light of the evidence and applicable law,fairly and adequately submitted the issues in the case to the jury.children broad,at quotation omitted.the district court must instruct the jury on the plaintiff claims and theories if the theories of law are legally correct,supported by the evidence,and brought to the court attention in a timely request,but is not bound to give the party requested instruction.board of water works trustees alvord,burdick howson,cir.in diversity cases such as this one,state law controls the substantive content of the instructions that are given.hoselton metz baking,cir.

we agree with the district court that the record contains no evidence that css promised at the june,meeting to have the system completed by a particular deadline and that no reasonable jury could find that such a promise had been made.moses asserts that winkelmann mentioning of dates for a desired launch and the css representatives response that there would be no problems amounted to a promise.moses also claims that the fact that actions to begin the implementation of the software were taken immediately following the meeting supports the idea that there was a mutually understood promise.even taking everything moses claims as true,the evidence does not support a claim for promissory estoppel because moses can not show the existence of a specific promise,the first element of the claim.the general statement that there would not be a problem is much too general to constitute a binding promise for either the time frame or the system capabilities.
moses next asserts that the district court erred in refusing its proffered version of the instructions with respect to the claims that were submitted to the jury.moses argues that,because the instructions it submitted correctly stated the law,they should have been accepted.the district court has broad discretion,however,to determine the form of the jury instructions,and we will reverse only if the error affected the substantive rights of the parties.gasper stores,cir.the relevant question is therefore whether the instructions submitted adequately stated the elements of the tort claims at issue.moses has failed to allege any legal errors in the given instructions,simply asserting that the instructions did not fully describe the alleged misrepresentations of css.
we agree that the proposed instructions e,f,and i,for fraudulent misrepresentation and negligent misrepresentation,differed from submitted instructions,and in the manner in which they framed the scope of the alleged misrepresentations.the submitted instructions focused on whether the statement it worked when spoken in response to moses inquiry about whether the css system was sufficient for moses to trade and process cns eligible securities for cash and account for the trades on a settlement date basis was intended to cause moses to rely upon such representation in deciding to implement the css system.appellee css app.in contrast,moses requested instructions focused on whether css represented to winkelmann that the css system had sufficient functionality for moses to operate as a self clearing broker dealer trading cns eligible securities for cash,intending that moses rely upon such representation appellant app.
the district court acted within its discretion when it formulated the instructions in such a way as to tie specific testimony at trial to potential conclusions instead of using the conclusory statements in moses instructions.the instructions for the misrepresentation claims correctly stated the tort elements under missouri law,did not imply factual conclusions for the jury,and did not prevent the jury from considering the full context of the facts the instructions mentioned.the court instructions for fraudulent omission and negligent omission also correctly stated the law,elaborating the factual findings necessary to find for the plaintiff.accordingly,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its broad discretion to frame appropriate jury instructions.
moses additionally appeals from the district court grant of defendants southwest and glatstein motion to dismiss the claims against them in the second amended complaint for failure to state a claim.b.moses added southwest and glatstein as defendants in the second amended complaint and alleged that they were liable for conspiracy,fraudulent misrepresentation,fraudulent omission,negligent misrepresentation,negligence,and promissory estoppel.
