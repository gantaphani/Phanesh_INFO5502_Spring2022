defendant appellant robert beam runyan was convicted of sexual exploitation of a child in violation of and of distribution,receipt,and possession of child pornography in violation of.in two separate actions,runyan appeals his conviction and the district court denial of his motion for a new trial.on september,we consolidated these two cases for the purposes of appeal.on december,this court issued a opinion holding that aspects of the government investigation violated the fourth amendment and remanding the case to the district court for further factfinding that would enable this court to assess the applicability of exceptions to the exclusionary rule.on january,the district court issued an order providing the requisite findings of fact.we now conclude our analysis of runyan fourth amendment claims and address runyan remaining claims,from both his appeal of his conviction and his appeal of the district court denial of his motion for new trial.for the following reasons,we affirm runyan convictions for receipt and possession of child pornography and for sexual exploitation of a child,but reverse his conviction for distribution of child pornography.we also vacate runyan sentence and remand to the district court for entry of judgment and resentencing consistent with this opinion.
factual and procedural background 
the facts of this case are described in detail in this court december,decision.accordingly,we only briefly reiterate the underlying facts of the case.we address specific facts pertinent to each of runyan remaining claims in greater detail within our discussion of each claim below.
in brief,robert beam runyan runyan and his wife judith runyan judith separated in january of.in june of,judith accompanied at different times by her daughter and various friends made several trips to runyan ranch to retrieve items of her personal property while runyan was.at the ranch,judith and one of her companions found two duffel bags in the barn containing items of pornography,including polaroid photographs of two individuals,one of whom appeared to be a very young teenager.judith removed these items from the ranch.judith and her companions also removed from the ranch a desktop computer and a collection of floppy disks,compact discs cds,and zip disks collectively,the disks that were lying on the floor surrounding the computer.
one of judith companions,brandie epp,reassembled the computer at judith residence and examined approximately of the cds and floppy disks taken from the ranch.epp discovered that some of these cds and floppy disks contained images of child pornography epp contacted the sheriff department and turned these materials over to a deputy.over the next few weeks,judith turned over various additional items found at the runyan ranch to a number of different law enforcement agencies.these items included the desktop computer,additional disks containing child pornography,and the duffel bags found in the barn.
texas ranger bobby grubbs ranger grubbs used his computer to view some of the disks delivered by judith and observed images of child pornography.he printed out several of these images on a color printer and showed them to members of the coleman county district attorney staff.an investigator in the district attorney office,darla tibbetts,tentatively identified the girl photographed in one of the images.an intern working for the district attorney office,melissa payne,was brought to the sheriff office to assist with the identification.she positively identified the girl in the pictures as misty metcalf misty,a former high school classmate 
on june,upon learning that he was a potential suspect,runyan met with ranger grubbs.at this meeting,after runyan had been given miranda warnings,he stated that he found a bag of pornography at a rest stop.runyan admitted that he viewed the materials in the bag and that,out of curiosity,he used his computer to view child pornography available on the internet 
on july,customs service special agent rick nuckles agent nuckles joined the investigation.agent nuckles examined several images from each floppy disk,zip disk,and cd turned over by judith and epp.agent nuckles found two images of misty,apparently taken with a digital camera or taken with a polaroid camera and then scanned into a computer.
also on july,tibbetts and ranger grubbs interviewed misty.misty stated that runyan hired her when she was a young teenager to perform odd jobs around his ranch and to iron clothes for him.she said that he approached her when she was fifteen about posing for nude photographs.misty told tibbetts that runyan had taken sexually explicit photographs of her on numerous occasions when she was between the ages of fifteen and seventeen.she reported that runyan had sometimes paid her approximately five dollars per photographic session and that he had promised her more money once he sold the pictures over the internet to customers in japan.
agent nuckles then filed two applications for federal search warrants,supported by his own affidavits.the first application sought a warrant to search the desktop computer and all the disks for files containing illegal images.the second application sought a warrant to search runyan ranch house for any and all computers,computer hardware,software,and computer devices.the affidavits supporting these applications included statements made by misty and judith to ranger grubbs as well as information from runyan voluntary statement to ranger grubbs.in addition,one of the affidavits contained a statement indicating that agent nuckles had conducted a cursory review of the computer storage media.magistrate judge philip lane issued both warrants.law enforcement officials subsequently searched runyan ranch house and discovered a computer backup tape that contained one picture of child pornography.
on october,runyan was indicted on six counts of child pornography charges.runyan filed three separate motions to suppress the evidence against him,primarily contending that the searches of the disks conducted by various law enforcement officials involved in the investigation violated his fourth amendment rights.the trial court held a hearing on runyan motions to suppress on april.at the close of the hearing,the trial court denied the motions,finding that the police searches did not violate runyan fourth amendment rights.
on april,a jury convicted runyan of four counts count sexual exploitation of a child in violation of count distribution of child pornography in violation of a count receipt of child pornography in violation of a and count possession of child pornography in violation of b.on july,the district court sentenced runyan to months on count months on count,to be served consecutively to count and months on counts and,to run concurrently with the sentence imposed on count,for a total sentence of months of imprisonment.in addition,the district court imposed a term of supervised release and mandatory special assessments totaling.
runyan timely appealed his convictions and his sentence,contending that the trial court erred in failing to suppress the evidence obtained directly and indirectly from the police searches there was insufficient evidence introduced at trial to establish the interstate commerce element of each of the four charges the trial court erred in refusing to order the government to produce misty boyfriend computer and in refusing to conduct an in camera review of evidence on that computer that runyan contends was exculpatory the trial court erred in admitting evidence that runyan refused to consent to the search of the desktop computer and the trial court erred in not grouping all the counts of his conviction in the sentencing determination while that appeal was pending before this court,runyan filed a motion for new trial based on evidence,alleging that misty boyfriend computer contained exculpatory evidence that the government withheld prior to trial.the district court denied this motion on september,and runyan timely appealed to this court.we consolidated runyan two actions for the purposes of appeal on september.
ii.runyan fourth amendment claims 
runyan seeks to suppress evidence obtained as a result of the state and federal law enforcement officials searches of the disks.runyan argues that these searches violated the fourth amendment and that no exceptions to the exclusionary rule are applicable.runyan also seeks to suppress evidence obtained pursuant to the search warrants,arguing that such evidence is the fruit of the poisonous tree because these warrants were procured based on information obtained through the prior illegal searches 
in reviewing a district court denial of a motion to suppress evidence,we review the district court factual findings for clear error and its conclusions regarding the constitutionality of a warrantless search de novo.united states vega,cir.we view the facts underlying the suppression determination in the light most favorable to the prevailing party,which in this case is the government.united states howard,cir.it is the defendant burden to prove a fourth amendment violation by a preponderance of the evidence.united states riazco,cir.however,once the defendant proves such a violation,the burden shifts to the government to demonstrate why the exclusionary rule should not apply to the fruits of the illegal search or seizure.united states houltin,cir.
in our prior opinion,this court held that the police violated runyan fourth amendment rights when they conducted a warrantless examination of disks that the private searchers judith and epp had not examined.see united states runyan,cir.while we noted that the disks and any evidence obtained as a result of the information found on the disks were potentially subject to suppression due to this fourth amendment violation,we indicated that this evidence would still be admissible if the government could demonstrate that an exception to the exclusionary rule is applicable in the instant case.we then remanded to the district court for factual findings relevant to this issue.the government now argues that this court should apply the independent source exception to the exclusionary rule,which dictates that evidence obtained from an illegal search is admissible if the same evidence was also obtained from a lawful source independent of the illegality.
as we noted in our december,opinion,under the independent source exception to the exclusionary rule,the government must make two showings in order for a lawful search pursuant to a warrant to be deemed genuinely independent of a prior illegal search that the police would still have sought a warrant in the absence of the illegal search and that the warrant would still have been issued,that there would still have been probable cause to support the warrant if the supporting affidavit had not contained information stemming from the illegal search.id.at citing murray united states,d.in the instant case,the government contends that the magistrate judge would have issued the two warrants permitting the police to search runyan computer and disks and runyan home even if the police had never conducted a search of the storage media.according to the government,the information that the police obtained from interviews with judith and misty and from runyan admissions in his statement to ranger grubbs was sufficient to compel the police to seek a warrant and to establish probable cause for a warrant to issue.thus,because the police obtained the same information acquired through their search of the disks from the subsequent,lawful searches pursuant to the warrant,these subsequent searches were an independent source of the images on the disks and this evidence is admissible at trial.
in our december,opinion,we noted that one of the affidavits submitted by agent nuckles in support of the warrant applications contained a brief reference to his search of the computer storage devices.we found that the inclusion of this statement in the warrant application raised a question about what role the searches might have played in the issuance of the warrants.because the district court made no factual findings at the suppression hearing enabling this court to address this issue,we remanded the case to the district court to conduct such proceedings as are necessary to make findings of fact addressing these questions.
on january,the district court conducted an evidentiary hearing on these issues.agent nuckles,ranger grubbs,and magistrate judge philip lane all testified at this hearing.on january,the district court entered,inter alia,the following factual findings addressing whether the police would have sought the warrant in the absence of the illegal search 
agent nuckles s decision to seek the search warrants in this case was unaffected by the fact that the police,including himself,may have looked at more disks than did the private parties.
the court finds that the police would have sought the warrants even if they had not exceeded the scope of the private party searches.
in support of these findings,the district court noted that 
t he police,in total,received thirteen recordable compacts sic discs in this case,only ten of which contained evidence of child pornography.of those thirteen,eleven initially came from brandie epp and judith runyan and had clearly been searched by private parties assuming without deciding that the two recordable cds not initially turned over contained child pornography images,then eight of the eleven cds that were initially turned over and previously searched by private citizens necessarily contained images of child pornography the fact that the police searched all the storage media and additionally recovered one zip disk,to floppies,and between zero and two additional cds containing child pornographic images did not tip the balance in favor of the decision to seek warrants.in other words,floppies plus cds plus zip disk equals approximately external storage media containers.the fact that the police determined that all contained child pornographic images instead of limiting their activities to of the did not tip the scale in favor of them seeking warrants.
we review these factual findings for clear error.see united states grosenheider,cir.runyan contends that the district court findings are clearly erroneous because agent nuckles inclusion of a reference to his cursory review of the disks in one of his affidavits signals that his decision to seek the warrant was motivated by his examination of the disks.we disagree.the fact that agent nuckles made a passing reference to his prior illegal search activity in his warrant application is not dispositive to our determination whether he would have sought the warrant in the absence of the prior illegal searches our review of the record reveals ample support for the district court finding that agent nuckles would have sought the warrants even if he had limited his examination to the same disks that were examined by the private searchers.
as agent nuckles testified at the hearing on remand,the statements provided by judith and misty,along with runyan statement to ranger grubbs,provided sufficient justification for agent nuckles to seek a warrant to search runyan home and computer equipment.moreover,seeking a warrant under such circumstances was apparently required by the investigative policies of the customs service.under these circumstances,the district court finding that agent nuckles would have sought both warrants even if he had never exceeded the scope of the private search is not clearly erroneous.
the second prong of the murray inquiry asks whether the issuance of the warrant as opposed to the decision to seek the warrant was independent of any illegal search activity.as runyan correctly points out,when a search conducted pursuant to a warrant is alleged to be an independent source of otherwise tainted evidence and the warrant application contains information obtained from the prior illegal search or,as in the instant case,contains a reference to the prior illegal search,this court task is to determine whether there would have been probable cause to support the issuance of the warrant had the tainted information been omitted from the application.see united states restrepo,cir agreeing that the proper approach is to excise from the warrant affidavit those facts that were gleaned from the illegal search,and then to consider whether the affidavit remaining information is sufficient to constitute probable cause.this probable cause inquiry is a question of law that we review de novo.united states hassan,cir.
in the instant case,the only information that must be stricken from agent nuckles affidavits to purge the affidavits of any reference to the illegal search is a short statement in one of the affidavits indicating that nuckles conducted a cursory review of the disks we find that there remains ample evidence in the applications to support a finding of probable cause.this conclusion is bolstered by the district court finding on remand that magistrate judge lane would have issued the warrants even if one of the warrant applications had not contained a reference to agent nuckles prior illegal search activities this finding indicates that the magistrate judge,who is more familiar with the detailed facts of this case,would have arrived at the same probable cause determination that this court reaches today.
in conclusion,we find that the searches conducted pursuant to the two warrants issued by magistrate judge lane are an independent source of the evidence obtained in the illegal searches of the disks.this evidence was properly deemed admissible.moreover,based on our determination that the warrants were issued independently of the prior illegal search,we find that any additional evidence obtained pursuant to these warrants is not the fruit of the poisonous tree and is therefore admissible.thus,the district court did not err in refusing to suppress any of the evidence against runyan 
iii.runyan sufficiency of evidence claims 
runyan challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting all four counts of conviction sexual exploitation of a child in violation of,distribution of child pornography in violation of a,receipt of child pornography in violation of a,and possession of child pornography in violation of b.this court reviews a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a conviction de novo,considering whether a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.united states de leon,cir.all reasonable inferences from the evidence must be construed in favor of the jury verdict.united states martinez,cir citing glasser united states.
runyan argues that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction for sexual exploitation of a child because the government failed to prove that runyan knew the images of misty would be transported in interstate or foreign commerce.runyan similarly argues that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction for distribution,receipt,or possession of child pornography because the government failed to prove that any illegal image was transported in interstate commerce.we consider each of these claims in turn.
a.the sufficiency of the evidence regarding sexual exploitation of a child 
the jury convicted runyan of sexual exploitation of a child in violation of,based on runyan conduct in photographing misty metcalf.section reads,in pertinent part,as follows 
a any person who employs,uses,persuades,induces,entices,or coerces any minor to engage in any sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct,shall be punished as provided under subsection d,if such person knows or has reason to know that such visual depiction will be transported in interstate or foreign commerce or mailed,if that visual depiction was produced using materials that have been mailed,shipped,or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means,including by computer,or if such visual depiction has actually been transported in interstate or foreign commerce or mailed.
runyan argues that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to demonstrate that he knew or had reason to know that the images of misty would be transported in interstate or foreign commerce.
according to misty testimony at trial,when runyan initially asked her to pose for nude photographs,he explained to her that he was planning to sell the photographs to people in another country.misty further testified that runyan said he would use the internet to solicit people to buy these photographs.runyan contends that misty testimony is insufficient to support his conviction because such statements do not demonstrate that he knew or had reason to know that images of child pornography would be transported in interstate or foreign commerce.according to runyan,a statement indicating that an individual is planning to sell images over the internet is insufficient to establish the interstate nexus required for conviction under.
as runyan correctly notes,this circuit has not yet decided whether an internet transmission,in and of itself,constitutes interstate transportation sufficient to satisfy the interstate commerce element of,the element requiring that an offender must know or ha ve reason to know that such visual depiction will be transported in interstate or foreign commerce or mailed.in the instant case we now squarely face this question.we join the first circuit in holding that t ransmission of photographs by means of the internet is tantamount to moving photographs across state lines and thus constitutes transportation in interstate commerce for the purposes of.united states carroll,cir 
the factual circumstances at issue in carroll are remarkably similar to the instant case.in carroll,the defendant found pornographic polaroid photographs of the defendant niece among his personal effects.id.at.after an fbi investigation,the defendant was charged with sexual exploitation of a child in violation of.the victim testified at trial that the defendant informed her at the time the photographs were taken that he intended to scan the images into a friend computer and distribute them over the internet.id.at.the defendant was convicted and subsequently appealed,challenging the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction.like runyan,the defendant in carroll argued that the victim testimony was insufficient to establish that he knew or had reason to know that the pictures would be transported in interstate commerce.the first circuit disagreed,holding that the victim testimony was sufficient to sustain a finding that the defendant intended to transport the pornographic depictions in interstate commerce and therefore knew that they would be so transported.id.while the carroll court recognized that there were alternate ways that the government could have established the interstate commerce element of the offense in that case,the court clearly indicated that the victim testimony alone was sufficient to establish the required interstate commerce connection.id.indicating that the victim testimony,if believed,proved the government point that the defendant intended to transport child pornography in interstate commerce.we similarly conclude in the instant case that misty testimony suffices to sustain the jury finding that runyan knew or had reason to know that the images of her would be transported in interstate commerce via the internet.
runyan further argues that misty was an unreliable witness whose testimony was not credible and that her testimony thus can not form the sole basis of his conviction for sexual exploitation of a child.while we recognize that misty testimony was not without its inconsistencies,runyan criticisms of misty credibility go to the weight of the evidence,not its sufficiency.in assessing the sufficiency of the evidence supporting runyan conviction,this court does not evaluate the weight of the evidence or the credibility of witnesses.see united states delgado,cir.credibility assessments are squarely within the jury domain,and we decline runyan invitation to the jury assessment of misty testimony.accordingly,we find that the government presented sufficient evidence to support runyan conviction for sexual exploitation of a child.
b.the sufficiency of the evidence regarding distribution,receipt,and possession of child pornography 
runyan also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his convictions for distribution,receipt,and possession of child pornography under.runyan contends that the government failed to demonstrate adequately that any of the illegal images introduced at trial were transported in interstate commerce,a required element of each of these three charges.specifically,runyan argues that the government never proved that any of the particular images in question came from the internet,rather than from purely sources.according to runyan,the government impermissibly relied solely on inference to establish the interstate commerce connection required under.
in support of his argument,runyan relies primarily on this court decision in united states henriques,cir.in that case,defendant bart henriques was convicted of possession of child pornography under a prior version of that required the government to prove possession of three or more images of child pornography.henriques,at.henriques conviction was based on exactly three images.he challenged his conviction,arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that the three images were transported in interstate commerce.id.at.this court agreed and reversed henriques conviction.we noted that transport of goods through interstate commerce is an element of the crime under,and we adopted the tenth circuit holding that,when the interstate commerce element of is established via internet transmission,the government must independently link all the images upon which a conviction is based to the internet in order to obtain a conviction.id.at citing united states wilson,cir.
in examining the particular images at issue in henriques,we recognized that two of the three images in question were connected to interstate commerce by evidence introduced at trial.a witness in that case testified at trial that she observed henriques viewing images of child pornography on the internet,including one of the three images supporting his conviction.id.at.another of the images supporting henriques conviction had a website address embedded on it.id.while we indicated that such internal evidence of an internet origin was most likely sufficient to independently link this image to interstate commerce,we ultimately concluded that there was still insufficient evidence to support henriques conviction because there was no evidence indicating that the third image at issue came from the internet.we deemed the government proffered evidence demonstrating that henriques had access to the internet,and that his computer contained pornographic material insufficient to establish the requisite connection between the third image and interstate commerce.id.at.moreover,we indicated that the internet link established for the first two images supporting henriques conviction could not be imputed to the third image because each image had to be independently linked to the internet.id.at.
runyan contends that,as in henriques,the government in the instant case failed to independently link any of the images supporting his convictions for possession,receipt,and distribution of child pornography to interstate commerce.the government responds that a rational jury could have found that the interstate nexus was established in this case.the government points out that runyan admitted in his initial confession to agent nuckles that runyan knew the cds taken from his home contained child pornography that had come from the internet,and that he had received images of child pornography from the internet by accessing newsgroups and viewing images.the government further notes that both the defense expert,chancey green,and the government expert,agent wargo,testified at trial that some of the images on the disks found by judith and on the hard drive of runyan desktop computer came from the internet.finally,the government points to runyan statements to misty indicating that he trafficked internationally in child pornography as further evidence that the government sufficiently established the interstate commerce nexus underlying runyan convictions for distribution,receipt,and possession of child pornography.
before delving into the substance of the parties arguments,it merits notice that,unlike the defendant in henriques,runyan was charged and convicted under the current version of,which requires distribution,receipt,or possession of only one image in order to sustain a conviction reads,in pertinent part 
a any person who 
knowingly mails,or transports or ships in interstate or foreign commerce by any means,including by computer,any child pornography 
knowingly receives or distributes 
a any child pornography that has been mailed,or shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means,including by computer or 
b any material that contains child pornography that has been mailed,or shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means,including by computer 
a in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the united states,or on any land or building owned by,leased to,or otherwise used by or under the control of the united states government,or in the indian country as defined in section,knowingly possesses any book,magazine,periodical,film,videotape,computer disk,or any other material that contains an image of child pornography or 
b knowingly possesses any book,magazine,periodical,film,videotape,computer disk,or any other material that contains an image of child pornography that has been mailed,or shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means,including by computer,or that was produced using materials that have been mailed,or shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means,including by computer,
shall be punished as provided in subsection b.
runyan apparently reads henriques to suggest that the government must provide direct evidence akin to the eyewitness testimony addressing the first image in henriques in order to provide the requisite independent link between an image and the internet.this argument mischaracterizes our holding in henriques.henriques establishes that the government must provide some evidence linking the specific images supporting the conviction to the internet in order to establish an interstate commerce connection under.henriques,at.thus,as we indicated in henriques,it is not enough for the government merely to introduce evidence indicating that the defendant had internet access and that the defendant,at some point in time,accessed or downloaded images from pornography websites or newsgroups.id.at.rather,the government must make a specific connection between the images introduced at trial and the internet to provide the requisite jurisdictional nexus.we did not suggest in henriques that circumstantial evidence would be insufficient to establish such a link.indeed,henriques implicitly supports the notion that circumstantial evidence linking a particular image to the internet such as the presence of a website address embedded on the image can be sufficient evidence of interstate transportation to support a conviction under.id.at noting that one of the three images in question contain ed a web address embedded on the image and that it is possible for this internal evidence to support a connection to the internet accord united states hilton,cir adopting the analysis of henriques and concluding that the government i s not required to provide direct evidence of interstate transmission,thus upholding the defendant conviction for receipt and possession of child pornography based on expert testimony opining that the particular images at issue in that case most likely originated from the internet.
viewing the evidence in the instant case,as we must,in the light most favorable to the verdict,there is adequate circumstantial evidence to tie particular images of child pornography that were introduced into evidence at trial to the internet.for example,one image obtained from the hard drive of runyan computer had a website address embedded on it and contained language advertising the child pornography available at that website all uncensored child nude and porno lolita pics asian nudist and others and ultimate lolita nudist site.the website address and this advertising language provides circumstantial evidence that this image was obtained from the internet.in addition,the government expert,agent wargo,testified at trial as to his opinion that this image came from the internet.this evidence is sufficient to enable a rational jury to find that runyan received and possessed an image of child pornography that was transported in interstate commerce within the meaning of.accordingly,there was sufficient evidence to support runyan convictions for receipt and possession of child pornography.
runyan conviction for distribution of child pornography is more problematic.the distribution charge against runyan was not based on any evidence indicating that runyan transmitted to others the images he had stored on the disks or on the hard drive of his computer.instead,this charge was apparently based on runyan expressed intent to distribute via the internet the images of misty that he created.however,the government has not provided sufficient evidence directly tying the images of misty to the internet for the purposes of the distribution charge.misty testimony alone is insufficient to establish the interstate commerce element of a conviction under.
unlike a conviction for sexual exploitation of a minor under,which requires the government to prove that the defendant knew or had reason to know at the time that the images were created that those images will be transported in interstate or foreign commerce or mailed,emphasis added,a conviction for distribution of child pornography under requires the government to prove that the defendant knowingly distributed any child pornography that has been mailed,or shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means,including by computer or any material that contains child pornography that has been mailed,or shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means,including by computer,id.emphasis added.as the language of the two sections suggests,while evidence of a defendant intent to distribute child pornography via interstate commerce is adequate to satisfy the jurisdictional element of,see,united states buculei,cir noting that jurisdictional element limits this section applicability to a discrete set of activities defendants who plan to transport visual depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct in interstate commerce emphasis added,such evidence of intent appears insufficient to satisfy the jurisdictional element of.
there was no evidence presented at trial indicating that runyan actually disseminated the pictures of misty to anyone,much less that he had transported these images in interstate or foreign commerce via the internet or any other means.nor was there any evidence presented at trial indicating that runyan actually distributed any of the other images contained on the disks or on the hard drive of his computer by transporting these images in interstate or foreign commerce.under these circumstances,no reasonable jury could have found that runyan knowingly distributed child pornography or material containing child pornography or that such child pornography or material containing child pornography was mailed,shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.accordingly,we reverse the distribution count of runyan conviction.
iv.runyan claims based on the wood computer 
in the course of preparing runyan defense,his attorneys purchased a computer from misty,nathan wood the wood computer the defense retained possession of this computer for four months,apparently without investigating its contents.shortly before trial,the defense retained an expert,chancey green,to analyze the computer.green informed runyan attorneys that there were pornographic images on the computer depicting what he believed to be underage females.runyan attorneys then contacted officials from the united states customs service.according to the defense,these officials instructed runyan attorneys to turn the wood computer over to the customs service.the customs service officials also instructed green to destroy the mirror image of the wood computer hard drive that he had created.
runyan contends that,from the time that his attorneys relinquished the wood computer to the customs service until the time of trial,the defense was denied access to the computer.the government,in contrast,maintains that the defense had an open invitation to examine the wood computer and its contents while the computer was in the possession of the customs service.at the request of the government,agent nuckles conducted an analysis of the contents of the wood computer hard drive.this analysis was apparently not completed until after the trial began.
both parties agree that the wood computer was available at trial.indeed,the defense introduced the computer into evidence.on the second day of trial,runyan made a motion requesting that the court order the united states to produce copies of all graphic images on the wood computer,examine them in camera,and enter an order making all said images computer information available to defendant counsel.runyan alleged that this hard drive contained images of child pornography that would exculpate him on the fourth day of trial runyan made a similar motion requesting that the court order the united states to produce copies of all graphic images on this computer and deliver them to defendant counsel.the district court denied both motions.
green testified at trial for the defense,stating that he had found images of what he believed to be underage females on the wood computer.agent nuckles testified at trial that he found no images of child pornography on the wood computer.agent nuckles conceded that he found questionable images during his analysis,but stated that he found no five and child porn images.neither party introduced any images from the wood computer into evidence at trial.
subsequent to trial,runyan appellate counsel requested and received from the government a mirror image of the wood computer hard drive.two additional defense experts,hill and andrus,then examined a sample of images from the computer.hill concluded that eleven images in the sample were girls under age sixteen andrus concluded that ten images in the sample were girls under age sixteen.runyan alleges that these images constitute exculpatory evidence because they support his theory that misty was responsible for creating images of herself,and that it was misty,not runyan,who intended to distribute these images over the internet.
runyan claims on direct appeal 
in his direct appeal of his criminal conviction,runyan contends that the district court erred in refusing to order the government to produce images from the wood computer that are,according to runyan,exculpatory under brady maryland,d.runyan similarly argues that the district court erred in refusing to conduct an in camera review of materials on the wood computer to determine if exculpatory evidence was present.the district court denied these motions on the ground that there was no need for production or in camera inspection because the computer was readily available to the defense at the time these motions were made during the trial.
methods of enforcing disclosure requirements are generally left to the sound discretion of the trial court.see united states valera,cir.however,this court has held that,under certain circumstances,refusal to compel production or conduct an in camera review of brady materials can be reversible error.see,williams dutton,cir refusal to compel production united states gaston,cir refusal to conduct an in camera review.the district court in the instant case apparently concluded that brady was not implicated because the images in question were not being suppressed by the government.we agree.
we review a district court brady determinations de novo.united states dixon,cir.in order to establish a due process violation under brady,a defendant must show that evidence was suppressed the suppressed evidence was favorable to the defense and the suppressed evidence was material to either guilt or punishment.at.evidence is material under brady when there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different if the suppressed evidence had been disclosed to the defendant.united states gonzales,cir citing united states bagley,d.however,a defendant seeking merely an in camera inspection to determine whether a particular source contains brady material need only make a plausible showing that the file will produce material evidence.united states lowder,cir quoting pennsylvania ritchie,d.
in addressing runyan motions to compel production and in camera review of the images on the wood computer,we need not determine whether the images on the wood computer were material under brady and its progeny.we agree with the district court that,at the time of trial,the wood computer was not being suppressed.an order compelling the government to produce images on the wood computer or,similarly,an order requiring production of these images for the purposes of in camera review would have served no purpose.as the district court correctly recognized,the defense had full access to the wood computer and its contents during the trial.indeed,the record confirms that the defense was fully aware that the wood computer was available for inspection at the time of trial.
accordingly,the only effect of an order compelling production or compelling production for the purposes of an in camera inspection would have been to require the government,rather than the defense,to turn on the computer and examine the images contained therein.however,brady does not require such action by the government.united states mulderig,cir holding that the government brady obligations do not require it to point the defense to specific documents within a larger mass of material that it has already turned over quoting united states mmahat,cir internal quotations omitted.evidence is not suppressed if the defendant knows or should know of the essential facts that would enable him to take advantage of it the government is not required,in other words,to facilitate the compilation of exculpatory material that,with some industry,defense counsel could marshal on their own.united states shoher,internal citations omitted see also mulderig,at w hen information is fully available to a defendant at the time of his trial and his only reason for not obtaining and presenting the evidence to the court is his lack of reasonable diligence,the defendant has no brady claim.quoting united states marrero,cir internal quotations omitted because there was no government suppression of the images on the wood computer at the time of trial,the district court properly denied runyan motions to compel production of these images.
runyan claims in his motion for new trial 
a more difficult question is presented by runyan motion for new trial based on evidence.runyan argues that the defense was denied access to the wood computer during the time period between the customs service acquisition of the computer and the trial.runyan contends that because he was prevented from accessing the wood computer during this time period,he was unable to make a meaningful analysis of the potentially exculpatory images on the computer.thus,according to runyan,his expert analysis of the images from the wood computer,which confirms that some of these images did depict individuals under the age of sixteen,is evidence that he was unable to obtain prior to trial due to the government suppression of the computer.
even assuming,arguendo,that the government withheld the wood computer prior to trial and that the results of the defense analysis can thus appropriately be deemed evidence,a new trial is not warranted.the defense analysis of the images from the wood computer fails to satisfy brady materiality requirement.
this court reviews a district court denial of a motion for new trial for abuse of discretion.united states jaramillo,cir.however,when the evidence is alleged to be exculpatory evidence that the government withheld in violation of brady,we review any brady determinations de novo.united states gonzales,cir.as a general rule,to obtain a new trial based on evidence,a defendant must demonstrate that the evidence was discovered after trial the failure to discover the evidence was not due to the defendant lack of diligence the evidence is not merely cumulative or impeaching the evidence is material and a new trial would probably produce a new result.united states williams,cir.however,when a motion for new trial based on evidence raises a brady claim,this court instead applies the brady test to determine whether a new trial is appropriate.see,gonzales,at applying the brady test in assessing a motion for new trial based on an alleged brady violation accord united states conley,cir noting that the brady test rather than the test governing motions for new trial is applicable where a defendant claims that the evidence should have been produced under brady united states quintanilla,cir evaluation of a brady claim asserted in a motion for a new trial involves an application of the three brady elements identified above,and not the test utilized in typical newly discovered evidence claims.
as noted above,to establish a due process violation under brady,a defendant must show that evidence was suppressed the suppressed evidence was favorable to the defense and the suppressed evidence was material to either guilt or punishment.at.evidence is material under brady when there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different if the evidence had been disclosed to the defendant.see bagley,at.a reasonable probability is established when the failure to disclose the suppressed evidence could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.kyles whitley,d.as we noted in gonzales,this standard does not require a defendant to establish that he would have been acquitted had the evidence been disclosed.at.however,the defendant must establish that the suppression of exculpatory evidence by the government undermines confidence in the outcome of the trial.id.quoting kyles,at.
it merits emphasis that the evidence in question in the instant case,the evidence that the government allegedly prevented the defense from accessing is not the wood computer or even the images contained on the wood computer.rather,the newly discovered brady evidence is the expert analysis of these images that the defense was able to obtain after trial,but was allegedly unable to obtain prior to trial.thus,this court task is to determine whether the availability of such expert analysis at trial would have placed the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.kyles,at.
as noted above,runyan attorneys initially hired chancey green to examine the wood computer prior to the time that the defense relinquished the computer to the customs service.although green was apparently unable to conduct a complete analysis of the images on the wood computer,he did testify at trial that he saw images of what he believed to be child pornography specifically,images of young girls on the computer.agent nuckles also testified at trial regarding the contents of the wood computer,indicating that he found no evidence of actual child pornography.however,nuckles conceded that there were some questionable images on the wood computer.in light of this testimony,it is clear that both the trial court and the jury were fully aware that the wood computer contained borderline images that might have constituted child pornography.as the district court correctly noted,runyan expert analysis only verified this information.
runyan contends that this verification is nonetheless material within the meaning of brady because such testimony would have bolstered runyan theory that misty was responsible for creating the pornographic images of herself.however,in light of the compelling evidence that runyan was personally involved in taking the pornographic photographs of misty the defense alternate theory explaining the origin of these images is extremely weak under the circumstances of this case,we can not say that the inclusion of additional evidence at trial providing indirect support if any for this demonstrably weak defensive theory would have placed the case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.wright united states,brady does not require the government to anticipate all possible defenses and provide the defendant with otherwise irrelevant information to bolster one possible factual theory,particularly where the theory itself is demonstrably implausible,aff,cir.we find that there is no reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different had runyan been able to present expert analysis of the images on the wood computer.
runyan also contends that the district court erred in denying his motion for a new trial without conducting an evidentiary hearing.this court recognizes that a district court may rule on a motion for new trial without conducting an evidentiary hearing.see united states blackburn,cir.moreover,the decision to hold a hearing rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.id.in the instant case,the trial court was well aware of the details of the parties dispute regarding the wood computer because runyan motion to compel production and runyan motion for in camera review involved essentially the same issues.the only new information relevant to this dispute at the time of the motion for new trial was the defense expert analysis of the images contained on the wood computer.the district court determined that it could adequately assess the relevance of these two reports without the assistance of an evidentiary hearing.we can not conclude that this determination was an abuse of the district court discretion.
runyan due process claim 
runyan contends that the district court erred in overruling his objection to testimony solicited by the government indicating that runyan refused to consent to a police search of his desktop computer.runyan argues that the government,in soliciting this testimony,attempted to use runyan invocation of his constitutional rights as evidence of guilt,in violation of the due process clause of the fifth amendment.the government responds that the district court admission of this testimony was not erroneous because runyan invited this testimony by suggesting that he had willingly consented to other searches that agent nuckles performed an inadequate investigation and that the desktop computer was tampered with while runyan was out of town on business.the government further contends that,even if the district court acted erroneously in overruling runyan objection,this testimony had no effect on the outcome of the proceedings.
this court ordinarily analyzes due process claims alleging improper comment on a defendant invocation of constitutional rights under the harmless error doctrine,determining whether the improper comment was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.see,united states moreno,cir improper comment on a defendant invocation of his right to counsel richardson lucas,cir improper comment on a defendant refusal to testify.in the instant case,the government contends that runyan did not raise this constitutional objection to agent nuckles testimony at trial and that plain error analysis is therefore applicable.in support of this contention,the government points out that runyan counsel objected to this testimony at the time it was presented only on the ground that it was hearsay.it appears from the record,however,that runyan counsel attempted to object to this line of questioning on constitutional grounds prior to the time that the testimony was elicited,and that the trial court indicated the court would not be receptive to such an objection.nonetheless,we need not decide whether this objection was properly raised at trial because even under the more harmless error standard,runyan fails to demonstrate that admission of agent nuckles testimony constitutes reversible error.
this circuit has not directly addressed the question whether a prosecutor commits constitutional error by invoking a defendant refusal to consent to a warrantless search to support an inference of guilt.however,the circuit courts that have directly addressed this question have unanimously held that a defendant refusal to consent to a warrantless search may not be presented as evidence of guilt.see,united states moreno,cir united states dozal,cir united states thame,cir united states prescott,cir but united states mcnatt,cir questioning whether a defendant invocation of his or her fourth amendment rights by refusing to consent to a warrantless search is the constitutional equivalent of a defendant invocation of his or her right to remain silent under the fifth amendment,but not reaching the issue.for the purposes of this appeal,we assume without deciding that it would be error of constitutional magnitude for a trial court to permit a prosecutor to comment on or present testimony regarding a defendant refusal to consent to a warrantless search to support an inference of guilt nonetheless,we find that under the circumstances of this case,this error was harmless.
runyan refusal to consent to a police search of his desktop computer arose only once during the course of agent nuckles testimony.the jury heard the following exchange 
q were you aware during your investigation in this case that prior to the execution of the search warrant of the desktop computer,that this defendant was asked for consent to search it 
a yes,i was.
q did this defendant give consent for law enforcement to search the desktop computer 
a no,he did not.
q however,he did give consent to search other places,correct 
a yes,he did.
the line of questioning then shifted to other matters.the prosecution neither commented on runyan refusal to consent to a warrantless search,nor asked the jury to draw any inferences from this refusal.indeed,runyan refusal to consent to the search was not mentioned at any other time during the trial.thus,the record reveals that the offending statement was merely an isolated reference and that government did not focus on or highlight runyan refusal to consent to the search.this suggests that the error was harmless.united states griffith,cir recognizing that two of the relevant factors in assessing whether a prosecutor comment on a defendant failure to testify can be harmless error are whether the comment was an isolated incident and whether the prosecution focused on or highlighted the refusal to testify citing united states shaw,cir.
moreover,the evidence supporting runyan conviction for possession and receipt of child pornography is very strong.images of child pornography often images of the same children or even identical images were found on runyan desktop computer,on the disks removed from the ranch by judith,and on a backup disk found during the search of runyan home.in addition,evidence of previous access to child pornography websites was found on runyan desktop computer and on a laptop computer that runyan previously owned that he gave to his stepdaughter,rickie,when she started college.strong evidence of guilt can render the admission of evidence regarding a defendant refusal to consent to a warrantless search harmless.see moreno,at mcnatt,at united states valley,cir finding that overwhelming evidence of guilt can render harmless a prosecutor comment on the defendant refusal to testify.under these circumstances,we can safely say that it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have returned a verdict of guilty even if the government had never asked agent nuckles about runyan refusal to consent to a police search of his desktop computer.see mcnatt,at.because we find that the alleged constitutional error did not contribute to the verdict obtained,this error was harmless,and the jury verdict should be upheld.valley,at quoting chapman california,d.
vi.runyan sentencing claim 
runyan final claim of error alleges that he was incorrectly sentenced.the district court grouped three of runyan four counts of conviction.count one sexual exploitation of a child was considered by itself,while the three remaining counts receipt,distribution,and possession of child pornography were grouped together.in the sentence calculation for the group of offens
