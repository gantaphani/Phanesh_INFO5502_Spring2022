hilgraeve hilgraeve appeals from the decision of the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan granting the motion of symantec symantec for summary judgment of for patent patent.hilgraeve symantec,d.symantec the district court grant of summary judgment for hilgraeve that symantec is not licensed to use the invention claimed in the patent.hilgraeve symantec,civ.action,license defense order.
we vacate the district court grant of summary judgment of of the patent and generally affirm the district court grant of summary judgment that symantec did not license the patent.we find that questions of material fact exist as to whether the limitations of the patent claims are found in the methods performed by the accused products,and that hilgraeve did not transfer any rights to practice the patent.
background 
hilgraeve filed suit against symantec in the eastern district of michigan for infringement of the patent on september.on the same day,hilgraeve filed a separate suit against mcafee associates,for infringement of the patent,also in the eastern district of michigan.the cases were not consolidated.in the mcafee case,the district court grant of summary judgment of,hilgraeve mcafee associates,d mcafee i,was vacated and remanded by this court because,under the agreed claim construction,questions of material fact existed about the operation of the accused device,mcafee ii.
the patent relates to computer virus detection software.the software scans a digital data file for viruses as the file is transferred to a storage medium.if the software detects a virus prior to storing the file,it automatically blocks storage of the file.the software may be used,for example,to scan a file for viruses as the file is transferred from a floppy disk to a hard disk of a computer system,or as the file is transferred over the internet from one computer system to a storage medium of another computer system.
the patent contains claims.independent claims and,which are at issue on this appeal,read as follows 
in a system for transferring digital data for storage in a computer storage medium,a method of screening the data as it is being transferred and automatically inhibiting the storage of screened data containing at least one predefined sequence,comprising the steps of 
causing a quantity of digital data resident on a source storage medium to be transferred to a computer system having a destination storage medium 
receiving and screening the transferred digital data prior to storage on the destination storage medium to determine if at least one of a plurality of predefined sequences are present in the digital data received and 
in response to said screening step 
a automatically causing the screened digital data to be stored on said destination storage medium if none of the plurality of predefined sequences are present,and 
b automatically inhibiting the screened digital data from being stored on said destination storage medium if at least one predefined sequence is present.
a method of preventing the spread of computer viruses to a computer having a storage medium,comprising the steps of 
simultaneously searching for a plurality of virus signatures,each of which comprising an identifiable digital sequence,while said computer is receiving a stream of digital data for storage on said storage medium 
providing an indication of the detection of a virus from said searching step and 
automatically inhibiting the storage of said digital stream on said storage medium if any of said virus signatures have been detected.
patent,ll.and,ll.emphases added to pertinent terms.
because these claims require the inhibition of storage,the district court was required to construe the meaning of the word storage in the patent.the district court construed storage as occurring when the incoming digital data is sufficiently present on the destination storage medium so that any viruses contained in the data can spread and infect the computer system.hilgraeve,d at.
hilgraeve contended that several symantec products,including pcanywhere and norton antivirus nav,infringe the patent under this claim construction.in other words,hilgraeve alleged that the accused products screen incoming digital data for viruses during transfer and before storage on the destination storage medium.in contrast,symantec contended that its products do not infringe because they screen for viruses only after the data have been stored on the destination storage medium.thus,the critical issue was whether the accused products screen for viruses before or after the data become sufficiently present on the storage medium so that viruses contained in the data could spread and infect the computer system.
to resolve this issue on summary judgment the district court relied on testimony of symantec expert witness about how the accused products operate and on statements made by hilgraeve and its expert that it agreed with the overview offered by symantec expert about how the accused products operate.hilgraeve,d at.upon accepting symantec view of how the products operate,the district court found that the accused products first allow the incoming digital data to be stored as a whole on the destination storage medium before it is scanned.virus screening is performed only after the incoming digital data has been fully transferred and stored.id.at.the district court held that b ecause there is no dispute about how the accused products operate,there is no genuine issue as to any material fact concerning whether defendant accused products literally infringe the patent and granted summary judgment for symantec.id.
before the district court,symantec also asserted the affirmative defense to hilgraeve infringement claim that it had acquired a license to use the patent under a complex series of transactions involving delrina and its subsidiaries.on june,delrina,delrina delaware a subsidiary of delrina,and hilgraeve executed a technology transfer agreement under which delrina paid hilgraeve million,and hilgraeve transferred certain rights to its software,allegedly including the technology at issue in this suit,to delrina delaware.the technology transfer agreement states that it is governed by the laws of the province of ontario,canada.on the same day,delrina canada also a subsidiary of delrina and delrina delaware entered into a software development and cost sharing agreement the sdcs agreement to govern the shared development of software by the parties.in july,symantec acquired delrina.on march,delrina canada licensed its intellectual property to symantec.on march,delrina delaware entered into an agreement with symantec to directly transfer rights to the technology transferred by hilgraeve to delrina delaware on june.
the district court granted hilgraeve motion for summary judgment that symantec did not have a license to the patent prior to march,because symantec had failed to establish that delrina delaware transferred any rights to the patent to delrina canada or delrina,and symantec therefore failed to show that it acquired any rights to the patent through the acquisition of delrina.license defense order,slip op.at.as to events after march,the district court denied both hilgraeve and symantec motions for summary judgment regarding symantec licensing defense,finding that the march,agreement raised a general issue of material fact as to whether symantec had acquired a license to the patent through the march,agreement.id.after granting symantec motion for summary judgment of,the district court denied all other pending motions in the case without prejudice,and dismissed the case.hilgraeve,d at.

ii.claim construction issues 
as noted above,this is our second case involving the patent.in mcafee ii,we accepted the claim construction of storage urged by both parties and adopted by the district court in mcafee i.that claim construction differs slightly from the claim construction adopted below in the district court in this case in that the mcafee ii claim construction views storage as occurring when the incoming digital data is sufficiently present on the destination storage medium,and accessible by the operating system or other programs,so that any viruses contained in the data can spread and infect the computer system.mcafee ii,at emphasis added to differing language.
symantec argues that storage should not be construed to occur when data become accessible by the operating system or other programs,hilgraeve,d at,or when any viruses contained in the data can spread and infect the computer system,but that storage should be construed to occur when the data become physically present,magnetically recorded on the storage medium.
we need not decide here whether our claim construction in mcafee ii is binding on us in this case as a matter of stare decisis.our decision in mcafee ii was precedential,but it merely adopted the district court claim construction in mcafee i based on the parties agreement that the district court claim construction was correct.we have independently considered the issues of claim construction and conclude that the construction of storage in mcafee ii is indeed correct.
the patent distinguishes prior art virus scanning programs because they do not automatically prevent the virus from being stored on the medium in the first place,hence they can not totally prevent the virus from attacking or spreading.patent,ll.thus,storage of the virus is identified with the virus ability to spread and infect the computer system.a virus may not spread or infect the computer system,however,unless it is accessed by the operating system or other programs.given this,we agree with the mcafee ii court that storage occurs when the incoming digital data are sufficiently present on the destination storage medium and accessible by the operating system or other programs so that any viruses contained in the data can spread and infect the computer system.mcafee ii,at.
iii.infringement 
symantec contends that even under our claim construction it does not infringe.hilgraeve argues that questions of material fact remain regarding the operation of the accused devices and hence infringement we conclude here that the conflicting affidavits of the parties experts leave material fact questions unanswered,just as we held in a somewhat similar context in mcafee ii.
the district court based its summary judgment of on the testimony of symantec expert,melvin,who opined on the operation of the accused products,and on statements made by hilgraeve and its expert,geske,agreeing with portions of melvin testimony.the experts,however,did not in fact agree.
the experts described the operation of the accused products in different ways.symantec expert,melvin,described the operation of nav as occurring in a sequence of steps.in this sequence,first step one a file is transferred for storage onto the destination storage medium.this transfer includes opening a new file on the storage medium and recording incoming data into the new file.second step two,the application causing the transfer makes a request to the operating system to close the file containing the transferred data.third step three,the operating system closes the file.fourth step four,after the file is closed,the symantec product invokes the nav scan engine to test the file for the presence of a virus.symantec expert alleged that after the third step and before the fourth step,the file is recorded on the storage medium and accessible to the operating system and other programs and therefore stored,and that since this occurs before the file is scanned for viruses,symantec products do not infringe.hilgraeve expert,geske,stated that although he agreed with melvin overview of how the accused products operate,in his opinion there were critical points in melvin analysis that did not correspond with the behavior of the nav as it executes.critically,geske interpreted the testimony of cohen,the chief architect of the symantec accused products,to mean that the accused products impose a barrier in the computer system file system which prevents all programs and the operating system from accessing the transferred file until it is processed and screened for viruses.thus,geske disputed that the file becomes accessible to the operating system and other programs between steps three and four.
symantec expert sought to prove that a file becomes accessible to the operating system or other programs before it is scanned for viruses by the nav scan engine by running four tests.hilgraeve expert asserted that these tests do not prove that symantec products do not infringe,and that even if they showed that the products do not infringe under the test circumstances,they do not prove under normal operating conditions.
we agree that tests of an accused device under unusual conditions are not necessarily relevant to an infringement analysis.for example,in determining whether a product claim is infringed,we have held that an accused device may be found to infringe if it is reasonably capable of satisfying the claim limitations,even though it may also be capable of modes of operation.see intel united states int l trade comm n,key,hercon labs,aff,huck textron,uspq,the fact that a device may be used in a manner so as not to infringe the patent is not a defense to a claim of infringement against a manufacturer of the device if it is also reasonably capable of a use that infringes the patent.high tech med.instrumentation,new image,finding that an accused device does not infringe if it does not infringe in its normal configuration,even if it may be altered into an infringing configuration under unusual circumstances.so too the sale of a device may induce infringement of a method claim,even if the accused device is capable of modes of operation in unusual circumstances.
in the first test,symantec expert downloaded an infected file from a web page on the internet to a storage disk of a computer running nav and the windows operating system.after the file arrived at the computer,but before the nav was able to scan and delete the file,he shut off power to the computer.when he turned the computer on again he was able to access the file with a utility program of windows.in the second test,melvin also downloaded an infected file from a web page to a storage disk of a computer running nav,but he restarted the computer instead of shutting off its power,prior to scanning by nav.when the computer restarted,he was able to access the file.symantec alleges that these two tests show that the file is stored on the computer storage medium prior to scanning.even if that is true as a factual matter under the circumstances of the tests,the tests are not probative of infringement during normal operation of the accused products.because the patent claims require automatically inhibiting the storage of the virus,as we said in mcafee ii when considering similar tests,a test disabling the automatic capabilities of the accused product is not probative of whether the accused product may infringe
