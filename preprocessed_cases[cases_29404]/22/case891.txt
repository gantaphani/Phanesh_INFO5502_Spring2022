in this discovery dispute the parties disagree about whether the demanding party or the responding party should pay the cost possibly as much as million for recovering usable information from the responding party computer backup tapes.we conclude that in a proper case,code of civil procedure,section,subdivision g hereafter section g requires the demanding party to pay that expense.the determination of a proper case is a factual matter best left to the discretion of the trial court.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiff,lexar media,lexar sued toshiba america electronic components,taec and taec parent company toshiba,for misappropriation of trade secrets,breach of fiduciary duty,and unfair competition.lexar served taec with a request for production and inspection of documents by which lexar sought categories of documents.lexar defined documents to include electronic mail and other forms of electronically or magnetically maintained information.taec responded,subject to assorted objections,that it would produce copies of documents responsive to many of the categories.after taec produced more than pages of documents,which taec described as all of the readily available responsive documents,a dispute arose about who should pay for recovery of additional responsive material specifically,email correspondence stored on taec computer backup tapes.
taec had more than backup tapes for the pertinent time through october.taec hired an electronic discovery specialist to examine the tapes.according to this specialist the data contained on the tapes had to be manipulated in various ways in order to search the tapes to find out what was contained in them.complete processing of all the tapes,which would include analyzing the data contained on the tapes,identifying and restoring the files,searching the restored files for responsive items,and producing the specified data,would cost between and million.processing a selection of tapes surrounding key dates would cost at least.taec gave this information to lexar and asked lexar to shoulder some or all of the cost depending upon how many tapes lexar wanted processed.lexar refused.
lexar filed a motion to compel production of all responsive documents contained on the backup tapes,subd.n.anticipating taec argument that lexar should bear part of the cost,lexar argued that in this case would be unfair.taec had admitted that the tapes were not in the best condition for discovery.some of the software that taec was using when the tapes were made had become obsolete,requiring the development of specialized conversion tools to access the information.some of the tapes had deteriorated from age.still others were incorrectly labeled.lexar cited three federal district court cases that held,in effect,that a demanding party ought not to be penalized when a producing party has chosen to keep records in a manner that makes them difficult to retrieve.in re brand name prescription drugs antitrust litigation,wl rorer,home indem,wl kozlowski sears,roebuck.in the alternative,lexar argued that the analysis used in federal court did not warrant cost shifting in this case.zubulake ubs warburg llc,zubulake.taec responded that restoring its electronic backup tapes was an undue burden and that the federal analysis favored shifting the cost to lexar.neither party referred to the pertinent california statute,section g.
the trial court granted lexar motion without comment or explanation.the court did not order lexar to bear any of the cost,nor did it limit the production request to a representative sampling as lexar had suggested as an alternative.the court simply ordered taec to produce all nonprivileged emails from its backup tapes within days.
taec petitioned for a writ of mandate and requested a stay of the trial court order.in its writ petition,taec argued that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to require lexar to pay all or part of the cost of restoring and searching its backup tapes.taec relied upon a line of federal cases in which the courts had shifted the expense of restoring or retrieving inaccessible data from the responding party to the demanding party.taec also cited section g and argued that it was an automatic provision that should apply to the instant matter.we issued the temporary stay and solicited preliminary opposition asking the parties to address the application of section g.following receipt of preliminary briefing,we issued an order to show cause why a peremptory writ should not issue as requested.
section contains the discovery procedures for demanding and producing documents and things.section g specifies the manner in which the production is to be made any documents demanded shall either be produced as they are kept in the usual course of business,or be organized and labeled to correspond with the categories in the demand.if necessary,the responding party at the reasonable expense of the demanding party shall,through detection devices,translate any data compilations included in the demand into reasonably usable form.italics added.
the parties do not dispute that taec backup tapes are data compilations within the meaning of section g or that taec will incur some expense to manipulate the tapes in order to produce usable information responsive to lexar document demand.their only dispute is whether the phrase at the reasonable expense of the demanding party is a mandatory provision or whether it merely permits the trial court to shift the cost to the demanding party when the responding party objects.
iii.appropriateness of writ review 
although we rarely review discovery orders by way of an extraordinary writ,it is appropriate to do so where appellate remedies are inadequate or where discretionary review is necessary to answer a question of first impression of general importance to the trial courts and the legal profession.oceanside union school dist.superior court cal d,fn,people superior court mouchaourab th,d.in the present case,california courts have not ruled upon the question of which party should pay when it is necessary to translate electronic data compilations in order to obtain usable information responsive to a discovery request.the question is one that is bound to arise with increasing frequency.given that the cost of translating such material can be exorbitant,the question of who should bear the cost raises practical concerns as well as complicated policy issues.we believe these issues are sufficiently novel and important to justify review by extraordinary writ.see lipton superior court th,d.
iv.standard of review 
management of discovery generally lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.citations.where there is a basis for the trial court ruling and it is supported by the evidence,a reviewing court will not substitute its opinion for that of the trial court.citation.the trial court determination will be set aside only when it has been demonstrated that there was no legal justification for the order granting or denying the discovery in question.citations.lipton superior court,supra,th at,d.of course,while the trial court has wide discretion in managing discovery issues,there can be no room for the exercise of such discretion if no ground exists upon which it might operate.carlson superior court cal d.where,as here,the relevant facts are undisputed,we review a trial court exercise of discretion as a question of law.san diego unified port dist.douglas barnhart,th,d barnhart.an appellate court may reverse a trial court decision for abuse of discretion where the exercise of that discretion is not based upon the applicable law.action that transgresses the confines of the applicable principles of law is outside the scope of discretion and we call such action an abuse of discretion.city of sacramento drew d.

computer backup tapes are magnetic tapes used to record the data contained in a computer network.the tapes are intended to provide users a means of recovering lost data in the event of a disastrous system failure.businesses generally back up their networks on a routine schedule,such as daily,weekly and monthly.feldman kohn,the essentials of computer d
