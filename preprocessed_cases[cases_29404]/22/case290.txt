kurt grossman pleaded guilty to possessing images of minors engaged in sexual activity.because grossman sentence of months in prison and years of supervised release,a substantial downward variance from the sentence recommended by the sentencing guidelines,is procedurally sound and reasonable in length,we affirm.
in september,the national center for missing and exploited children began investigating years old,married,with a receiving a report that he had engaged in online enticement of children for sexual acts.ja.the tip,reported by an individual who had communicated with grossman in an online chat room,said that grossman loved to chat about his interests includ ing child abuse,kinky kids,and older men for younger women.id.by may,the investigation revealed that grossman was an active member of an online group that shared child pornography.a case agent later discovered that grossman had sent multiple emails containing child pornography from november to january.
when case agents visited grossman home,he agreed to talk to them.he denied having inappropriate physical contact with minors but admitted possessing and trading illicit pornography for more than five years.ja.grossman consented to a search of his computer,which revealed thousands of images,including child and adult pornography.
on april,case agents arrested grossman,after which he pleaded guilty to possessing images of minors engaged in sexual activity.see a b.the base offense level for a violation of this law is.see a.the presentence report recommended several increases to grossman offense level two levels for images involving prepubescent minors,see id.b five levels for distributing images in return for things of value more images,see id.b b four levels for sadistic images,see id.b two levels for using a computer,see id.b and five levels for an offense involving over images,see id.b d.grossman also qualified for a downward adjustment both for accepting responsibility,see id.a,and for entering a guilty plea,see id.b.these adjustments left grossman with an offense level of and a criminal history category of i,which intersect at a guidelines range of months.because grossman plea agreement included just one count of conviction,that range was reduced,in accordance with c,to the statutory maximum of months.see b.
after acknowledging that the probation department correctly calculated the guidelines range,the sentencing judge noted that he was troubled and shocked by the enhancements.ja.in his view,the guidelines produced a calculation that was not fair and not reflective of what grossman did.ja.concerned that the guidelines break out an offense into very tiny increments that almost repeat one another,and that some of the enhancements should be knock ed off,ja,he complained and want ed the record to reflect,ja,that t his is what happens when you take judging,which is a judge job,and you give it to a commission and say,a dd mathematical calculations and come up with a presumed sentence from that,id.
returning to the task at hand,the judge recognized his duty to impose a sentence sufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with the a factors.a.the judge appreciated that the offense was thoroughly disgusting and antisocial and that certain aspects of grossman psychological evaluation were indeed troubling.ja see a.the judge understood that the sentence must reflect the seriousness of this offense and afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct and protect the public from further crimes that might be committed by this defendant.ja see a a c.he noted that grossman was an educated man who knew his actions against innocent children were legally and morally wrong and commended grossman for appreciating that the true victims of his crime were the innocent children.ja see a.the judge also considered grossman need for correctional treatment and educational and potentially medical treatment.ja see a d.he then sentenced grossman to a prison term followed by years of supervised release.
in reviewing sentences after booker,we first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error.gall united states,d.we then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed.id.the question in the end is whether the district court abused its discretion in sentencing the defendant.id.
district courts,as a matter of process,must properly calculate the guidelines range,treat the guidelines as advisory,consider the a factors and adequately explain the chosen an explanation for any variance from the guidelines range.id.in applying congress mandate that sentencing courts must consider the a factors,we have not lost sight of the fact that the district court judges are involved in an exercise of judgment,not a ritual.united states mcgee,cir.we thus have required courts only to provide enough detail to allow an appellate court to conduct meaningful appellate review and to conclude that the district court adequately considered the relevant statutory factors.id.at.
consistent with these requirements,the sentencing judge correctly calculated the guidelines range.he recognized that his duty is to impose a sentence sufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with the purposes that congress has set forth for sentencing in a.ja see kimbrough united states,d.after applying the a factors,he ma d e an individualized assessment based on the facts presented as to what sentence grossman should receive.gall.at.weighing these individualized considerations,the district judge concluded that the guidelines produced a sentence that not reflective of what grossman did,ja,and thus exercised his discretion to reduce grossman sentence from months to months.
the government concedes that the district court clearly did consider the factors.br.at.and the judge plainly explained the basis for his sentence,including his substantial variance below the guidelines range.see ja.on this record,no procedural error occurred.
the more difficult question is whether the length of this sentence is reasonable.grossman recommended guidelines sentence after accounting for the statutory maximum was months and years of supervised release,and the district court varied it to months and years of supervised release.this considerable variance implicates the supreme court recent decision in gall united states.while gall permits appellate courts,i n reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence outside the guidelines range,to continue to take the degree of variance into account and consider the extent of a deviation from the guidelines,it offers two important qualifications.at.it reject s an appellate rule that requires extraordinary circumstances to justify a sentence outside the guidelines range.id.and it reject s the use of a rigid mathematical formula that uses the percentage of a departure as the standard for determining the strength of the justifications required for a specific sentence.id.
at the same time that gall bars a rigid mathematical formula for reviewing sentences,it permits district and appellate courts to require some correlation between the extent of a variance and the justification for it.id.in describing the duty of a sentencing judge,the court says if he decides that an sentence is warranted,he must consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.we find it uncontroversial that a major departure should be supported by a more significant justification than a minor one.id.at.in describing the duty of an appellate court,the court says it may consider the extent of the deviation,but must give due deference to the district court decision that the a factors,on a whole,justify the extent of the variance.id.
perhaps most importantly,gall shows that the sentencing process involves an exercise in judgment,not a mathematical proof.as a result,appellate courts must give due deference to the district court decision that the a factors,on a whole,justify the extent of the variance,and due deference to the sentencing judge assessment of the competing considerations,id.at is to say,not just review to the reasonableness of a sentence bu
