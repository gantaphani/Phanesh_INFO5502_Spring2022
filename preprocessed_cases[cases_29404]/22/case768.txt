this case involves alleged infringement by gateway,gateway,microsoft corporation microsoft,and dell dell of two patents owned by lucent technologies,lucent.after a jury verdict of infringement and a damages award of,the district court granted judgment as a matter of law jmol,and alternatively a new trial,on infringement and damages.lucent,gateway,d lucent.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the court grant of jmol based on lack of standing for one patent and based on for the other patent.we need not decide the damages issues.
the patents at issue in this appeal are directed to methods of compressing digital audio files to reduce storage space without compromising the quality of sound produced from the files.the methods involve using the frequencies of the audio signals to generate frequency coefficients,and then using certain dictate what data can be ignored and how finely to encode the assign numbers to the audio signals,to quantize the frequency information.for example,an absolute hearing threshold is an estimate of the quietest sounds a person can hear.a masking threshold reflects what sounds are inaudible when other sounds are present.
james johnston and joseph hall are the listed inventors on the earliest application,application the application,which was filed in while they were working at at t bell laboratories at t they are likewise the inventors of patent the patent,which was filed in and is a continuation,through two other applications,of the application.the claims of the patent are directed to a method of compressing digital audio files wherein tonality values are used in generating masking thresholds for quantization.claim recites

in april,following a reissue proceeding,the patent was surrendered in favor of patent no.re the patent.notably,claim was canceled during the reissue proceeding.in addition,the priority claim was amended such that the patent claims priority,through several applications,as a cip to the application.
in,at t entered into a joint development agreement jda with a german company,fraunhofer gesellschaft fraunhofer,which was also working on digital compression technologies.under the jda,fraunhofer scientist,karlheinz brandenburg,went to work with johnston at at t beginning in april.the jda preserved existing technology,technology developed by at t or by fraunhofer before april,to each company.the jda defined existing technology as 
existing technology is the results of work relating to digital audio coding needed to cover iso work done by at t information principles research laboratory and fhg fraunhofer at its ais including the work of brandenburg and his colleagues at the university of erlangen,cooperating with before the beginning of the period.
existing at t technology is described in attachment a papers describing technical information and attachment b patents and patent applications.
existing fhg technology is described in attachment c papers describing technical information and attachment d patents and patent applications.
emphasis added in contrast,new work,technology developed after april,was to be jointly each company had the nonexclusive right to make use of,and to grant nonexclusive licenses to others to use,the technology.specifically,the jda stated 
all new work is treated as joint work.the intellectual property rights to that work will be jointly owned by at t and fhg fraunhofer.each party has the nonexclusive right to make use of the results of new work including intellectual property rights,and may grant nonexclusive licenses to others to use the results of such new work.
although the jda was originally set to terminate on september,it was later extended indefinitely.
working together in late,johnston and brandenburg implemented and assisted in setting the industry standard iso audio layer coding techniques.by,fraunhofer had written software for functionality,and licensed hundreds of companies to use its software and patents.microsoft sought to add to its windows media player the ability to play files.thus,in,microsoft obtained a license from fraunhofer for the decoder software and incorporated it into computers containing windows media player to allow the computers to play files.
in,after the commencement of this litigation,microsoft took another license from fraunhofer for encoding and decoding software for use in its windows media player.the software included two fast encoder and the high quality encoder.only the high quality encoder uses tonality values as required by the patent.in late,microsoft released windows media player,which retains the fast encoder,but omits the high quality encoder.
in,lucent filed suit against gateway for patent infringement in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia.the action was transferred to the southern district of california.microsoft intervened and filed a declaratory judgment action against lucent.in,lucent filed suit against dell for patent infringement in the district of delaware.that case was also transferred to the southern district of california and consolidated with the other cases.the patents at issue were divided into five groups for summary judgment and trial 
in,the district court issued a claim construction order for the patent.lucent,gateway.a claim construction order was issued for the patent in,following the reissue proceedings.lucent,gateway.
then,in early,a jury trial was held.at issue was infringement and validity of claims,and of the patent and all claims claims,and of the patent.in a special verdict form,the jury was asked to answer a special question relevant to the infringement analysis with respect to the patent 
has microsoft proven by a preponderance of the evidence that work was performed on or after april which was incorporated into any of the claims of the patent lucent,gateway,slip op.at,wl.the jury answered that microsoft had failed to prove that any claim of the patent incorporates work first performed on or after april,new work.id.the jury found contributory and induced infringement of all asserted claims and rejected all invalidity defenses.id.at.the jury awarded damages in the amount of for each of the patent and the patent,based on a royalty rate for the value of the entire computer that performed the encoding functions.id.at.

lucent challenges the district court holding that it lacks standing to sue for infringement of the patent in the absence of fraunhofer on two grounds.first,lucent avers that the court erred in finding that claims and of the patent constitute new work under the jda.alternatively,lucent contends that,even if claims and are new work,the court erred in concluding that fraunhofer is a of the patent,and thus the patent.
the jury determined that all four claims of the patent incorporate existing technology,not new work,under the jda.the district court upheld the jury finding that claims and of the patent are existing technology however,the court determined,contrary to the jury finding,that claims and are new work.claim limits the frequency coefficients to mdct coefficients.claim requires a means for receiving and a means for converting,decoding the set of frequency coefficients.
lucent contends that the district court erred in setting aside the jury finding and concluding that claims and constitute new work.according to lucent,the jury finding that claims and of the patent do not incorporate new work is supported by substantial evidence.further,lucent asserts that for claims and to constitute existing technology,it is not necessary for there to be written descriptive support for the claims in the specification of the patent since contract law governs,not,first paragraph.lucent asserts that under the jda,all that is required is for the claimed subject matter to have been in the public domain prior to april.this interpretation of the jda is apparently attributable to the language the results of in the definition of existing technology.
with respect to claim,lucent contends that the original application,filed in,refers generally to means to transform and that,before april,a person of skill in the art would have recognized that mdct was among the existing means to transform.in fact,lucent asserts that its expert testified that mdct was known in the prior art,and that evidence indicated that johnston recognized the availability of mdct prior to april.thus,lucent argues,use of the mdct transform in the method of claim was part of the results of johnston work.
with respect to claim,lucent argues that the elements,means for receiving and means for converting,encompass structures for receiving and decoding frequency coefficients.according to lucent,the district court erred in limiting the structures that support the elements to the digital signal processor dsp and the very large scale integration vlsi hardware,rather than to include their equivalents.lucent asserts that it is undisputed that some structure for encoding and decoding was part of johnston work.in particular,lucent points to the specification and drawings of the patent,which date to,and evidence of johnston working embodiment.moreover,lucent contends that its expert testified that personal computers have dsps and vlsis,and that johnston testified that he tested his software on alliant and data general computers.
we can not adopt lucent strained interpretation of the jda.existing technology is clearly defined in the jda to refer to technology developed by at t or by fraunhofer prior to april.indeed,what was recognized by the parties to constitute existing at t technology and existing fraunhofer technology was specifically described in attachments to the jda.there is simply no basis for reading existing technology more broadly to encompass any technology in the public domain prior to april.notably,lucent points to nothing in attachments that supports its argument that the subject matter of claims and was existing technology.
furthermore,we disagree that written descriptive support in the specification is not relevant to determining when the claimed technology was developed.in order to be valid,each patent claim must meet all the statutory requirements,including written description under,first paragraph.patent claims are awarded priority on a basis based on the disclosure in the priority applications.go med.indus,inmed,augustine,gaymar.when the patent application was filed as a reissue of the patent,the priority was amended to claim priority as a continuation to an application filed in,which in turn was a cip of another application that was a continuation of the application,filed in.thus,while the patent and the patent shares the same specification as the application filed in,it does not share the same specification as the application.since the critical date for distinguishing between new work and existing technology is april,it is important to establish whether the claims of the patent are entitled to the priority date of the application,or only to the priority date.
the district court determined that the patent which shares the same specification as the application filed in does not mention mdcts and thus there is no evidence that the work embodied in claim was performed prior to april.lucent,d at.even if the implementation of mdcts into the claimed technology would have been obvious to one of skill in the art,the court correctly recognized that a demonstration of obviousness is not sufficient to show possession.see poweroasis,usa,regents of the of cal.eli lilly,lockwood am.airlines.moreover,the court relied on the testimony of johnston that he had not heard of mdcts and had not performed work with mdcts before the collaborative period with fraunhofer.lucent,d at.we find the court analysis to be sound,and thus we conclude that claim constitutes new work.we next proceed to consider claim 
the court first restated its earlier construction of the claim terms,means for receiving and means for converting,as claim terms under,requiring the following corresponding structure described in the specification of the patent 
a digital signal processor dsp,a dsp with software,vlsi hardware embodiments,or hybrid embodiments.
lucent,d at see patent.the court then recognized that none of the corresponding structures appeared in the specification of the application which is entitled to priority to the application filed in,but instead first appeared in the patent application,in the priority application filed in.lucent,d at.the court rejected lucent attempt to rely on figure of the patent for support because the figure does not identify any structures.id.we agree with the district court that claim,in that it recites the two claim terms,is only entitled to a priority date of.lucent does not point to other corresponding structures in the patent specification that support the terms means for receiving or means for converting,nor does lucent point to support for dsp or vlsi in the application.
further,the court properly rejected lucent arguments that one of skill in the art would have known in that dsp and vlsi are satisfactory structures for a means for receiving and a means for converting.id.the understanding of one of skill in the art does not relieve the patentee of the duty to disclose sufficient structure to support claim terms.biomedino,llc waters techs.thus,claim is entitled only to a priority date of,after the april critical date.we further agree with the district court that lucent presented insufficient evidence to support the jury finding that claim had an earlier date of invention.as such,claim is new work and not existing technology.given that claims and of the patent are existing technology and claims and are new work,we must now consider the ownership of the patent and the patent.
lucent argues,in the alternative,that even if claims and incorporate new work under the jda,ownership of the patent and thus the patent remains solely with lucent since claims and are existing technology.lucent contends that while the jda may have attempted to assign joint ownership to some of the claims of the patent,it was ineffective to do that.according to lucent,by law a patentee may only assign title to an entire patent a transfer of less is merely a license.thus,lucent avers,at t merely granted a license to fraunhofer in claims and of the patent,not an ownership interest in the entire patent.because fraunhofer is not a of the patent,lucent contends that it does not lack standing to sue in the absence of fraunhofer.
in making its argument,lucent relies primarily on pope,and on subsequent supreme court and federal circuit precedent reiterating the principles set out in pope.see pope gormully jeffery.lucent contends that while the district court correctly recognized that pope precluded the separation of claims and from claims and,it arrived at the wrong the jda therefore assigns ownership of the entire patent.instead,lucent argues,pope mandates that the result of a mixed assignment is a mere license.in addition,lucent criticizes the district court application of israel project amgen.according to lucent,israel is distinguishable from the instant case because it involved who began with an ownership interest.
we find no error in the district court application of pope and israel.the issue in pope was whether the plaintiff in an infringement suit had legal title to a patent and thus the right to sue.at.the patent related to bicycles,the second claim reciting in a velocipede,an adjustable hammock seat,j,substantially as set forth.id.at.other claims did not mention a hammock seat.id.at.the plaintiff had obtained title to the patent through a series of assignments,the first of which conveyed all rights for past infringement so far as said patent relates to or covers the adjustable hammock seat or saddle id.at.thus,the court considered whether a patentee can split up his patent into as many different parts as there are claims,and vest the legal title to those claims in as many different persons.id.at.the court concluded that the right of the patentee to assign his monopoly was limited to 
the whole patent,comprising the exclusive right to make,use,and vend the invention throughout the united states 
an undivided part or share of that exclusive right or 
the exclusive right under the patent within and throughout a specified territory.
id.at.citing waterman mackenzie,and gayler wilder,how.a transfer of less,according to the court,did not convey title in the patent and the right to sue instead,it conveyed merely a license.pope,at.therefore,the court determined that the plaintiff lacked title in the patent and could not sue for infringement.id.the district court correctly recognized that pope stands for the proposition that the owner of a patent can not split up its ownership rights in a patent and assign different claims to different parties.pope,however,has limited relevance to the instant case where we need to determine ownership of the patent in the first instance,upon issuance of the patent.
more relevant is israel,which,like this case,involved determination of the ownership of a patent when some of the claimed subject matter was invented under a contract and some was invented outside the contract.israel involved a contract between,and israel project ibep in which ibep would fund research conducted by in cooperation with yeda research and development,yeda,would apply for patents in its sole discretion,and all ownership interests in patents so obtained would be assigned to ibep.israel g,at.after the termination of the contract a patent issued,which named four inventors and named yeda as the assignee.id.at.one of the inventors,rubenstein,had
