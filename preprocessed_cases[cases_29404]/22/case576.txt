john kuchinski appeals his conviction and sentence for receipt and possession of child pornography.a,a b.principally,he asserts that his prosecution for receipt and possession violated the double jeopardy clause that any use of the united states sentencing guidelines violates the separation of powers doctrine,and that he was improperly sentenced when all child pornography images on his computer were counted for sentencing purposes.we affirm his conviction,but vacate his sentence and remand.
background 
after obtaining information that kuchinski was involved in child pornography,the fbi obtained a search warrant for his computer.upon execution of that warrant,between and separate images of child pornography were recovered therefrom.sixteen of those images were located in the computer downloaded files and were located in its deleted files recycle bin.kuchinski does not argue that he is not responsible for the possession of those images.however,images were in the active temporary internet files and another to images were in the deleted temporary internet files thereafter,kuchinski was indicted for receipt of child pornography in violation of a count i,possession of child pornography,a b count ii,and forfeiture of his computer equipment,count iii.he pled not guilty.
kuchinski then entered into a plea agreement which provided that he would plead guilty to possession of child pornography and admit the forfeiture,whereupon the government would dismiss the receipt of child pornography count.alas,although the plea agreement spelled out the fact that kuchinski understood he was pleading to a charge which carried a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years,at the change of plea hearing he argued that the maximum term mandated by the protect act did not apply to him.the government disputed that,said it was a brand new issue,and declared that it was not willing to go forward with the plea agreement if kuchinski refused to plead to charges under the protect act.after some discussion,the district court refused to accept or approve the plea agreement at that point.the court then continued the hearing to a later date.
at the later hearing,it became apparent that kuchinski would not accept the plea agreement as presented,and he,instead,announced that he was prepared to plead guilty to to all three counts of the indictment,if that could be a conditional plea.the government,however,refused to agree to a conditional plea.therefore,kuchinski did plead guilty to possession of child pornography count ii and admitted the forfeiture count iii.that left the receipt of child pornography charge count i for trial.
but kuchinski still had one more trick up his sleeve.he,in effect,contended that because all elements of possession of child pornography were incorporated into the elements of receipt of child pornography,it would violate double jeopardy if the district court proceeded to trial on the latter count.the district court was not convinced and did proceed to hold a bench trial at which kuchinski was found guilty.
then came sentencing and a host of new objections.the only objections relevant on this appeal are kuchinski claims that since the protect act,the separation of powers doctrine is violated because the united states sentencing commission need not have any judges on it the protect act also removes sentencing discretion from district judges and,thereby,offends due process and the district court erred when it calculated the number of child pornography images for which kuchinski would be charged,a calculation that affected his sentencing guideline offense level.see ussg b 
the district court considered and rejected kuchinski challenges and sentenced him to seventy months imprisonment and three years of supervised release on both counts,with the sentences to run concurrently.this appeal followed.
jurisdiction and standards of review 
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to.we have jurisdiction pursuant to and a.
we review claims that the district court is required to enforce a plea agreement de novo.see united states fagan,cir.we also review claims that a rule or statute violates the separation of powers doctrine de novo.see united states yacoubian,cir.similarly,we review claims of double jeopardy violations de novo.see united states jose,cir.and,as with other constitutional issues,we review claims that the sentencing guidelines are unconstitutional de novo.see united states leasure,cir.
we review the district court interpretation of the sentencing guidelines de novo.see united states nielsen,cir.moreover,we review applicability of the sentencing guidelines to a particular offense de novo.see united states,cir.the district court applications of the sentencing guidelines to the facts of a case are reviewed for an abuse of discretion.see united states miguel,cir.however,factual findings in the sentencing phase are reviewed for clear error.id.
discussion 
kuchinski launches a number of attacks on the process that led to his conviction on both substantive of child pornography and possession of child pornography.we will first consider those.thereafter,we will consider his attack on the whole guideline regime as well as its application to those convicted of child pornography.finally,we will consider his assertion that the guideline range was calculated improperly.
a.the findings of guilt 
the plea agreement 
kuchinski insists that once the government entered into a plea agreement,it was absolutely bound to the agreement terms,even before the district court accepted the agreement.he is wrong.
had the district court already accepted the plea agreement,the government could not have easily withdrawn from it.see fagan,at.but here the district court had not yet accepted it and a plea agreement that has not been entered and accepted by the trial court does not bind the parties.see also united states,cir united states savage,cir mabry johnson,d.we recognize that where detrimental reliance is shown,the government may be bound even before the district court accepts the agreement but no detrimental reliance appears here.
the attempt to enter a conditional plea 
once his allonge regarding the plea agreement was parried,kuchinski tried to unilaterally enter a plea to all counts,while preserving his claim about the plea agreement.when the government refused to accede to that new proposition,kuchinski complained that federal rule of criminal procedure a was an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers doctrine because permitting a conditional plea was an issue that should be left to the courts alone.again,he is wrong.
it is,of course,important to maintain a separation of powers,lest liberty be overturned by an undue concentration of power in one of the branches of the government.see mistretta united states,d.but the greatest security against accumulation of excessive authority in a single not in a hermetic division among the branches,but in a carefully crafted system of checked and balanced power within each branch.id.at.at.thus,our constitutional system imposes upon the branches a degree of overlapping responsibility,a duty of interdependence as well as independence the absence of which would preclude the establishment of a nation capable of governing itself effectively.id.at.at see also united states ray,cir.
none of the dire consequences that the doctrine seeks to protect us from are threatened by a rule providing that a defendant may enter a conditional guilty plea w ith the consent of the court and the government.a.it is true that courts do have an interest in the efficient administration of justice but it is far from clear that the taking of a conditional guilty plea will always be efficient.in fact,it may cause what almost amounts to an interlocutory appeal,and result in a great loss of ultimate efficiency.see.a advisory committee notes.it may also invade the executive ultimate ability to fully and fairly pursue a conviction,and the government does have an interest in that pursuit.see ohio johnson,d.
at any rate,while kuchinski sees great danger to our system,we are not gallied by his nightmare.rather,we see a somewhat common occurrence in a slightly di
