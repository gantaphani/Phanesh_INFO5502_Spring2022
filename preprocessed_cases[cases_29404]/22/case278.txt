jeffrey grimes appeals his conviction of possession of child pornography under a b he challenges the results of his jury trial on four fronts that the evidence was insufficient that the district court instructed the jury,as a matter of law,to find a fact essential to conviction that the search and seizure of his computer violated his fourth amendment rights and that the district court abused its discretion in admitting into evidence the contents of two narratives.while disagreeing with grimes on the first three issues and on his challenge to the narratives probative value,we vacate and remand for a new trial after concluding that the narratives prejudicial effect substantially outweighed their probative value.
on october,grimes wife brought his computer to a store in paris,texas,for repair,signing a slip and authorizing repair work the slip indicated the computer would not boot up.two days later,kevin watson,a repair technician,began working on the computer.
watson testified that the computer would not power on until he had removed a large amount of dust from the fan.when he then performed a standard check of the hard drive to see whether the computer had other problems,he discovered that the hard drive was low on space.after attempting but failing to contact grimes by phone,watson reached grimes wife and advised her of the problem,suggesting either the purchase of a new hard drive or allowing him to remove temporary files,temporary internet files,and other files not needed on the computer.
grimes gave permission for watson to remove files but said she would speak with grimes before approving a new hard drive.watson then began deleting temporary internet files.he testified that he looked for jpg files which are picture files that consume a lot of hard drive space.
after locating jpg files,watson continued to follow his standard approach by opening the files to ensure,before deleting the pictures,that they were not personal to the computer owner while opening jpg files,watson found approximately seventeen that contained the images of young,naked girls,perhaps six to ten years of age,with pixel over their private areas.thinking that the images might be illegal,watson called his supervisor,robert slider,and showed him the images.slider,in turn,thought the images might constitute child pornography,so he reported the matter to police detective danny huff.
huff came to the store and viewed the seventeen images that watson had found originally watson showed him only the images.without requesting watson or slider to search the computer any further,huff reported the findings to fbi special agent ken paith.
slider copied the seventeen images onto a floppy disk,which he gave to huff,who copied them before faxing them to paith,who seized the computer after obtaining a search warrant paith then delivered the computer to the fbi office in dallas,where its contents were reviewed by fbi computer specialist guelda lambert.
grimes was tried on a superseding indictment that charged him with one count of possession of three or more sexually explicit visual depictions of minors.specifically,he was charged with possession of thirteen computer graphic files,each of which contained one image.lambert further testified that government exhibits a through l were extracted from grimes computer.lambert testified that the images were stored three subdirectories down in the computer,in a directory called my briefcase,which was in a directory called desktop,which was in windows.
mike marshall testified for the government as an expert witness in the general fields of computers and the specific computer applications of dos,windows,windows,the internet,and functions within those systems such as my briefcase.as part of the government investigation,lambert had provided marshall with a disk containing the contents of grimes hard drive.marshall confirmed that the series of images in exhibits a through l had been stored in the subdirectory my briefcase.this testimony would be important in demonstrating that the pictures were not somehow accidently on the user computer multiple inputs are required to place files into the subdirectory in which the pictures were discovered.
marshall testified that each of these images was stored in the subdirectory at a different time and in the jpg format.he also stated that the series of images contained in exhibits a through l all depicted unclothed,young female children with pixel boxes over their genitalia,which boxes were generated by a computer on the images after the pictures were taken.in his opinion,the girls were naked and had their genitals exposed when the pictures were taken 
marshall also identified government exhibits,and,which were images of young girls who were either nude or partially nude.he testified that these images were retrieved from the temporary internet files in grimes computer.marshall explained that a temporary internet file is created when any of the windows operating systems is installed with an internet browser.this temporary cache is a first in first out algorithm in which the files most recently viewed on the internet by the end user remain in storage for quick recall.the images contained in exhibits,and were viewed on the internet by the end user.
marshall identified government exhibits and,which are paper copies of a narrative or story.exhibit is entitled torture horse,and exhibit is entitled too young.exhibits and were downloaded by the computer end user and stored in the temporary internet file.marshall could not tell whether the end user had read either of them.
grimes sought to suppress these narratives as violative of federal rule of evidence b.the district court,after reconsideration,allowed their admission to demonstrate intent and state of mind.brief passages from these narratives were read to the jury.
the jury also heard testimony from paith regarding his conversation with grimes at grimes residence.during what appears to have been only a brief discussion,grimes admitted that he was the chief user of that computer,that he spent approximately three to four hours per day using it to access the internet,and that he had accessed internet sites that contained pictures of nude,young girls.grimes sought to suppress this conversation,claiming that the interview had been custodial in nature.
clyde shaw,a pediatric physician,also testified as an expert witness for the government.he stated that the girls depicted in exhibits a through l were under the age of eighteen.based on his years experience,he believed that many of the children in those exhibits were prepubertal or in early puberty and it is atypical behavior for children of this age to display their naked bodies.
grimes argues that the presence of the pixel boxes prevents,as a matter of law,the nude photographs of the minor girls from meeting the statute definitional requirements.first,he asserts that because the genitals were blocked out,the photographs fail to meet the definition of lascivious.second,and along the same lines,he argues that because the genitals are blocked out,they are not exhibited.
in interpreting the statute,courts begin and end with the text if it is unambiguous and does not lead to an absurd result as we have said,a b makes it unlawful knowingly to possess three or more books,magazines,periodicals,films,video tapes,or other matter if a the producing of such visual depiction involved the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct and b such visual depiction was of such conduct.there are two questions did the production involve the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct,and was the visual depiction a depiction of such conduct 
this circuit,when determining whether a visual depiction of a minor constitutes a lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area under e,applies the test of united states dost,aff,cir,which we adopted in united states carroll,cir citing united states knox,cir,vacated and reinstated in relevant part,cir per curiam.the factors are 
whether the focal point of the visual depiction is on the child genitalia or pubic area 
whether the setting of the visual depiction is sexually suggestive,in a place or pose generally associated with sexual activity 
whether the child is depicted in an unnatural pose,or in inappropriate attire,considering the age of the child 
whether the child is fully or partially clothed,or nude 
whether the visual depiction suggests sexual coyness or a willingness to engage in sexual activity 
whether the visual depiction is intended or designed to elicit a sexual response in the viewer.
id.citingknox,at.the list is not exhaustive,and no single factor is dispositive.id.
after viewing the photographs,we reject grimes challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence.it is plain to any viewer that the producing of these visual depictions involved the use of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct and that the visual depiction captured that activity.
grimes answers by saying that computer alterations brought the photographs outside the statute reach.that,however,is not what the plain language requires.
the scienter requirement of subsection is applied to the entire clause even were the statute to be written as grimes wishes it were,courts have treated the words lascivious and exhibition as a phrase.knox,at.interpreting individual words in context is a common approach in statutory construction.see deal united states,d observing that it is a fundamental principle of statutory construction and,indeed,of language itself that the meaning of a word can not be determined in isolation,but must be drawn from the context in which it is used 
to aid in its interpretation,the knox court considered the purpose behind that statute.it also applied a plain language analysis to determine that nothing in the statute required nudity.the knox court reasoned 
congress aimed the federal child pornography statute at combatting the use of children as subjects of pornographic materials,which is harmful to the physiological,emotional,and mental health of the child.new york ferber,d.in so doing,congress defined the lascivious exhibition of genitals or pubic area as one variety of sexually explicit conduct proscribed by the statute.thus,we find it more meaningful to focus on the ordinary meaning of the statutory term lascivious exhibition,rather than simply focusing on the term exhibition divorced entirely from the context in which it was used.
the term lascivious is defined as t ending to excite lust lewd indecent obscene sexual impurity tending to deprave the morals in respect to sexual relations licentious.black law dictionary ed.hence,as used in the child pornography statute,the ordinary meaning of the phrase lascivious exhibition means a depiction which displays or brings forth to view in order to attract notice to the genitals or pubic area of children,in order to excite lustfulness or sexual stimulation in the viewer.such a definition does not contain any requirement of nudity,and accords with the test announced in united states dost for determining whether certain material falls within the definition of e.nor does such a definition contain or suggest a requirement that the contours of the genitals or pubic area be discernible or otherwise visible through the child subject clothing.
the same court specifically rejected the characterization of united states villard,cir that grimes urges to us.he asserts that villard logic suggests that the statutory term pubic area is analogous to the medical meaning.the third circuit disagrees and characterizes villard holding as the obvious principle that nudity alone is insufficient to constitute lascivious exhibition.id.at.to hold otherwise would outlaw many works of art or family photos of,say,naked children in bathtubs.id 
the knox court stopped short of saying that the dost factors are the only consideration.that court believed that,even without a requirement for nudity,the statute does require a threshold inquiry into whether the depiction visually exhibits the genitals or pubic areas.id.at.that court considered the dost factors useful in making this threshold inquiry,as we do.again,however,our case is distinguishable from knox,because in knox the court faced a set of native photographs in which the production did not involve nude children,but,instead,minors wearing tight,revealing clothing.the knox court faced a more difficult question than do we.
even under a analysis,the photos grimes had in hand revealed ample exhibition and lasciviousness both to meet the threshold inquiry and to allow a reasonable juror to vote for conviction.grimes would have us quibble with the jury evaluation.although undoubtedly many cases involving photographs of minors will follow this one,and such computer manipulation will present courts with difficult factual and legal questions,the instant matter is not one of those cases.
to ignore the approach would undermine several of the statute purposes,on which the supreme court has relied when discussing this statute and the issue of child pornography generally.the court has recognized that the psychological effect of visually recording the sexual exploitation of a child is devastating,and its elimination is of surpassing importance.new york ferber,d.
additionally,controlling the production and dissemination of child pornography is of paramount importance,because pedophiles often use child pornography to seduce other children into performing sexual acts.osborne ohio,d.these harms occur during the first photographing of the lasciviously exposed what is later a photograph.the knox court,having considered these purposes,was persuaded that 
where the child is treated as a sexual object,the permanent record of this embarrassing and humiliating experience produces the same detrimental effects to the mental health of the child as a nude portrayal.the rationale underlying the statute proscription applies equally to any lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area whether these areas are clad or completely exposed.
grimes claims that the district court instructed the jury that it must,as a matter of law,find a fact that was essential to conviction,the lascivious exhibitions of the girls genitals or pubic areas,had been established by the evidence.the court did not,in fact,instruct the jury to find a fact,nor did it disturb the written instructions it had read to the jury before the final arguments.
grimes contention is based on a portion of a comment,which he lifts out of context and in doing so misrepresents the court remarks from our review,it seems the court merely attempted to make plain that there is a inquiry are the images of minors if so,the jury must also decide whether the minors were engaged in the lascivious exhibition of their genitals or pubic area.this was an aid,not an error.
grimes sought to suppress the images,contending that they were seized in violation of the fourth amendment.he claims that the store search went beyond the permission given by his wife,thereby invalidating any evidence that flows from the search.the initial search,being private in nature,is not subject to fourth amendment analysis,unless the private individual was acting as an agent of,or with the participation of,a government official.united states jacobsen,d citing walter united states,d,and suggesting that any invasion of a defendant privacy rights by law enforcement officers that occurs after a private search is tested by the degree to which it exceeds the scope of the private search.
in united states paige,cir,we discussed the test for determining when a private party is a government actor under the fourth amendment whether the government knew or acquiesced in the intrusive conduct and whether the private party intended to assist law enforcement efforts or to further his own ends.the computer store employees do not meet this test.
first,the government was not involved in the initial discovery of the images.second,when the private parties initially discovered the images,they did not act with the intent to assist law enforcement officials.the employees did,however,intend to aid officials after the discovery of the images and their initial belief in the images illegality,but this is a different inquiry.
the next consideration is whether,after the private search,the person c
