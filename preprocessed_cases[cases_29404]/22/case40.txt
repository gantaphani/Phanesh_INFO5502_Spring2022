this case raises important issues about the relationship between the anticybersquatting consumer protection act acpa and the world intellectual property organization wipo dispute resolution procedures under the uniform domain name dispute resolution policy udrp.this is a dispute between jay sallen,a resident of brookline,massachusetts,and corinthians licenciamentos ltda cl,a brazilian corporation,over sallen registration and use of the domain name.we are asked to determine whether sallen,a domain name registrant who has lost the use of a domain name in a wipo dispute resolution proceeding that declared him a cybersquatter under the udrp,may bring an action in federal court seeking a declaration that he is not in violation of the acpa a declaration that he is not required to transfer the domain name to cl and such relief as necessary to effectuate these ends the district court held that federal courts lack jurisdiction over such claims.for the reasons that follow,we reverse the district court and hold that there is federal jurisdiction over such claims.
this is a case in the new territory of cybersquatting also known as cyberpiracy or domain name hijacking,an internet phenomenon whereby individuals register internet domain names in violation of the rights of trademark owners,at.alternatively,the case may be viewed as possibly one of reverse domain name hijacking,whereby trademark owners abusively assert their trademark rights to strip domain names from rightful owners.see udrp rule,at,defining reverse domain name hijacking.cybersquatters often register domain names incorporating the trademarks of others,with the intent of selling the domain names back to the trademark owners at a profit,at,at sporty farm sportsman,cir.some trademark owners,however,may find accusations of cybersquatting a convenient way to bypass legitimate disputes over trademark rights.see cong.rec.
cl asserts that it has rights in brazil to the name corinthiao,the portuguese equivalent of corinthians,which is the name of a soccer team popular in brazil.in the district court,and before this court,cl argued that a wipo panel properly found that sallen was a cybersquatter under the udrp.the udrp applies to sallen because its terms are incorporated into his domain name registration private contract.cl says that federal courts do not have jurisdiction to revisit the issue of whether sallen is a cybersquatter as determined under that contract.further,cl says,federal courts lack jurisdiction over sallen suit under the acpa because cl has disclaimed any intent to sue sallen under the acpa.if sallen can not reasonably fear a lawsuit under the acpa,so the argument goes,then there is no article iii case or controversy.cl insists that its victory under the udrp is unrelated to,and unaffected by,any cause of action under the acpa.even if sallen had an affirmative right under the acpa to use,it says,he has contractually waived that right by agreeing to the udrp different legal standard in his domain name registration agreement.
sallen unsuccessfully defended his registration and use of in a wipo dispute resolution proceeding initiated by cl.wipo arbitration and mediation center,administrative panel decision,corinthians licenciamentos ltda sallen,no.july,bianchi,sole panelist,at.ht ml.sallen then filed a complaint in federal court against cl seeking a declaration that his registration and use of is not unlawful under the acpa.he relied on both d v and the declaratory judgment statute.section d v states 
a domain name registrant whose domain name has been suspended,disabled,or transferred under a policy described under clause ii ii may,upon notice to the mark owner,file a civil action to establish that the registration or use of the domain name by such registrant is not unlawful under this chapter.the court may grant injunctive relief to the domain name registrant,including the reactivation of the domain name or transfer of the domain name to the domain name registrant.
sallen asserts that this provision of the acpa creates an explicit cause of action for a declaration that a registrant who has lost a domain name under the udrp has lawfully registered and used that domain name this declaration overrides the wipo panel decision to the contrary and federal courts may order the domain name reactivated or transferred back to the aggrieved registrant.sallen position is that,despite the terms of his domain name registration agreement,and despite the wipo panel interpretation of those terms,he is entitled to retain registration and use of if his registration and use of the domain name is consistent with the acpa.
this case raises an issue of first impression,requiring us to determine whether a domain name registrant,who has lost in a udrp proceeding,may bring an action in federal court under d v seeking to override the result of the earlier wipo proceeding by having his status as a nonviolator of the acpa declared and by getting an injunction forcing a transfer of the disputed domain name back to him.the answer to this question turns on the relationship between the acpa,in particular d v,and decisions of administrative dispute resolution panels contractually empowered to adjudicate domain name disputes under the udrp.
the district court dismissed sallen complaint on the grounds that no actual controversy existed between the parties since cl never claimed that sallen violated the acpa.we hold that,although cl represented that it had no intent to sue sallen under the acpa for his past activities in connection with,an actual controversy did exist between the parties concerning rights to,and that the district court incorrectly dismissed sallen complaint.section d v grants domain name registrants who have lost domain names under administrative panel decisions applying the udrp an affirmative cause of action in federal court for a declaration of nonviolation of the acpa and for the return of the wrongfully transferred domain names.accordingly,we reverse and remand to the district court.

the internet is a network of computers allowing a user on the network to communicate with any other computer on the network.see incorporating,for purposes of the trademark act,the definition of internet given by f the international computer network of both federal and interoperable packet switched data networks perritt.law and the information superhighway b,at ed briefly explaining how the internet works delta matsuura,law of the internet documenting the internet history.although there are many widely used applications on the internet,perritt,supra,b,at,the world wide web is the dominant application,id.g,at.t he web is a method of organizing information distributed across the internet.id.users of the internet may make information available on the web and access information made available by others.id.internet users are able to access desired content on the web by typing in the correct uniform resource locator url,or domain name,which functions much like a telephone number,allowing a user who enters the correct address to reach a particular web site 
a domain name consists of at least two parts the top level domain and the second level domain.the top level domain,such as.com.net,or.org,is preceded by the second level domain,which consists of a combination of letters,numbers,or some symbols.so,for example,in the domain name.gov is the top level domain name and uscourts is the second level domain name.a user wishing to view the federal judiciary official web site could do so by entering into her web browser.
presently,users may not claim their own top level domains,but anyone wishing to obtain a second level domain name may,for a fee,enter into a registration agreement with a domain name registrar,thereby acquiring exclusive rights to that second level domain and the ability to create as many third or higher level domains as desired under that second level domain.
disputes over domain names have become increasingly common with the expanding commercial use of the internet.see management of internet names and addresses,june,first wipo internet domain name process archive,at http visited,describing increased commercial use of the internet and associated potential for trademark disputes.because of their easily remembered form,domain names have become business identifiers important to offering goods and services on the internet.the importance of having one recognized trademark as a domain name stems from the fact that many internet users,when looking for a company web site,may simply infer the web site address by extrapolating from the company recognized trademark,at.for instance,a person looking for the company web site might enter into her web browser,assuming correctly that it would turn up the company official web site.
as companies seek to incorporate their nationally registered trademarks into domain names that they can use to promote goods and services,they often find that the names,or names confusingly similar,have already been registered by individuals unconnected with the company.delta matsuura,supra,b,at.this occurrence is unsurprising because the initial domain name registration system is a operated,system that does not inquire into potential conflicts with trademarks.see also sporty farm,at attributing increasing cybersquatting to lack of any regulatory control over domain name registration panavision int l,toeppen,cir noting that nsi,the registrar involved in this case,does require registrants to represent that they are not infringing any trademarks,but does not make any inquiry of its own.
in the past,confusingly similar trademarks could exist simultaneously in different geographical areas or in different business sectors without creating consumer confusion.the internet has drastically changed this situation because a domain name is both unique and global in scope.street grant,law of the internet,at see also internet architecture board,request for comments,iab technical comment on the unique dns root,at to remain a global network,the internet requires the existence of a globally unique public name space.second wipo report,supra,at.for example,a party can not register and use in the united states while another party registers and uses in brazil.similarly,one party can not register that domain name to post biblical messages while another uses it to promote a soccer team,like any domain name,is unique and its use by one party is mutually exclusive with its use by any other party.

when a domain name registrant registers a domain name with a registrar,such as nsi,the parties enter into a registration agreement.sallen registration agreement,like all registration agreements for second level domain names within the.com.net.org.biz.info,and.name top level domains,incorporates the terms of the udrp.see uniform policy general information,at last updated,udrp note id.this is because registrars have agreed,or have been required by icann,to incorporate the udrp into registration agreements for these second level domain names,uniform policy general information,supra udrp note,and registrants must accept the udrp terms in order to register a domain name.parisi netlearning,d,noting that the udrp binds registrants by virtue of their contracts with registrars see also second wipo report,supra,at noting that icann uses its control over the domain name system to impose the udrp through contract.
by its terms,the udrp governs disputes between the registrant and third parties over the registration and use of a domain name.udrp.in particular,the udrp only governs allegations by third party trademark holders asserting that a registrant has engaged in cybersquatting.under the udrp,a registrant is required to submit to a mandatory administrative proceeding in the event that a third party asserts,to an administrative dispute resolution service provider,that the registrant domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which the complainant has rights the registrant has no rights or legitimate interests in the domain name and the registrant domain name has been registered and is being used in bad faith.id.a complainant under the udrp must establish all three elements to prevail.

the wipo panel found that sallen domain name was identical or confusingly similar to cl corinthiao mark,mainly on the grounds that when comparing corinthians with corinthiao the domain name at issue is phonetically nearly identical to the complainant trademark.then,finding that sallen did not use or prepare to use the domain name in connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services before he had received notice of the dispute,udrp c i,and that he was not making a legitimate noncommercial or fair use of the domain name,without intent for commercial gain or to misleadingly divert consumers,id.c iii,the panel concluded that sallen had no rights or legitimate interests in,id.a ii.finally,the panel concluded that sallen registered and used in bad faith,id.a iii,because he registered the domain name primarily for the purpose of selling it to cl,id.b i.the panel ordered that the registration of be transferred to cl.

our review of the district court order dismissing sallen complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is de novo.corrada betances serv,cir.the basic framework for analyzing federal subject matter jurisdiction has long been settled.jurisdiction depends upon the facts as they existed when the complaint was brought mullen torrance,wheat.for a federal court to have subject matter jurisdiction over a dispute,a statute must confer jurisdiction on the federal court and the exercise of jurisdiction must be consistent with the constitution.osborn bank of the united states,wheat.
the federal question jurisdiction statute,states that t he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.in order to determine whether a case arises under federal law,we look at the plaintiff complaint.louisville nashville mottley.sallen complaint alleges a cause of action under federal law,namely d v,and so his cause of action arises under federal law for purposes of 
cl asserts that sallen action does not arise under d v because he has not provided notice to a mark owner as required by the statute and because there is no dispute under the acpa.cl argument is without merit.sallen has clearly stated in his complaint that d v is the basis for his requested relief.whether or not sallen can win his claim under d v is a separate question which does not bear on jurisdiction unless sallen claim is wholly insubstantial and frivolous.bell hood.holding that jurisdiction is not defeated by the possibility that the averments might fail to state a cause of action on which petitioners could actually recover.
sallen claim is not wholly insubstantial and frivolous.whether cl is a mark owner within the meaning of the statute is in dispute,but it is far from frivolous to argue that it is sallen claims that he gave notice to cl as required by d v and cl does not dispute this.instead,cl says that it has not registered corinthians as a trademark and so sallen did not provide notice to a mark owner.cl interpretation of mark owner is unpersuasive.the acpa says mark,not registered mark,which defines separately.section defines mark to include any trademark and that same section defines trademark as any word,name,symbol,or device used by a person,or which a person has a bona fide intention to use in commerce and applies to register on the principal register,to identify and distinguish his or her goods and to indicate the source of the goods.mark owner must be understood against the backdrop of trademark law,which provides some protections to unregistered marks.see stores,samara,d two pesos,taco cabana,d.
in addition,interpreting mark owner to apply only to registered marks would create a perverse result at odds with our view of the acpa as granting relief to registrants who have wrongly lost domain names in udrp proceedings.it would be very odd if congress,which was well aware of the international nature of trademark disputes protected americans against reverse domain name hijacking only when a registered american mark owner was doing the hijacking.such a policy would permit american citizens,whose domain names are subject to wipo transfer orders,to get relief against abusive mark owners that have registered in the,but not against abusive mark owners that have not registered including both foreign mark owners and domestic mark owners that have not registered.it would leave registrants unprotected against reverse domain name hijackers so long as the hijackers are not registered with the pto.
with regard to whether there is a dispute under the acpa,the text states a registrant whose domain name has been suspended,disabled,or transferred under a policy described under clause ii ii may,upon notice to the mark owner,file a civil action d v.a policy described under clause ii ii includes any action of transferring or canceling a domain name ii in the implementation of a reasonable policy by such registrar prohibiting the registration of a domain name that is identical to,confusingly similar to,or dilutive of another mark.id.d ii ii.it is undisputed that sallen is a registrant and that the wipo panel ordered his domain name transferred.the transfer was under a policy as defined by d ii ii.that is,his domain name was transferred by nsi,pursuant to its policy,stated in the udrp,see udrp k,of cancelling or transferring domain names found by a dispute resolution panel to be confusingly similar to others trademarks 
the analysis is not as simple under the constitution.the question here is whether congress has extended the federal courts jurisdiction beyond article iii limits by providing a cause of action to individuals such as sallen.article iii states that t he judicial power shall extend to all cases arising under this constitution,the laws of the united states,and treaties made under their authority.const.art.iii,cl.article iii acts as a ceiling congress may confer federal jurisdiction up to article iii limits,but not beyond.osborn,wheat.although osborn reflects a broad conception of arising under jurisdiction,verlinden cent.bank of nigeria,d,congress may not extend that jurisdiction to decide federal questions that are not article iii cases.the triad of injury in fact,causation,and redressability comprises the core of article iii requirement,and the party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing its existence.steel citizens for a better env t,d footnote omitted 
if d v were read to permit federal jurisdiction in instances where no article iii case or controversy exists,then the statute would run afoul of the constitution.but we do not read d v as granting federal jurisdiction over mere abstract claims of federal right where no article iii case exists.although cl has stated that it has no intent to sue sallen under the acpa for his past actions related to,there is indeed a controversy between sallen and cl sallen asserts that he has rights to and cl asserts that it has mutually exclusive rights to the same domain name.since the dismissal of sallen complaint,the domain name has been transferred to cl and is now being used to promote the corinthians soccer team.sallen asserts that the domain name belongs to him.
cl claims that a reasonable apprehension of suit is required to meet article iii case or controversy requirement.but this is not the only way to establish the existence of a case for purposes of article iii.the reasonable apprehension of suit doctrine exists to cabin declaratory judgment actions where the only controversy surrounds a potential,future lawsuit,biogen,amgen.holding no case or controversy exists when a party brings a declaratory judgment action to declare patents invalid and the declaratory defendant promises never to sue on the patents in the future super sack chase packaging,same.that is not this case.
here,sallen has already had transferred from him a domain name,to which he claims to have legitimate rights,in an international dispute resolution proceeding.at the time sallen filed his complaint,the dispute had already progressed far beyond those cases in which a declaratory defendant only questionably threatened suit.sallen had been brought before a wipo panel,the panel had found him in violation of the udrp cybersquatting provision,and the panel had ordered the disputed domain name transferred to cl.sallen objected to all of this.as other courts have noted,a certain controversy renders the reasonable apprehension question irrelevant.arrowhead indus.water,ecolochem,waters.
according to cl,regardless of any udrp dispute between it and sallen,there is no dispute under the acpa.but this assumes that a declaration of compliance with the acpa is only relevant to defend against a potential lawsuit under that very statute and that a declaration of sallen compliance with the acpa could not redress his udrp defeat.this assumption is incorrect.section d v provides a registrant who has lost a domain name under the udrp with a cause of action for an injunction returning the domain name if the registrant can show that she is in compliance with the acpa.a declaration of sallen compliance with the acpa would redress his loss of in the udrp proceeding.
first,the udrp clearly contemplates judicial intervention and,in fact,that the judicial outcome will override the udrp one.see udrp k stating that udrp proceedings shall not prevent either party from submitting the dispute to a court of competent jurisdiction for independent resolution world intellectual property organization,the management of internet names and addresses intellectual property issues final report of the wipo internet domain name process v,at http,hereinafter first wipo report stating that udrp administrative dispute resolution procedures should not have and can not have the effect of binding precedent in national courts id.at v stating that a decision by a court of competent jurisdiction,that is contrary to a determination resulting from the administrative procedure should override the administrative determination.
this is how the udrp has been interpreted.broadbridge media,d,concluding that a plaintiff that has filed an icann administrative proceeding may,before,during,and after filing such a proceeding,bring an action in federal court prods.armitage hardware.supply,c,wl,at.may,concluding that the icann policy and its accompanying rules do contemplate the possibility of parallel proceedings in federal court and that federal courts are not bound by the outcome of the icann administrative proceedings parisi,d at,concluding that udrp proceedings should not receive the significant deference accorded to arbitration under the federal arbitration act.
the ability of the parties to a udrp proceeding to seek independent resolution of the issues was part of the compromise codified in the udrp.see udrp k first wipo report,supra,at recommending,with the approval of virtually all commentators,that the udrp not deny the parties to the dispute access to court litigation id.at,iv noting that parties should be able to seek de novo review of udrp administrative dispute resolution.because the udrp explicitly contemplates independent review in national courts,the cause of action sallen seeks to assert is consistent with the udrp structure.
since the udrp can not confer federal jurisdiction where none exists,the remaining question is whether congress has,in fact,provided a cause of action to override udrp decisions.under d v,congress has provided registrants such as sallen with an affirmative cause of action to recover domain names lost in udrp proceedings.the statute clearly states that a registrant whose domain name has been suspended,disabled,or transferred may sue for a declaration that the registrant is not in violation of the act and for an injunction returning the domain name.d v.sallen is a registrant.his domain name has been transferred.now he simply seeks the declaration and injunction that the statutory provision makes available.congress authorization of the federal courts to grant injunctive relief to the domain name registrant,including the reactivation of the domain name or transfer of the domain name to the domain name registrant,provides sallen with an explicit cause of action to redress his loss of under the udrp.phc,pioneer healthcare,cir holding that federal jurisdiction clearly exists over plaintiff request for a declaration that it was not violating defendant trademark rights and that it was entitled to maintain its trademark registration.
that a declaration of compliance with the acpa trumps the panel finding of noncompliance with the udrp is further supported by the overlap between the two provisions.in the wipo proceeding,the panel found that was confusingly similar to cl trademark,that sallen had no rights or legitimate interests in,and that the domain name was registered and being used in bad faith.sallen argues that,under law,none of these claims is legally supported.
although cl recognizes overlap between the udrp and the acpa,it argues that wipo proceedings determine whether a registrant use of a domain name is in accordance with the udrp,not whether there has been a violation of a law.but a wipo panel application of the udrp requires it to resolve issues of law in some cases and,in these cases,a federal court declaration of a udrp participant rights directly impacts the decision issued by the wipo panel.for instance,the panel found that sallen had no rights to or legitimate interests in the domain name at issue.the panel concluded that publishing quotes from the bible before cl filed its complaint but after sallen had notice that there was a dispute brewing was insufficient to constitute a right or legitimate interest.a finding by a federal court that sallen was within his rights when he used to post biblical quotes would directly undercut the panel conclusion.
similarly,the panel,taking into consideration sallen lack of rights or interests in the domain name,found that sallen had registered and used in bad faith.again,sallen asserts that he had no bad faith intent because he believed,and had reasonable grounds to believe,that his use of was fair or otherwise lawful under d b ii.a finding by a federal court that sallen was within his rights would necessarily undermine the panel conclusion that he used the domain name in bad faith.
more generally,a court d v decision that a party is not a cybersquatter under the acpa,and that a party has a right to use a domain name,necessarily negates a wipo decision that a party is a cybersquatter under the udrp.the conclusion that a federal court interpretation of the acpa supplants a wipo panel interpretation of the udrp is further reinforced by the fact that wipo does not create new applies existing law.in fact,the application of the lowest common denominator of internationally agreed and accepted principles concerning the abuse of trademarks,rather than the creation of new law,is part of the udrp fundamental structure.see second wipo report,supra,at.
cl claims that it does not contest any of sallen acpa cybersquatting arguments,but instead defends wipo decision that sallen violated the udrp contractual prohibition on cybersquatting.as cl understands the law,sallen has waived his rights under the acpa by agreeing to different standards under the udrp.but d v provides disappointed administrative dispute resolution participants with a chance to have any unfavorable udrp decision reviewed in a court.we think this provision means that a federal court decision that sallen was in compliance with the acpa necessarily contradicts the wipo panel finding that sallen lacked a legitimate interest in.congress has defined in the acpa what it means to lack a legitimate interest in a domain name under law.for that reason,should a federal court declare that sallen is in compliance with the acpa,that declaration would undercut the rationale of the wipo panel decision.
we would not lightly assume that congress enacted the acpa,but intended all domain name registrants
