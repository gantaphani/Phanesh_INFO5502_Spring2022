this is an appeal from an order of dismissal following the grant of respondent joe titzer motion to quash service on process on a complaint filed by appellant nam tai electronics.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
the essential facts are not in dispute.appellant is a consumer electronic products manufacturer incorporated under the laws of the british virgin islands and based in hong kong.appellant stock is publicly traded in the united states on the nasdaq national market system.respondent is an individual residing in colorado.
respondent,using seven different aliases,posted messages on internet message boards,some of which were devoted to discussions of appellant stock.is a california corporation based in santa clara,california.in order to avail himself of the opportunity to post on a message board,respondent was required to register a nickname or alias known as a id,and agree to terms of service.the terms of service include a promise not to post any content that is unlawful,defamatory,libelous or otherwise objectionable.the terms of service further state that the relationship between the person registering and shall be governed by the laws of the state of california,and that both agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the california courts.
appellant contends that at least three of the messages posted by respondent were false,defamatory,misleading,or otherwise unlawful.the messages at issue stated that appellant had colluded with other companies to win contracts in restraint of free trade and that it was losing business to another electronics manufacturing firm.in july,appellant filed a complaint for libel,trade libel,and violations of business and professions code section against the unknown author of the three messages.after some investigation,appellant learned that respondent was the author,and the complaint was amended to add him as the true defendant.respondent was personally served with the complaint in colorado in december,and immediately moved to quash for lack of personal jurisdiction.hearing was set for march.
on february,counsel for respondent filed a status conference questionnaire which stated respondent had specially appeared and filed a motion to quash to be heard on march.at the status conference that was attended by counsel for both sides,the court set a trial date and final status conference date.
at the subsequent hearing on the motion to quash,the court granted the motion.the court found that specific jurisdiction could be based on the fact that respondent derived benefit from california by having an account contract with,a internet company,that permitted him to post messages on a maintained bulletin board.nevertheless,the court concluded that while specific jurisdiction could be extended over respondent it would not comport with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice to do so,explaining at length why it believed this was so.appellant is not a california resident.it filed suit in california to conveniently obtain subpoena power over,which it then used to compel to disclose the name of the person who posted the alleged defamatory messages on the bulletin board devoted to appellant corporation.respondent messages did not have a peculiar california impact.respondent messages posted to the bulletin board were disseminated.respondent messages,in other words,were not and had no peculiar impact on california residents.that the employees who maintained the electronic bulletin board are located in california is incidental.the maintained bulletin board is part of a communications network that is accessible to any internet user.the bulletin board is interactive messages may be posted on it from any internet portal by a account subscriber.respondent accessed and posted to the bulletin board from outside california.respondent is an individual and resides in colorado.respondent using keystrokes from his computer entered an account contract with over the internet.he posted the messages to maintained bulletin boards,including the three that are allegedly defamatory toward appellant,from a computer terminal in colorado.he has not conducted any commercial activities in california,and owns no property in california.
the court also ruled that respondent did not waive his right to challenge jurisdiction by filing the status conference questionnaire or by participating in the status conference because the status conference was a matter of routine set by the court staff and when counsel for respondent called to seek a continuance he was wrongly informed by the courtroom assistant that it could not be continued counsel alerted the court that respondent was making a special appearance to challenge jurisdiction and the court agreed that counsel could make the appearance without waiving jurisdiction.
once service was quashed as to respondent,the complaint was dismissed because there were no remaining defendants.appeal was taken from the order quashing service and dismissing the complaint.
discussion 
appellant contends that the order quashing service and dismissing for lack of personal jurisdiction should be reversed for two reasons respondent actions in filing a status conference questionnaire and appearing at the status conference constituted a general appearance and by repeatedly interacting with a web site maintained by a california corporation,respondent purposefully availed himself of the benefits of the forum,subjecting himself to jurisdiction here.
the parties are in agreement that a general appearance need not be a formal,technical step or act.what is determinative is whether defendant takes a part in the particular action which in some manner recognizes the authority of the court to proceed.sanchez superior court d.the appearance will be considered general in nature if the defendant acts in a manner,showing of a purpose of obtaining any ruling or order of the court going to the merits of the case.california overseas bank french american banking d.in order to determine whether counsel remarks constitute a general or a special appearance,we look not to whether a party expressed an intent that the appearance be considered general or special,but rather to the character of the relief asked.citation.if the defendant raises any other question,or asks for any relief which can only be granted upon the hypothesis that the court has jurisdiction of his person,his appearance is general citation.ibid.in california overseas bank,for example,counsel for defendant made an appearance at a hearing on a request for a temporary restraining order.rather than confining his remarks to a denial of the court jurisdiction over defendant or simply to clarifications of fact in order to assist the court,counsel addressed the propriety of the issuance of the temporary restraining order and,thus,defendant right to payment on a letter of credit.id.at.since the underlying suit involved that question,the court could not help but conclude that counsel addressed the merits of the case when he opposed the temporary restraining order.having addressed the merits of the case,defendant submitted itself to the jurisdiction of the court.id.at.
appellant principal authority for the proposition that filing a status conference questionnaire and appearing at a status conference constitutes a general appearance is mansour superior court th,d.in that case,separate attorneys represented two defendants as well as some defendants.the attorneys for both defendants assisted in the preparation of a joint case management statement and appeared at an evaluation hearing.the attorney also issued deposition subpoenas unrelated to the issue of jurisdiction,an action which the court held,was sufficient in and of itself to constitute a general appearance.id.at,d.as to the other defendant,the court held that his attorney assistance in the case management statement and appearance at the hearing alone was sufficient to invoke jurisdiction.the court explained that the case management evaluation procedure established a schedule for discovery and law and motion,and set a date for the mandatory settlement conference and trial.the court noted that th
