robert geiner appeals his sentence of months imprisonment for attempted interstate transportation of child pornography and possession of child pornography.we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to and a and affirm.
background 
geiner was charged with attempted interstate transportation of child pornography count one,in violation of a a b,and possession of child pornography count two,in violation of a b b.he pleaded guilty to both counts,but did so without entering into a plea agreement.because the proposed plea agreement required that geiner stipulate to the application of certain enhancements under the united states sentencing guidelines or guidelines,geiner rejected the agreement,electing to raise his arguments regarding the proper application of the guidelines before the district court.at his change of plea hearing,geiner admitted that he knowingly possessed and attempted to distribute computer files containing child pornography by enabling the feature on a computer software program called bearshare,which he installed on his home computer.he also admitted that he obtained computer files containing child pornography by downloading them from other people using bearshare.
the probation office issued a presentence investigation report psr calculating an imprisonment range under the guidelines of to months for count one and to months for count based on a total offense level of and a criminal history category of i.the total offense level included a enhancement under b b for committing an offense involving distribution for the receipt,or expectation of receipt,of a thing of value,but not for pecuniary gain.as the psr addendum reflects,geiner objected to the application of this enhancement,arguing that it should not apply because he did not barter or agree with another for the exchange of a thing of value when he shared and downloaded files containing child pornography.
geiner noted this same objection to the psr at his sentencing hearing,arguing that,instead of applying the enhancement,the court should apply the general enhancement under b f for distribution that does not fall under one of the other b subsections.in response,the government introduced the testimony of the special agent who investigated and interviewed geiner the agent testified that geiner had been using a software program called bearshare,a program that is available on the gnutella network.the agent explained that geiner originally used this program to download images from others without enabling the sharing feature of the software program to allow others to access and download his computer files.later,however,geiner changed the software settings by clicking a box on the software preferences page to facilitate the sharing of certain computer files with others according to the agent,geiner had learned that he could download files from others at a faster speed if he permitted others to obtain files from him.as the agent explained,because geiner permitted the sharing of his files,he became a priority trader when he sought files from other network users.as a priority trader,geiner had the benefit of a faster downloading speed,which gave him the ability to obtain files containing child pornography more easily and efficiently.after hearing from both parties,the district court decided that the enhancement applied to geiner case because he had made files containing child pornography available to the public in return for the ability to obtain child pornography at a faster speed.
after the court addressed geiner objections to the psr,geiner indicated that he wished to call witnesses to testify in his behalf.at this point,the district court notified the parties that it intended to impose a sentence within the guidelines,even though the court understood that the guidelines are not mandatory and it may exercise its discretion to impose a sentence that meets the objectives of the sentencing factors delineated in a.the court noted that the guidelines have particular value to sentencing judges in this kind of case and that it should not ignore the guidelines when a guidelines sentence meets the purposes of the factors in a.in addition,the court explained that,because it intended to apply a guidelines sentence,it would not consider impermissible bases for departure.in response,geiner counsel indicated that she understood the court intentions and that all of the testimony she planned to present was related to a ground for departure under the guidelines,specifically diminished capacity under.
after hearing geiner testimony and counsels arguments concerning a departure based on diminished capacity,the court accepted the psr total offense level of and decided to sentence geiner within the guidelines range contained in the psr.before imposing the sentence,the court asked the parties if they wished to make any additional objections.neither party objected.the court subsequently sentenced geiner to months imprisonment,the bottom end of the applicable range under the guidelines.
on appeal,geiner challenges his sentence on two grounds.he argues that the district court erred in applying the enhancement under b b and that his sentence is both unreasonable and unconstitutional because the court did not consider the a factors.
ii.discussion 
we will set aside geiner sentence only if it is procedurally or substantively unreasonable in light of the statutory factors contained in a.see united states hildreth,cir.a procedurally reasonable sentence reflects the sentencing court calculation of the applicable advisory guidelines range and its application of the a factors.see united states atencio,cir.in addition,to impose a procedurally reasonable sentence,the sentencing court must afford defendants their rights under the federal rules of criminal procedure.id.a sentence is substantively reasonable when it reflects the gravity of the crime and the a factors as applied to the case.id.
moreover,although the guidelines are now advisory,we accord a properly calculated guidelines sentence a presumption of substantive reasonableness,see united states kristl,cir per curiam,an approach the supreme court recently upheld as constitutional,rita united states,d.in holding that the courts of appeals may accord guidelines sentences this presumption,the supreme court explained that the guidelines seek to embody the a considerations and reflect a rough approximation of sentences that might achieve a objectives.id.at.consequently,when a district court imposes a guidelines sentence,it reflects the double determination of the district court and the sentencing commission regarding the proper sentence the upshot is that the sentencing statutes envision both the sentencing judge and the commission as carrying out the same basic a objectives,the one,at retail,the other at wholesale.id.at.as the court reasoned,an appellate presumption of reasonableness simply recognizes the circumstance that when the judge discretionary decision accords with the commission view of the appropriate application of a in the mine run of cases,it is probable that the sentence is reasonable.id.at.
in affirming the use of an appellate presumption,the court also emphasized the nonbinding nature of the presumption.id.at.it does not function like an evidentiary presumption,which requires one side to meet a particular burden of proof,and it does not allow for the especially strong deference appellate courts often grant an expert agency factual findings.id.the presumption simply reflects the increased likelihood that a guidelines sentence will be reasonable because it represents the combined judgment of the sentencing court and the sentencing commission.id.at.with this in mind,we first determine whether the district court correctly applied the guidelines,reviewing the court findings of fact for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.see kristl,at.we then address geiner argument that his sentence is unreasonable and unconstitutional.
application of the guidelines 
the district court applied a increase to geiner sentence under b b,which enhances a sentence based on d istribution for the receipt,or expectation of receipt,of a thing of value,but not for pecuniary gain.the application note to this section defines the type of distribution to which the enhancement applies as any transaction,including bartering or other transaction,that is conducted for a thing of value,but not for profit.app.the definition of thing of value is clarified by the note as anything of valuable consideration and is illustrated by an example for example,in a case involving the bartering of child pornographic material,the thing of value is the child pornographic material received in exchange for other child pornographic material bartered in consideration for the material received.id.
geiner argues that this enhancement should not apply because he did not agree to provide access to his files in exchange for the files he sought from others.nor did he expect anyone to reciprocate by providing files or anything else of value.in other words,because he did not communicate with anyone who had access to his files and did not expect anyone to provide him with something of value in return for his files,geiner contends that the district court erred in applying the enhancement.because this court has yet to interpret this particular guidelines provision,we analyze the relevant language in detail,focusing in particular on the meaning of transaction,expectation,and thing of value.
the meaning of transaction 
we begin by addressing the argument that the enhancement applies only to a exchange or agreement between two or more traders in child pornography.although the application note contains terms familiar to contract law,the plain language of the provision itself counsels against a narrow interpretation of its application.a person need only have the expectation of receipt of something of value for the enhancement to apply.this expectation need not arise from an underlying agreement to exchange child pornography or distribute it in return for a thing of value.although the application note indicates that bartering and other transaction s are examples of transactions to which the enhancement applies,it does not limit the definition of transaction to these examples.we therefore agree with the second circuit interpretation of the note language the word including before the examples indicates that any long as it involves the expectation of the receipt of a thing of value suffices to trigger the subsection enhancement.united states maneri,cir see also united states oldham,cir unpublished agreeing with the second circuit holding that a defendant may have an expectation in the absence of a specific agreement with another person.hence,geiner need not have entered into a specific agreement or understanding with other individuals for the enhancement to apply.the enhancement applies if he engaged in any transaction with the expectation that he would receive a thing of value.
our recent discussion of distribution under in united states shaffer,cir,illustrates how geiner conduct constitutes a transaction.in shaffer,we interpreted the term distribution under a according to its plain meaning,holding that a defendant distributes child pornography under the statute by distributing,delivering,transferring,or dispersing it to others.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.we specifically held that a defendant distributes child pornography by making computer files containing child pornography available for others to download.id.at.we likened a defendant who makes computer files available in this manner to the owner of a gas station 
n either the owner nor his or her agents may ever pump gas.but the owner has a roadside sign letting all passersby know that,if they choose,they can stop and fill their cars for themselves,paying at the pump by credit card.just because the operation is we do not doubt for a moment that the gas station owner is in the business of distributing gasoline.
id.at.we also do not doubt that the gas station owner and the passerby engage in a transaction,which includes both an act or an instance of conducting business or other dealings and a ny activity involving two or more persons.black law dictionary ed.hence,the meaning of distribution under easily falls within the meaning of the word transaction.here,geiner does not dispute that he attempted to distribute child pornography within the meaning of.in addition,he does not contest the district court finding that a governmental agent was able to download files containing child pornography from his computer.because his conduct satisfies our definition of distribution in shaffer,at,it also constitutes a transaction as that term is used in the application note to.see shaffer,at holding that defendant distributed child pornography under when others downloaded it after he made it available through his use of a program.consequently,the only remaining question is whether geiner expected to receive a thing of value.
the expectation of receipt of a thing of value under b b 
the term expectation in b b is a result of a amendment to the guidelines as we recently noted,although this court has yet to interpret the amended language,the second circuit has interpreted the provision at issue.see oldham.at unpublished citing maneri.in maneri,the second circuit explained when a defendant expects to receive a thing of value under b b b ased on the ordinary meaning of the word expectation,the enhancement applies when a defendant distributes child pornography in anticipation of,or while reasonably believing in the possibility of,the receipt of a thing of value.at.we agree that this interpretation reflects the ordinary meaning of the word expectation and hold that a defendant expects to receive a thing of value under b b when he distributes child pornography in anticipation of,or while reasonably believing in the possibility of,the receipt of a thing of value.
in the instant case,geiner clearly anticipated that he would receive a thing of value when he enabled the software feature in order to distribute files containing child pornography to others.the district court found that geiner enabled the feature to allow others to access his files because he wanted to be able to acquire child pornography on the network at a faster speed.in other words,he made his files available to others on the network in anticipation of a faster downloading speed.believing that others would configure their systems to allow priority downloading,geiner expected to become a priority trader who could acquire shared files more quickly.although he had no definite guarantee that others would so configure their systems,he reasonably believed in that possibility and anticipated the benefit of acquiring files at a more rapid speed.
geiner acknowledges that he configured his software to permit the sharing of his files because he wanted to be able to download images at a faster speed.nevertheless,he contends that he did not expect to receive a thing of value because he would have had access to the images he sought without allowing others to access his files.he argues that,because he could have downloaded the same images without allowing this access,he did not expect to receive a thing of value.in short,he argues that he did not expect to receive a benefit when he configured the software on his computer to allow for the distribution of files containing child pornography.
we agree that geiner did not expect to access images and other files in exchange for allowing other network users to access his files.although other courts have held that,by sharing files on a network,a defendant necessarily expects to receive a thing of value,access to other users files,united states griffin,cir united states mcvey,d,we do not think the language of b b permits such a broad interpretation.to apply the enhancement to every defendant who shares files on a network would be to disregard the connection between distribution and thing of value in the provision requirement that distribution be for the receipt,or expectation of receipt,of a thing of value.b b emphasis added.although a defendant may share files on a network with the expectation of receiving other users files in return,this is not necessarily true in every case.indeed,the present case illustrates the exception.gein
