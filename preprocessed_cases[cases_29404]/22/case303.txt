henry mcgrattan appeals his sentence for using a computer connected to the internet to persuade a minor to engage in illegal sexual activity,and knowingly receiving and distributing child pornography.the district court concluded that based on a prior ohio state offense,a higher mandatory minimum sentence applied to the first count.because the ohio offense does not categorically qualify as a prior offense under federal law,and because the government has not provided sufficient documentation of mcgrattan actual conduct in that offense,we vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion.
background 
on february,henry mcgrattan pled guilty to a misdemeanor attempted violation of ohio section a.according to the warrant affidavit of an fbi agent,mcgrattan had sent several explicit photographs of underage boys and girls to an undercover illinois detective.
as detailed in an affidavit of complaint,from march through june of,mcgrattan sent pictures to and attempted to meet with an fbi agent posing as a girl on the america online internet service.on june,mcgrattan was indicted on one count of violation of b for using a computer connected to the internet to persuade a minor to engage in illegal sexual activity and one count of violation of a for knowingly receiving and distributing child pornography.on july,mcgrattan pled not guilty on both counts.on september,he changed his plea to guilty on both counts.
the district court found that mcgrattan ohio conviction qualified as a prior conviction under b,raising the mandatory minimum for the child pornography offense from five to fifteen years.the district court also verbally explained the guidelines calculations for both counts,resulting in a range of to months.the court acknowledged that mcgrattan had raised and preserved several objections to the guidelines calculations,but decided that because count carried a mandatory minimum and count carried a mandatory minimum with a prior conviction,and it was sentencing mcgrattan to the mandatory minimum of months,it need not address those objections.
on december,the district court sentenced mcgrattan to years imprisonment,years supervised release,and a mandatory assessment.mcgrattan timely appealed.
discussion 
application of the categorical approach 
mcgrattan primary contention is that the district court erred by finding that his conviction under ohio section a qualified as a prior conviction for the purposes of b.he argues that the statutory elements of his prior misdemeanor conviction under section do not sufficiently overlap with defining child pornography to result in a predicate child pornography offense under section b in all instances.
we review de novo the district court legal conclusion that a prior conviction is a qualifying offense.see,united states armstead,cir reviewing conclusion that prior conviction was a crime of violence under the sentencing guidelines.
b provides that a violator of a shall be fined under this title and imprisoned not less than years and not more than years,but,if such person has a prior conviction under the laws of any state relating to the production,possession,receipt,mailing,sale,distribution,shipment,or transportation of child pornography,such person shall be fined under this title and imprisoned for not less than years nor more than years.
b.defines child pornography as any visual depiction,including any photograph,film,video,picture,or computer or image or picture,whether made or produced by electronic,mechanical,or other means,of sexually explicit conduct,where 
a the production of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct 
finally,sexually explicit conduct is defined as i sexual intercourse,including,or,whether between persons of the same or opposite sex ii bestiality iii masturbation iv sadistic or masochistic abuse or v lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person a.
the ohio statute under which mcgrattan was convicted makes it illegal to p ossess or view any material or performance that shows a minor who is not the person child or ward in a state of nudity.ohio section a.the scope of this statute was narrowed in when the united states supreme court adopted the ohio supreme court interpretation limiting section a to cover only the possession or viewing of material or performance of a minor who is in a state of nudity,where such nudity constitutes a lewd exhibition or involves a graphic focus on the genitals,and where the person depicted is neither the child nor the ward of the person charged.osborne ohio,d quoting state young,ohio,emphasis added.
thus,the question is whether mcgrattan ohio conviction qualifies as a conviction under the laws of a state relating to the possession,receipt,or distribution of any visual depiction which involves the use of a minor engaging in lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person under b.
the government principal argument is that the state conviction qualifies as a predicate offense because it relates to the same by section b.we look first to the supreme court explication of the general principles governing the application of enhancements based on state convictions.
in taylor united states,d,the court held,in the context of the armed career criminal act acca,e,that sentencing enhancements based on a prior jury conviction,generally require the trial court to look only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense in determining if that offense is a qualifying prior conviction.id.at.see also united states arnold,cir applying taylor to the sentencing guidelines.taylor allows the court additionally to consider the indictment or information and jury instructions when they show that the defendant was charged only with qualifying conduct.taylor,at.
in shepard united states,d,the supreme court further clarified what types of documents a sentencing court may look to when the prior conviction was the subject of a plea rather than a jury trial.there,the court held that police reports could not be used,and that a judge investigations into the conduct underlying prior pleas are generally limited to examining the statutory definition,charging document,written plea agreement,transcript of plea colloquy,and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.id.at.the court limited the evidence the court may consider because of concerns that allowing a judge to resolve a disputed finding of fact based on a prior plea would present a serious risk of unconstitutionality by raising the sentencing ceiling without the jury finding.id.at.
the government cites cases from four circuits to support its argument that taylor and shepard do not apply to the enhancement provision in.in united states rezin,cir,the seventh circuit rejected an argument that a prior conviction for third degree sexual assault against two minors in violation of a wisconsin statute failed to qualify as enhancement under b,which is materially indistinguishable from the statute at issue here.id.at.the court discussed at length the policy implications that made the conduct that gave rise to the prior conviction rather than the elements of the underlying offense important.id.at.although rezin departs from the shepard in suggesting that facts which are uncontested or uncontestable can be used even if not presented in documents allowed by taylor or shepard,rezin,at,in view of the constitutional underpinning of shepard,we are not persuaded that we should depart from its holding.further,the rezin court assumption that the sentencing court should look first to the charging document the indictment or information and to the judgment,read in light of the statute under which the defendant was convicted is consistent with both taylor and shepard.rezin,at.in united states trogdon,cir,also cited by the government,the court,following rezin,first held that the victim age was not an element of the statute of prior conviction required to qualify categorically under section b.id.at.the court then went on to examine the underlying facts to determine whether the victim was a minor.
