this appeal,a part of the multidistrict class action antitrust litigation brought against microsoft corporation by purchasers of microsoft operating system software and applications software,presents the question whether indirect purchasers have stated a claim upon which relief can be granted.see.b.the district court granted microsoft motion to dismiss their claims,concluding that because these plaintiffs did not buy software directly from microsoft,they were indirect purchasers who were barred from seeking recovery for illegal overcharges under the principles of illinois brick illinois,d.the court also found that they lacked standing to seek recovery for certain types of injury because the alleged injury did not constitute antitrust injury,was speculative,or was generalized and not specific to the plaintiffs.the court dismissed the plaintiffs equitable claims under the doctrine of laches.
for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
in the aftermath of the united states suit against microsoft,in which microsoft was found to have maintained an illegal monopoly in the worldwide market for licensing pc operating systems,see united states microsoft,numerous class action suits were filed against microsoft in courts across the country.on april,the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation transferred the cases that were pending in federal district courts to the district of maryland,pursuant to.thereafter,plaintiffs filed a superseding consolidated amended complaint,seeking damages and equitable relief under the clayton and sherman acts.see.
in their consolidated amended complaint,the plaintiffs allege that beginning in the late,when microsoft market share in the united states for operating system software was percent,microsoft engaged in a series of predatory acts that were designed to,and did,eliminate competition and prevent entry into the operating system software market.they allege that since,when digital research,and ibm were eliminated as meaningful competitors,microsoft has had no significant competitor in the operating systems software market.they assert that microsoft used this monopoly power to raise prices and to leverage its power into other markets,including markets for applications software such as word processing,spreadsheet,and office suite software,with the result that microsoft has dominated these applications software markets since the,achieving market shares approaching percent.thus,for the time periods material to the complaint,the plaintiffs contend that microsoft has had monopoly power in four product markets 
the licensing of personal computer operating systems software the licensing of personal computer word processing applications software the licensing of personal computer spreadsheet applications software and the licensing of personal computer office suite applications software.
the plaintiffs allege that microsoft maintained and advanced its monopoly power by refusing to sell its software to manufacturers,retailers,and consumers.instead,they allege,microsoft employed a licensing system.it used one type of license for transactions with original equipment manufacturers oems,allowing them to preinstall software on personal computers,which they in turn sold to consumers or.the plaintiffs claim that microsoft was able to require oems to accept the terms of microsoft licensing agreement,forcing the oems to preinstall microsoft operating systems on personal computers they sell and to act as microsoft agents in offering a second type of license,called license agreements eulas,for acceptance or rejection by consumers under terms dictated by microsoft.to use microsoft software,the were required to agree to the eulas,which provided,among other things,a refund to the if the declined to enter into the eula.the eulas imposed significant restrictions on use of the software by the licensee,giving microsoft remedies against the for breach of the license agreement.the complaint alleges in a similar manner that microsoft dictated the terms and conditions under which distributors and retailers were able to sell eulas.
the plaintiffs claim that under this licensing regime,most consumers did not purchase software licenses directly from microsoft.rather,they bought computers from oems or retailers with software that incorporated microsoft offer to issue the a license agreement.the plaintiffs who have appealed here are typical of those who purchased computers from oems or retailers with preinstalled software.
the plaintiffs allege that microsoft exclusionary and restrictive practices caused them injury by charging them prices for operating systems software and applications software,by denying them the benefit of new and superior technologies,and by preventing them from reselling microsoft software products.they also claim that by integrating its internet explorer web browser with its operating system,microsoft deprived them of alternative internet search engines,degraded the performance of their computers,and made their computers more susceptible to security breaches.in short,they allege that as,they paid prices for software and were deprived of the benefits of competition including,but not limited to,technological innovation,market choice,product variety,and substitutable supply.they request equitable relief,treble damages,attorneys fees,and costs.
in response to the plaintiffs complaint,microsoft filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs claims under federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.by order dated january,the district court granted microsoft motion,relying on two distinct grounds that the plaintiffs were indirect purchasers and therefore barred from suing for overcharge damages under the doctrine of illinois brick illinois,d and that the plaintiffs lacked standing to seek recovery for injuries other than overcharges under the holding of associated general contractors california state council of carpenters,d.in re microsoft.antitrust,d.
with respect to its application of illinois brick,the district court concluded that the plaintiffs did not purchase either software or eulas directly from microsoft,even though the computers that the plaintiffs purchased included licenses from microsoft that had to be agreed to by the purchasers.the court noted,whether the consumer buys software or the eula,the immediate economic transaction constituting the purchase occurs between the consumer and an oem or retail seller.id.at.the court also concluded that despite the broad allegations of antitrust injury,the plaintiffs claims reduced to claims for prices or overcharges paid by the plaintiffs to the oems or retail dealers from whom they purchased the computers,because any damage that was not measurable by the prices paid to the oems or retailers was only incidentally related to the alleged anticompetitive behavior.id.at.
as to the standing issue,the district court considered the five factors identified in associated general contractors and concluded that consideration of the last existence of more direct victims and the problem of speculative injury and complexity in apportioning its conclusion that plaintiffs lacked standing to sue for some of the injuries alleged.id.at.
the district court certified its january,dismissal order for appellate review under b.in re microsoft,d at.we denied plaintiffs petition for interlocutory appeal on june.
the district court granted microsoft motion to dismiss the remaining issues for equitable relief on november,concluding that it was perfectly clear that the plaintiffs in the consolidated amended complaint were not pursuing injunctive claims with diligence.the focus was on monetary damages.the court also concluded that microsoft would be prejudiced and that resurrecting equitable claims at that late date would be contrary to the public interest.
along with granting microsoft motion to dismiss the plaintiffs claims for equitable relief,the district court entered final judgment in this case on november,dismissing plaintiffs complaint.plaintiffs are now prosecuting this appeal from the court judgment.
our review of the district court judgment granting microsoft motion to dismiss under rule b is de novo and focuses only on the legal sufficiency of the complaint.in conducting this review,we take the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,but we need not accept the legal conclusions drawn from the facts,and we need not accept as true unwarranted inferences,unreasonable conclusions,or arguments.eastern shore,assocs,cir see also dickson microsoft,cir.
as its principal ground for dismissing the complaint,the district court applied the rule established in illinois brick,which held that only direct purchasers of products affected by activity can seek treble damages under of the clayton act.those who purchase indirectly or through intermediaries are barred from recovering for antitrust injuries.see also kansas utilicorp united,d.
in illinois brick,the state of illinois sued concrete block manufacturers for engaging in a conspiracy,in violation of of the clayton act and of the sherman act.the manufacturers were suppliers to subcontractors who installed bricks for general contractors engaged by the state of illinois.the state claimed that the manufacturers had illegally overcharged the intermediary contractors and that the overcharge had been passed on to the state.the supreme court barred the state from recovering against the manufacturers,because the state,as an indirect purchaser,should not be allowed to use a theory to recover damages from a defendant unless the defendant would be allowed to use a defense in a suit by a direct purchaser.at.in hanover shoe,united shoe machinery,d,the court had held that an antitrust violator could not defend itself by arguing that a direct purchaser suffered no injury because it was able to pass on illegal overcharges to indirect purchasers.illinois brick applied the same logic to offensive uses of a theory.thus,the court held that indirect purchasers could not claim to be injured because direct purchasers had passed on illegal overcharges to them.at.
the supreme court relied on two rationales in adopting the rule.first,allowing indirect purchasers to recover damages at each level down the economic chain would create a serious risk of multiple liability for defendants.illinois brick,at.see also hanover shoe,at.utilicorp,at.second,courts would be required to engage in highly complicated calculations to apportion the recovery among all potential plaintiffs that could have absorbed part of the overcharge.illinois brick,at.this would add whole new dimensions of complexity to suits and seriously undermine their effectiveness.id.by adopting the rule barring recovery by indirect purchasers,the risk of duplicative recoveries and overcompensation for the same antitrust injuries was eliminated.
to be governed by the illinois brick rule,plaintiffs have to be indirect purchasers seeking recovery for illegal overcharges.indirect purchasers are those purchasers i n the distribution chain,who are not the immediate buyers from the alleged antitrust violators.utilicorp,at.
in this case,it is apparent that the plaintiffs were indirect purchasers because they did not buy products directly from microsoft.rather,they purchased computers from oems or retailers on which microsoft operating systems and software had been preinstalled.the plaintiffs were thus at the end of the retail distribution chain with at least one and possibly more intermediaries between them and microsoft.the plaintiffs are also claiming damages in the form of overcharges paid to the oems and retailers who could in turn seek recovery for overcharges against microsoft.thus,the plaintiffs claim for damages in the form of overcharges would,at first blush,appear to fall squarely within the illinois brick paradigm.
the plaintiffs do not contest the fact that they purchased computers from oems and retailers,on which microsoft operating systems and applications software were preinstalled.they argue nonetheless that illinois brick does not bar their damages claims,giving four basic reasons they acquired licenses that functioned as contracts directly between them and microsoft their right under the eula to a refund from microsoft establishes a direct economic relationship microsoft should be judicially estopped from asserting that it sells software to intermediaries by statements that it made in other cases and an exception allowed by illinois brick based on superseding market forces should be applied.we address these arguments in turn.
first,plaintiffs argue that because they subscribed to eulas and microsoft does not sell its software to anyone,the eula between each plaintiff and microsoft is the relevant economic transaction.this argument,however,fails to recognize both the role of the oem or the retailer in the licensing chain and the economic realities of the transaction.although microsoft does not sell title to its software,it does sell licenses to use its software,and plaintiffs could have acquired licenses directly from microsoft.indeed,in this case,the district court certified a class of who did purchase licenses for operating systems software directly from microsoft.but the plaintiffs in this case acquired their licenses by purchases from oems and retailers,paying them,not microsoft,for their licenses at prices set by the oems and retailers.because the plaintiffs purchased their products from intermediaries and not microsoft,they are indirect purchasers within the meaning of that term as defined in illinois brick and utilicorp,and the recoveries they would have from microsoft would present the very problems that those cases sought to avoid.
in the same vein,the plaintiffs contend that because the eula entitles them to a refund from microsoft in the event that they do not subscribe to the license,the meaningful transaction is between them and microsoft.but it does not follow from this observation that the plaintiffs were direct purchasers of microsoft licenses.while the reimbursement structure does demonstrate that microsoft maintains a financial relationship with,that relationship does not establish that plaintiffs paid microsoft for the software licenses.moreover,even though microsoft might be required by the eula to provide refunds or other reimbursements,that obligation did not give microsoft the ability to control the retail prices set by oems and retailers for the sale of the license agreements.were we to accept plaintiffs argument,we would have to consider the very complex price adjustments within microsoft distribution chain that illinois brick sought to avoid.see illinois brick,at.
plaintiffs also seek to bind microsoft,under the doctrine of judicial estoppel,from asserting that it sells software to oems or other retailers because,within the context of other legal disputes,microsoft has denied making a first sale to oems.although microsoft may have argued in the past that it did not sell title to its software,plaintiffs have not shown that microsoft ever denied selling oems the right to charge consumers for licenses or the options to enter into licenses.as microsoft has not relied on mutually inconsistent positions,we find no basis for applying the doctrine of judicial estoppel.see emergency one,am.fire eagle engine,cir king herbert thomas memorial,cir.
finally,plaintiffs argue that they should not be held to be indirect purchasers because of a market forces exception referred to in illinois brick.there,the court stated that a situation in which market forces have been superseded and the defense might be permitted is where the direct purchaser is owned or controlled by its customer.at.this exception,however,has been construed narrowly to apply only when the antitrust defendant has either functional unity with the intermediary sellers or sufficient ownership interest in or control over the intermediary sellers to set prices along the chain of distribution.see in re brand name prescription drugs antitrust,cir jewish hosp.stewart mechanical enterprises,cir in re sugar industry antitrust,cir.the plaintiffs,however,do not allege such facts.in the absence of such allegations,we can not overlook the supreme court admonition against enlarging exceptions that would undermine the rule.see utilicorp,at.see also dick
