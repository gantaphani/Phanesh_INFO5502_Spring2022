the plaintiffs in these consolidated appeals are veterans who received medical treatment and health care at the william jennings bryan dorn veterans affairs medical center dorn vamc in columbia,south carolina.after two data breaches at the center compromised their personal information,the plaintiffs brought separate actions against the secretary of veterans affairs and dorn vamc officials defendants,alleging violations of the privacy act of,et and the administrative procedure act apa,et.
in both cases,the plaintiffs sought to establish article iii standing based on the harm from the increased risk of future identity theft and the cost of measures to protect against it.the district court dismissed the actions for lack of jurisdiction,holding that the plaintiffs failed to establish a,imminent for purposes of article iii standing.we agree with the district court and therefore affirm.
the beck case arises from a report that on february,a laptop connected to a pulmonary function testing device with a velcro strip was misplaced or stolen from dorn vamc respiratory therapy department.the laptop contains unencrypted personal information of approximately patients,including names,birth dates,the last four digits of social security numbers,and physical descriptors age,race,gender,height,and weight.
an internal investigation determined that the laptop was likely stolen and that dorn vamc failed to follow the policies and procedures for utilizing a laptop to store patient information.dorn vamc officials used medical appointment records to notify every patient tested using the missing laptop and offered one year of free credit monitoring.to date,the laptop has not been recovered.
richard beck and lakreshia jeffery the beck plaintiffs filed suit on behalf of a putative class of the approximately patients whose information was stored on the missing laptop.relevant to this appeal,the beck plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and monetary damages under the privacy act,alleging that the defendants failures and violations of the privacy act caused plaintiffs embarrassment,inconvenience,unfairness,mental distress,and the threat of current and future substantial harm from identity theft and other misuse of their personal information.they further allege that the threat of identity theft required them to frequently monitor their credit reports,bank statements,health insurance reports,and other similar information,purchas e credit watch services,and shift financial accounts.
in addition to their privacy act claims,the beck plaintiffs sought broad injunctive relief under the apa,requiring the va to account for all privacy act records in the possession of dorn vamc and to recover and permanently destroy any improperly maintained records.the beck plaintiffs also sought to enjoin the defendants from transferring patient information from computer systems to any portable device until and unless defendants demonstrate to the court that adequate information security has been established.finally,the beck plaintiffs alleged separate negligence claims.
the defendants moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction or,in the alternative,for failure to state a claim.the district court granted the motion as to the negligence claims,but declined to dismiss the privacy act and apa claims.
following extensive discovery,the plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment and for class certification.the defendants renewed their motion to dismiss the plaintiffs claims for lack of jurisdiction and,in the alternative,moved for summary judgment.the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss,holding,pursuant to clapper amnesty international usa,that the beck plaintiffs lacked standing under the privacy act because they had not submitted evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether they face a certainly impending risk of identity theft.
the beck plaintiffs fear of harm from future identity theft,said the district court,was too speculative to confer standing because it was contingent on a chain of attenuated hypothetical events and actions by third parties independent of the defendants.citing clapper,at.the beck plaintiffs also failed to satisfy the lesser standard of substantial risk of future harm referenced in clapper the plaintiffs calculations that of those affected by the laptop theft would have their identities stolen and that all affected would be times more likely to experience identity theft d id not suffice to show a substantial risk of identity theft.
the district court also rejected the beck plaintiffs attempt to create standing by choosing to purchase credit monitoring services or taking any other steps designed to mitigate the speculative harm of future identity theft.these measures,according to the court,did not amount to an because they were taken solely to mitigate a speculative future harm.
turning to the beck plaintiffs request for injunctive relief under the apa,the district court acknowledged that the claim that there have been at least seventeen data breaches at dorn vamc during the course of th e beck litigation was undoubtedly concerning.nonetheless,the court concluded that dorn vamc past privacy act violations are insufficient to establish plaintiffs standing to seek injunctive relief where it was no more than speculation for plaintiffs to assert that their personal information will again be compromised by a future privacy act violation and that they will be injured as a result.
the district court ruled in the alternative that the defendants were entitled to summary judgment on the merits,because the beck plaintiffs had not suffered actual damages as required to recover damages under the privacy act,and the apa could not be read to provide for the broad judicial oversight of the va entire privacy program sought by the plaintiffs.
the watson case arises from dorn vamc july discovery that four boxes of pathology reports headed for storage had been misplaced or stolen.the reports contain identifying information of over patients,including names,social security numbers,and medical diagnoses.dorn vamc officials alerted those affected and,as they did following the laptop disappearance,offered each of them one year of free credit monitoring.the boxes have not been recovered.
while the beck litigation was pending,beverly watson brought a putative lawsuit on behalf of the over individuals whose pathology reports had gone missing.watson sought money damages and declaratory and injunctive relief,alleging the same harm as did the beck plaintiffs.the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim.
the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,relying on clapper to hold that watson lacked article iii standing under the privacy act because she ha d not alleged that there ha d been any actual or attempted misuse of her personal information,thus rendering her allegation that her information will eventually be misused as a result of the disappearance of the boxes speculative.
according to the district court,for watson to suffer the injury she feared,the court would have to assume that the boxes were stolen by someone bent on misusing the personal information in the pathology reports the thief would select watson report from the over reports in the missing boxes the thief would then attempt to use or sell to others watson personal information and the thief or purchaser of watson information would successfully use the information in the report to steal watson identity.this attenuated chain of possibilities did not satisfy watson burden to show that her threatened injury was certainly impending.as it did in beck,the district court rejected watson allegations that any costs incurred to fend off future identity theft constituted an.
turning to watson claim for injunctive relief under the apa,the district court concluded that her allegations,based on dorn vamc historic inability or unwillingness to protect plaintiff personal information were insufficient to show that,absent injunctive relief,she would be in real and immediate danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of some official conduct.
all plaintiffs appeal the district court ruling as to article iii standing the beck plaintiffs also appeal the district court alternative ruling that the defendants are entitled to summary judgment on the privacy act and apa claims.because we find that the plaintiffs do not have article iii standing,we do not address the merits.

the court recently explored the threatened injury theory of article iii standing in clapper amnesty international usa.that case involved a constitutional challenge to section of the foreign intelligence surveillance act of fisa,which,upon the issuance of an order from the foreign intelligence surveillance court,authorizes for a period of up to year the attorney general and the director of national intelligence to target for surveillance persons reasonably believed to be located outside the united states to acquire foreign intelligence information.at quoting.
the respondents attorneys and,labor,legal,and media organizations whose work required them to communicate via telephone and with individuals located abroad sought a declaration that the provision was facially unconstitutional and a permanent injunction against its use.id.at.the respondents alleged two injuries that curtailed their ability to locate witnesses,cultivate sources,obtain information,and communicate confidential information,and that they had implemented costly and burdensome measures,including traveling abroad to have conversations,to protect the confidentiality of their sensitive communications from fisa surveillance.id.at.
the district court ruled that the respondents lacked standing.id.at.on appeal,the second circuit reversed,holding that the objectively reasonable likelihood that the respondents communications would be intercepted at some future time and their allegation that they suffered economic and professional harm as a result were sufficient to confer standing.id.
the supreme court rejected the second circuit use of an objectively reasonable likelihood standard for article iii standing as inconsistent with the court requirement that threatened injury must be certainly impending to constitute injury in fact.id.at listing cases.addressing first the respondents allegation that the government would target their private communications,the court catalogued the series of hypothetical events that would have to occur to establish an imminent namely,the speculative possibility that the government,pursuant to many safeguards,would successfully target and intercept the communications of those foreigners with whom the respondents worked.id.at.the respondents theory of standing,premised on this highly attenuated chain of possibilities could not satisfy the requirement that threatened injury must be certainly impending.id.at.
the respondents second theory of injury,premised on the costly and burdensome measures they had undertaken to protect the confidentiality of their communications,also failed to confer standing.id.at.the court reasoned that the respondents attempts to minimize and phone conversations,to speak in generalities rather than specifics,and to travel abroad to have conversations,were all costs incurred in response to a speculative threat.id.at.the court declined to water down the fundamental requirements of article iii by allowing respondents to manufacture standing merely by inflicting harm on themselves based on their fears of hypothetical future harm that is not certainly impending.id.
clapper discussion of when a threatened injury constitutes an article iii is controlling here.before explaining why,we address the plaintiffs contention that the district court misread clapper to require a new,heightened burden for proving an article iii.to the contrary,clapper iteration of the tenet that a threatened injury must be certainly impending to constitute an is hardly novel,daimlerchrysler cuno,an asserted injury is imminent when it is certainly impending lujan,at,same whitmore,at a threatened injury must be certainly impending to constitute injury in fact.
we also reject the plaintiffs claim that emotional upset and fear of identity theft and financial fraud resulting from the data breaches are adverse effects sufficient to confer article iii standing.appellants br.at citing e.that assertion reflects a misunderstanding of the privacy act and is an overextension of doe chao.
the sole issue in chao was whether a privacy act plaintiff must prove actual damages to qualify for the minimum statutory award of.at.there,a claimant brought suit under the privacy act against the department of labor for improperly disclosing his social security number.id.at.this court held that the department was entitled to summary judgment,concluding that the claimant had failed to raise a triable issue of fact about actual damages because he had submitted no corroboration for his claim of emotional distress.id.the supreme court affirmed,reasoning that a straightforward textual analysis of the privacy act required a plaintiff to prove actual damages from an intentional or willful violation of the act to qualify for the award.id.at.
as the court explained in chao,the reference in the privacy act to adverse effect is a term of art identifying a potential plaintiff who satisfies the and causation requirements of article iii standing.at emphasis added.we decline to interpret dicta in chao discussing the plaintiff conclusory allegations that he was torn all to pieces by the unauthorized disclosure of his social security number as support for the proposition that bare assertions of emotional injury are sufficient to confer article iii standing.id.at.this court is bound by holdings of the supreme court,not its unwritten assumptions.fernandez keisler,cir.
accordingly,with clapper tenets firmly in tow,we address the two grounds for article iii standing pressed by the plaintiffs for their privacy act claims the increased risk of future identity theft,and the costs of protecting against the same.
increased risk of future identity theft 
our sister circuits are divided on whether a plaintiff may establish an article iii based on an increased risk of future identity theft.the sixth,seventh,and ninth circuits have all recognized,at the pleading stage,that plaintiffs can establish an based on this threatened injury.see galaria nationwide mut.ins,wl,at cir,increased risk of future identity theft theory established after hackers breached nationwide mutual insurance company computer network and stole their sensitive personal information,because t here is no need for speculation where plaintiffs allege that their data has already been stolen and is now in the hands of criminals remijas neiman marcus,llc,cir.increased risk of future fraudulent charges and identity theft theory established certainly impending and substantial risk of harm after hackers attacked neiman marcus with malware to steal credit card numbers,because p resumably,the purpose of the hack is,sooner or later,to make fraudulent charges or assume those consumers identities krottner starbucks,cir.increased risk of future identity theft theory a credible threat of harm for article iii purposes after theft of a laptop containing the unencrypted names,addresses,and social security numbers of starbucks employees pisciotta old bancorp,cir.banking services applicants increased risk of harm theory satisfied article iii requirement after sophisticated,intentional and malicious security breach of bank website compromised their information.
by contrast,the first and third circuits have rejected such allegations.see katz pershing,llc,cir.brokerage increased risk of unauthorized access and identity theft theory insufficient to constitute actual or impending injury after defendant failed to properly maintain an electronic platform containing her account information,because plaintiff failed to identify any incident in which her data has ever been accessed by an unauthorized person reilly ceridian,cir.increased risk of identity theft theory too hypothetical and speculative to establish certainly impending after unknown hacker penetrated payroll system firewall,because it was not known whether the hacker read,copied,or understood the system information and no evidence suggested past or future misuse of employee data or that the intrusion was intentional or malicious.
the plaintiffs say that our sister circuits decisions in krottner,pisciotta,and remijas support their allegations of standing based on threatened injury of future identity theft to the contrary,these cases demonstrate why the plaintiffs theory is too speculative to constitute an.
underlying the cases are common allegations that sufficed to push the threatened injury of future identity theft beyond the speculative to the sufficiently imminent.in galaria,remijas,and pisciotta,for example,the data thief intentionally targeted the personal information compromised in the data breaches.galaria,wl,at h ackers broke into nationwide computer network and stole the personal information of plaintiffs and million others.remijas,at why else would hackers break into a store database and steal consumers private information pisciotta,at scope and manner of intrusion into banking website hosting facility was sophisticated,intentional and malicious.and,in remijas and krottner,at least one named plaintiff alleged misuse or access of that personal information by the thief.remijas,at of the credit cards potentially exposed to malware were known to have been used fraudulently krottner,at named plaintiff alleged that,two months after theft of laptop containing his social security number,someone attempted to open a new account using his social security number.
here,the plaintiffs make no such claims.this in turn renders their contention of an enhanced risk of future identity theft too speculative.on this point,the data breaches in beck and watson occurred in february and july,respectively.yet,even after extensive discovery,the beck plaintiffs have uncovered no evidence that the information contained on the stolen laptop has been accessed or misused or that they have suffered identity theft,nor,for that matter,that the thief stole the laptop with the intent to steal their private information watson complaint suffers from the same deficiency with regard to the four missing boxes of pathology reports.moreover,as the breaches fade further into the past,the plaintiffs threatened injuries become more and more speculative.see chambliss carefirst,wl,at.may,in re,supp,t he passage of time without a single report from plaintiffs that they in fact suffered the harm they fear must mean something.
the plaintiffs counter that there is no need to speculate here because they have alleged and in the beck case the va investigation concluded that the laptop and pathology reports had been stolen.see.we of course accept this allegation as true.but the mere theft of these items,without more,can not confer article iii standing.see randolph ing life ins.annuity,supp,deeming as speculative plaintiffs allegations that at some unspecified point in the indefinite future they will be the victims of identity theft where,although plaintiffs clearly alleged their information was stolen by a burglar,they did not allege that the burglar who stole the laptop did so in order to access their i nformation,or that their i nformation ha d actually been accessed since the laptop was stolen.
indeed,for the plaintiffs to suffer the harm of identity theft that they fear,we must engage with the same attenuated chain of possibilities rejected by the court in clapper.at.in both cases,we must assume that the thief targeted the stolen items for the personal information they contained.and in bot
