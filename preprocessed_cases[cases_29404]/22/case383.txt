much like the interactive process required of employers and employees in cases involving reasonable accommodations under the ada,a consent to search often involves a little bit of between police and a person giving permission for a search.unraveling what occurred during that exchange is the stuff of suppression hearings in the district court,and a judgment on what happened and what consequences flow from what happened is usually a very inquiry.so it is in this case.
this case comes to us after shelby lemmons pled guilty to charges of using a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing a videotape in violation of a count i and,on the basis of three computer images,possessing computer files containing depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct in violation of a b count ii.lemmons guilty pleas were conditioned on his ability to air,on appeal,his claim that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress.
our case starts in a trailer park where lemmons lived in a trailer assigned to space.the chain of events started when lemmons neighbor,a woman living in trailer space,called the bloomington indiana police department to report seeing a camera lens on her trailer that should not have been there.it was pointed toward her bedroom.jeff canada,a bloomington police officer,responded to the complaint and traced a cable wire attached to the intruding camera.it led straight to lemmons trailer.
bloomington detective anthony pope soon arrived on the scene.pope knew lemmons lemmons greeted pope saying,what up,tony,who on previous occasions cooperated with the bloomington police by making controlled drug buys for them.pope knocked on lemmons door and told him about his neighbor complaint.pope said he wanted to talk to lemmons about the incident.lemmons agreed and pope and canada came in,as did two officers who arrived earlier.pope told lemmons that he wanted to search the trailer to make sure that lemmons did have any recordings of in his neighbor bedroom.after a about whether pope had a warrant he did,lemmons volunteered to get some recordings.he started to move toward his bedroom,but pope stopped him and pulled out a form.while going over the form with lemmons,lemmons asked pope if he could talk to him alone.pope asked the other officers to leave.lemmons then told pope that there were things in his trailer that he did not want pope to find.he mentioned that he had some marijuana.pope said the police were not worried about that they were there to investigate the camera and recordings.lemmons also mentioned that he had a crack pipe.pope then told lemmons he would not bargain things away and that lemmons needed to decide whether to consent to a search.lemmons then signed the form after pope read its contents to him.pope also read miranda warnings to lemmons.
according to pope,lemmons handed him some pictures,saying,you going to want to see these too,but they legal.pope described the pictures as being of a female in her late teens in some of the pictures she was partially nude.he thought the pictures were sexually provocative.lemmons also pointed out some videotapes.canada went to review the tapes on lemmons vcr.
pope next searched a front room in the trailer that resembled an office.there,lemmons pointed out some polaroids.one of them,lemmons said,was a picture of his daughter.according to pope,the girl in the picture was wearing a shirt and underwear and was in a here i am type pose.pope pointed to a computer in the room and asked lemmons if there was anything on it that pope needed to be aware of.according to the district court findings,lemmons told pope that he could look if he wanted and turned on the computer for pope.when the computer came on,pope recognized a program involving photographs.he pulled up the program and turned it on.using it,he found on the hard drive images containing child pornography.he estimated that there were over images,with the subjects ranging in age from to their late teens.standing either beside or a few feet behind pope as he reviewed the images,lemmons said,it not what you think.he claimed that the images had been sent to him by other people.
pope had another officer drive lemmons to the police station.canada told pope that the tapes he reviewed included a female about years old in a bathtub.another video contained a female in her teens engaging in sexual conduct with lemmons.
an hour or so later,pope interviewed lemmons at the police station.lemmons admitted taping his neighbor bedroom window.he also claimed that the on the tape was his granddaughter and that he had taped her.he acknowledged the videotape of the other teenager with him and admitted that he was responsible for the computer images,which he had traded with other people over the internet.lemmons was not arrested after all this simply drove him back to the trailer park and dropped him off.
pope contacted special agent robert molina of the fbi and informed him of what he had found.molina believed the material fit the definition of child pornography under federal law.the next day molina accompanied pope back to lemmons trailer,where they obtained more admissions involving lemmons use of the internet and the mail to trade child pornography.lemmons also consented to another search while searching,molina found more incriminating items.
lemmons argues on appeal that the bloomington police exceeded the scope of his consent while searching his trailer.unfortunately,his argument in the district court focused on whether his consent was involuntary.his motion to suppress did not pointedly contest the scope issue.only patches of lemmons testimony touched the issue and even then only in response to questions from the government.at the end of the hearing,lemmons argument made only cursory allusions to a fairly general search and a general rummaging.in sum,we think lemmons did not raise the issue of the scope of consent before the district court 
the more important question is what effect that has on our review.lemmons claims it has none,citing united states hardin,cir.hardin was also a case where the defendant had not raised the scope of consent issue before the district court but challenged only the voluntariness of a consent.id.at.we held that the district court conclusion with regard to voluntariness necessarily include d a finding that consent was broad enough to encompass the search in question.id.we doubt that hardin gives a free appellate pass and a potential remand to the district court to any defendant who fails to raise a scope of consent argument in a case involving the voluntariness of consent.but in hardin we found enough of a factual record to make our review possible.the same is true here.accordingly,we will assume that the district court voluntariness holding necessarily included an unarticulated finding that the consent given was broad enough to cover the scope of the subsequent search on a district court denial of a motion to suppress,we review the district court factual findings for clear error and questions of law de novo.united states,cir.
the first task is defining the scope of lemmons consent,at least initially.the scope of consent is defined by gauging,under the totality of the circumstances,what a typical reasonable person would have understood it to be.florida jimeno,d.the scope of a search is generally defined by its expressed object.united states saadeh,cir.pope gained access to lemmons trailer by saying that he needed to talk to him about his neighbor complaint about videotaping.when he was inside,pope said that he needed to search his home and make sure that he did have any recordings of her bedroom window inside.lemmons replied,i be honest with you,i got some recordings in here and i go get em for you.after pope called lemmons back,lemmons said that he had some videotapes but also some other things that lemmons did not want the police to see.pope responded,i here to investigate the camera and some recordings.lemmons then volunteered to get his videotapes.a reasonable observer would clearly understand these exchanges as centering on recordings of the neighbor bedroom window.
