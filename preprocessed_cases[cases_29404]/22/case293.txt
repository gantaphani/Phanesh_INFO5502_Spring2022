luay batti was convicted of improperly accessing information from a protected computer,in violation of a c and c b iii.he appeals the district court finding that the value of the information that he obtained exceeded and the district court order of in restitution.for the following reasons,we hold that the district court use of the cost of production of the information obtained here was a reasonable,and therefore permissible,method by which to determine the value of the information obtained by batti,and that the district court did not abuse its discretion in ordering restitution in the amount of.we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.
facts and procedural history 
luay batti worked in the it department of,an advertising company in michigan,for about six years,until he was fired in march.the events leading to his termination began about six months earlier when batti accessed computer server and copied confidential computer files belonging to ceo without authorization.although these files were normally stored on the ceo desktop computer,they had been moved by the company to the company server while the ceo computer was being replaced.within these files were confidential pieces of information including executive compensation,financial statements of the firm,goals and objectives for senior executives of the company reporting to the chairman,and some strategic plans.dist.dkt.doc.trial tr.at.
the record does not reveal why batti retained this information for six months,but,on the evening of february,he went to the office of vice chairman and general manager,joseph naporano,to talk about the information he had obtained.batti ostensible purpose in approaching naporano was merely to inform him of the weaknesses in barriers and to complain about the it department management.at this meeting,batti also gave naporano a letter in which batti set out his complaints and a computer disk containing some of the ceo files that batti had copied.the disk also contained video footage that had purchased for use in television commercials for its largest client,general motors.soon afterwards,naporano began to investigate the security weaknesses mentioned by batti,and,within a few days,naporano fired batti for exercising bad judgment in accessing and copying the ceo files.trial tr.at.
about six weeks later,on april,while the security review was still underway,naporano learned of two websites that contained confidential information regarding and gm,along with emails sent between officials of these two companies.these websites were open to the public for an likely of time,but almost immediately after discovered them they became.greatly alarmed by what was clearly a breach of the company system,and unaware of exactly how broad the breach was,naporano contacted the police and an it security firm,who recommended that naporano contact the fbi.the fbi determined that batti had accessed confidential files no fewer than times after his firing,twice through a server and nineteen times through the email account of another employee,steve majoros.the fbi conducted a search of batti home on april.in an interview with the fbi,batti admitted that he had accessed system through its server and majoros webmail.on the latter point,batti admitted that he had learned majoros username and password in the course of his employment with although majoros had slightly altered his password after batti was fired,batti was able to guess the new password through trial and error.finally,after this interview,batti sent two emails to the fbi in which he attempted to explain his actions.
in addition to the work done by the fbi,the firm conducted a substantial investigation,and naporano obtained legal advice regarding the security breach from outside counsel.the total cost of the security firm investigation and the advice from counsel amounted to.in addition,many of employees assisted with the investigation.in all,employees spent approximately hours dealing with the security breach.
batti was charged with one count,a violation of a c and c b iii.section a c sets out the prohibited conduct as follows 
a whoever intentionally accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized access,and thereby obtains c information from any protected computer shall be punished as provided in subsection c of this section.

c.in the indictment,the government sought a felony conviction by alleging,pursuant to subsection b iii,that batti obtained information valued in excess of.doc.indictment at.the only portion of this charge that batti challenged in the court below was whether the value of the information that he obtained actually exceeded.
at a bench trial held on october,the district court heard testimony from fbi agent bryan taube and naporano regarding batti intrusions,the steps taken to investigate and remediate these breaches of security,and the expenditure of by for the services of the it security company and for legal advice.moreover,the hours spent by employees in response to the intrusion would have cost using standard rate.naporano also testified that paid about for the footage that batti accessed and put on the disk that he gave naporano.
the district court found that the amount best represented the value of the information that batti had obtained in his intrusions it therefore ruled for the government on the issue of whether the value exceeded.doc.findings of fact and conclusions of law at.in coming to this conclusion,the district court noted that there was virtually no case law interpreting how to define or measure the value of the information obtained,but it found persuasive cases regarding the value of stolen goods under.id.at,citing united states stegora,cir united states cummings,cir united states drebin,cir united states kwan,wl,at s,unpublished opinion.the courts in these cases held that,where a stolen good does not have any readily ascertainable market value,any reasonable method may be used to calculate its value,including the cost of production,research,or design.see stegora,at holding that,in the absence of a market value,any reasonable method may be employed to assign a value to an item,including revenue and the cost of development and production citations omitted drebin,at holding that a jury instruction allowing valuation by any reasonable method was proper kwan,wl,at allowing the use of the cost of production of stolen goods as a permissible valuation method.accordingly,the district court looked to cost of production of the video footage that batti posted online,which,at approximately,was well over the threshold.
the district court then sentenced batti to one day in prison,with credit for time served,and months of supervised release,the first six months of which the court required batti to serve in a program.doc.judgment at.the district court also ordered batti to pay restitution in the amount of.id.at.in reaching this determination,the district court rejected the probation officer recommendation that the guidelines range be based on a loss of approximately number reached by adding the cost of the security firm and legal advice to the cost of the hours spent on the issue by employees.in the district court view,overreacted in response to batti actions and the hours spent by employees was excessive.doc.g at.as a result,the district court allowed only the spent for the security firm and legal advice in calculating loss for the purposes of sentencing.id.at.this resulted in a guidelines range of six to twelve months in prison,from which the court varied downward to impose the custodial sentence,with credit for time batti had already served.id.at.
batti now appeals two aspects of his conviction and sentence.he challenges the district court conclusion that the value of the information obtained exceeded,and he argues that the amount of restitution ordered was excessive and unnecessary.for the following reasons,we reject these arguments.
ii.the value of the information obtained 
batti challenge to the district court conclusion that the value of the information obtained exceeded requires an interpretation of c b iii.a matter requiring statutory interpretation is a question of law requiring de novo review,and the starting point for interpretation is the language of the statute itself.united states shafer,f d,cir quotation marks omitted.section of title contains no definition of the term value,as used in c b iii,however,and does not otherwise indicate how a court should determine whether the value of the information obtained exceeds.c b iii.
batti argues that the district court committed a legal error because he asserts that there was no evidence that his actions had any impact on the company use of these commercials.batti br.at emphasis in original,alteration added.in other words,batti contends that,because he did not damage the information in any way,the court could not find that the value of the information obtained exceeded.id.the district court rejected this argument on the ground that the statute does not require that the information obtained lost value as a result of the defendant illicit actions.as the district court stated 
there simply is no requirement under the pertinent subsections of that defendant unauthorized access must have led to any sort of loss,that the value of the information must have been diminished as a result of his conduct,or that he somehow must have profited from his actions.rather,the trier of this case,the called upon only to determine the value of the information through some appropriate means.
doc.findings of fact and conclusions of law at.
we agree with the district court.when the statutory language is plain,the sole function of the least where the disposition required by the text is not to enforce it according to its terms.arlington cent.sch.dist.bd.of educ.murphy,internal quotation marks omitted see also caminetti united states.the statute here requires only a determination of the value of the information obtained,not whether that value decreased.furthermore,the statute contains specific definitions of the terms loss and damage,either of which could be said to include an alleged decrease in the value of the video footage obtained by batti these terms loss and damage are used in other provisions within,but not in subsection c b iii.see a a prohibiting knowingly caus ing the transmission of a program,information,code,or command,and as a result of such conduct,intentionally caus ing damage without authorization,to a protected computer a b prohibiting intentionally access ing a protected computer without authorization,and as a result of such conduct,recklessly caus ing damage a c prohibiting intentionally access ing a protected computer without authorization,and as a result of such conduct,caus ing damage and loss a a prohibiting the interstate transmission of any threat to cause damage to a protected computer a c prohibiting the interstate transmission of any demand or request for money or other thing of value in relation to damage to a protected computer,where such damage was caused to facilitate the extortion.given that the terms loss and damage encompass the type of decrease in value described by batti,the absence of these terms in c b iii supports the conclusion that the value of the information obtained bears no relation to whether that value was diminished by the defendant actions.we therefore reject batti argument that a diminution in value constitutes the statutory measure.
batti also argues that the district court should have used the market value of the information,and that there was no market available to set a value on the information.batti br.at.we believe there is also no merit in this argument,because,as we explain below,although there may be no readily ascertainable market value for the video footage that batti obtained,the cost of production of that footage was a permissible basis on which the district court could rely in determining whether the value of the information obtained exceeded.
subsection a c was added to in in order to protect against the interstate or foreign theft of information by computer.economic espionage act of,title ii,stat,at,wl.in particular,congress was concerned about the fact that electronically stored information is intangible,and it has been held that the theft of such information can not be charged under more traditional criminal statutes such as interstate transportation of stolen property.at citing united states brown,cir.subsection a c ensure s that the theft of intangible information by the unauthorized use of a computer is prohibited in the same way theft of physical items are protected.id.
regarding the penalties for violations of subsection a c,the senate report states that violations involving information of nominal or minimal value constitute misdemeanors,punishable under c a.at.for violations involving valuable information and misusing information in other more serious ways,however,the felony provision of c b applies.id.furthermore,congress identified precisely the types of violations worthy of felony punishment by including within c b three preconditions to its application.in order to punish a violation of a c as a felony,the government must prove one of the following 
i the offense was committed for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain 
ii the offense was committed in furtherance of any criminal or tortious act in violation of the constitution or laws of the united states or of any state or 
iii the value of the information obtained exceeds.
c b i iii.the senate report notes that the first two of these preconditions derive from the copyright statute,a,and the wiretap statute,d.at.moreover,these two provisions are intended to have the same meaning as in those statutes.id.
subsection iii is similar to the statute mentioned by the senate report as the inspiration for the amendment,in that both require the value of the object of the violation to exceed.section prohibits transport ing,transmit ting,or transfer ring in interstate or foreign commerce any goods,wares,merchandise,securities or money,of the value of or more,knowing the same to have been stolen,converted or taken by fraud.emphasis added.consequently,given the absence of case law interpreting the term value in c b iii,we may consider parallel interpretations of.we also recognize a key difference between the two statutes although prohibits obtaining information,prohibits transporting,transmitting,or transferring proscribed items.thus,as the senate report notes,t he crux of the offense under subsection a c is the abuse of a computer to obtain the information,and a ctual asportation need not be proved.at.
examination of the definition of value in reveals that the market value of the stolen good constitutes the primary relevant benchmark for the determination of the value of stolen goods,wares,merchandise,securities or money in.according to,value means the face,par,or market value,whichever is the greatest,and the aggregate value of all goods,wares,and merchandise,securities,and mone
