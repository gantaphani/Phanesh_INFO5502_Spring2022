plaintiffs luciano pisciotta and daniel mills brought this action on behalf of a putative class of customers and potential customers of old national bancorp onb.they alleged that,through its website,onb had solicited personal information from applicants for banking services,but had failed to secure it adequately.as a result,a computer hacker was able to obtain access to the confidential information of tens of thousands of onb site users.the plaintiffs sought damages for the harm that they claim to have suffered because of the security breach specifically,they requested compensation for past and future credit monitoring services that they have obtained in response to the compromise of their personal data through onb website.onb answered the allegations and then moved for judgment on the pleadings under rule c.the district court granted onb motion and dismissed the case.the plaintiffs timely appeal.for the reasons set forth in this opinion,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
backgrounda.facts 
onb operates a marketing website on which individuals seeking banking services can complete online applications for accounts,loans and other onb banking services.the applications differ depending on the service requested,but some forms require the customer or potential customer name,address,social security number,driver license number,date of birth,mother maiden name and credit card or other financial account numbers.in and,respectively,pisciotta and mills accessed this website and entered personal information in connection with their applications for onb banking services.
in,ncr,a hosting facility that maintains onb website,notified onb of a security breach.onb then sent written notice to its customers.the results of the investigation that followed have been filed under seal in this court for present purposes,it will suffice to note that the scope and manner of access suggests that the intrusion was sophisticated,intentional and malicious.
district court proceedings 
pisciotta and mills,on behalf of a putative class of other onb website users,brought this action in the united states district court for the southern district of indiana.they named onb and ncr as defendants and asserted negligence claims against both defendants as well as breach of implied contract claims by onb and breach of contract by ncr.the plaintiffs alleged that 
b y failing to adequately protect their personal confidential information,onb and ncr caused plaintiffs and other similarly situated past and present customers to suffer substantial potential economic damages and emotional distress and worry that third parties will use the plaintiffs confidential personal information to cause them economic harm,or sell their confidential information to others who will in turn cause them economic harm.
in pleading their damages,the plaintiffs stated that they and others in the putative class have incurred expenses in order to prevent their confidential personal information from being used and will continue to incur expenses in the future.id.at.significantly,the plaintiffs did not allege any completed direct financial loss to their accounts as a result of the breach.nor did they claim that they or any other member of the putative class already had been the victim of identity theft as a result of the breach.the plaintiffs requested c ompensation for all economic and emotional damages suffered as a result of the defendants acts which were negligent,in breach of implied contract or in breach of contract,and a ny and all other legal equitable relief to which plaintiffs are entitled,including establishing an economic monitoring procedure to insure sic prompt notice to plaintiffs of any attempt to use their confidential personal information stolen from the defendants.id.at.
ncr moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim its motion was granted.this ruling has not been appealed.onb,the remaining defendant,answered the second amended complaint.the plaintiffs moved for class certification.onb then filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings under federal rule of civil procedure c and a memorandum in opposition to class certification.
the district court granted onb motion for judgment on the pleadings and denied the plaintiffs motion for class certification as moot.specifically,the district court concluded that the plaintiffs claims failed as a matter of law because they have not alleged that onb conduct caused them cognizable injury.at.in support of its conclusion,the court noted that,under indiana law,damages must be more than speculative therefore,the plaintiffs allegations that they had suffered substantial potential economic damages did not state a claim.id.emphasis in original.
the district court looked to five cases from other district courts across the country that had rejected claims for the cost of credit monitoring as an alternative award for what would otherwise be speculative and unrecoverable damages.id.finding their reasoning persuasive,the district court concluded that t he expenditure of money to monitor one credit is not the result of any present injury,but rather the anticipation of future injury that has not yet materialized.id.at citing forbes wells fargo bank,d.the court also concluded that,although not enumerated as a separate cause of action in the complaint,the plaintiffs had made allegations that could relate to a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress the court dismissed this claim as well.it noted that,as a matter of indiana law,any such action was dependent on an underlying negligence claim.id.at.finally,the court concluded that there could be no action for breach of contract under indiana law in the absence of an allegation of cognizable damages.
the plaintiffs then timely appealed the entry of judgment for onb on the claims for negligence and breach of implied contract and further asked that this court vacate the order denying class certification as moot.

jurisdiction 
the plaintiffs filed this action in the district court under the class action fairness act of,stat,codified at d cafa,on behalf of a putative class that includes residents of indiana,illinois,kentucky,missouri,ohio and tennessee.under cafa,the district court had jurisdiction over this action because the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of,exclusive of interest and costs,d,and because at least one member of the proposed class is a citizen of a state different from onb.id.d a.in short,subject to limitations not relevant here,cafa allows for incomplete diversity.strawbridge curtiss,cranch.interpreting the language of the general federal diversity statute to require complete diversity.in calculating the requisite amount in controversy,cafa requires that the claims of all the plaintiffs be aggregated.d in re brand name prescription drugs antitrust,cir noting the otherwise applicable rule that aggregation is not permitted and,therefore,at least one plaintiff in a particular class must satisfy the jurisdictional minimum.
we have,of course,an independent responsibility to examine our subject matter jurisdiction.see steel citizens for a better env t,d.as we have noted,in reaching the conclusion that dismissal was appropriate,the district court in this case relied on several cases from other district courts throughout the country.many of those cases have concluded that the federal courts lack jurisdiction because plaintiffs whose data has been compromised,but not yet misused,have not suffered an sufficient to confer article iii standing we are not persuaded by the reasoning of these cases.as many of our sister circuits have noted,the requirement can be satisfied by a threat of future harm or by an act which harms the plaintiff only by increasing the risk of future harm that the plaintiff would have otherwise faced,absent the defendant actions we concur in this view once the plaintiffs allegations establish at least this level of injury,the fact that the plaintiffs anticipate that some greater potential harm might follow the defendant act does not affect the standing inquiry.
availability of credit monitoring damages under indiana law 
with the issue of jurisdiction resolved,we now turn to the merits of the plaintiffs claim for damages.this case,invoking cafa special rules for diversity jurisdiction,alleges causes of action under indiana law.our duty,therefore,as in every diversity case,is to apply state substantive law,as we believe the highest court of the state would apply it.state farm mut.auto.ins.pate,cir.
the principal claims in this case are based on a negligence theory.the elements of a negligence claim under indiana law are a duty owed to plaintiff by defendant,breach of duty by allowing conduct to fall below the applicable standard of care,and a compensable injury proximately caused by defendant breach of duty.bader johnson,emphasis added.the plaintiffs complaint also alleges that onb has breached an implied contract.compensable damages are an element of a breach of contract cause of action as well.see mccalment eli lilly.
as this case comes to us,both the negligence and the contractual issues can be resolved,and the judgment of the district court affirmed,if the district court was correct in its determination that indiana law would not permit recovery for credit monitoring costs incurred by the plaintiffs.we review de novo the district court determination of the content of state law.hinc,cir see also salve regina coll.russell,d rejecting a rule of deference to district court determinations of state law.we must determine whether indiana would consider that the harm caused by identity information exposure,coupled with the attendant costs to guard against identity theft,constitutes an existing compensable injury and consequent damages required to state a claim for negligence or for breach of contract.neither the parties efforts nor our own have identified any indiana precedent addressing this issue.nor have we located the decision of any court other than the district court in this case that examines indiana law in this context.we are charged with predicting,nevertheless,how we think the supreme court of indiana would decide this issue.see dumas infinity broad,cir.
when faced with a novel question of state law,federal courts sitting in diversity have a range of tools at their disposal.first,when the intermediate appellate courts of the state have spoken to the issue,we shall give great weight to their determination about the content of state law,absent some indication that the highest court of the state is likely to deviate from those rulings.see woidtke clair county,illinois,cir.we also shall consult a variety of other sources,including other relevant state precedents,analogous decisions,considered dicta,scholarly works,and any other reliable data tending convincingly to show how the highest court in the state would decide the issue at hand.mckenna ortho pharm,cir see generally dolores sloviter,a federal judge looks at diversity jurisdiction.discussing the challenges facing federal courts in applying uncharted areas of state law.in the absence of any authority from the relevant state courts,we also shall examine the reasoning of courts in other jurisdictions addressing the same issue and applying their own law for whatever guidance about the probable direction of state law they may provide.see allstate ins.tozer,cir.
in the end,however,the plaintiffs must come forward with some authority to support their view that they have a right to the relief they seek because,as we have stated,we have limited discretion with respect to untested legal theories brought under the rubric of state law.huss cont l cas,cir.without state authority to guide us,w hen given a choice between an interpretation of state law which reasonably restricts liability,and one which greatly expands liability,we should choose the narrower and more reasonable path at least until the state supreme court tells us differently.todd societe bic,cir en banc see also insolia philip morris,cir federal courts are loathe to fiddle around with state law.though district courts may try to determine how the state courts would rule on an unclear area of state law,district courts are encouraged to dismiss actions based on novel state law claims.home valu,pep boys,cir adopting an interpretation of state law which,between two possible options,take s the approach that is restrictive of liability with these principles in mind,we turn to our consideration of whether indiana would recognize a cause of action for a data exposure injury.specifically,we shall examine whether indiana would compensate victims who undertake credit monitoring to guard against identity theft that might follow.
we begin our inquiry with the indiana authority most closely addressed to the issue before us.on march,the indiana legislature enacted a statute that applies to certain database security breaches.specifically,the statute creates certain duties when a database in which personal data,electronically stored by private entities or state agencies,potentially has been accessed by unauthorized third parties.et the statute took effect on july,see,after the particular incident involved in this case neither party contends that the statute is directly applicable to the present dispute we nevertheless find this enactment by the indiana legislature instructive in our evaluation of the probable approach of the supreme court of indiana to the allegations in the present case.
the provisions of the statute applicable to private entities storing personal information require only that a database owner disclose a security breach to potentially affected consumers they do not require the database owner to take any other affirmative act in the wake of a breach.if the database owner fails to comply with the only affirmative duty imposed by the duty to statute provides for enforcement only by the attorney general of indiana.it creates no private right of action against the database owner by an affected customer.it imposes no duty to compensate affected individuals for inconvenience or potential harm to credit that may follow 
the plaintiffs maintain that the statute is evidence that the indiana legislature believes that an individual has suffered a compensable injury at the moment his personal information is exposed because of a security breach.we can not accept this view.had the indiana legislature intended that a cause of action should be available against a database owner for failing to protect adequately personal information,we believe that it would have made some more definite statement of that intent.moreover,given the novelty of the legal questions posed by information exposure and theft,it is unlikely that the legislature intended to sanction the development of common law tort remedies that would apply to the same factual circumstances addressed by the statute.the narrowness of the defined duties imposed,combined with penalties as the exclusive remedy,strongly suggest that indiana law would not recognize the costs of credit monitoring that the plaintiffs seek to recover in this case as compensable damages.
the plaintiffs further submit that cases decided by the indiana courts in analogous areas of the law instruct that they suffered an immediate injury when their information was accessed by unauthorized third parties.specifically,the plaintiffs claim that indiana law acknowledges special duties on the part of banks to prevent the disclosure of the personal in
