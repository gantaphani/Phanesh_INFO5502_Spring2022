at t corporation is still the largest long distance telephone company in the country,and this case is about its recent entry into the broadband telecommunications market that provides access to the internet.at t has acquired mediaone group,mediaone,which has a cable franchise in henrico county,virginia.in approving the transfer of control of the franchise,the henrico county board of supervisors the county required mediaone to provide any requesting internet service provider isp with access to its cable modem platform.at t and mediaone sued the county in federal court,arguing that the open access provision was preempted by federal law the communications act and,in any event,violated state law.the district court agreed and granted summary judgment for at t and mediaone.we affirm as follows.under bell atlantic,prince george county,cir,we must consider the state law question first.however,because virginia law does not provide an independent ground for disposition of the case,we proceed to the preemption question.henrico county open access provision violates the federal communications act,b d,by forcing mediaone to provide its telecommunication facilities its cable modem platform to any isp as a condition for the county approval of the transfer of control of the franchise.because the open access provision is inconsistent with the federal communications act,it is preempted and superceded.
most residential and small business consumers gain access to the internet through slower narrowband technology,specifically,through the traditional telephone modem that is connected to copper lines.broadband technology is beginning to provide many of these consumers with a alternative to internet access,and analysts are forecasting substantial growth in the demand for broadband services.the most common forms of broadband technology are cable modem platforms and digital subscriber lines dsls.a broadband pipeline,like the basic telephone infrastructure,serves as a conduit between an internet user and an isp,such as america online,juno,or prodigy.
in and at t began a major effort to establish a foothold in broadband markets around the country.at t sought to enter these markets by acquiring existing cable television companies.one of its first acquisition targets was mediaone,a large cable company with a franchise in henrico county,virginia.like most cable operators,mediaone provides traditional cable television service.however,the company has upgraded its cable systems,including the one in henrico county,to include a cable modem platform that provides a link to the internet.in connection with this upgrade mediaone joined with others to form a company doing business as road runner.road runner provides a bundled service that combines mediaone broadband pipeline the cable modem platform with the internet services usually offered by an isp.mediaone customers who want internet access over cable do not have the option of using just mediaone cable modem platform rather,they must subscribe to road runner and take the internet services it offers.although road runner customers may subscribe to an isp unaffiliated with mediaone,most customers have no incentive to do that because the features offered by most outside isps are nearly identical to those offered by road runner.instead of paying for a duplicative internet service from an outside isp,most mediaone customers simply stick with the bundled service provided by road runner.
on may,at t and mediaone entered into an agreement to merge.the merger,which has now been finalized,gives at t control of all of mediaone cable television systems,including the system that holds a franchise in henrico county.in july at t and mediaone applied to the county for formal approval of the transfer of control.the county gave its approval in an ordinance adopted in december.the county approval,however,was conditioned on the requirement that n o later than december,mediaone shall provide any requesting internet service provider isp access to its cable modem platform unbundled from the provision of content on rates,terms,and conditions that are at least as favorable as those on which it provides such access to itself,to its affiliates,or to any other person.this open access condition would require mediaone to open its broadband pipeline to unaffiliated isps.mediaone customers would thus be able to access the internet over mediaone cable modem platform without subscribing to the bundled road runner service.
at t and mediaone chafed under the open access condition mandated by henrico county.they sued the county in federal court in the eastern district of virginia,seeking a declaratory judgment that the condition violates the first amendment and the commerce clause,is preempted by federal law,and is void under virginia law.at t and mediaone also asked for an injunction against the enforcement of the condition.they moved promptly for summary judgment on the grounds that the open access requirement is preempted by the communications act of,as amended by the telecommunications act of,stat,and is unenforceable under virginia law.gte intelligent network services,bell atlantic,bell atlantic virginia,and bell atlantic internet solutions,collectively verizon were allowed to intervene as defendants on the side of the county.verizon,of course,offers a dsl service that competes with mediaone road runner service.the county and verizon filed a for summary judgment asserting that the open access condition was not preempted by federal law and that it was a valid exercise of the county authority under virginia law.
the district court granted at t and mediaone motion for summary judgment.see mediaone group,county of henrico,d.the court concluded that the open access condition was preempted by several provisions of the communications act.first,it held that the condition violates b d by requiring mediaone to provide its telecommunications facilities to any requesting isp as a condition for the county approval of the transfer of control.id.at.second,the court held that the open access condition violates e because it would condition and restrict the use of mediaone transmission technology.id.at.third,after concluding that road runner is a cable service,the court held that the open access condition is also barred by c and f.because the condition would require mediaone to provide all isps nondiscriminatory access to its cable modem platform,the court concluded that the county was attempting to regulate mediaone as a common carrier in violation of c.id.at.the court also held that the condition is contrary to f s prohibition against requirements regarding the provision or content of cable services.id.at.finally,the district court held that the open access requirement is void under virginia law because nothing in the virginia code as it relates to the regulation of cable systems expressly or impliedly authorizes the county to impose such a condition.
the county and verizon appeal the district court order granting mediaone and at t motion for summary judgment.we review a summary judgment decision de novo.see at t communications of bell,cir.
this case boils down to two questions the federal constitutional question of whether the communications act preempts any power henrico county has under the virginia code to enact an open access provision and the state law question of whether the county has the authority under the virginia code to enact such a provision.
recently,in bell atlantic,prince george county,cir,we observed that the question of whether a federal statute preempts a state statute is a constitutional question.id.at.we went on to hold that when a court is faced with a constitutional question of federal preemption and a question of state law,the court should decide only the state law question if it provides an independent ground upon which the case may be disposed of.id.at quoting ashwander.valley.brandeis,concurring.this rule is based on the principle that courts should avoid deciding constitutional questions unless they are essential to the disposition of a case.id.at.to complete the point,we state the obvious an independent state law ground is one that allows us
