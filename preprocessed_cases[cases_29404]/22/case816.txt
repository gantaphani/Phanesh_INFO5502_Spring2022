apple computer,apple appeals the summary judgment of the united states district court for the northern district of california,invalidating patent the patent,issued november,and assigned to apple articulate systems,articulate the district court denial of its motion for attorneys fees.we,and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
the technology behind this appeal concerns the generation of multiple active windows in a graphical user interface.apple owns several patents that cover this type of technology,including the patent.the patent,generally speaking,claims a method of displaying data on a computer screen in multiple windows that are simultaneously active.in this claimed system,the user may manipulate or operate on two or more displayed windows without having to toggle between active windows,and without changing the display order of the windows a primary window floats over one or more secondary windows.articulate developed a computer dictation software system known as powersecretary.when powersecretary is running on a computer,a voicebar floats on top of other windows to allow the user to access certain features of the software.
apple originally brought suit against articulate systems alleging that articulate powersecretary product infringed four of apple patents,including the patent.there are two versions of the powersecretary for microsoft windows operating systems and one for macintosh operating systems.apple alleged that both versions of the software infringed its patents.when dragon systems acquired powersecretary for windows,apple added dragon systems as a defendant.
through a series of summary judgment motions by articulate,this lawsuit was eventually narrowed to allegations of infringement of a single patent,the patent,by a single product,the windows version of powersecretary.first,the macintosh version of powersecretary was dropped from the suit because the court found that apple had licensed articulate to make,use,sell,copy,and otherwise distribute the macintosh version of powersecretary.then the court found,based on apple admissions,that the windows version of powersecretary did not infringe two of the four asserted patents.finally,the court found that the windows version of powersecretary did not infringe another of apple patents because articulate could only be accused of inducement or contributory infringement and apple could not provide proof of the requisite direct infringement.
with respect to the patent,the only remaining patent in the lawsuit,apple alleged infringement of claims,and.claims and are independent claims and claims and and claims are dependent claims depending from claims and,respectively.claim claims a method of displaying simultaneously active windows and reads as follows 
in a computer display system having a central processing unit cpu coupled to a display such that data is displayed on said display in a plurality of windows,a method for displaying said windows and operating upon said windows and said data in said windows by a user,comprising the steps of 
generating and displaying each of said plurality of windows at a different window layer according to a window order,wherein a window at a higher window layer covers a window at a lower window layer to the extent that any of said windows overlap,wherein said step of generating and displaying each of said plurality of windows comprises the steps of generating and displaying a first window at a first window layer,wherein said first window layer is a highest window layer generating and displaying a second window at a second window layer,wherein said first window has a portion that does not overlap with said second window both of said windows being simultaneously active and said user operating on both said first window and said second window without altering the window order of said plurality of windows.
claim is substantially similar to claim,claiming a computer display system capable of displaying simultaneously active windows.claims and are dependent on claims and,respectively,and further specify that the first window comprises a help access window.claim is dependent on claim and further specifies that said cpu generates said first windows in response to execution of a first application and generates said second window in response to execution of a second application.the remaining asserted claims,and,are dependent on claims and and differ only slightly from these independent claims.
having eliminated of the patents from the lawsuit,articulate moved for summary judgment of invalidity of the patent.specifically,articulate asserted that claims,and of the patent were anticipated by prior art adobe photoshop software.articulate further alleged that claim,the only other claim asserted by apple,was also invalid as obvious over adobe photoshop in conjunction with a certain mactutor publication.
adobe photoshop is a graphics software package that allows a user to create drawings on a drawing window on a computer screen.adobe photoshop also has a tool palette that is displayed next to the drawing window,or may be positioned to overlap the drawing window.the palette is a menu of drawing commands or tools that can be selected by clicking on the icon in the palette for that function.a user may successively manipulate or click on the drawing window and the palette without changing the displayed ordering of these items.the palette will continue to float on top of the drawing window.
articulate argued that the drawing window and tool palette window of adobe photoshop were simultaneously active windows as claimed in the patent.according to articulate,these features of adobe photoshop anticipated claims,and of the patent and rendered them invalid.
the mactutor article don melton and mike ritter,c workshop,menus and floating palettes,mactutor,april,at describes menus and floating palettes in graphical display systems.articulate argued that the mactutor article further disclosed that simultaneously active windows could be generated by separate applications.according to articulate,this publication,together with adobe photoshop,rendered claim of the patent invalid for obviousness.
to assist in deciding articulate summary judgment motion,the court held a claim interpretation hearing pursuant to markman westview instruments,aff,d.following that hearing,the court issued its first order,construing the following claim terms at issue 
framing device on the computer screen that displays information and may set the displayed information apart from other information on the screen 
operate on a,closing,moving or resizing a window without manipulating the data contained within such window 
operate on data in a the data contained within a window without necessarily opening,closing,moving or resizing the window 
help access window that contains one or more controls for accessing information which has been loaded on the central processing unit cpu.
the court subsequently issued a second order,granting articulate motion for summary judgment,finding that claims,and of the patent are invalid.
in making its findings of invalidity in its second order,the court further construed additional claim terms as follows 
simultaneously active or more defined and separated areas on the computer screen which are open at the same time and may be operated on by the user 
available for operation.
in finding the patent invalid,the district court compared the claims with the prior art.the district court referenced the declaration of articulate expert and concluded,without any further elaboration,that the computer program known as adobe photoshop disclosed each and every limitation contained in independent claims and.it also found that e ach of the remaining claims of the patent depend s on claims and,so they are also anticipated by adobe photoshop.
the court further noted that claims and,also dependent on claims and,respectively,differ from the remaining claims by defining the first window as a help access window.apple defined this term during prosecution as a window that contains one or more user interface controls for accessing information related to software that is loaded on said cpu.the court concluded that the prior art met these claim limitations.
apparently addressing the only remaining asserted claim,claim,the court concluded that the patent was anticipated or rendered obvious by the photoshop software.having found all claims at issue invalid,the district court entered final judgment in favor of articulate.apple now appeals this judgment.
following the court ruling in its favor on summary judgment,articulate moved to have the case declared an exceptional case and further moved for an award of attorneys fees.the court found,however,that articulate had not provided clear and convincing evidence that this was an exceptional case.specifically,the court found that articulate had failed to prove that apple infringement suit was purely retaliatory and,therefore,in bad faith.the court further found that apple pretrial investigation was sufficient.finally,the court noted that even though much of apple suit was summarily dismissed,that did not automatically mean that articulate was entitled to attorneys fees.articulate this denial of their request for attorneys fees.

on appeal,apple does not contest the district court factual findings with respect to its ultimate finding of anticipation.indeed,the parties appear to be in agreement on the content and characterization of the prior rather,apple challenges the legal analysis and the underlying claim interpretation of the court that led it to conclude that the asserted claims of the patent were invalid.claim construction is a question of law,which we review de novo.cybor fas,en banc.in conducting this de novo review,however,we begin with and carefully consider the trial court work.key pharm.hercon labs,citing cybor,at,at plager and bryson,concurring separately.
claims and 
the district court summarily found claims and invalid under b,stating only that adobe photoshop discloses each and every limitation contained in independent claims and.on appeal,apple claims legal error in this finding of anticipation,and in the underlying claim interpretation of the terms windows and simultaneously active.finding no legal error in the district court claim construction,we affirm the district court judgment of invalidity of claims and.
apple first asserts that the district court interpretation of window is in error because the court improperly ignored the distinction in the patent specification between windows and menus.according to apple,the palette of adobe photoshop is a type of menu a menu and,therefore,not a window within the meaning of the patent.the court misinterpretation of the term window,claims apple,led the court to erroneously find adobe photoshop anticipatory.
apple argues that the patent specification separately refers to both windows and menus,and the specification describes how menus may be included within windows.therefore,according to apple,windows and menus are distinguished.apple further argues that the windows of the patent are limited to windows in which data is displayed,and data can not include commands.in support of this argument,apple points to language in claims and requiring the display of data and to portions of the specification that distinguish data from commands or functions.
apple interpretation of windows necessarily excludes menus or palettes,since these graphical features are distinct and since these features display functions,not data.based on this interpretation,adobe photoshop is not anticipatory since it contains only one window within apple definition.
we are not persuaded by apple arguments.notwithstanding apple arguments to the contrary,the evidence fully supports the district court construction of the term window.according to the written description of the patent,windows may take the form of a variety of objects,such as a file folder,loose leaf binders,or simple rectangles,lines.the written description further teaches that the windows of apple invention include defined areas having window features such as menu bars,command options,text,icons,button functions to be executed by the cpu,lines emphasis added.taking the language of the patent at face value,a simple icon that performs a button function is a window.thus,the palette of adobe photoshop,incorporating a number of function keys within a defined area,is surely a window for the purposes of the patent.
moreover,this broad definition of the term window is not at odds with the common definition of those skilled in the art.indeed,as demonstrated by the very references cited in the patent specification,menu bars or buttons are commonly understood to be types of windows by those skilled in the 
similarly,in light of the clear language of the specification,apple argument that the window of its invention must include data in the form of text,as opposed to mere functions or commands,is equally unavailing.
first,we reject apple contention that claims and and the corresponding dependent claims require windows containing data that a user may operate on.this recitation of data in the claimed windows appears in the preambles of claims and.the body of claim also refers to data in the windows,but only as a possibility,not as a requirement.thus,if the windows of the claimed invention are to be limited to windows containing data,this limitation must come from the preambles of claims and.language in a claim preamble,however,acts as a claim limitation only when such language serves to give meaning to a claim and properly define the invention,not when the preamble merely states a purpose or intended use of the invention.in re paulsen,quoting degeorge bernier,uspq.viewing the claims as a whole and in light of the written description,the recitation of data in the preambles of claims and does not give meaning to these claims nor serve to define the invention.instead,the term data refers to a purpose or intended use of the windows of the claimed invention.
second,even if we were to find that the recitation of data in the claim preambles acts as a claim limitation,we would conclude that this term is used in a broad sense,and that this broad meaning of data is consistent with the district court interpretation of the term window.the written description uses the term data to include both text and command features 
the access window includes a working area in which the cpu displays instructions,text or command options.the working area includes a vertical slider for scrolling through data displayed within the working area.
emphasis added,lines.thus,the term data can not exclude commands,as argued by apple.
finally,we also note that the preferred embodiment of the patent further suggests that apple narrow interpretation of data can not be correct.claims and specify that the user may operate on the data displayed in the plurality of windows of the invention in most of the help windows of the preferred embodiment of the patent,however,the only data that may be operated on are icons or command keys,in many instances a command key labeled huh therefore,under apple proposed interpretation,there are no data in most of the help windows of its preferred embodiment to be operated on by the user.and while this evidence alone is not necessarily dispositive of the claim construction issue,it further suggests the incorrectness of apple proposed interpretation that the data displayed in the windows of its invention does not include icons or command keys.
accordingly,we reject apple arguments that the district court misconstrued the term window.
apple next argues that the district court construction of simultaneously active windows is incorrect in that it improperly fails to lend separate meaning to the requirement that the claimed active windows be operable on.claim,argues apple,is exemplary of this distinction in the patent in that it first recites that both the first and second windows are simultaneously active,and then,in a separate limitation,requires said user operating on both said first window and said second window without altering the window order.apple also argues that this same distinction is present in claim and in the patent specification.
operating on a window,apple insists,must mean manipulating the window or data in the window as if an actual file or other physical object were being manipulated.thus,apple claims,an operable window is distinct from an active window.and taking this construction,adobe photoshop does not anticipate claims and because,while the tool palette is active,it may not be operated on within apple proposed definition.it may be moved about the display screen,but it may not be resized,nor may the contents be reorganized,nor may the palette be otherwise manipulated.
we reject this argument as well.the district court correctly found that,in the context of the patent,active means available for operation as the specification describes 
using the techniques of the present invention,the presentation window or access window floats above other application windows,such as window,and are simultaneously active,thereby allowing the user to operate on both windows and without altering the ordering of the window layers.
lines emphasis added.in contrast,prior art systems were distinguished in that they required an initial mouse click to activate the window before operation on that window was possible.thus,active,in the context of the patent,means available for operation,and the invention of the patent allowed multiple windows to be available for operation active without the need of a preliminary mouse click.
as for the separate recitation of the requirements that both windows be active and operable on without changing the ordering of the windows,contrary to apple assertions,the district court interpretation does preserve these separate limitations.the second limitation concerns the effect of a user operating on a window,not the fact that it may be operated on.both windows could potentially be active or operable on,yet,operating on the windows could change the display order.in contrast,the claim separately specifies that the windows are both active operable on and that operating on these windows will not change their display order one window floats over the other.thus,both limitations are preserved.
finally,apple argues that the district court claim construction improperly causes the claims to read on prior art before the examiner during the prosecution of the patent.specifically,apple points to patent the patent,issued june,and a manual describing the preferred embodiment of the patent,hypercard.each of these references was considered by the examiner in the prosecution of the patent.the patent describes menus whereby portions of a menu bar may be torn off and moved about the display screen.the hypercard program includes this menu feature and further allows the simultaneous operation of a palette of commands with a document window.when operated in this manner,hypercard strongly resembles the window and palette format of adobe photoshop.apple argues,therefore,that the district court interpretation reads on the patent and the hypercard product and that the claims of the patent must be interpreted more narrowly to avoid the prior art before the examiner during prosecution.
we reject this final argument as well.to be sure,the district court claim construction does cause the claims to read on the hypercard program.this does not,however,negate the district court claim construction or finding of anticipation.indeed,it provides further evidence that the claimed invention of the patent was not novel.
the palette feature of the hypercard program was in no way evident from the manual submitted during the prosecution of the patent.moreover,in submitting this reference,apple directed the examiner attention to another feature,the message box,and made no mention of the palette feature.similarly,it is not evident from the specification of the patent that the tear off menu feature allowed the user to superimpose such a menu window over any other window.nor is it taught that such superimposed windows are simultaneously active and will not change order when operated upon.thus,the fact that the examiner allowed the claims of the patent over these references does not support apple attempt to narrow its claims to avoid certain features disclosed in these references.
in addition,while apple is correct that claims should be read in a way that avoids ensnaring prior art if it is possible to do so,eastman kodak goodyear tire rubber,here it is not possible to do so.where the only claim construction that is consistent with the claim language and the written description renders the claim invalid,then the axiom does not apply and the claim is simply invalid.rhine casio.see also becton dickinson bard,judicial redrafting of claims to preserve validity is impermissible.we are convinced that claims and are simply invalid.
in conclusion,we find none of apple arguments persuasive.we therefore affirm the district court summary judgment of invalidity of claims and.
claims and 
having found claims and anticipated by adobe photoshop,the district court concluded that the other asserted claims,each dependent upon claims or,were also anticipated by this same reference.with respect to claims and,however,the court further noted that,while these claims defined the first window as a help access window,this additional limitation was also met by adobe photoshop.apple claims legal error in the district court failure to consider these claims individually and in its broad construction of the term help access window.we agree.
as apple correctly points out,each claim of a patent is presumed valid independently of the other claims and dependent claims shall be presumed valid even though dependent upon an invalid claim.bausch lomb,uspq.thus,the district court improperly concluded that the dependent claims were invalid.moreover,with respect to claims and,the district court interpretation of help access window was so broad as to read the help limitation out of the claim.
in support of the district court construction of help access window,articulate points to the language of claim and to the prosecution history articulate notes that,as originally filed,claim did not specify the meaning of help access window.then,in response to an indefiniteness rejection,apple broadly defined the help access window as said help access window being a window that contains one or more user interface controls for accessing information related to software that is loaded on said cpu.having adopted such a broad definition within the text of the claim,articulate argues,apple can not now narrow that definition.accordingly,articulate asser
