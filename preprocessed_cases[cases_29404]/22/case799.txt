ingram industries,lightning source,and,collectively the defendants appeal the judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of missouri holding them liable for infringement of united states patent the ross patent owned by on demand machine corporation odmc.we conclude that the jury verdict of infringement was based on a partly incorrect claim construction,and that on the correct construction a reasonable jury could not find the patent to be infringed.accordingly,the judgment of infringement is reversed and the damages award vacated.the grant of a license during appeal is vacated,and the issues raised by are moot.
background 
the ross patent is for a system and method of manufacturing a single book copy,wherein a single copy of a book is printed and bound,generally at the site of sale,upon provision to the customer of computerized information about the book.according to the ross patent,a retail seller of books provides a computer console for customer use,wherein the computer stores promotional and other information such as book reviews and price,and also stores the complete text of the book and the design of its cover.the customer can browse through the stored information,inspect the text,and select a book for purchase the book is then printed and bound,preferably at the same site.the patent summary of the invention describes the system as follows 
a customer module a customer kiosk permits the consumer to access the promotional sales information on a display screen which may include general information such as a list of best sellers or specific information a sample chapter about individual books in which the consumer may have some interest.such promotional sales information may include a graphical simulation of the book,descriptive information provided by the publisher,as well as a synopsis and critique of the book by a book reviewer presented in full motion video and stereo sound.the consumer may browse though the introduction,abstracts or selected pages of the book on the computer module screen.
it is therefore an object of the invention to provide a book manufacturing system which is capable of storing data corresponding to the text and color graphical cover of tens of thousands of different books,as well as promotional sales text and color graphics for aiding the consumer in choosing a book for purchase,and facilitate the high speed manufacture of a single copy of a selected book on the immediate premises while the customer waits for a very short time.
line,line,lines.the patent explains the advantages of providing promotional information to the customer,along with immediate production and delivery of the selected book.patent figure shows a sales kiosk with the customer at the computer,and adjacent equipment 
defendant lightning source is a book printing company with a factory in lavergne,tennessee,and defendant ingram industries is the corporate parent of lightning source.lightning source prints and sells books as ordered by publishers,wholesalers,and retailers such as,but does not sell directly to the public.purchasers may order books from lightning source through its website or by electronic data interchange edi,identifying the book by its title and author or isbn international standard book number.lightning source usually prints books in batches,often as large as several hundred books,but may also print single copies if ordered.lightning source testified that the time from order until delivery ranges from one to fifteen days.defendant is a seller of books and other products to the public on the internet its internet website provides promotional and sales information on individual books,and receives orders from customers.does not print books,but may order single or multiple copies from lightning source to fill orders from the public.
while the ross patent application was pending,ross offered to license his invention to ingram industries,a commercial printer.they entered into a confidentiality agreement beginning in february,and ross disclosed his patent application and business plans to ingram.the ross patent issued on november.ingram sought the advice of counsel,who advised that ingram could practice printing in a manner.in september ingram informed ross that ingram was not interested in obtaining a license.ingram then created a subsidiary company,lightning source,to print books to order for resellers but not for the general public.
in odmc requested reexamination of the ross patent,citing several additional references.claims and were duly confirmed by the patent and trademark office,and are as follows with bracketed numbers as added by the district court 
a method of high speed manufacture of a single copy of a book comprising the steps of 
storing the text of a plurality of books in a computer,
storing a plurality of covers for books to be printed in said computer,said covers being stored in a bit mapped format,
storing sales information relating to said plurality of books in a computer,
providing means for a customer to scan said sales information,
enabling the customer to select which book or a portion of a plurality of books,
commanding a computer to print the text of said selected books and a cover in response to said selection,
retrieving the text of said selected books from a computer,
printing the text of said selected books on paper pages,and 
binding said paper pages together to form said selected one of said books.
claim is similar,but varies in the clauses relating to the book cover 
a method of high speed manufacture of a single copy of a book comprising the steps of 
storing the text of a plurality of books in a computer,
storing sales information relating to said plurality of books in a computer,
providing means for a customer to visually review said sales information,
commanding a computer to print the text of a selected one of said books in response to a customer selection,
retrieving the text of said selected one of said books from a computer,
printing the text of said selected one of said books on paper pages,
binding said paper pages together to form said selected one of said books,
storing graphical information corresponding to the cover of each of said books,
commanding a computer to reproduce said graphical information on a book cover,and 
binding said paper pages together with said cover therearound.
after the reexamination ross informed ingram that lightning source was infringing the ross patent and again offered a license.ingram and lightning source again sought the opinion of counsel,who advised that the printing of books in accordance with the flow diagram of exhibit a by ingram,would not constitute infringement of the claims of the ross patent.opinion letter of.counsel also advised that infringement would not be found if the claims were limited to the embodiment shown in the specification,but cautioned that if a trier of fact were to look at the claim language in isolation from the specification and the embodiment described therein,infringement might be found,although such broad claims would be of questionable validity in view of the prior art.opinion letter of november,to be at risk,the claims would have to be interpreted very broadly and a broad interpretation of the claims could well invalidate them.lightning source sought the opinion of other counsel,who were of similar view.ingram and lightning source then declined the proffered license.
odmc filed suit against ingram industries,lightning source,and,alleging infringement of claims and and that the infringement was willful.the district court held a markman hearing and construed various claim terms,and instructed the jury accordingly.the jury returned a verdict of infringement,and awarded in compensatory damages.the jury also found the infringement to be willful,but the court denied odmc request for enhanced damages and attorney fees,explaining that this was an extremely close case.on this appeal the defendants challenge the district court construction of several claim terms,dispute various jury instructions,and argue that a reasonable jury could not have found infringement on the correct claim construction.they also state that the damages award was excessive or speculative.
the district court rejected odmc request for an immediate injunction,and authorized continuing operation by the defendants through the conclusion of all appellate and proceedings at a royalty rate of of lightning source revenues for operations covered by the patent.odmc describes this remedy as a compulsory license and argues that it was improperly granted,citing the general rule that a patentee has the right to an injunction.this is the subject of odmc.
discussion 
claim construction is a matter of law,and receives plenary review on appeal.markman westview instruments,aff,d see cybor fas technologies,en banc.the reviewing court determines whether a reasonable jury,on correct instruction of law,could reasonably have reached the verdict reached by this jury that is,was there substantial evidence in support of the verdict,when disputed questions of fact and factual inferences are resolved in favor of the party that received the verdict.see,richardson suzuki motor.
a jury instruction based on incorrect law,such as an erroneous claim construction that may have affected the verdict,receives de novo review.an erroneous jury instruction may warrant a new trial,see ecolab paraclipse,or the court may consider whether,on the correct instruction,the jury could have reached only one verdict.see,cybor,at.the court award of a license during appeal and refusal to issue an immediate injunction are reviewed on the standard of abuse of discretion.
claim construction 
the district court held a markman hearing and construed the disputed terms of the claims.only claim was presented for jury verdict,and the claim terms are reviewed in that context.
these claim construction proceedings took place in,at a time when conflicting federal circuit panel opinions were producing uncertainty as to the law of claim construction.see phillips awh,en banc clarifying the law and resolving conflicts in claim construction.this court in phillips emphasized that the proper judicial construction of a claim and its terms is from the viewpoint of a person of ordinary skill in the field of the invention the court must determine how such a person would understand the claim in the context of the particular technology and the description in the specification,with due reference to the prosecution history.thus the court in phillips,resolving conflict,stressed the dominance of the specification in understanding the scope and defining the limits of the terms used in the claim.at.
sales information,clauses and of claim 
although this case was tried before phillips was decided,the district court mostly applied the precedent whose correctness has been confirmed.for example,although the district court approached the construction of sales information in claim clauses and by reciting general dictionary definitions,as follows 
the word sales is an adjective modifying the word information.the dictionary definition of information is.knowledge derived from study,experience,or instruction.a non accidental signal used as an input to a computer or communication system.citing several dictionaries,
the court held,correctly,that these multiple dictionary definitions of information and sales should be construed in a manner which is consistent with their use in the intrinsic record.the district court then defined sales information as data stored in a computer which is involved in the promoting and selling of a book,and that the term is not limited to promotional information,but includes descriptive information as well,such as price.the jury instruction was as follows 
the term sales information in claim is broader than promotional information and may include descriptive information which would aid in making a sale to the customer,such as the price of the book,library of congress notice,fly sheets,synopsis,plot outline,author biographical summary,price,sku isbn number.
the defendants argue that the district court construed and instructed the jury on sales information too broadly.they argue that the patent specification and prosecution history require that sales information always includes information that is promotional in nature,and that the term is not met by the provision of only price and identifying information such as title or isbn.odmc responds that the claims are not limited to the embodiment illustrated in the specification,and that sales information is infringed even when there is no promotional information included with the identifying information.in finding infringement the jury necessarily accepted the odmc view,for the orders to lightning source carry only identifying information,and lightning source provides no promotional information.
in general,the scope and outer boundary of claims is set by the patentee description of his invention.phillips,at.the specification makes clear that sales information is that which would help the consumer to choose a book.we agree with the defendants that the prosecution history requires this claim construction,for the inclusion of promotional information was a material distinction from the prior art.ross stressed that in his invention a customer can browse among books based on information concerning the substantive content of the book.the specification identifies descriptive material such as a synopsis,plot outline,author biographical summary,as promotional information,lines.odmc stressed this distinction from the prior art on reexamination 
it is submitted that in no way is a job file descriptor to be confused with means for allowing a customer to browse among a multiplicity of books stored on patent owner system and to select the book of interest for printing and delivery to the customer.
the reexamination examiner agreed,stating as the ground of patentability that 
the prior art does not disclose or suggest the storing of sales information for customer review which provides descriptive information relating to stored books in a computer in combination with the customer selection of books or portions of books,
odmc states that the term sales information is met by identifying information such as title or isbn alone,for the specification states that the computer stores a book attributes description and lists eleven attributes that include the title of the book,its isbn number and other information as shown in which help to describe the book and to provide the potential customer with information about the book,lines.odmc argues that the isbn is sufficient sales information,and that this claim term is met whether or not promotional material such as book reviews are also made available to customers.odmc argues that the jury necessarily so found,in finding infringement.
the defendants argue that odmc disavowed this interpretation in order to obtain the patent,and represented to the patent examiner that the inclusion of promotional material is what distinguishes this invention from the prior art.we agree with the defendants that sales information requires that promotional information is stored in the computer that is made available to the customer.the isbn or the title and author are file identifiers,not promotional information.the jury instruction,if read to mean that identifying information alone can satisfy the sales information term,is incorrect.
we conclude that on the correct construction of sales information,claim clauses and can not be met by lightning source activities,for it was not disputed that the books ordered from lightning source were ordered solely upon identifying data such as title or isbn,without promotional information from lightning source.odmc argues that provides sales information,producing joint infringement as to the of lightning source production that is ordered by amazon.we discuss this aspect in part ii,infra.
customer,clauses and of claim 
the district court construed customer to mean anyone who buys goods or services,and that the customer does not have to be an individual consumer or a retail customer.the court rejected the defendants argument that the ross patent is limited to direct retail customer sales,and instructed the jury as follows 
the word customer is one who buys goods or services and,is not limited to a retail customer.
the defendants argue that this claim interpretation is broader than the specification allows,and that the entire focus of the ross patented invention is that the customer is the person who orders and immediately receives the book,the ultimate consumer.the defendants point out that their orders come only from resellers,not from individual purchasers,and that printing is at a remote factory,not at the customer site.they point out that the ross specification describes the customer as a consumer who,upon choosing a book,sets in motion the high speed manufacture of a single copy of a selected book on the immediate premises while the customer waits for a very short time,lines.the defendants argue that the district court,in refusing to include this limitation of customer in its markman definition and jury instruction,placed too much weight on a dictionary definition of customer that is out of context.
odmc argues that the patentee did not disavow the standard dictionary meaning of customer,and that the ross invention is not limited to any specific kind of customer.however,when the scope of the invention is clearly stated in the specification,and is described as the advantage and distinction of the invention,it is not necessary to disavow explicitly a different scope.see astrazeneca ab mut.pharm,where the general summary or description of the invention describes a feature of the invention here,micelles formed by the solubilizer and criticizes other products here,other solubilizers,including that lack that same feature,this operates as a clear disavowal of these other products bell atlantic network services,covad communications group,the written description can provide guidance as to the meaning of the claims,thereby dictating the manner in which the claims are to be construed,even if the guidance is not provided in explicit definitional format.quoting scimed life,advanced cardiovascular.
the ross specification repeatedly reinforces its usage of the term customer as the retail consumer.see,lines all customer actions are conducted within customer console,lines the customer seats himself or herself in front of computer screen as depicted in,lines if the consumer wishes to purchase a book,he may either pay for the book through a store clerk or the consumer may enter his credit card into the system.the specification distinguishes general purpose machines not specifically designed to be consumer operated for the on demand,automatic manufacturing of a single book at the point of sale,lines.
in phillips,at,the en banc court explained that the role of the specification is to describe and enable the invention.in turn,the claims can not be of broader scope than the invention that is set forth in the specification.although we agree with the district court that the ross invention does not concern itself with whether the customer reads the book or obtains it for resale,the focus of the ross patent is immediate printing and binding initiated by the customer and conducted at the customer site.the district court definition of customer can not eliminate these constraints in order to embrace the remote production of books for publishers and retailers.
providing means for a customer to visually review,clause of claim 
the district court correctly viewed claim clause,providing means for a customer to visually review said sales information,to be in form pursuant to and instructed that the computer module is the corresponding structure shown in the specification.the jury was instructed as follows 
claim,clause,recites providing means for a customer to visually review said sales information.the word providing in this clause has its usual and customary meaning,including to supply for use,contribute,or furnish.
the phrase means for a customer to scan said sales information in this clause the words of claim is interpreted to include a customer computer module,as described in column,lines and column,lines,but does not include elements in the patent specification,which are referred to as being preferable,and thus a customer seat and ambient light are not included.because this claim language concerns a means plus a function,the words means for a customer to scan said sales information include equivalents of a customer computer module which has the identical function permitting a customer to visually review the sales information which has been stored in a computer.such equivalents include any computer monitor that gives a customer access to sales information that has been stored in a computer and any user input device for a customer to perform this function.these include accessing information by touching the computer screen or by use of structure that is equivalent thereof.
the defendants argue that the district court improperly invaded the province of the jury when it announced the equivalents that are included,stating that it is the role of the trier of fact,here the jury,to determine equivalents under.see utah med,graphic controls,equivalents under is a question of fact odetics,storage tech,comparing overall structures corresponding to the claimed function.
odmc states that it was not incorrect for the district court,in the context of claim construction,to instruct the jury as to possible equivalents of the computer monitor and how the customer accesses the sales information.although equivalents do not lose their factual identity in a context,in the uncertain boundary between law and fact in claim construction,the giving of an instruction that is not incorrect factually is not reversible error.the infringement issue as to this clause,as the district court instruction implemented,is not whether the computer contains a touch screen,but whether the defendants provide a computer means to customers.see acromed sofamor danek group,limitations on the structure for means plus function claims must relate to the function at issue.
it is undisputed that these defendants do not provide a computer to the customer.odmc states that the defendants provide themselves with computers and that provides sales information that a customer can access through any computer.however,this is not the ross invention,which requires that the bookseller provides the customer with the computer for use in this unified system.although a witness for odmc testified to his belief that the defendants encourage retail booksellers to provide computers for customer use,there was no evidence of such booksellers providing a computer system whereby the ultimate customer can initiate printing and binding of a selected book from data that had been entered into the computer.
amazon states that while it provides information about books,including promotional information,it does not provide computers or computer kiosks.consumers use their own computers to order books from amazon,which in turn may place orders with lightning source.however,the consumer can not order that the book be printed.as summarized by the district court 
evidence at trial established that the books printed by lightning source are the result of various types of demands wholesalers use systems that do not involve any viewing of sales information available on any web site two retailers order books in a similar manner some publishers order books by edi electronic data interchange transactions where there is no use of any web site other publishers order books by placing orders through the lightning source web site,but that ordering process requires no viewing of sales information retail customers may order lightning books through amazon web site by reviewing sales information,but the books may have already been printed as a result of an amazon order to lightning source.
order of july,at.the evidence summarized by the district court was undisputed publishers,wholesalers,and retailers,order books from lightning source in various ways,but there is not direct ordering by retail customers.
printing on paper pages,clause of claim 
it was undisputed at trial that lightning source prints on rolls or webs of paper rather than on sheets.the district court ruled that printing the text of said selected one of said bo
