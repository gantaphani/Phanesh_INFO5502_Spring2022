background 
the patent is here for the third time.the patent is directed to the in transit detection of computer virus with safeguard,and is described in detail in our earlier opinions.see hilgraeve mcafee,hilgraeve i hilgraeve symantec,hilgraeve ii.briefly,the patent discloses a method of scanning for and detecting computer viruses embedded in data files that are downloaded or copied from a remote server,via the internet onto a computer.critically,the claimed operates before the downloaded or copied data files are accessible to the computer operating system,thereby allowing the software to block access to those files early enough to prevent the embedded viruses from spreading and infecting the computer.the patent includes claims,of which claim and claim are independent.claim is representative 
in a system for transferring digital data for storage in a computer storage medium,a method of screening the data as it is being transferred and automatically inhibiting the storage of screened data containing at least one predefined sequence,comprising the steps of 
causing a quantity of digital data resident on a source storage medium to be transferred to a computer system having a destination storage medium 
receiving and screening the transferred digital data prior to storage on the destination storage medium to determine if at least one of a plurality of predefined sequences are present in the digital data received and 
in response to said screening step 
a automatically causing the screened digital data to be stored on said destination storage medium if none of the plurality of predefined sequences are present,and 
b automatically inhibiting the screened digital data from being stored on said destination storage medium if at least one predefined sequence is resent.
patent,emphases added.
in the patent two prior appearances before this court,the central issue was whether the accused products scanned incoming data files prior to storage.in hilgraeve i,hilgraeve,the original assignee of the patent,brought a patent infringement suit against mcafee associates mcafee for its virusscan product.at.the district court granted summary judgment of to mcafee,and hilgraeve appealed.id.in that appeal,the parties did not dispute the construction of the claim term storage,which the district court had construed as occurring when the incoming digital data is sufficiently present on the destination storage medium,and accessible by the operating system or other programs,so that any viruses contained in the data can spread and infect the computer system.id.at.
in hilgraeve ii,hilgraeve asserted the same patent in a separately filed action against symantec.at.the district court granted summary judgment of to symantec,and hilgraeve appealed.id.on appeal,hilgraeve challenged the district court construction of the term storage,which differed from the construction in hilgraeve i because it did not include the accessible by the operating system or other programs language.id.at.symantec argued that the term should be construed to occur when the data become physically present,magnetically recorded on the storage medium.id.we rejected symantec construction and adopted hilgraeve construction which was identical to the district court construction in hilgraeve i of storage,holding that storage occurred when the incoming digital data are sufficiently present on the destination storage medium and accessible by the operating system or other programs so that any viruses contained in the data can spread and infect the computer system.id.at.
subsequent to our decision in hilgraeve ii,symantec settled its dispute with hilgraeve,and,as part of that settlement,purchased hilgraeve interest in the patent.hilgraeve had previously filed a new infringement action against ca,alleging infringement of claims of the patent.the district court then substituted symantec as the plaintiff.
ca,the accused infringer here,develops and sells a number of antivirus software products.the accused products are the etrust ez and etrust products collectively the eav products,which employ both an incoming and outgoing scan mode the arcserve product,which is designed to restore data from a backup media where the data had previously been archived and the gateway products,which operate as a proxy between a user personal computer and an unattended gateway computer.
ca initial pleadings denied infringement and asserted affirmative defenses and counterclaims for invalidity and.subsequently,ca amended its pleadings to add affirmative defenses including a defense of laches and counterclaims for unenforceability of the patent due to inequitable conduct,and for invalidity of the patent under for failing to name alleged levin.the district court also granted levin motion to intervene as a party and assert a claim for of the patent.
as discussed below,the district court construed the terms a method of screening the data as it is being transferred,computer system,and destination storage medium the critical claim terms on an order dated march.based on its constructions of those terms,it granted summary judgment to ca of on the eav products and the arcserve product.although it did not grant summary judgment on the gateway products,the parties stipulated to of the gateway products under the district court claim construction.the district court also granted summary judgment to symantec on invalidity,holding that the patent was not anticipated or obvious in view of several prior art references.finally,in separate orders,the district court granted summary judgment to symantec on ca affirmative defense of laches ca claim that the patent was unenforceable based on inequitable conduct and ca and levin claim that levin was a joint inventor of the patent.symantec timely appealed ca and levin timely.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a,except as to ca improper on the issue of laches.
discussion 
we review summary judgment decisions without deference,reapplying the standard used by the district court.innogenetics,abbott.under that standard,summary judgment must be granted when,drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the,there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and no reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmovant.id.
symantec primary challenge is to the district court determination that the term a method of screening the data as it is being transferred,appearing in the preambles to the claims,was a claim limitation,and its construction of that phrase to mean a method of screening the data while it is being moved or copied and before the data is stored to the computer storage medium.at.these determinations bear directly on the infringement analysis of each of the accused ca products.the dispute centers on whether the claims cover methods that do not screen data until after that data is written to a storage medium but do conduct screening prior to storage,before the data is accessible to the operating system or to other computer programs.
under the district court construction,antivirus programs that screen data at any time after that data is written to the storage medium,the computer hard drive,but before it becomes accessible to the operating system or to other computer programs,fall outside the scope of the as it is being transferred limitation,even if screening is completed entirely before the data becomes accessible.this construction,symantec argues,is in direct conflict with our earlier decision in hilgraeve ii,where we construed the term storage to occur when the incoming digital data is sufficiently present on the destination storage medium and accessible by the operating system or other programs so that any viruses contained in the data can spread and infect the computer system.at.that construction of the term storage,symantec argues,would have no meaning if the claim term a method of screening data as it is being transferred were construed to mean that the virus scanning must occur entirely before any data is written to the storage medium.
on appeal,ca does not dispute the binding effect of our earlier construction of the term storage in hilgraeve ii.instead,ca contends that our earlier panel decision did not address the claim term a method of screening data as it is being transferred,appearing in the preamble,now at issue.that term,it argues,is a separate claim limitation that was added independently to overcome prior art methods.
claim construction is a question of law that we review without deference.cybor fas,en banc.
because the disputed term appears in the preamble to claim,we must first determine whether it is in fact a separate limitation.in general,a preamble is construed as a limitation if it recites essential structure or steps,or if it is necessary to give life,meaning,and vitality to the claim.catalina mktg.int l,quoting pitney bowes.a preamble is not limiting,however,where a patentee defines a structurally complete invention in the claim body and uses the preamble only to state a purpose or intended use for the invention.id.quoting rowe dror.in catalina,we identified several guideposts to aid in determining whether a preamble should be given limiting weight.for example,clear reliance on the preamble during prosecution to distinguish the claimed invention from the prior art transforms the preamble into a claim limitation because such reliance indicates use of the preamble to define,in part,the claimed invention.id.absent clear reliance on the preamble in the prosecution history,or in situations where it is necessary to provide antecedent basis for the body of the claim,the preamble generally is not limiting.id.at.thus,in general,the purpose of a claim preamble is to give context for what is being described in the body of the claim if it is reasonably susceptible to being construed to be merely duplicative of the limitations in the body of the claim and was not clearly added to overcome a rejection,we do not construe it to be a separate limitation.
here,the only basis for the district court departure from the general rule was the notion that the as it is being transferred language was added separately from the prior to storage limitation to overcome the prior art.however,the district court erred in its description of the prosecution history.the prosecution history is clear that both terms were added concurrently to overcome the same prior art.the as it is being transferred language did not have its own independent significance.the prosecution history fails to demonstrate clear reliance on the preamble during prosecution to distinguish the claimed invention from the prior art.see id.at 
ca argues alternatively that the district court construction was nonetheless correct because the as it is being transferred term and the prior to storage term can not have the same must each be given a distinct construction.although ca is correct that when construing terms in the body of a claim,the general assumption is that different terms have different meanings,applied medical resources united states surgical,the same generally is not true for terms in the preamble.the use of different language in the preamble than in the body of the claims does not suggest that the preamble imposes a limitation.rather it is assumed that the preamble language is duplicative of the language found in the body of the claims or merely provides context for the claims,absent any indication to the contrary in the claims,the specification or the prosecution history.here,there is nothing in the claims,the specification or the prosecution history that suggests that the preamble language as it is being transferred has any different meaning than prior to storage.
indeed,if the term as it is being transferred is to be read consistently with our prior construction of the term storage,the claim term as it is being transferred can only mean that virus scanning occurs prior to storage.any other construction of that term would vitiate the meaning that we previously gave to the term storage in hilgraeve i and hilgraeve ii.see fort howard paper,s tatements in opinions of this court must be read harmoniously with prior precedent,not in isolation.there would simply be no reason to construe storage to mean that scanning can occur after it is written to the computer but before it is accessible to other programs if the term as it is being transferred requires scanning to occur completely before any data is written to the computer.
we conclude that the term as it is being transferred simply means prior to storage.given our previous construction of the term storage in hilgraeve ii,the term as it is being transferred must mean before the incoming digital data is sufficiently present on the destination storage medium and accessible by the operating system or other programs so that any viruses contained in the data can spread and infect the computer system.under these circumstances,the language in the preamble does not impose a separate claim limitation.
symantec also challenges the district court construction of the terms computer and computer system.the district court construed these terms to mean a personal computer or workstation.in doing so,the district court rejected symantec proposed construction that computer system meant any combination of hardware,software,documentation,and manual procedures that are combined to perform a specific function.at.based on the district court claim construction,the parties stipulated that the gateway products do not infringe the asserted claims.
the dispute here centers on whether the term computer system is properly limited to a single computer,or whether it covers a network of multiple computers.the district court explained that its construction limited the term computer system to a single personal computer or workstation.the district court premised its construction on the preferred embodiment use of a single computer,which as the court noted,constitutes the complete description of the computer system.the district court also relied on expert testimony that the term computer system,as used in the specification,referred to a single computer.
on appeal,symantec contends that the district court improperly limited the claims to cover only the preferred embodiment.the specification does not limit the invention to the preferred embodiment,and the ordinary meaning of the term computer system,according to symantec,includes both a single computer and a system of multiple,interconnected computers.
we agree with symantec that the district court construction of the terms computer and computer system unduly limits the scope of the claims to a single personal computer.the claims must be read in view of the specification,of which they are a part.phillips awh,en banc.in phillips,we characterized the specification as the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term.id.we find nothing in the specification that would limit the meaning of the term computer or computer system to a single computer.the terms are not expressly defined in the specification,and there is nothing in the specification that suggests that it adopted a special definition of those terms moreover,the expert testimony that the district court cites does not support the district court construction.that testimony simply recites how each expert would construe the term computer system based on his own reading of the specification.such expert testimony,which does not identify the accepted meaning in the field to one skilled in the art,is unhelpful.sinorgchem,at according little or no weight to expert testimony about the meaning of specification terms where the expert failed to present evidence of the generally accepted meaning of those terms to persons of ordinary skill in the art.
because the specification does not reveal any special definition for the terms computer or computer system,we must construe those terms according to their ordinary meaning.in phillips,we explained that the words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning.at.we clarified that the relevant meaning is the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art in question at the time of the invention.id.at.dictionaries are among the many tools that can assist the court in determining the meaning of particular terminology to those of skill in the art of the invention.id.at.here,it is clear that the ordinary meaning of the terms computer or computer system as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention is not limited to a single computer or workstation.the dictionary of computing at that time defined the term system,in relevant part,as 
anything we choose to regard a as an entity and b as comprising a set of related components.in computing the word is widely used with many shades of meaning.most commonly,however,it may refer to a related set of hardware units,or programs,or both.the hardware contents of a computer room may be spoken of as the system,and so may a range of manufacturer equipment.
dictionary of computing ed.by contrast,the same dictionary defined the term as d enoting a computer system or subsystem that is capable of operation without being connected to any other computer system or subsystem.id.at.in other words,a stand alone computer is only one type of computer or computer system.we therefore conclude that the ordinary meaning of the terms computer and computer system to one of ordinary skill in the art in was not limited to a single,computer or workstation and that the district court erred by unduly limiting its construction of those terms.
because we find that the terms computer and computer system are not limited to a single computer,we must vacate and remand to the district court on the issue of infringement of ca gateway products.given our construction of these terms,on remand,the district court should determine whether the combination of computers used in the gateway system performs all the claimed method steps.
symantec also contends that the district court erred in construing the term destination storage medium to mean a computer storage medium that is the target of the transfer of data as a result of the causing step.this construction,when read together with the district court construction of the terms computer and computer system,which we rejected above,effectively limited the term destination storage medium to encompass only a storage system residing within a computer,such as a computer hard drive.such a limitation had the effect of excluding from the claim scope any peripheral devices,such as floppy drives or thumb drives.
the district court reasoned that construing destination storage medium to include peripheral devices would be inconsistent with its construction of the term computer system,since such a construction would permit the invention to operate outside of the computer system.at.under the correct construction of computer system,there is no reason that destination storage medium must be limited to a computer hard drive.under our construction of destination storage medium,peripheral devices,such as floppy drives and thumb drives,are properly within the scope of that term.in addition,we note that the inclusion of peripheral devices within the scope of the term destination storage medium is consistent with the broad construction we gave that term in hilgraeve ii storage medium refers to any storage medium of the computer system,if the data,when stored on the medium,are accessible to the operating system or other programs,such that viruses in the data can spread and infect the computer system.at.
next,symantec argues that the district court improperly granted summary judgment of on the eav products based on a finding that ca does not induce infringement of the patent.the district court held that the eav products failed to meet both the as it is being transferred claim limitation and the causing a quantity of digital data resident on a source storage medium to be transferred claim limitation.as we have already found that the former was based on an erroneous claim construction,we now need only address the latter claim limitation.
before the district court,there was no dispute that the eav products do not cause a quantity of digital data resident on a source storage medium to be transferred,as required by claim.instead,as the district court found,the eav products work in conjunction with a downloading or copying program,such as an internet browser.the eav products perform the scanning the downloading program performs the downloading.symantec argued that ca induces its customers to infringe the patent by promoting its eav products to be used in an infringing manner in conjunction with a downloading program.the district court rejected this argument.it held that symantec could not establish active inducement because it did not show that any third party directly infringed the patent using the eav products.
b provides that w hoever actively induces infringement of a patent shall be liable as an infringer.in order to succeed on a claim of inducement,the patentee must show,first that there has been direct infringement,and second,that the alleged infringer knowingly induced infringement and possessed specific intent to encourage another infringement.memc materials,mitsubishi materials silicon,quoting.mining chemque.we recently clarified en banc that the specific intent necessary to induce infringement requires more than just intent to cause the acts that produce direct infringement t he inducer must have an affirmative intent to cause direct infringement.dsu med.jms,relevant section en banc.thus,inducement requires evidence of culpable conduct,directed to encouraging another infringement,not merely that the inducer had knowledge of the direct infringer activities.id.
on appeal,symantec asserts that it produced ample evidence to establish that the eav products have no utility apart from screening downloaded or copied data files.that is,the eav products operate only when a user downloads or copies a file onto his computer,and the downloading or copying must happen via a downloading or copying software program.in particular,symantec points out that the eav product manual establishes that ca promotes its use of the eav product in combination with a downloading program in an infringing manner.the manual states that t he realtime monitor scans programs on a workstation or server each time a file is executed,accessed,or opened.at.in its discussion of the internet,the manual states that t he newest source of infections is the internet this feature works with browsers from netscape and microsoft.id.at.in response,ca maintains that symantec has not shown any evidence of direct infringement because it has not shown that any ca customer actually performs all of the claimed method steps.absent such a showing,ca contends that the district court properly granted summary judgment.
we find that there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether ca induced its customers to infringe the patent.we agree with symantec that ca encouraged customers to engage in direct infringement by using the eav products in conjunction with a downloading program.this is not a case where the customers may be using the product in either an infringing way or a way ca customers can only use the eav products in an infringing way.under these circumstances,symantec has produced sufficient circumstantial evidence of direct infringement to create a genuine issue of material fact,even though symantec has not produced evidence that any particular customer has directly infringed the patent.direct evidence of infringement,as opposed to circumstantial evidence,is not necessary.see chiuminatta concrete concepts,cardinal,finding that cardinal advertisements conceded the ability of the accused device to practice the claimed method,and encouraged such use moleculon research cbs,rejecting the argument that proof of inducing infringement or direct infringement requires direct,as opposed to circumstantial evidence.
we therefore vacate and remand the district court summary judgment finding of with respect to the eav products on remand,the district court should consider whether the specific intent requirement set forth in dsu,which was decided after the grant of summary judgment in this case,was met.
on,ca challenges the district court summary judgment finding that the doctrine of laches does not bar symantec recovery for ca alleged patent infringement prior to the filing of suit.at the outset,we dismiss ca laches claim as an improper.a party may if adversely affected by the appealed judgment in some particular which it seeks to have modified.typeright keyboard microsoft,internal quotation marks omitted.a may only be filed when a party seeks to enlarge its own rights under the judgment or to lessen the rights of its adversary under the judgment.bailey dart container.thus,a properly filed requires that,upon acceptance of appellee argument,our determination would result in a reversal or modification of the judgment rather than an affirmance.see id.here,the district court granted summary judgment of on ca eav products.ca argues on appeal that the doctrine of laches precludes symantec from recovering damages on those products for any period before the filing of suit.thus,even if we were to agree with ca that laches precludes symantec recovery over the eav products,our determination would have no effect on the district court judgment.we therefore dismiss as improperly filed ca laches 
however,we may consider ca laches arguments as an alternative ground for sustaining the judgment of.typeright keyboard,at even though we lack jurisdiction over the,the appellee may still defend the judgment on other grounds.we find that the district court did not err in dismissing ca laches defense on summary judgment.
a defendant,in order to invoke the defense of laches,must prove that the plaintiff delayed filing suit for an unreasonable and inexcusable length of time from the time the plaintiff knew or reasonably should have known of its claim against the defendant,and that the delay operated to the prejudice or injury of the defendant.aukerman chaides constr,en banc.a presumption of laches arises upon proof that the patentee delayed filing suit for more than six years after actual or constructive knowledge of the defendant alleged infringing activity.id.at.we review a district court determination on the issue of laches for an abuse of discretion.id.at.
the patent issued to hilgraeve on june.in june,an independent software company called cheyenne software began marketing a antivirus software product called inoculan.hilgraeve sent a warning letter to cheyenne dated october,regarding possible infringement.on november,ca acquired cheyenne software,and thereafter allegedly the inoculan product into one of its etrust antivirus products.hilgraeve filed the present suit against ca on september,and,as discussed above,symantec later acquired hilgraeve interest in the patent and was substituted as the plaintiff in the present suit.
before the district court,ca argued that symantec should be charged with the period of delay attributable to hilgraeve when it stepped in as the plaintiff in the present suit.ca asserted that cheyenne open and notorious marketing of inoculan in june established hilgraeve constructive knowledge of cheyenne infringing use,and that,regardless,the october,warning letter established hilgraeve actual knowledge of cheyenne infringing use.finally,ca argued that by establishing hilgraeve knowledge of cheyenne alleged infringement,it was also establishing hilgraeve knowledge with respect to the accused ca products at issue here,since ca the inoculan product into one of its own.
the district court held that hilgraeve alleged knowledge of inoculan,either constructive or actual,was insufficient as a matter of law to establish hilgraeve knowledge of the alleged infringing ca products.in doing so,it did not reach the question of whether symantec should be charged with hilgraeve knowledge.rather,it concluded that ca had failed to show evidence establishing that inoculan was the same or similar to the products in suit.we agree that laches would only apply if the products were the same or similar,see watkins northwestern ohio tractor pullers association,cir,and that ca has presented insufficient evidence that inoculan is the same or similar to any of the products in suit on appeal,ca does not point to any such evidence but contends that symantec october,warning letter to ca,urging that it had committed willful infringement,must be interpreted as an admission that inoculan was a precursor to one of the ca products at issue here.we can not agree.willful infringement requires an objective showing that the alleged actions constituted infringement of a valid patent,determined by the record developed in the infringement proceeding.in re seagate,llc.an allegation of willful infringement does not assume any similarity between inoculan and the products in suit.we therefore find that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to symantec on ca laches defense.
levin and ca asserts that he is an omitted of the patent to show,levin is required to prove his contribution to the conception of the claims by clear and convincing evidence.see ethicon,surgical.an alleged testimony,standing alone,can not rise to the level of clear and convincing evidence he must supply evidence to corroborate his testimony.id.in guide international,international trade commission,we explained that w hether the testimony has been sufficiently corroborated is evaluated under a rule of reason analysis,which requires that an evaluation of all pertinent evidence must be made so that a sound determination of the credibility of the inventor story may be reached.id.at quoting price symsek.corroborating evidence may be in the form of records made contemporaneously with the inventive process,c ircumstantial evidence of an independent nature,or oral testimony from someone other than the alleged inventor.id.
before the district court,levin submitted a declaration stating that he gave matthew gray gray,one of the named inventors of the patent,the idea for the virus scan method in a february,telephone call.to corroborate his declaration,levin submitted gray day planner,which reflected gray notes confirming that the disputed telephone call took place.levin points out that gray testified that the day planner entry that reflected his conversation with levin was relat ed to the patent.at.in addition,levin relied on the lack of evidence showing gray conception of the virus scan invention,which he argued further corroborated his own testimony.
the district court found that the day planner entry was insufficient as corroborating evidence.that entry,according to the district court,at most shows only that levin and gray discussed the state of the art it fail ed to explicitly identify levin contribution.at.we agree with the district court that,at most,the day planner entry establishes that gray and levin spoke about the state of programs it does not establish that levin contributed to the idea.that entry,listing an ibm scan program,a computer virus handbook,jim mcaffey virus scan,and levin checkup antivirus system,at,suggests only that gray simply called levin to discuss the state of the prior art.
the district court also found that any evidence tending to call into question gray contribution to the invention was irrelevant to the question of whether levin made any contribution.again,we agree with the district court that the evidence regarding gray contribution was not relevant to the question of levin contribution.thi
