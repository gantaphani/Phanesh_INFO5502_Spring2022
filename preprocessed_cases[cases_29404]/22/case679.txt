in a jury trial,kenneth michael dodds was found guilty of knowingly possessing material that contained images of child pornography in violation of a b and knowingly receiving obscene pictures in violation of.
dodds challenges his conviction and sentence on three grounds.first,he asserts that judgment on both counts should be reversed because the district court abused its discretion by allowing the introduction of images of child pornography into evidence,which he claims had little probative value and had an overwhelmingly prejudicial effect.second,dodds claims that his conviction under must be reversed because the government failed to furnish evidence that he had received the obscene pictures from the internet,as required by the statute.finally,dodds argues that the district court should have sentenced him under sentencing guideline,which is the appropriate sentencing guideline for mere possession of child pornography,rather than sentence him under,which is the appropriate sentencing guideline for receiving,transporting,or advertising material involving the exploitation of a minor.
background 
dodds was stationed at the redstone arsenal in alabama while serving in the united states military and chad davis was assigned to share a room with him.at trial davis testified that on several occasions,in the middle of the night,he had observed dodds viewing child pornography on his computer.he decided to investigate dodds computer,which he had permission to use,and found in a folder named mike pics some of the pictures he remembered seeing dodds view on the computer.davis went first to his chaplain and ultimately to his chain of command.the investigation that followed revealed that there were pornographic images on the computers hard drive and that dodds possessed a entitled mike pics that contained pornographic photographs.an expert testified that of the photographs,only three contained images that could be classified as adult pornography as opposed to child pornography.
dodds friend,paul leitner,suggested in testimony that another individual,todd shofner,may have been responsible for the presence of child pornography on dodds computer.shofner was unavailable to testify because he had died before the investigation of dodds began.leitner testified that he believed that shofner had downloaded some pornography on dodds computer and had shown some of the pictures to leitner and dodds.leitner further testified that he never saw shofner downloading child pornography from the internet,but shoftner had given him a copy of the called mike pics,which contained child pornography.
leitner acknowledged that shofner had wiped dodds hard drive in january or february of.therefore,anything that was on dodds hard drive at the time it was seized later in would have been put on the computer after the wipe.this alleged wiping of the hard drive in january helps to explain why there were only images on the computer hard drive when it was confiscated in april,but more than on the mike pics,which would not have been wiped.one of the items seized from dodds room was a cd.
to counter the assertion that shofner had been responsible for downloading,or at least viewing,all of the images,the government presented evidence that shofner had been released from training at redstone arsenal on approximately march,to return to his base in germany and that pornographic images from the had been viewed as late as march.additionally,over images of child pornography were accessed on dodds computer in a one week period in early april.furthermore,the government argued that special importance should be assigned the fact that the files were named mike pics rather than todd pics.
during the jury trial,the district court admitted into evidence images of child pornography taken from the computer,rejecting dodds objection that the evidence was cumulative and prejudicial and denying dodds motion for judgment of acquittal.dodds was convicted on both counts and the probation office recommended that dodds be sentenced using.at the sentencing hearing,however,the district court agreed with the government that,which resulted in a higher sentence,was more appropriate.
discussion 
admission of evidence 
dodds first claims that exposing the jury to of the images of child pornography found in his possession was unfairly cumulative and prejudicial,overwhelming the evidence minimal probative effect.as a result,he asserts that both counts of his conviction should be reversed since the evidence should have been excluded under federal rule of evidence.
this court reviews a district court evidentiary rulings for a clear abuse of discretion.united states tinoco.we will reverse a district court evidentiary rulings only if the resulting error affected the defendant substantial rights.id.citing united states hands,cir.although we recognize that.permits the district court to exclude otherwise relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,we have also recognized that rule is an extraordinary remedy which the district court should invoke sparingly,and t he balance should be struck in favor of admissibility.id.at citing united states elkins,cir.thus,we have held that i n reviewing issues under rule,we look at the evidence in a light most favorable to its admission,maximizing its probative value and minimizing its undue prejudicial impact.id.internal citations omitted.however,limits do exist regarding the quality and quantity of evidence that may be introduced.rule demands a balancing approach between the degrees of probative value that a piece of evidence has and its prejudicial effect.old chief united states,d 
dodds argues that the district court erred in applying such a balancing test relying on two cases from other circuits to support his claim,both of which we find inapplicable and easily distinguishable.first,the challenged evidence here is not extrinsic to the crime charged or more violent than the actual pornography which was charged as was the case in united states grimes,cir.here it constituted a small portion pictures of the thousands of actual child pornography which dodds was convicted of possessing pictures and was not extrinsic,but rather a part of the actual pornography possessed.
nor do we find united states,cir,applicable.in that case the ninth circuit determined that the evidence should have been excluded because it was too prejudicial in light of evidence that the defendant had simply stumbled upon the pornographic films in a briefcase in an abandoned farmhouse and there was no evidence that he had ever watched them or knew their content.id.at.dodds argues that his case parallels,asserting that like,he never saw any of the pornography on his computer because shofner put the images there undetected and in secret.belying dodds claim,however,is the government evidence of dodds guilt,which included the testimony of dodds roommate who observed dodds looking at the pornographic pictures on his computer,the fact that child pornographic images continued to be accessed after shofner had left the base,and the fact that the images were placed into a file a named after dodds.this case is completely inapposite to.
on the other hand,in united states becht,cir,a case almost exactly like this one,the court refused to reverse a child pornography conviction on the grounds that the district court had abused its discretion by allowing the government to enter child pornographic images into evidence.see becht,at.becht had pornographic images stored on his computer,hundreds of which were child pornography.id.at.becht conceded that the images constituted child pornography but argued that he did not know his website contained such images because he had activated a robot program to disseminate the pornographic images from his website and wrote a program that automatically sorted incoming images into categories according to their file name.id.the government argued that because the automatic sorting system did not function until after many of the pictures had been filed,becht must have sorted the pictures by hand and was therefore aware of their content.id.similarly,dodd
