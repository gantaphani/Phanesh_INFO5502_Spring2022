a jury convicted jeffrey martin walker on charges of interstate stalking,cyberstalking,and mailing a threatening communication.on appeal,he challenges both the verdict and the ensuing sentence,presenting among other issues three questions of first impression in this circuit.two of these questions involve statutory interpretation and the third involves the operation of federal rule of criminal procedure e.after careful consideration of compendious briefing and arguments,we reject the appeal.
background 
we rehearse the facts in the light most agreeable to the verdict,consistent with record support.united states stevens,cir.
the appellant and his wife,amy walker,lived together with their son,until their relationship soured.as with many such tales,there is an element of he said,she said regarding the cause of the discord.amy says that the appellant had been physically and emotionally abusive the appellant says that the marriage went downhill once the couple moved from michigan to puerto rico so that amy could accept a position as a court reporter.
the family moved to puerto rico in,and amy left the marital domicile in august of.for the first few months after the separation,lived with his father in puerto rico.in december,amy repaired to the puerto rico family court,complaining that the appellant had prevented her from having any contact with her son and,in the bargain,was threatening to take the boy back to michigan.responding to amy entreaty,the family court barred the appellant from taking out of puerto rico.
the appellant defied the court order and returned to michigan with.the court ordered him to bring the boy back.when he ignored that decree,the court found him in contempt and issued a warrant for his arrest.meanwhile,the appellant obtained a temporary custody order from a michigan court.
as the rift between the spouses deepened,amy began receiving harassing and threatening.these communiqués were laced with derogations such as whore and bitch and contained threats to harm amy if she continued her battle for custody although the originated from account,testified that his father had composed them.amy corroborated this identification,testifying that she inferred the appellant authorship from certain habitual misspellings and turns of phrase.
around this same time,the appellant threatened to blow head off with a shotgun.the appellant brother,jack,heard the threat and called the police.alarmed by this development,amy flew to michigan and succeeded in obtaining a custody order from the court there.the michigan court allowed amy and her son to reside in puerto rico after amy supervisor at work,chief judge josé fusté of the united states district court for the district of puerto rico,offered assurances that amy would return to michigan should subsequent proceedings require her presence.
amy return to puerto rico did not allay her trepidation.to keep tabs on her estranged husband whereabouts,amy surreptitiously used her knowledge of his password to monitor his.in this way,she learned that the appellant had contacted a militaristic website asking for pointers on wielding a knife in close combat.she also learned that the appellant had asked the author of a religious tome whether a man could commit premeditated murder and still be saved.amy testified that these communications exacerbated her fears that the appellant intended to kill her and her young son.
other actions during this period demonstrated the appellant increasing desperation.for example,in the spring of,he engaged in an extended correspondence with a private investigator in puerto rico.although the appellant never hired the man,the relevant make it plain that the appellant wanted help in learning where his wife and son were living.in april,the appellant telephoned amy sister and described in gruesome detail how he would murder both his wife and his son if he lost the ongoing custody battle.amy sister related the threat to amy.that summer,the appellant engaged in a long online chat with a counselor at new hope ministries,a christian counseling center.during this chat,he expressed his resolve to harm amy and stated that he could have her killed for a few hundred dollars.
on the day before he made these statements,the appellant had purchased a airline ticket to puerto rico.upon viewing the appellant planned itinerary in his,amy became frightened and contacted the authorities.on the day of the flight to puerto rico august,agents of the federal bureau of investigation fbi greeted the appellant at the luis muñoz marín international airport,arrested him as he deplaned,and charged him with criminal contempt for defying the earlier orders of the puerto rico family court.in due course,the appellant received a prison sentence.
while incarcerated,the appellant composed a letter to amy,exhorting her to pray lest god harm her or given the rancorous background of their relationship,amy interpreted the appellant jumbled prose as a threat.the appellant also wrote to one tony walker a friend,but not a relative about a fellow inmate offer to kill amy for him.in that letter,the appellant stated that he did not know if he said yes to the fellow inmate or not.the appellant also wrote that i f a man or woman would have done what my wife and brother did to me,i would have killed them.tony viewed these comments as constituting a threat on amy life and informed her of them.
before the criminal contempt sentence expired,a federal grand jury sitting in the district of puerto rico returned an indictment against the appellant.the indictment charged him with one count of interstate stalking,ten counts of cyberstalking each count emanating from a particular communication,and two counts of mailing threatening letters.see,c.after a trial,a jury convicted the appellant on the interstate stalking count,four cyberstalking counts,and one threatening letter count.it acquitted him on the remaining counts.
the district court denied the appellant motion for acquittal,and imposed a month incarcerative sentence.this timely appeal ensued.in it,the appellant is ably represented by new counsel.
ii.analysis 
the appellant musters a long list of remonstrances.we address below each of the various elements of this asseverational array.
the appellant first contention is that the district court committed reversible error when it denied his pretrial motion for a change of venue.the crux of this contention is that it was unfair to try him in the same courthouse where amy worked as a court reporter.he muses that the jurors may have given extra credence to amy testimony because of her position and because of testimony that judge fusté then the chief judge of puerto rico federal district court had vouched for amy in the michigan custody proceedings and had encouraged her to contact the fbi when she learned of the appellant planned trip to puerto rico based on these atmospherics,the appellant maintains that his motion to change venue should have been granted and the case transferred to,and tried in,some other district.
we review a district court denial of a motion for a change of venue for abuse of discretion.see united states pérez gonzález,cir.an abuse of discretion occurs when a relevant factor deserving of significant weight is overlooked,or when an improper factor is accorded significant weight,or when the court considers the appropriate mix of factors,but commits a palpable error of judgment in calibrating the decisional scales.united states nguyen,cir.within this rubric,a material error of law is invariably an abuse of discretion.united states snyder,cir.
venue requirements for criminal cases are set by statute.see see also const.amend.vi.where,as here,those requirements are satisfied,the choice of venue is in the first instance a matter of prosecutorial discretion.the district court,however,may overrule that choice in certain narrowly circumscribed circumstances.as a general rule,a court must transfer a case to another district if an unacceptable level of prejudice against the defendant is likely to mar a trial in the original district.a.this requires prejudice so great that the defendant can not receive a fair trial.id.a court also may transfer a criminal case to another district for the convenience of the parties,any victim,and the witnesses,and in the interest of justice.b.
the appellant initial claim implicates rule a the mandatory transfer provision.this provision has been applied almost exclusively in cases in which pervasive pretrial publicity has inflamed passions in the host community past the breaking point.see,united states angiulo,cir per curiam.here,however,there is no hint either that the contretemps between amy and the appellant had captured the attention of the wider community or that pretrial publicity had tainted the jury pool.instead,the appellant seeks to extend the mandatory transfer provision to cases,like this one,in which the putative victim of a charged crime is an employee of the court.
to the extent that the appellant invites us to forge a per se rule,we decline his invitation.the mere fact that the victim of the crime is a court employee in the district is not,in and of itself,a reason sufficient to compel a transfer of venue.see,united states angelus,cir upholding denial of motion to transfer venue where victim was a deputy marshal who worked in district.
the appellant citation to the decision in united states wright,d,does not sully this conclusion.wright is readily distinguishable the crimes charged there occurred in court and court personnel were to be called as witnesses.see id.at.nor does the appellant invocation of supreme court precedents,see,united states young,d turner louisiana,d,assist his cause.these cases stand for general principles with which we agree,but they have no specific application here.
the appellant tries a variation on this theme.he says that amy status as a court employee,coupled with the testimony about the chief judge intervention and ongoing advice,biased the jury against him.but this case was not about the chief judge,who neither presided over the trial nor appeared as a witness.refined to bare essence,the claim of jury prejudice is composed entirely of speculation and surmise.see pérez gonzález,at denying change of venue where record contained no hard evidence of jury prejudice.in idiosyncratic situations like this one,it is the trial judge informed discretion,not the view from a more remote appellate perch,that must control.united states lopez lopez,cir noting the trial judge familiarity with the nuances of the case nuances which may not survive transplantation into a cold appellate record.
we add a coda.any concerns about an artificial inflation of amy credibility due to either her position at the courthouse or her relationship with chief judge fusté easily could have been addressed by cautionary instructions.yet,the appellant never requested any such instructions.given this omission,his conclusory complaint that the government had an unfair advantage rings hollow.greer miller,d concluding that failure by defense counsel to request curative instruction may suggest that no error occurred.
this leaves only the appellant claim that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to transfer the case,pursuant to rule b,in the interest of justice.we note,however,that the appellant has not alleged that a change of venue would have convenienced the parties,the victims,or any of the witnesses.rule b links the two requirements convenience and the interest of justice and when a rule lists two requirements in the conjunctive,both must be satisfied.see,united states luna,cir.
there is no point in beating a dead horse.the facts of this case plainly indicate that puerto rico,where the victims and several key witnesses resided,was a reasonably convenient forum for all concerned.to cinch matters,a fair trial was possible in puerto rico,and the jury careful picking and choosing among the counts charged is a strong indication that the appellant received one.on this record,the interest of justice did not demand a transfer.consequently,the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to move the trial out of puerto rico.
interstate stalking.
we turn next to the appellant plaint that the record does not support his interstate stalking conviction and that,therefore,the district court should have granted his motion for a judgment of acquittal on this count.see.we review the denial of a rule motion de novo.united states dwinells,cir.in determining whether particular evidence is sufficient to ground a conviction,we take the facts and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most agreeable to the jury verdict.united states,cir.if,on that view,the prosecution has adduced sufficient evidence of the essential elements of the crime such that a rational jury could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,the insufficiency challenge fails.id.
to prove interstate stalking,the government must show that the accused traveled in interstate or foreign commerce with the intent to kill,injure,or harass another person and that in the course of,or as a result of,such travel,the accused placed his target in reasonable apprehension of harm to herself or a family member.the appellant theorizes that the statute applies only when some injuring or harassing act takes place during or after the interstate travel.if this is so,he can not be guilty of the charged crime because he was detained as soon as he landed in puerto rico and the government offered no proof that he did anything amiss during the course of his travel.
this is quintessentially a statutory argument,and statutory construction must begin with the words of the statute itself.united states charles george trucking,cir.here,the language of the relevant statute contradicts the appellant theory.
the interstate stalking statute proscribes interstate travel with malicious intent when in the course of,or as a result of,that travel,the defendant places his intended victim in reasonable apprehension of harm.by employing the disjunctive in the course of,or as a result of,congress criminalized two types of acts.reiter sonotone,d discussing effect of legislature use of disjunctive.the first type encompasses acts occurring in the course of the specified travel that place the target in fear of harm.the second type occurs when the interstate travel itself,viewed in the historical perspective of previous events,results in placing the target in reasonable fear of harm.the appellant proposed construction would read this second class of prohibited conduct out of the statute,and adopting it would render nugatory the as a result of language.this,in turn,would flout the venerable principle that a ll words and provisions of statutes should be given effect.united states ven fuel,cir.constructions that would render statutory words or phrases meaningless,redundant or superfluous should be avoided.id.at.
the language of the interstate stalking statute is clear and unambiguous.taken at face value,it leads to a sensible result.the statute should,therefore,be read as written.see cahoon shelton,cir.
common sense supports this reading of the statute.after all,when a defendant has repeatedly threatened to harm his victims and then travels across state lines intending to inflict that harm,it would strain credulity to think that congress meant to hold the defendant harmless until he took some further step to carry out his threat.giving the statute its plain meaning,we hold that one way a defendant can engage in interstate stalking is by traveling across state lines with the intent to harm or harass another and,as a result of that travel,placing the target of his malevolence in reasonable fear of harm 
once we have settled upon the proper construction of section,the conclusion is inescapable that the evidence suffices to support the interstate stalking conviction.the appellant obviously engaged in interstate travel when he journeyed from michigan to puerto rico moreover,the record reveals a number of that can reasonably be regarded as threats against amy and.that the putative victims had a reasonable basis for apprehension is manifest.
this leaves only the matter of the appellant intent and,given the full panoply of circumstances that preceded his flight,a rational jury reasonably could conclude as this jury did that the appellant traveled to puerto rico with the intent to harm or harass his wife and son.the motion for a judgment of acquittal was,therefore,appropriately denied.
mailing a threatening letter.
similarly,the appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence undergirding his conviction for mailing a threatening letter.because the appellant raised this claim in his rule motion for a judgment of acquittal,it engenders de novo review.dwinells,at.
the statute of conviction makes it a crime for a person to mail a communication addressed to any other person and containing any threat to injure the person of the addressee or of another.c.the jury found the appellant guilty of this crime with respect to the letter that he sent to tony walker described earlier.in the appellant view,this epistle could not have triggered the statute because it did not contain threatening language and,in all events,was not mailed to the person allegedly threatened namely,amy.the district court rejected these arguments and so do we.
whether a writing can fairly be construed as a threat depends on the totality of the circumstances.see united states whiffen,cir.the question is one of fact.see united states fulmer,cir.in deciding whether a particular letter contains a threat,a factfinder must take the words in a context and determine whether the author reasonably should have foreseen that his message would be perceived by the addressee as a threat.see united states freeman,cir.applying these principles,we believe that the jury reasonably could have concluded that the letter in question contained a threat against amy.
we go directly to the text of the letter,which is rife with references to killing amy.for example,one paragraph suggests that the appellant,then incarcerated,was talking with a fellow inmate about murdering amy.scrutinizing this passage in light of the acrimonious marital history,we can not the jury determination that the appellant should have foreseen that his comments would be perceived by the recipient of the letter as a threat against amy 
the appellant first fallback position is that the letter threatened one person amy but was sent to someone else tony.those facts are accurate,but the conclusion that the appellant draws from them is not.
the test under section c is not whether a communication contains a threat to the addressee.rather,the statute criminalizes the mailing of a letter that contains a threat either to the person of the addressee or of another.c.as we already have explained,the jury was entitled to conclude that the letter in question contained a threat to injure amy.no more is exigible to prove that element of the offense see,united states poe,cir upholding conviction where threat was to harm addressee daughter united states malik,cir upholding conviction where letter sent to trial judge threatened the author litigation adversaries.
the appellant has a further fallback position.he argues that the letter is protected by the first amendment.this argument is hopeless.the law is crystal clear that threats are not constitutionally protected speech.see city of paul,d.the appellant citation to watts united states,d per curiam,does not reconfigure the decisional calculus.the instant letter contains none of the politically charged and hyperbolic rhetoric found protected there.
to say more on this point would be to paint the lily.the district court did not err in denying the appellant rule motion with respect to the threatening letter count.
challenges to the indictment.
the appellant claims for the first time on appeal that the form of the indictment reveals two fatal defects.first,he asserts that the interstate stalking count,which listed both amy and as intended victims,is duplicitous.second,he asserts that cyberstalking should have been charged as a single offense and that separating it into various counts offended the rule against multiplicity.these challenges come too late in the day.
under the criminal rules,a defendant must challenge a perceived defect in an indictment before the commencement of trial.b b.a failure to mount such a challenge within the prescribed time frame constitutes a waiver.e.this is not a judicial gloss rule e itself uses that precise terminology.
to be sure,this is not a typical waiver.waiver normally involves the intentional relinquishment of a known right.see,united states carrasco de jesús,cir.forfeiture is the term that is normally used to describe an unexplained failure to make a timely assertion of a right.see,united states olano,d.this distinction can be important.waived objections can not be reviewed on appeal save for the rare case in which a reviewing court,as a matter solely of its discretion,forgives the waiver,whereas forfeited objections are reviewable for plain error.see id.at.united states rodriguez,cir.
it is an open question in this circuit whether the words waiver and waives,as used in rule e,should be taken literally.see united states lugo guerrero,cir several other courts of appeals have pondered this question.the majority view is that a party failure to raise rule b defenses prior to trial such as a challenge to the form of an indictment constitutes a waiver in the classic sense and,thus,precludes appellate review of the defaulted challenge.see,united states burke,cir united states dupree,cir united states acox,cir united states brooks,cir united states brown,cir.a few circuits,however,have treated such defaults as forfeitures and engaged in plain error review.see united states robinson,cir united states mahdi,see also united states baker,cir deeming default a waiver but nevertheless applying plain error review.
we believe that rule e says what it means and means what it says.great weight must be given to the plain language of the rule,particularly since congress amended it in after the supreme court had made the distinction between waiver and forfeiture pellucid and left the waiver terminology intact.see.advisory committee notes see also olano,at.explaining distinction.what is more,the matters that fall within the compass of rule b and thus rule e are normally correctable before trial if seasonably brought to the attention of the district court and the government.it strikes us as manifestly unfair for a defendant to sit silently by,take his chances with the jury,and then be allowed to ambush the prosecution through a attack.accordingly,we join the majority view and hold that a failure to challenge a defect in an indictment before trial,as required by rule b,results in an unreviewable waiver of that challenge pursuant to rule e.because the appellant did not raise either duplicity or multiplicity challenges at any time prior to trial,he has waived those challenges.
this framework does not risk a miscarriage of justice due to the presence of a key exception if a defendant can show good cause for a failure to raise a rule b challenge prior to trial,that challenge may be entertained by the district court and reviewed on appeal.see.e see also acox,at.here,however,the appellant did not make a good cause argument in the district court at any time,and he has not made a cognizable showing of good cause in this court.given these circumstances,there is no unfairness in holding him to his waiver.
evidentiary rulings.
the appellant contends that the district court erred in admitting certain evidence.where objections have been preserved,we review a district court evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.see united states rodríguez vélez,cir.
prior bad acts.the appellant assigns error to the admission of testimony about incidents that occurred before the events at issue here.on those earlier occasions,he had either threatened family members or behaved violently.
it is common ground that evidence of prior bad acts may not be introduced to prove subsequent action in conformity therewith.b.nevertheless,evidence of prior bad acts may be admissible if it has special relevance that is,if it tends to prove a material fact apart from a mere propensity to behave in a certain way as long as its probative value is not substantially outweighed by any unfairly prejudicial effect.see united states rodríguez berríos,cir.
here,evidence that the appellant estranged wife and son had witnessed him uttering threats and engaging in violence was specially relevant to show the reasonableness of their apprehension of harm when the appellant,after making a series of menacing statements,departed abruptly for puerto rico.the reasonable apprehension of harm is an element of the interstate stalking offense.see.where,as here,evidence is probative of an element of a charged crime,rule b does not automatically preclude its admission.see united states alzanki,cir.
the district court found that this evidence was admissible.pertinently,it found the evidence to be more probative than prejudicial.the balance of probative value and unfairly prejudicial effect is,within wide limits,one for the trial court to strike.see united states smith,cir only rarely and in extraordinarily compelling circumstances will we,from the vista of a cold appellate record,reverse a district court judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.quoting freeman package mach,cir.seen in this light,the court below did not abuse its discretion in permitting the introduction of the prior bad acts evidence.
lay opinions.the appellant accuses the district court of improperly allowing lay witnesses to offer opinion testimony.the general rule is that a lay opinion,not based upon any scientific or specialized knowledge,is properly admitted when it is rationally premised on the witness perception and promotes a better understanding of either the witness testimony or some material fact.see.
against this backdrop,we turn to the appellant specific claims.first,he suggests that tony walker should not have been permitted to describe his reaction to the letter that he received.this suggestion is baseless a recipient reaction to a communication addressed to him is helpful to the jury determination of whether a threat has been lodged.fulmer,at.
the appellant next complaint,voiced for the first time on appeal,posits that neither the private investigator nor the online counselor consulted by the appellant should have been allowed to opine about his state of mind during their internet exchanges.had there been contemporaneous objections below,this argument might present a close question.after all,the jurors were presented with the contents of the online conversations and were in as good a position as the witnesses to gauge what those communications portended for the appellant state of mind.see united states sanabria,cir holding that lay opinion testimony is not admissible when the jury can readily draw the necessary inferences and conclusions without the aid of the opinion.
but there is a rub.the appellant never interposed contemporaneous objections to this belatedly challenged testimony.this boosts the standard of review to plain error.see united states sánchez berríos,cir.
to establish plain error,the appellant must show that an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected the appellant substantial rights,but also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states duarte,cir.the appellant can not surmount this daunting obstacle even if the admission of the testimony was error a question that we do not reach the error was not plain.
to show plain error,the appellant would have to satisfy all four elements of the relevant test.see id.it is readily apparent that the third element is lacking here.in the grand scheme of things,the challenged testimony constituted a tiny part of the government case.moreover,it is wildly implausible that the jury would have reached a different conclusion about the appellant intent in the absence of this testimony.any error in admitting the testimony could not,therefore,satisfy the third prong of the plain error standard.see,united states richardson,cir.
the appellant also protests the admission of what he characterizes as amy opinion testimony regarding her interpretation of various actions taken by him.this protest falls flat.placing a victim in reasonable apprehension of harm is an element of interstate stalking.the victim is in a unique position to evaluate the effect of a threat.see fulmer,at a victim reactions and actions taken in response to an alleged threat are relevant to the determination of whether a statement is a true threat.while the victim subjective view is not controlling,it is assuredly relevant.thus,the district court did not abuse its discretion in permitting amy to explain why certain of the appellant words and deeds frightened her.
there is one loose end.the appellant argues that an fbi agent should not have been permitted to opine that a bag found in the appellant house,which contained among other things a knife,rubber gloves,and duct tape,was a murder kit.this was not a lay opinion at all the agent had years of experience and was trained in forensics.see united states hoffman,cir holding that dea agent experience in combating drug trafficking qualified him to opine on the meaning of a coded telephone conversation between suspected dealers.
we need not belabor the point.the only objection made to this testimony below was on relevancy grounds,and the testimony was unarguably relevant.see.the appellant present argument is thus forfeited,and there was no plain error.relatedly,we reject the appellant contention that no foundation was laid for the admission of the murder kit evidence.amy testified that she found the bag in the michigan house that the appellant had been inhabiting and that it was in the same room as the appellant other possessions.although other people had lived in the house,amy testimony was sufficient to support a finding that the bag belonged to the appellant.see.a.
hearsay.moving to a different series of rulings,the appellant argues that the lower court improperly admitted hearsay evidence.hearsay is commonly defined as a statement,other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing,offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.c.it follows from this definition that a witness account of an statement,not offered to prove the truth of that statement,is not inadmissible hearsay.see kassel gannett,cir.this axiom defeats much of the appellant hearsay argument only a handful of specific hearsay objections survives.
the appellant assails amy testimony that he had threatened to kill and then himself.however,this testimony was not hearsay amy gave it in response to a question that asked for her personal knowledge.hearsay requires an statement.c.the only statement referenced in amy challenged testimony was the appellant own alleged threat,which can not be inadmissible hearsay.see.d.
the appellant complaint about the admission of various orders entered by puerto rico courts turns on a procedural default.the appellant lodged no objection below to the admission of these documents,and we see no plain error.
nor did the district court commit plain error when it admitted,without objection,an from amy sister recounting the substance of her telephone conversation with the appellant.the sister testified at the trial that the appellant,in the course of this conversation,had threatened to kill amy and because the was cumulative of this properly admitted testimony,its introduction did not amount to plain error.see united states bailey,cir.
the appellant last hearsay contention relates to the admission of testimony,over objection,to the effect that police officers and a social worker in michigan told him that they were removing him from the appellant care because the appellant had threatened to blow head off.had no knowledge of the threat,so the testimony appears to be a classic example of inadmissible hearsay.
the government insists that this testimony was not offered for the truth of the matter asserted but,rather,to explain how amy regained custody of.this characterization seems inadequate because the government proffer was not limited in that way.moreover,the alleged statement went to the heart of the interstate stalking charge,and the context exception can not be stretched to that extent.see united states martin,cir.
here,however,the appellant wins the battle but loses the war.although the trial court erred in admitting this piece of evidence,its error is not of constitutional magnitude.thus,reversal is not required as long as it can be said with fair assurance,after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole,that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.kotteakos united states.see.a.harmless error review takes into account,among other things,the centrality of the tainted material,its uniqueness,its prejudicial impact,the uses to which it was put during the trial,the relative strengths of the parties cases,and any telltales that furnish clues to the likelihood that the error affected the factfinder resolution of a material issue.united states sepulveda,cir.
in this instance,the threat related by was only one of several threats allegedly made by the appellant and described to the jury.perhaps more important,the jury learned of the very threat mentioned by during amy testimony.accordingly,we conclude without serious question that the error in admitting the disputed portion of testimony did not affect the appellant substantial rights.it was,therefore,harmless.
sentencing.
the district court grouped the six counts of conviction and sentenced the appellant to serve a month term of immurement.the appellant challenges his sentence on a plethora of grounds.
when confronted with claims of sentencing error,we engage in a pavane.first,we inquire whether the district court committed any procedural bevues,including any errors in constructing the guideline sentencing range gsr.see united states martin,cir.in performing this task,we review the court interpretation and application of the sentencing guidelines de novo and assay any subsidiary findings of fact for clear error.united states parrilla román,cir.at the second stage of the analysis,we consider the reasonableness of the sentence.martin,at.review is for abuse of discretion.united states anonymous defendant,cir see gall united states,d.
enhancements.the appellant begins with a challenge to the procedural reasonableness of the sentence.the various facets of this challenge consist primarily of attacks on upward adjustments made by the sentencing court in the course of constructing the gsr.
we approach these claims of error mindful both that the government has the burden of proving sentencing enhancements by a preponderance of the evidence,see united states aymelek,cir,and that we must honor the sentencing court findings of fact unless those findings are clearly erroneous,see united states villar,cir.we are mindful,too,that the usual rules of evidence do not pertain at sentencing.rather,the district court may base sentencing determinations on any evidence that it reasonably finds to be reliable.see united states cintrón echautegui,cir.
initially,the appellant argues that the sentencing court erred in finding that the crimes of conviction involved the threatened use of a dangerous weapon a finding that triggered a upward adjustment,see ussg b c.this argument trenches on the frivolous the record contains ample evidence to support a determination that the appellant placed both amy and in fear of harm through,in part,threats to use a gun.a prototypical example is the appellant vow,previously described,to blow head off.
the appellant next claim relates to the sentencing court finding that one of his crimes involved a vulnerable victim a finding that triggered a upward adjustment,see id.b.for this enhancement to apply,the victim must have an impaired capacity to detect or prevent the crime,and the defendant must be aware,actually or constructively,of that impairment.united states stella,cir.
in this regard,the sentencing court found that was a victim of the interstate stalking offense,and this finding is not clearly erroneous.the court corollary finding that the appellant should have known that his son was virtually powerless to fend off or prevent the stalking is equally beyond reproof.minors are often regarded as especially vulnerable victims,see,united states molina,cir,and the nature and circumstances of this interstate stalking offense made such a finding appropriate.see generally ussg,comment.explaining that victim can be vulnerable due to,among other things,age or mental condition.the impaired capacity of a young boy caught in the toils of his parents deteriorating marriage is readily evident.
the sentencing court use of a enhancement under ussg was likewise supportable.there is evidence in the record that the appellant used a minor in the commission of the cyberstalking crimes.testified that the appellant had forced him to write an to amy in an effort to convince her that a particular account belonged to him.the appellant then used that same account to send threatening to amy while masquerading as on this basis,the enhancement for using a minor in connection with the commission of a crime was fully warranted.
departures.having made these and other unchallenged determinations,the sentencing court tentatively assigned the appellant an adjusted offense level of.the combination of this offense level and a criminal history category chc of i normally would produce a gsr of to months.here,however,the court essayed two upward departures and measured their extent by making corresponding changes to the sentencing grid.
specifically,the court departed upward by two levels for the unusual seriousness of the interstate stalking crime.see id,comment.it simultaneously increased the chc from i to iv to represent more accurately the appellant criminal past.see id.a.these departures elevated the gsr to to months,and the court sentenced the appellant at the top of this reconstructed range.the appellant contests both departures.
we review the factual findings on which a departure rests for clear error.united states pacheco,cir.the ultimate departure decision engenders review.united states roselli,cir.in determining that the interstate stalking offense was so serious as to take it out of the heartland,the sentencing court gave weight to the number and horrific nature of the appellant threats,the length of time over which the threats were made,and the meticulousness of the appellant plotting.even though an upward adjustment already had been made for the appellant pattern of behavior,see ussg b d,the atypical extent of this pattern and the aggravating factors allowed the sentencing court to make an upward departure.see id,comment.explaining that an upward departure may be warranted if the defendant stalked the victim on many occasions over a prolonged period of time see also united states ruggles,wl,at cir,affirming upward departure in analogous circumstances.
by like token,the sentencing court determination that the appellant chc underrepresented his criminal past was within the encincture of its discretion.see ussg a.in formulating this departure,the court appropriately considered i the appellant criminal contempt conviction,which resulted in a sentence of more than sixty days imprisonment and which was unrelated to the pattern of stalking for which he was being sentenced,see id.b ii the mailing of the threatening letter while imprisoned,see id.d and iii the fact that the appellant engaged in stalking while on pretrial release for a separate violent crime in michigan,see id,comment.a iv 
substantive reasonableness.the appellant final sentencing challenge implicates the substantive reasonableness of his sentence.this challenge fails.the appellant committed a litany of serious crimes,and the aggravating factors are many and varied.the sentencing court considered the totality of the circumstances,weighed all of the relevant factors,see a,and imposed a sentence within albeit at the apex of the reconstructed gsr.
there is no single reasonable sentence in any particular case but,rather,a universe of reasonable outcomes.as long as the sentence imposed is procedurally sound and falls somewhere within this range of reasonableness,we will uphold it.see united states dixon,cir.
in the case at hand,the able district judge gave a plausible rationale for t
