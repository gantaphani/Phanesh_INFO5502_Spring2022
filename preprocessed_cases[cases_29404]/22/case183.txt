plaintiff verisign,is in the business of selling internet domain names and operates the popular.com and.net domains.in,a competitor arrived on the scene defendant,llc xyz launched.xyz,a new domain,and began registering domain names ending in.xyz.as part of its marketing push,xyz,along with its ceo daniel negari,made a series of statements touting the popularity of the.xyz domain and warning of a scarcity of desirable.com domain names.verisign sued xyz and negari,alleging that those statements violated the lanham act false advertising provisions.
the district court granted summary judgment to xyz,holding that verisign could not establish the elements of a lanham act claim.we agree.as to xyz statements,most of which concern its registration numbers,we hold that verisign failed to produce the required evidence that it suffered an actual injury as a direct result of xyz conduct.nor can verisign establish,we hold,that xyz statements about the availability of suitable.com domain names were false or misleading statements of fact,as required for lanham act liability.accordingly,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment.
we begin with a brief overview of the domain name industry.a domain name is the string of characters in an internet address.in the domain name,for instance,the.gov element of the name is referred to as a domain.verisign is the exclusive operator of both the.com and.net domains.it operates the.com registry,selling domain names to registrars who in turn sell those names to end users.over million.com domain names have been registered.among these million registered domain names are percent of all dictionary words from to.
the worldwide domain name system is overseen by the nonprofit internet corporation for assigned names and numbers icann.in the early,icann began to consider the introduction of new domains,in order to enhance competition and consumer choice.in,icann began to accept applications for new domains,and by july it had approved nearly of applications.xyz,founded by negari,was among the hundreds of applicants granted the right to operate a new domain.xyz launched.xyz in.
at the heart of this case are certain promotional efforts undertaken by xyz to market its new.xyz domain.according to verisign,a number of xyz activities crossed the line into false or misleading advertising,violating the lanham act and injuring verisign own business operations.the statements of which verisign complains can be divided into two rough categories,which we describe in turn.
first is a series of affirmative statements about.xyz,promoting.xyz popularity and touting its high registration numbers.for instance,negari wrote a post on xyz blog titled.xyz,the most used new gtld generic domain boooooooom stating that.xyz has received the most registrations of all new gtlds with domains registered.an xyz employee later told a reseller that xyz had over registrations.and xyz also promoted its registration numbers in emails to individual registrars.
by august,xyz had secured over one million.xyz registrations.verisign does not contest that figure,nor the literal truth of the registration numbers advanced by xyz.indeed,it is not disputed that those numbers match statistics maintained in the zone file,a database tracking domain names registered in domain extensions.rather,the crux of verisign claim is that xyz registration numbers are false or misleading because they include not only registrations bought and paid for by consumers indicating actual consumer demand but also.xyz registrations given away for free just after xyz launch,through an agreement between xyz and by including those registrations in its numbers,verisign contends,xyz misrepresented actual consumer demand for its product.
negari also promoted the popularity of the.xyz domain in media interviews.during one such interview,negari,along with other domain operators,spoke with national public radio npr as part of a story on the expansion of the domain market.introducing negari,the npr reporter said,you could try to become the next.com,the next,ending,the thing that you can stick on the back of any business name.emphasis added.the statement of which verisign complains appeared after the interview,on the xyz corporate blog in a post titled.xyz the next.com,xyz promotes negari npr interview and states that npr reporter described.xyz as the next.com,id.emphasis added diverging,verisign argues,from the actual formulation you could try to become the next.com used by npr.the post ends with a link to the full npr interview.id.
in addition to promoting the xyz domain with false statements,verisign alleges,xyz falsely disparaged verisign competing.com domain.here,verisign points to a series of statements by xyz and negari calling into question the availability of suitable.com domain names.first,during his interview with npr,negari,referring to the.com domain,said,all of the good real estate is taken.the only thing that left is something with a dash or maybe three dashes and a couple numbers in it.a few months later,a negari blog post on xyz website included this line did you know that of all registrar searches today result in a domain taken page.negari echoed that claim in a subsequent radio interview,saying that nine out of ten.com searches show up as unavailable.finally,xyz posted a advertisement to website youtube,comparing a new audi with a.xyz license plate to a dilapidated honda with a.com plate,and saying,with over million.coms registered today,it impossible to find the domain name that you want.all of those statements,verisign claims,are false or misleading.
in december,verisign filed suit against xyz and negari,claiming that its new competitor had violated the lanham act false advertising provisions.a b.as is customary in lanham act suits,verisign undertook a consumer survey to support its claims.verisign survey tested consumer reaction to xyz statements about its registration numbers and,according to verisign,demonstrated that consumers understood xyz references to registrations to signify actual consumer purchases,rather than.xyz registrations given away for free.
after extensive discovery,xyz moved for summary judgment,and the district court granted its motion.in an accompanying opinion,the court comprehensively rejected verisign claim,finding that verisign failed to establish a violation of the lanham act on multiple grounds,any one of which would have been sufficient justification for an award of summary judgment to xyz.
first,on the threshold question of falsity,the district court held that verisign could not show that any of the statements complained of was false or misleading.as to xyz promotion of its registration numbers,the court found,those numbers were verifiably true,based on accurate statistics from the zone file,and nothing in the record supports the notion that xyz statements were false.the court also concluded that xyz promotion of negari npr interview including the next.com statement was not false.
similarly,the district court held,verisign could not establish that xyz statements regarding.com availability were false or misleading.statements like all of the good real estate is taken and it impossible to find the domain name that you want,the district court explained,reflect subjective opinion or puffery,neither of which is actionable under the lanham act.and while negari assertion that percent of registrar searches result in a domain taken message is a verifiable statement of fact,the district court concluded,verisign had not shown that statement to be false on the contrary,verisign own data demonstrated that.com names are largely unavailable.
because verisign had fail ed to meet the first element of a lanham act claim,a false or misleading statement the district court could have awarded summary judgment without further analysis.instead,it went on to identify other,independent defects in verisign case.under the lanham act,even a false statement is not actionable unless it is material,or likely to influence a consumer decision.here,the district court held,verisign had presented no evidence to show that consumers were influenced by the statements in question,having chosen not to test materiality in its consumer survey.nor,the district court held,could verisign show that any of xyz statements actually deceived consumers,as required under the lanham act,pointing again to shortcomings in verisign survey evidence.
finally,and providing yet another independent justification for its decision,the district court held that verisign had failed to establish the requisite causal connection between the allegedly false statements and any damages actually suffered by verisign.verisign first theory of damages that xyz false advertising had diverted sales from verisign domains to.xyz rested on the analysis of expert lauren kindler.but the district court excluded that testimony on the ground that kindler methods and conclusions were unreliable,primarily because kindler relied on data point ing only to correlation,not causation.as to verisign second theory of damages that xyz statements disparaging the.com domain had lessened the goodwill associated with verisign product the court concluded that verisign had failed to produce any evidence of lessened goodwill apart from its own subjective belief that its reputation had been harmed.
verisign timely noted this appeal.
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to verisign,the nonmoving party,and drawing all reasonable inferences in verisign favor.design,leather indus.of,cir.to show that summary judgment should not be awarded,verisign must provide more than a scintilla of evidence and not merely conclusory allegations or speculation upon which a jury could properly find in its favor.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.we review the district court evidentiary ruling regarding verisign expert testimony for abuse of discretion.meyers lamer,cir.
the lanham act prohibits the false or misleading description of fact,or false or misleading representation of fact,which in commercial advertising or promotion,misrepresents the nature,characteristics,qualities,or geographic origin of his or her or another person goods,services,or commercial activities.a.accordingly,a plaintiff asserting a false advertising claim must establish each of five elements,showing that 
the defendant made a false or misleading description of fact or representation of fact in a commercial advertisement about his own or another product the misrepresentation is material,in that it is likely to influence the purchasing decision the misrepresentation actually deceives or has the tendency to deceive a substantial segment of its audience the defendant placed the false or misleading statement in interstate commerce and the plaintiff has been or is likely to be injured as a result of the misrepresentation,either by direct diversion of sales or by a lessening of goodwill associated with its products.
design resources,at quoting pbm,llc mead johnson,cir.f ailure to establish any one of these five elements is fatal to a plaintiff claim.id.and importantly,verisign must be able to point to at least one challenged statement that satisfies all five lanham act requirements as the parties agree,a lanham act claimant may not mix and match statements,with some satisfying one lanham act element and some satisfying others.see johnson johnson vision care,contacts,cir.rejecting argument that challenged statements should be evaluated in concert to determine whether any or all violated lanham act.
here,we agree with the district court that verisign failed to present evidence sufficient to show that any of xyz challenged statements violated the lanham act.we address in turn the two categories of statements at issue statements about.xyz registration numbers and popularity,and disparaging statements about the availability of verisign.com domain names.
the crux of verisign claim is that xyz used deceptive statements about its registration numbers and popularity to manufacture an unwarranted gold rush for.xyz domains.by touting registration numbers that included free registrations and claiming that npr had dubbed it the next.com,verisign argues,xyz created a false picture of consumer demand that was intended to drive up.xyz sales to registrars and website owners.xyz,for its part,insists that its registration numbers were true that it had no obligation to separate out registrations arising from a legitimate commercial promotion and that as the district court found,verisign consumer survey evidence failed to establish that consumers were misled by xyz numbers.the blog post stating that it had been deemed the next.com by npr,xyz argues,is either true when viewed in context of the npr story or harmless exaggeration,as puffery.
as described above,the district court sided thoroughly with xyz,holding that xyz statements were not false as a matter of law and that verisign also had failed to establish materiality and deception,two additional and independent elements of a lanham act claim.without casting any doubt on those holdings by the district court,we find that we need not review them here.we agree with the district court that verisign failed to establish yet another lanham act element that it suffered an injury flowing directly from the challenged statements and affirm the grant of summary judgment to xyz on that ground alone.
to recover damages under the lanham act,versign must show not only false advertising by xyz,but also that xyz statements caused verisign actual damages.see pbm products,at summary judgment properly awarded to defendant in lanham act case because plaintiff could not prove that allegedly false statements caused any damages xoom,imageline,cir.lanham act plaintiff must prove actual damages and a causal link between those damages and the lanham act violation,abrogated on other grounds by reed elsevier,muchnick.this is not a minor or technical element of a lanham act claim indeed,as the supreme court has explained,it is the core requirement that a plaintiff show economic or reputational injury flowing directly from the deception wrought by the defendant advertising that assures article iii standing in lanham act cases.lexmark int l,static control components.accordingly,we have made clear that the indispensable fifth element of a lanham act claim is that the plaintiff has been or is likely to be injured as a result of the alleged misrepresentation,either by direct diversion of sales or by a lessening of goodwill associated with its product.design resources,at quoting pbm products,at.
with respect to xyz statements,verisign proceeded under the first of these damages theories,claiming that xyz fake gold rush directly diverted sales from verisign.net registry to xyz new.xyz domain for support,verisign rested on its expert,lauren kindler,who indeed opined that xyz statements sapped verisign profits by redirecting registrations away from verisign.net registry.relying on verisign claim that xyz false statements were the reason consumers signed up for.xyz domains,kindler also suggested that verisign was entitled to disgorgement of xyz profits.
exercising its gatekeeping function under daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,the district court excluded kindler report,leaving verisign with nothing to show injury in the form of diversion of sales.acting as gatekeepers,district courts are charged with ensuring that expert testimony of all kinds is relevant and reliable.see cooper smith nephew,cir.citing daubert see also kumho tire,carmichael,district court basic gatekeeping obligation applies to all expert testimony.here,citing daubert,the district court concluded that kindler methods are questionable and that her conclusions are not reliable,primarily because kindler analysis failed to distinguish between correlation and causation.we agree with the district court.
kindler concluded that verisign lost approximately in profits as a result of.xyz registrations diverted from.net.to arrive at that figure,she began by identifying a decline in registrations on the.net domain between june and may the time period during which xyz made the allegedly false statements at issue.she then attributed to xyz a percentage of those lost registrations,based on.xyz market share
