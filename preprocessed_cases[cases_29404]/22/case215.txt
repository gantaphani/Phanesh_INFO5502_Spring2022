countless commercial messages,known colloquially as spam,pass through the internet every day,inspiring frustration,countermeasures.based upon eleven commercial messages,mummagraphics,a provider of online services,seeks significant statutory damages from omega world travel,a travel agency omega gloria bohan,omega president and founder and,a wholly owned subsidiary of omega collectively,appellees.mummagraphics alleges that sent the messages in violation of the controlling the assault of pornography and marketing act of act,et,as well as oklahoma law.
the district court awarded summary judgment to the appellees on all of mummagraphics claims and we affirm.the act preempts mummagraphics claims under oklahoma statutes.in addition,mummagraphics failed to allege the material inaccuracies or pattern of failures to conform to requirements that is necessary to establish liability under the act.the act addresses spam as a serious and pervasive problem,but it does not impose liability at the mere drop of a hat.
appellant mummagraphics,webguy internet solutions,is an oklahoma corporation with its only place of business in oklahoma city.according to mark mumma,the company president,mummagraphics hosts web pages,registers domain names,designs web pages and logos,and sets up computer servers.mummagraphics also operates websites devoted to opposing spam messages including.in addition,mummagraphics runs a website,that lists internet domain seventy of of which are operated by owners have indicated that they do not wish to receive unsolicited commercial messages.mummagraphics owns the domain name and uses the account for company purposes.
operates a website selling cruise vacations and sends to prospective customers.it sent eleven containing travel offers to between december,and february.each message contained a line of text on which the recipient could click in order to be removed from future mailings,and each message also said that the recipient could of future by writing to a postal address contained in each message.each message also contained a link to the website and a tollfree phone number for the company.
mummagraphics claims that the messages contained several inaccuracies.first,each message stated that the recipient had signed up for the mailing list,but mummagraphics alleges that it had not asked that receive the company offers.second,while each message listed as the sending organization,each also included the address.net in its header information,even though mummagraphics alleges that.net is not an internet domain name linked to or the other appellees.in addition,the messages contained the from address cruisedeals cruise.com,even though had apparently stopped using that address.
when mark mumma noticed the that had received,he did not use the electronic link to remove the address from the list,but instead called john lawless,omega world travel general counsel,to complain.mumma told lawless that he had not asked to receive the messages.he told lawless that he refused to use mechanisms because only idiots do that,and he believed mechanisms just led to more unwanted messages.mumma told lawless that his preferred removal procedure was to sue for violations of oklahoma law.lawless asked mumma for his address,but mumma did not provide it.instead,he asked lawless to remove from all future mailings every address containing a domain name listed on mummagraphics website.lawless said he was gon na take them down right now,but omega technical support division indicated that removing all the addresses would require considerable effort,and the addresses were not immediately removed.
on january,the day after speaking with lawless,mumma received another message at.he sent a letter dated january,to daniel bohan of omega world travel,saying that he had received six unsolicited messages from,omega subsidiary,but again not specifying the address at which he had received the messages.the letter claimed that the messages violated federal and state laws and said that mumma intended to sue bohan company for at least in statutory damages unless bohan settled the matter for.mumma attached the to his letter,and after john lawless noticed that the messages appeared to have been sent to he directed that the address be removed from the mailing list.the company subsequently removed the address.
after omega world travel failed to pay mumma,postings on one of mumma websites accused omega,and daniel and gloria bohan of being spammers who had violated state and federal laws.the website posted a photo of the bohans that had evidently been copied from the omega website and described the couple as spammers.on the basis of these postings,omega world travel,the bohans,and sued mumma and mummagraphics in federal court,claiming defamation,copyright infringement,trademark infringement,and unauthorized use of likeness.the district court granted mummagraphics summary judgment on all these claims except the libel action,on which all the plaintiffs except daniel bohan,who is no longer a party,expect to proceed to trial.
mummagraphics raised counterclaims against the appellees under oklahoma and federal law,which are the only claims now before this court.mummagraphics alleged,inter alia,that the contained actionable inaccuracies and that the appellees failed to comply with federal and state requirements that they stop sending messages to recipients who opted out through specified procedures.both parties sought summary judgment on mummagraphics counterclaims,and the district court granted the appellees motion.the court held that the act preempted mummagraphics claims under oklahoma statutes.it further held,inter alia,that the appellees had not violated the act because the alleged inaccuracies were not material and the appellees had not violated the provisions.mummagraphics now appeals.
we turn first to the district court determination that the act preempted mummagraphics claims under oklahoma statutes regulating commercial messages.the basic principles of preemption are well settled,and we need not belabor them here.our inquiry into the scope of a preemption clause is shaped by two presumptions.medtronic,lohr,d.first,under our federal system,we do not presume that congress intends to clear whatever field it enters.instead,we start from the basic assumption that congress did not intend to displace state law,maryland louisiana,d,and that the historic police powers of the states were not to be superseded by the federal act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress,medtronic,at.citations omitted.second,from this departure point,we address preemption issues in accordance with the comment that t he purpose of congress is the ultimate touchstone in every preemption case.id.alteration in original citation omitted.instead of imposing the narrowest possible construction on preemptive language when read in isolation,we seek a fair understanding of congressional purpose,looking to the language of the statute and the statutory framework surrounding it,while also considering the structure and purpose of the statute as a whole.id.at.emphasis,citations,and internal quotations omitted.
mummagraphics argues that it is entitled to damages because such damages are authorized by oklahoma law and lie outside the act preemptive scope.the act provides,in part,
this chapter supersedes any statute,regulation,or rule of a state or political subdivision of a state that expressly regulates the use of electronic mail to send commercial messages,except to the extent that any such statute,regulation,or rule prohibits falsity or deception in any portion of a commercial electronic mail message or information attached thereto.
b.the principal oklahoma provision under which mummagraphics seeks damages provides 
it shall be unlawful for a person to initiate an electronic mail message that the sender knows,or has reason to know 
misrepresents any information in identifying the point of origin or the transmission path of the electronic mail message 
does not contain information identifying the point of origin or the transmission path of the electronic mail message or 
contains false,malicious,or misleading information which purposely or negligently injures a person.
oklahoma courts appear not to have construed the state provision,but the language seems to reach beyond common law fraud or deceit.by its terms,the statute is not limited to inaccuracies in transmission information that were material,led to detrimental reliance by the recipient,and were made by a sender who intended that the misstatements be acted upon and either knew them to be inaccurate or was reckless about their truth.rogers meiser,requiring those elements for oklahoma fraud action see also restatement second of torts.
the district court held that the oklahoma statutes were preempted insofar as they applied to immaterial misrepresentations,and that this ruling disposed of mummagraphics oklahoma statutory claims.mummagraphics does not challenge the district court reading of oklahoma law or mummagraphics complaint,but it argues that the district court was incorrect to hold actions for immaterial error to be preempted because the act permits states to prohibit falsity or deception.see b.
whatever the precise scope of the oklahoma provision might be,we can not agree that mummagraphics action for immaterial errors survives preemption.to begin with,the language in the exception to the federal preemption provision upon which mummagraphics relies is hardly as straightforward as the company suggests.the exception,as noted,allows states to prohibit falsity or deception in commercial messages.those terms are not defined in the statute.however,deception requires more than bare error,and while falsity can be defined as merely the character or quality of not conforming to the truth or facts,it also can convey an element of tortiousness or wrongfulness,as in deceitfulness,untrustworthiness,faithlessness.webster third new international dictionary unabridged see also oxford english dictionary vol.v ed defining false as erroneous,wrong,but also as mendacious,deceitful,treacherous,and p urposely untrue see also black law dictionary ed defining false as untrue but also as deceitful lying.
since the word falsity considered in isolation does not unambiguously establish the scope of the preemption clause,we read falsity in light of the clause as a whole.reading falsity as referring to traditionally tortious or wrongful conduct is the interpretation most compatible with the maxim of noscitur a sociis,that a word is generally known by the company that it keeps.see,jarecki searle,d neal clark.the canon applies in the context of disjunctive lists.see neal,at,jarecki,at.here,the clause links falsity with deception one of the several tort actions based upon misrepresentations.keeton et,prosser and keeton on the law of torts,at ed defining deceit as species of tort restatement second of torts describing elements of deceit.this pairing suggests that congress was operating in the vein of tort when it drafted the clause exceptions,and intended falsity to refer to other torts involving misrepresentations,rather than to sweep up errors that do not sound in tort.
other sections of the act do not support a reading of falsity.in the portion of the act that created a civil cause of action,congress affixed the title p rohibition of false or misleading transmission information to a section that prohibits only header information that is materially false or materially misleading.a emphasis added.while the heading of a section can not limit the plain meaning of the text,it can shed light on some ambiguous word or phrase.of trainmen baltimore ohio.see also united states,d.moreover,the normal rule of statutory construction provides that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning.gustafson alloyd,d internal quotations omitted.whether linked with materiality,see a,or deception,see id.b,we can find nowhere in the statute that congress meant to apply falsity in a mere error sense.
there are good reasons for this.congress did not intend falsity to encompass bare error because such a reading would upset the act careful balance between preserving a potentially useful commercial tool and preventing its abuse.the act enacted findings make clear that congress saw commercial messages as presenting both benefits and burdens.congress found that t he convenience and efficiency of electronic mail are threatened by the extremely rapid growth in the volume of unsolicited commercial electronic mail,id.a,but also that low cost and global reach make it extremely convenient and efficient,and offer unique opportunities for the development and growth of frictionless commerce,id.a.congress noted that states had sought to regulate commercial,but it found that the resulting patchwork of liability standards had proven ineffective 
many states have enacted legislation intended to regulate or reduce unsolicited commercial electronic mail,but these statutes impose different standards and requirements.as a result,they do not appear to have been successful in addressing the problems associated with unsolicited commercial electronic mail,in part because,since an electronic mail address does not specify a geographic location,it can be extremely difficult for businesses to know with which of these disparate statutes they are required to comply.
congress implemented these findings by creating a national standard that would be undermined to the point of by mummagraphics interpretation of the preemption clause.rather than banning all commercial or imposing strict liability for insignificant inaccuracies,congress targeted only containing something more than an isolated error.the act made it a crime to materially falsif y header information in multiple commercial electronic mail messages and intentionally initiate the transmission of such messages,but it attached no criminal sanction to errors.a.the act created civil causes of action relating to error,but attached requirements beyond simple mistake to each of them.it permitted lawsuits based upon materially false or materially misleading header information.a emphasis added.the act made it actionable for a person to initiate the transmission to a protected computer of a commercial electronic mail message if such person has actual knowledge,or knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circumstances,that a subject heading of the message would be likely to mislead a recipient,acting reasonably under the circumstances,about a material fact regarding the contents or subject matter of the message id.a emphasis added.in sum,congress enactment governing commercial reflects a calculus that a national strict liability standard for errors would impede unique opportunities for the development and growth of frictionless commerce,while more narrowly tailored causes of action could effectively respond to the obstacles to convenience and efficiency that unsolicited messages present.id.a.
mummagraphics reading of the preemption clause would upend this balance and turn an exception to a preemption provision into a loophole so broad that it would virtually swallow the preemption clause itself.while congress evidently believed that it would be undesirable to make all errors in commercial actionable,mummagraphics interpretation would allow states to bring about something very close to that result.
the ensuing consequences would undermine congress plain intent.as we have noted,congress found that because addresses do not specify recipients physical locations,it can be difficult or impossible to identify where recipients live and hence to determine the state laws that apply.id.a.moreover,commercial are a bulk medium used to target thousands of recipients with a single,meaning that the typical message could well be covered by the laws of many jurisdictions.as a result,senders would likely have to assume that their messages were governed by the most stringent state laws in effect.the strict liability standard imposed by a state such as oklahoma would become a de facto national standard,with all the burdens that imposed,even though the act indicates that congress believed a less demanding standard would best balance the competing interests at stake.because mummagraphics reading of
